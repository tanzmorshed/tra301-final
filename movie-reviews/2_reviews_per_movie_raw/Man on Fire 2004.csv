"bt-wells99-1","9","72","83","4 February 2010"," Underrated and ignored, but a bit of a classic
","Tony Scott can make good films and bad, personally I think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother, but this is quite possibly his best film.<br/><br/>What makes this film so great is that Scott gives Denzel (on scorching form, better than Training Day) and the revelation who is Dakota Fanning time to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness. The set up is absolutely NOT boring, although it takes time - it is involving, and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a superb role for Radha Mitchell as the mother. This all serves to make the action so much more effective, as we are so invested in the characters, for all their all too obvious weaknesses. This film has you on the edge for its entirety, and doesn't cop out at the end either.<br/><br/>The film would of course be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles, when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there (I can only really think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more on-screen power these days). This film should have been huge, given his status and the strength of his performance, and the quality of the film. It just goes to show you that if a studio doesn't back a film to the hilt, it ends up going straight to video. I wish I'd got the chance to see this on the big screen."
"sblenkharn","10","425","523","4 January 2005"," Riveting viewing!
","Certainly one of the finest movies I have seen for quite some time. Exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film. Denzel Washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date, and the rest of the cast perform beautifully. Christopher Walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as I would have liked. A story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love. This is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener. All in all, a truly gripping film from beginning to end. Highly recommended!"
"OttoVonB","9","64","74","10 January 2007"," Denzel VS Mexico City... with unexpected heart
","Alcoholic mercenary Creasy (Washington) is all washed-up, until his friend (Walken) finds him a job in Mexico City, as bodyguard for a rich family's little girl Pita (Fanning). The taciturn man and melancholy girl slowly develop a strong bond... that is utterly shattered the day that Pita is kidnapped and that negotiations are sorely mishandled.<br/><br/>""Man on Fire""'s title works against it. It proclaims an adrenaline-fueled action film, when in fact what we get is very different. What could be mistakenly thought to be a prologue (Creasy is introduced, meets Pita and the relationship is shown) constitutes a good half of the film's running time. Washington and Faning are on top form, the former tortured and angry and the latter endearing without being cloying, so it is a tribute to Scott and screenwriter Helgeland that the film takes its time showing their odd relationship. This makes things all the more hurtful and outraging when she is captured in a kidnapping that leaves Creasy severely scarred, both emotionally and physically.<br/><br/>The film earns its title in the second half, not because of non-stop action - which it fore-goes in order to give us something more pondered and cruel - but because Creasy is literally ablaze with silent fury. As he hunts down anyone who participated or profited from Pita's kidnapping, dismantling rings of Mexico City's tower of corruption, his methods get bloodier while his movement actually get slower. Creasy races against time and his own likely death, as a tragic figure who's newfound reason to live has been taken away from him.<br/><br/>The performances are fine, with great turns from the two leads and superb supporting turns by the always reliable Christopher Walken and Jiancarlo Giannini. What sometime detracts from the film's quality is Tony Scott's now signature messy visuals. While some shots are magnificent, reminiscent of brother Ridley's work, some are almost trashy and epilepsy-inducing (some unnecessary hyper-MTV editing). the man redeems himself by handling his actors with care, superbly illustrating his environment and creating a stark atmosphere.<br/><br/>This is a precious oddity: a quality blockbuster."

","...dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial, brain-dead and pointless. The film is excellent, the acting by both Denzel and Dakota (she will go sky high, trust me on that)are just fabulous, and the plot is mind blowing. Actually ""fabulous"" is a small word to use for such talented actors. The film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional, a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film. If you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films, you still haven't watched your favorite one yet...Trust me, in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling.

"Thrashman88","10","219","281","25 September 2004"," Mexican Officials Should Be Killed
","I loved this movie. I'm a Mexican and was in the least offended by it. In fact, I think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over Mexico. It's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse. It angers me to read in the news how killers, kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy, Denzel Washington's character. A bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante. Kidnapping is flourishing industry down here (at least in the big cities). I actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one's Creasy did his fine job upon. That would be so marvelous (Sorry, I am THAT resentful!). MAN ON FIRE is a gripping film that you can't miss. It might be hard on some of you, if you aren't used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do that ALL the time while watching American movies) but the effort will be well worth it. Some of the editing is a bit fuzzy...kind of like TRAFFIC, remember? (another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico is). The movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half. I swear you'll be cheering as you watch Denzel Washington dispatch the wrong doers. His performance is nothing short of Excellent. The ending (no spoilers, OK!!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the year's best movies. A ""must own"" for a DVD collection! 9* out of 10"
"hitchcockthelegend","9","24","28","27 June 2009"," Righteous retribution and the John Creasy redemption.
","Man on Fire is directed by Tony Scott and adapted to screenplay by Brian Helgeland from the novel of the same name written by A.J. Quinell. It stars Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Marc Anthony, Rachael Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Christopher Walken, Giancarlo Giannini, Mickey Rourke and JesÃºs Ochoa. Music is scored by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Paul Cameron.<br/><br/>Mexico City and kidnappings are rife. Enter ex-military operative John Creasy (Washington). Often drunk and with no discerning aims in life, Creasy is hired by the Ramos family to act as bodyguard to their young daughter Pita (Fanning). After initially being cold and distant, Creasy starts to form a warm relationship with Pita, but tragedy strikes and Pita is kidnapped. This sets the wheels in motion for Creasy to go on a one man war of revenge against anyone involved in the snatch.<br/><br/>Directed with a raft of deliriously ace neo-noir flourishes by Tony Scott, Man on Fire is 145 minutes of fatalism. From the outset it's evident that this sweaty part of Mexico is home to a tortured soul, a man in desperate need of redemption. John Creasy will get this redemption, by hook or by crook, we know this, the narrative structure quickly pulls us in to impress this fact upon us. How he finds it, both emotionally and physically, is what drives the picture on. This is no ordinary tale of revenge, an excuse for pyrotechnics and inventive deaths, it is about one man's journey to said redemption, his trawl through hell, his personal sacrifice is his calling.<br/><br/>The catalyst is the kidnapping of young Pita Ramos, but where it would have been easy for Scott to jump in early and unleash Creasy hell, the director shows great restraint by affording time to the relationship of John and Pita. Most of the first hour is spent building a bond between them, the child softening the edges of the Creasy exterior, to then enter into his heart as he becomes not just a friend, but a surrogate father as well. It's a very real relationship, a natural one, so when things go pear shaped in the second half of the piece, we care what is happening.<br/><br/>Yet constantly that air of fatalism and pessimism hangs heavy as the plot thickens, the unfolding story pulsing with betrayal at almost every turn, classic neo-noir and Scott amps up the disorientation as we enter a hellish world of social decay. His box of tricks contain jump-cuts, film stock, reverse process, over-saturated colours, kinetic camera work, step-printing and slow-mo, all used to create the perfect tonal discord, a marrying up of the anti-hero's state of mind and that of the realm he has entered.<br/><br/>The film can be accused of pandering to stereotyping Latino baddies, especially irksome since the source novel was based in Italy, and that is a misstep that could have been avoided, but Man on Fire remains one of the most important neo-noirs available to view. It refuses to take easy options, particularly with the jet black finale, it has a grasp on what is required for quintessential neo-noir. Backed by stunning work from Washington, Scott and Cameron, it's a film equally of high technical merit as it is of narrative bite. 9/10"

","This is by far one of the better made movies and  didn't leave me disappointed at all. The sound track along with finely  shot hand-held camera work was exquisite . The are always chances a  movie won't hold ones beliefs as well as another, but I felt that  rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent. Dakota Fanning is  rapidly becoming a staple in movie that require a child with an old  soul personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent. As  for Mr. Washington and of course Christopher Walken they both exceed  the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to move  to the light."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","126","171","4 November 2005"," 3 Denzels and 1 Dakota For Your Money
","Here's a gritty, get-the-bad guys revenge story starring a relentless and rough Denzel Washington. He's three personalities here: a down-and-out-low-key-now drunk- former mercenary, then a loving father-type person to a little girl and then a brutal maniac on the loose seeking answers and revenge.<br/><br/>The story is about Washington hired to be a bodyguard for a little American girl living in Mexico, where kidnappings of children occur regularly (at least according to the movie.) He becomes attached to the kid, played winningly by THE child actress of our day, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington goes after the men responsible and spares no one. Beware: this film is not for the squeamish.<br/><br/>This is stylish film-making, which is good and bad. I liked it, but a number of people found it too frenetic for their tastes as the camera-work is one that could give you a headache. I thought it fit the tense storyline and was fascinating to view, but it's (the shaky camera) not for all tastes.<br/><br/>Besides the two stars, there is the always-interesting Christopher Walken, in an uncharacteristically low-key role, and a number of other fine actors.<br/><br/>The film panders to the base emotions in all of us, but it works."

","i liked this film a lot. it's dark, it's not a bullet-dodging, car-chasing numb your brain action movie. a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague, leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions. it's nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own minds.<br/><br/>in the end, motivated by love or vengeance, or a desire to repent - he does what he feels is ""right"". 'will god ever forgive us for what we've done?' - it's not a question mortal men can answer - so he does what he feels he has to do, what he's good at, what he's been trained to do.<br/><br/>denzel washington is a great actor - i honestly can't think of one bad movie he's done - and he's got a great supporting cast. i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone."
"MovieAddict2016","Null","109","155","20 September 2004"," One of the best thrillers in years; a hard-as-nails revenge flick with Washington in top form.
","I hate preachy revenge flicks. I pay money to go see a revenge movie, I want revenge -- not some tough guy learning that killing is bad, etc. Seriously, if I wanted a sermon on the importance of turning the other cheek, I'd either go to church or rent an eco-friendly Steven Seagal movie.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of the revenge genre, there's something about the build-up that gets my blood boiling. I love getting attached to characters and feeling their vengeance, which is why I love revenge movies that go all-out and feature TRUE revenge.<br/><br/>COLLATERAL DAMAGE is a good example of a movie that just backed itself into a wall. It starts as a revenge movie and ends as a message against terrorism, war, and violence. In an Arnold Schwarzenegger film? Give me a break.<br/><br/>So I had never expected to see such hardcore material in MAN ON FIRE -- it's an all-out action thriller that takes no prisoners. When Denzel stuck a stick of dynamite up a man's anus, then blew him up, I thought, ""Wow, this movie really isn't afraid of offending people.""<br/><br/>Washington's character isn't likable which is part of the reason this succeeds. Most revenge movies feature heroes who, magically, don't seem to want to kill anybody. However in this, Creasy (Washington) is a bodyguard who avenges the death of a little girl (Dakota Fanning) and he does so with more than mere vengeance. ""I'm going to kill everyone,"" he says, and then does, with no pity and no remorse.<br/><br/>In fact this actually reminded me of the Tom Clancy novel ""Without Remorse,"" only it's even better. Scott is at the top of his game here, revolutionizing subtitles along the way and adding an unmistakable grain to his movie that only helps it become more memorable as a gritty revenge flick.<br/><br/>It also features both Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke -- the Kings of Cool -- in the same film together. That right there makes the film worth seeing.<br/><br/>I agree with Quentin Tarantino. This is one of Tony Scott's best films and a great, hard-as-nails revenge movie -- I had expected little and got back a lot. A definite must-see, and an Oscar-worthy performance by Washington.<br/><br/>One of 2004's most underrated films. How did this get 30% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes?!<br/><br/>4.5/5"
"RickHarvey","8","13","15","1 February 2010"," A emotional ride
","This film contains the one ingredient that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion. Sorrow, love, laughter , anger. There are so many emotions thrown into this film. From start to finish this film is immensely captivating. The plot on paper sounds like the usually rubbish that is mostly thrown In the faces of the audiences but don't be mistaken, this film is powerful. Washington as always puts on a great performance.<br/><br/>The plot in a nutshell: man suffers from depression, a young girl brings life into him, kids gets kidnap, man wants revenge. Doesn't sound like anything special but it far superior than any other similar film out there. For instant, TAKEN is a similar film but when you compare them both, MAN ON FIRE wins hands down. The characters are engaging and everyone puts in a great performance and the directing is great. Mexico City feels alive , it looks like Mexico city, it smells like Mexico city. Everything is portrayed brilliantly . the style of direction was something I enjoyed and brought the best out of Mexico City<br/><br/>This is one of those films you'll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you'll beg your family and friends to watch. From start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist, making it a roller-coaster journey. There enough action to keep you happy, there enough character development to please you and then there's Washington to bring a smile to your face . Watch this film, you won't be disappointed"
"rothenburg74","9","12","14","24 September 2004"," Won't be Disappointed
","The movie has a great story and great acting. The sound was terrible and it had too many camera tricks. I had to use the subtitles on my DVD player just to understand some of the dialogue. However, the positives far outweigh the negatives. I personally think Denzel is a top five actor and this movie just adds to his tradition of great performances. The little girl has a great performance also. I've seen many bad reviews and I don't understand them. Just picky writers, they have to bash some movies. Funny, I've never remembered one of their names. Apparently there is an original that is worth checking out and comparing. This movie is a must see for action fans."
"littlemartinarocena","6","89","133","9 October 2006"," The Editing Massacre
","A riveting introduction, powerful performances and yet, I couldn't quite connect. The trendy editing, I hope, it's just a moronic phase that movies are going through to be outgrow soon, very soon. All the dramatic tension vanishes as the editor plays around with the visuals. Why? If you have characters played by the likes of Denzel Washington, why the need to hit us over the head with a self conscious blow of irrational cutting taking me out of the movie completely and forcing me to see the movie as a movie, the actors as actors and the drama as sheer fiction. Washington is superb. Slowly but surely I'm warming up to the man. I've always admired his performances but there was something about the actor, a veil of arrogance perhaps, that stopped me from getting closer. Here, his personal torment and his warming up to Dakota Fanning took me completely until the smart ass editing ruined everything."
"virek213","7","89","136","10 May 2004"," Vengeance In Mexico City
","Although released among a flock of revenge-minded action flicks (KILL BILL VOL. 2; THE PUNISHER; WALKING TALL), MAN ON FIRE works as well as it does thanks in large part to the always-watchable Denzel Washington, one of the best actors around today.<br/><br/>In MAN ON FIRE, based on A.J. Quinnell's 1980 novel (first filmed in 1987, with Scott Glenn), Washington plays a down-on-his-luck ex-mercenary who has now stooped to drinking from a flash of Jack Daniels, until his old partner (Christopher Walken) offers him a chance at redemption.  He is hired on as a bodyguard to the 10 year-old daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a Mexican businessman (Marc Antony) and his American-born wife (Radha Mitchell). While he and Fanning work like oil and water first (not mixing very well), he really gets to form a bond with her, encouraging her to do better at swimming, while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past.  It is that very bond that will force Washington back into his old line of work when Fanning is kidnapped and held for a $10 million ransom, and he is nearly killed.  With almost any other stock action hero (Schwarzenneger; Segal, etc.), the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we've seen a million times before.  But Washington's character, though he's killing for a reason, does not particularly enjoy doing what he does.  Still, he gets help from a very intrepid Mexican newspaper reporter (Rachel Ticotin) out to expose ""La Hermanidad"" (The Brotherhood), the kidnap gang responsible for Fanning's abduction.<br/><br/>MAN ON FIRE is flawed to some extent because of the hyper camera work, nearly headache-inducing montage editing, and various film stocks that are par for the course of its director Tony Scott (TOP GUN; CRIMSON TIDE), but which are not necessarily unique to him (witness Oliver Stone's use of montage in JFK or Sam Peckinpah's in his classic 60s and 70s films).  Still, Scott gets a very good performance from Washington, as well as Fanning, who comes across as far more than a typical movie-brat kid.  Harry Gregson-Williams' south-of-the-border Spanish guitar score is enhanced by soundtrack splashes of Chopin, Debussy, and even Linda Ronstadt's classic 1977 country-rock version of ""Blue Bayou.""  Although the film overall is quite violent, it is no worse than most action films of the last ten years, and overall it is much better than most."

","Man on Fire is an excellent movie, and certainly one of the best of 2004; it's a shame Denzel Washington didn't get an Oscar nomination for this. In this movie he plays John Creasy, a man assigned to protect a young girl in Mexico. He regains his will to live as he bonds with Pita. When she gets kidnapped, the movie turns into an intense story of violent revenge as Creasy hunts down all the criminals and even police who are in on this kidnapping scandal as he searches for the truth about Pita. This movie is absolutely riveting, It's practically two and a half hours long but the story is so compelling the time just flies by.The ending of the movie could have been better, but overall this movie is worth watching. (As I said earlier, Man on Fire reminds me of episode 35 of Beast Wars, titled ""Code of Hero"", where Dinobot, just like Creasy, is a troubled person with a dark past who goes on a seemingly hopeless rescue mission, with a whole lot of revenge thrown in the mix.)If you haven't seen Man on Fire, watch it; you won't regret doing so."

For some the beginning of the film may drag on for a bit too long, however it is essential in establishing Creasy's character. The action really starts when Cristopher Walkens, who by the way is brilliant in his supporting role says Creasy's about to paint his masterpiece. one by one the culprits meet in their end in ways which even the most spontaneous and inventive killer would not even dream about.

"fertilecelluloid","8","4","4","8 January 2005"," Dark art snuck under the studio radar
","You've got to give it to Tony Scott: He tries so friggin' hard. His films bring new meaning to the term ""layering"". He gets criticized a lot for his ""MTV-style cutting"", but that's a lazy jab.<br/><br/>I'm not on IMDb to review every mainstream Hollywood effort. I'd die of boredom if I did. My job (self-appointed) is to review the beautiful and the brutal, the extremes of cinema, the cinematic polar ice caps (with the odd exception). MAN ON FIRE qualifies for comment because it's made for people (guys mostly) who love movies that sizzle like fatty bacon and make no apologies to the loathsome PC crowd for being violent, sleazy, obsessive and baked in a thick, crusty style.<br/><br/>Scott makes hard, arty genre pictures when he's truly on a roll and he does it with total conviction. MAN ON FIRE is Scott on a major roll.<br/><br/>The first forty-five minutes prep for the inevitable holocaust of payback by focusing on Denzel Washington's relationship with the little girl (Dakota Fanning) he's been hired to protect. The ninety minutes that follow Dakota's kidnapping zero in on Washington's bloody revenge and preparation.<br/><br/>The film's been predictably blasted for its supposed Right Wing politics. That's manure. It's a revenge pic, for Chrissakes, not propaganda.<br/><br/>There is criticism of Mexican corruption and the serious problem of kidnapping in that country is torn from fresh headlines. But all this is texture, material for Scott to layer into his hundred million plus ""B"" movie.<br/><br/>Scott goes bananas stylistically and employs every graphic trick in the book to subvert the texture of the imagery. Even subtitles cop a serious retrofit. At times I found the graphic enhancement a little over-the-top and slightly distracting, but, for the most part, it enhanced the T. Scott style of info overload.<br/><br/>It's obvious that Scott relishes directing action sequences as he imbues his set-ups with so much detail and delivers very brutal, uncompromising work. <br/><br/>The sound design is always thunderous and powerful in every one of the Brit director's films, and MAN ON FIRE is no exception.<br/><br/>A guest appearance by Chris Walken is a lot of fun and Washington's penchant for torture amps up the intensity levels.<br/><br/>Perhaps twenty minutes too long, but, hey, this is dark art snuck under the studio radar by a master tactician."

I loved Creasy (and I'm not normally a Denzel Washington fan!) and the little girl was so cute that I knew I was going to be distressed by her kidnapping. <br/><br/>In summary, the two lead characters, Creasy and Pita, were amazing and brilliantly acted. And the ending made me cry (a lot). This film is very heartwarming and even the revenge scenes were better than I expected!<br/><br/>8/10 (and that's probably not being very generous).

"alindsay-al","9","6","7","9 January 2015"," a fantastic film that is surprisingly unique
","I am a big fan of Denzel Washington so I decided to watch this film and I must say it is fantastic. The premise of this film sees denzels character hired to protect a family particularly a young girl. So when she is kidnapped he promises to kill every person responsible and save the girl from death. Now Denzel is great in the role and he combines the mix of drama and action really well and his performance in this film is really really good with special emotional layers to his character. The supporting cast is also really good with this probably being my favourite Dakota fanning performance ever. Her and denzels chemistry is fantastic and really carries the first half of this film which makes the second half more impactfull. The mum and dad of fanning were both really good also with the mum being an emotion filled character and the dad a layered character. Even though he isn't in the film that much Christopher walken was great in the film and showed his real acting chops and his chemistry with Washington was good. The story was multi layered and even though the premise is similar to other films this one has its unique angle. The story isn't just an action story but it sees a man who goes through a journey of redemption and gets attached to this kid and the end of the film is tear worthy. The script is great too with a really good mix of comedy and drama dialogue that makes these characters feel interesting and multi layered. The style is a bit of a mixed bag I did think some of the stylistic choices worked for the Mexico style. However, not all of it works and sometimes it takes the grit off the film and that is a big disappointment for the film in my opinion. Overall I love this film it is fantastic and every Denzel Washington fan should see it."

","Based on a 1980'ies A. Quintrell novel ""Man on Fire"" as a production sizzles and then flares with high quality. It is a violent revenge movie , it is a touching redemption story , it is a friendship/healing tale....and it succeeds telling all these aspects in an emotional , gripping way. Main creator of this production Tony Scott ( whom I think along his brother Ridley Scott are last of the few creative artist directors remained in CGI/Marketing oriented Hollywood ) uses a non-original but still very good script , high class acting talents of Denzel Washington , Dakota Fanning and supporting cast plus some very stylish , cutting , flashy , clip like camera work ( especially in violent scenes ) to create a great movie. Tony like his brother Ridley is a true artist on my account.<br/><br/>Story : Creasy ( Washington ) is an ex CIA operative/assassin who was burnt and now is an alcoholic filled with guilt due to his past career. When a friend of his arranges a job for him as a bodyguard for Pita ( Fanning ) daughter of a young industrialist in Mexico City where kidnapping-for-ransom is the new rising crime wave , he accepts it reluctantly. But when Pita with her child like innocence forms a bond and takes him out of his self pitying he is committed to her. Until she is kidnapped and Creasy wounded while protecting her. When ransom payment goes awry and she is assumed dead Creasy goes rogue and starts a bloody rampage , begins a violent reckoning among these ""professional criminals"" and whoever arranged and profited from this foul deed or ""looked wrong"" to Creasy<br/><br/>The whole movie is tight accessible to regular viewer , filled with themes fills you with emotions along with clip like scenes...Acting especially from Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning is great...Highly recommended"

","This is great movie. Denzel Washington is a bodyguard for a young girl but screws up through no fault of his own, and then goes on the hunt for vengeance.

He shows amazing depth and passion - you can almost feel it being sucked out of him. It's somewhat too long, but that helps to build the relationships, particularly between yourself and Creasy and the little girl. Sometimes, these things take time.

"Buddy-51","7","75","135","20 September 2005"," flawed but gripping crime thriller
","You know you're in for something different when a movie has Christopher Walken playing the part of a professional hit man - and he isn't even one of the bad guys! Although it could do with some judicious trimming here and there, ""Man on Fire"" is a generally effective crime drama that ranges in tone from the openly sentimental to the downright brutal - and just about every tone imaginable in between.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington stars as Creasy, a former CIA assassin who has recently quit the business and is seeking some sort of redemption for the sins he's committed. So far, he's been looking for answers in a bottle and the Bible and not doing all that well with either. As the movie opens, Mexico City has been ravaged by a series of kidnappings aimed at the powerful and well-to-do, possibly perpetrated by the very police force assigned to keep law and order in the community. Creasy accepts the position as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy business owner who rightly fears for her safety. The first third of the film is devoted to the growing friendship between Creasy and his charge, Pita, a sweet little girl who, slowly but surely, works her way into Creasy's initially hardened heart and affections. The last two-thirds of the film turns into an Avenging Angel melodrama, as Creasy systematically seeks out and eliminates all those responsible for a tragedy that occurs early on in the story.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by A.J Quinnell, ""Man on Fire,"" astutely written by Brian Helgeland and flashily directed by Tony Scott, is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter. It takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is, for all intents and purposes, achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering (admittedly disreputable) people. These scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful, even if they do at times border on the exploitative. Even better are the quiet, intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the early parts of the movie. Washington and the wonderful Dakota Fanning establish an natural, easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow.<br/><br/>Washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic righteousness, making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing eludes us intellectually. In addition to the two leads, there are solid performances from Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin and Giancarlo Giannini. But it is Washington and the delightful Ms. Fanning who steal the show.<br/><br/>""Man on Fire"" would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time, but this is still a better-than-average crime thriller."
"jubileey_rising","10","28","46","9 April 2005"," ""Revenge is a dish best served cold.""
","Revenge is a word most of us are all-too familiar with. Rarely do I comment on movies, but today -- as I compose this message at 2:30AM -- I feel compelled to do so. Judging the proverbial book by its cover, one might suspect ""Man On Fire"" is a movie based solely on personal revenge. This particular movie, however, is a far-cry from such. Throughout the movie, there is much more to learn (or, for some of us, to be reminded of): 100% selfless acts of kindness, acts of pure love. Once you check out this movie, you'll surely realize the devotion that the main character (played by Denzel Washington) has for his young companion. Regardless of pain or suffering, and without personal gain, ""Creasy"" takes on battles with enemies, once-friends, and even himself in order to not let the death of his friend lie in vain.<br/><br/>During and after watching this movie, I have the overwhelming sensation of cold loss paired with the warmth of friendship and devotion -- a devotion that eventually led to death. If, for one breathing moment, all of humankind could possess the selfless, endearing characteristic such as this -- this eternal promise to one another -- I truly believe the world would indeed morph into a surrealistic, incredible heaven full of kindness for and acceptance of one another . As movies these days rarely do, ""Man On Fire"" reminds us all of the sacrifices we must endure, the pains we must withstand to ensure the survival of ourselves and our friends, and the comfort of knowing that -- somewhere, somehow -- somebody is as faithful to us as ""Creasy"" was to ""Pita.""<br/><br/>That is the brilliance (and the essence) of entertainment."

","Long time ago, maybe 10 years ago when movies were full of magic(not in literal sense), when I was a child, I used to watch a good movie and sleep satisfactorily at night with blank mind, peace and happiness. I have seen many movies which failed to bring that sense of feeling in the last 3 years, but when i watched this movie recently I was overwhelmed with peace and satisfaction, and the heroism depicted in the movie etched an lasting impression in my mind.The Story is simple, a tough guy who is hired to protect a girl, and starts loving her as his own daughter, and then she is abducted by a gang which trades in human lives and kidnapping. How the tough guy avenges the girls' kidnapping forms the rest of the story. But No! No! Story might seem simple, but it grips you and keep you glued to every emotion.<br/><br/>Well, the music is mind-blowing. And especially the music at end with a Tribal touch to it rouses inspiration and strength in everyone. 10/10 for music.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington, keeps you transfixed every single second with his flawless performance. He adds so much authenticity, reality to the characters that you can't explain his performance in 1000 words! Blockbuster action movie, a must watch for sure!"
"headhunter46","Null","7","9","24 September 2004"," Demons within and demons without.
","Denzel Washington plays the role of an ex-marine who is battling demons from within himself, the memories of the horrible things that occur in war. We depend on men like him to defend our country, and we send them to other parts of the world in the name of freedom. We train them to be cool-headed, efficient killers because sometimes that is the only way to stop the selfish, evil ones who would destroy decency and freedom with no regard for human rights. <br/><br/>But then these heroic saviors of freedom must deal with the deeds they have committed and too often they can't turn off the dreams that come back to haunt them. You may have trouble understanding but this happens to soldiers who acted honorably in war. The destruction is traumatic even to those who obey all the rules of the ""Geneva Conventions"". They, like him, often resort to booze to numb the brain so the memories are not as painful. Something inside men like this has been twisted until it is almost dead and can only be revived by a special person. I know, because I was once like him.<br/><br/>In this movie, that special someone is a little girl with a heart as big as Australia. Our hero tries to distant himself from everyone to avoid the emotional interaction that comes with a relationship. The closest thing to a friendship is with another of his kind who has seemingly been able to overcome his past while Denzel (as John Creasy) is still battling his.<br/><br/>But, this little girl with her bubbly, innocent personality and zest for life slowly melts the granite heart within and we see him come out of his shell and dare to have feelings for another human again.<br/><br/>He was hired to be the families bodyguard, but is soon more than that to the girl. He becomes a friend and mentor to her. Then suddenly everything goes wrong. He finds himself surrounded by a large group of would be abductors. Vastly outnumbered he puts up a valiant fight killing several of the attackers but is severely wounded trying to save her. The kidnappers escape with her as he lies bleeding from multiple wounds.<br/><br/>While he is near death a ransom is demanded but the transfer of money goes wrong and the kidnappers swear they will kill the girl. A conspiracy begins to unfold that seems to involve even the police.<br/><br/>Our hero is able to recuperate and swears vengeance on the whole bunch of kidnappers. Now the heart once open and loving of the little girl has turned once again to cold, hard granite and woe unto anyone who had a part in her demise.<br/><br/>There is much action and enough explosions to please most lovers of action films, as our hero methodically goes about eliminating all involved in the kidnapping. Some may find a few of his methods brutally cold hearted but remember, they killed the first person he allowed himself to get close to and by ridding the world of them, they cannot do that to someone else. He seems to take no pleasure in eliminating the criminals, he is merely ridding the world of vermin. There are no wisecracks, no smiles of vengeance relished. Merely cold-hearted, methodical killing of corrupt, evil people. He uses whatever means necessary to extract information, even to the point of what decent citizens would consider cruelty! As he gets closer to the perpetrators, members of the police force are found to be involved and our hero enlists the help of a reform minded reporter who has been battling corruption in Mexico by exposing it in the newspaper she writes for.<br/><br/>I can't say more here without giving away too much and I caution you that if you hate to know the ending of a movie, DO NOT READ SPOILERS IN THE OTHER REVIEWS. At least not until after you have watched the movie. If you are like me you enjoy surprises and this movie has several.<br/><br/>Let it suffice to say I was quite impressed with the acting of the members of this cast.

Add Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken with a hard boiled script by Brian Helgeland and you think you've got a masterpiece on your hands.<br/><br/>But it's not. The acting is good all around, as can be expected by veterans like Washington and Walken. But director Scott goes overboard with his MTV-style editing, cutting, blow-ups and close-ups.

"Replikant","4","41","79","25 August 2005"," Flashy and ruthless does not equal great movie
","The thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy, shaky, camera-work and the fast, confusing cutting. I am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh proof with most of their movies, but in this case there was WAY too much. It seems like the jump-cuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over Mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end. For a movie that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that it's story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development. That is another disappointing aspect of the movie. If I want to watch an over the top action flick I do not need any justification, but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of Denzel Washington's character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances. The first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb archetypes and clichÃ©s are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens. So the movie does not work either on the level of a believable drama/thriller , nor as a pure action movie. Of course the movie is not as bad as some oft the totally messed up blockbusters of the last years, but I absolutely cannot understand why so many people claim this movie to be something fresh and so cool. For a video clip it is way too long and for a movie it has too little substance."

We learn about Creasy's (Washington) new job and his relationship with the people around him that makes him change in the first hour.<br/><br/>Then, during the second hour, director Tony Scott shows us his trademark action genre as Creasy ignites his anger after Pita's (Fanning) kidnapping. Now with the help of a reporter (Rachel Ticotin) and a detective (Giancarlo Giannini), Creasy vows to hunt down the mastermind behind the kidnapping, that is ""The Voice"".<br/><br/>As we go deeper, we feel a sense of pity for Creasy. With Harry Gregson-Williams' (Phone Booth (2002)) gritty and touching score, we can feel that the villains should deserve to die.<br/><br/>Overall, Man on Fire is a solid movie, not for its action, but for its drama.

The first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl he's paid to protect.  The trailers to this movie all mention that she is kidnapped.  So, I'm giving nothing away when I say that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess after she's kidnapped. Whatever the director was trying to accomplish, all he succeeds in doing is making the audience literally nauseous.  Rapid, frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half-hour as Creasy tracks down the perpetrators.  These cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is to jolt you out of the story. I'm sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story signified a change in Creasy's character and signified that a different movie was to follow.  Well, he was right.  The movie that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap.  The result of which is a depressing ending that ruins even the quality first forty minutes of the movie."

First you spend some time bonding the hero to the character who will later become a victim of some crime. The more innocent the victim is or the more horrible their demise , the more the director can crank up the sadism later on in the movie.<br/><br/>The problem for me with this film is the hero seemed to be a lot sicker than the bad guys. He tortures his victims before killing them , cutting fingers off here , inserting explosives into rectums there, it's really nasty stuff.and yet there seems to be no sense that what he's doing is wrong, the camera seems to treat him as if he's a bit of a cool dude.<br/><br/>As well as this kind of cockeyed morality the construction of film it self seems to linger on the scenes of torture, I couldn't help feeling that this was a movie made by a sadist for other sadists , a snuff movie made for titillation.<br/><br/>The whole idea of setting up a situation in a film which allows the viewer to enjoy scenes of torture really creeps me out."

Initially we the audience see the relationship between Pita (as she is called) and Creasy Bear (as he is affectionately called by little Lupita) as nothing more as a paid gig that neither child or protector are too keen on, but each day little pip squeak Lupita wears down the hard drinking emotionless bodyguard John Creasy and when she is kidnapped by a slew of bad Mexican banditos, Creasy swears he will make sure anyone and everyone who played even a tiny part in his clients abduction will pay for it with their lives.<br/><br/>The director Tony Scott spared no expense in making sure John Creasy's vengeance mission to make the criminals pay for their bad choice in abductions left no stone unturned, no vehicle explosion too powerful, and no interrogation too brutal that the film had to be rated for adult only audiences.<br/><br/>This is the third time I have seen the film and I am sure to want to watch it again over the next few decades as it surely is a film classic in the crime/hero genre.

There's seems to be an underlying comparison of Scott vs Tarantino from the more 'verified' reviewers that undoubtedly takes away from a masterclass of acting in of itself. The storyline has an astounding gradualism, slowly easing you in to understanding the pain of the protagonist; 'Creasy', who is Clearly haunted and disillusioned from his inescapable past. ""Nothing more dangerous than a man alone with his thoughts"" rings true. As the movie progresses, the relationship between both Pita and Creasy intensifies. ""He shows her that it's okay to live again"". The U-turn this takes when she is taken away is sharp. The movie adopts a heads and tails kind of approach with so much pain and emotion initially, to so much anger and violence eventually. This U-turn is both gripping and exhilarating, it will have your eyes unblinkingly hypnotised to the screen. As of all good films, the ending is not one to disappoint.

","Based on the novel of the same name by the pseudonymous AJ Quinnell, which is itself alleged to be based around true events, Man On Fire has previously been brought to the big screen in a 1987 European production by French director Elie Chouraqui. At it's heart, a simple revenge fable, Man On Fire follows the fortunes of a formerly accomplished military man known simply as Creasy, that's Creasy with a C, not a G as it sporadically sounds in the movie. Portrayed in this adaptation by Denzel Washington, Creasy is an amiable if evasive character, clearly troubled by a shadowy past of contentious moral value. This exhibits itself in a pervasively melancholy facial expression and an eagerness to spend rather too much time with his good friend Jack Daniels. It's only through the ever watchable Christopher Walken's character Rayburn, a friend and former colleague, that the viewer is afforded any insight into Creasy's character or past. After we're explicitly informed of the prolific rate of kidnappings in South American states, a bearded, bottle hitting Creasy is cajoled by Rayburn into taking a job as a bodyguard in his adopted home, Mexico. He's immediately hired by the unconvincing couple of Samuel and Lisa Ramos, played by Jennifer Lopez casualty Marc Anthony and Neighbours alumnus Radha Mitchell, to protect their little girl Pita, played by Dakota Fanning. Of course Pita is summarily abducted, Creasy is riddled with bullets, and the subsequent ransom drop is botched, ostensibly meaning curtains for the little girl. Well Creasy needed something to burn about, you didn't think it was about visit to the clap clinic did you? The rest of the film depicts a largely irrelevant criminal network being dispatched in creatively gruesome ways until the inexorable showdown with the architect of the kidnapping.<br/><br/>The first half of the film plods along with a pleasantly restrained pace, allowing us to enjoy some truly memorably scenes between the excellent Washington and Fanning. Creepily precocious in previous appearances, c.f. the saccharine I Am Sam, Fanning is charming as a convincingly bright youngster with maturity beyond her years, and a penchant for oral hygiene, rather than some kind of miniaturised twenty-something. Washington performs admirably as a character that is detached and distant, not least because he clearly has little back story to speak of. Walken is used sparingly and his performance is restrained. His only foray into his usual trade of scene stealing dramatic monologues even ends with the assurance ""I don't have anything else to say"". Mickey Rourke puts in a brief performance as a lawyer that appears as though the word bar has no legal connotations to him at all, and all the other supports are of a generally high standard. Anthony and Mitchell, however, fail to convince as either spouses or parents. Mitchell manages to be pert and distressed at the appropriate junctures, but Anthony clearly struggles to make his character credible as an actual human being.<br/><br/>The second half of the film, and it does start almost exactly half way through the two and half hour runtime, sees Scott abandon all directorial restrain and turn up the affectation to 11. In a scene which had the potential for Washington and Mitchell to display a deeper emotional side to their characters, Creasy flicks through his departed charge's diary while sitting on her bed, and is interrupted by the grieving MILF. After some cursory navel gazing, Lisa concedes that she doesn't know what to do and solicits Creasy's plans for the future, ""What are you going to do?"" ""What I do best. I'm gonna kill 'em. Anyone that was involved, anybody who profited from it, anybody that opens their eyes at me (!?)"" This statement of murderous intent comes complete with an irritating musical cue courtesy of Nine Inch Nails, and Lisa's response? Clearly suffering from a bout of the ever popular Lady Macbeth syndrome, barely batting an eyelid, she offers ""you kill 'em all"", pecks him on the cheek and sends him on his merry way. The inevitable 'tooling up' montage follows promptly.<br/><br/>From here on in, the film resembles some unholy mash of Stone and Soderbergh via Akerlund, filming a Tarrantino script without the dialogue or stylistic aplomb. The soundtrack proceeds to irritate, offering the abrasive cheese-grater on a guitar posturing of Nine Inch Nails to let us know when the action is suitably 'hardcore', and the pseudo mystical foreign female vocals popularised by Scott senior in Gladiator, when something 'poignant' is occurring. The subtitles, required by virtue of the Mexican locale, fade, grow, wipe and move across the frame in manner initially intriguing, but quickly distracting. These two aberrations, on top of the 'kid in a sweet shop' approach to visual effects, serve to totally distance the viewer from any connection they may have established in early scenes. On top of this we're offered a fearless journalist who can seemingly find out anything, Creasy attracting and taking bullets like Rocky does punches, and yet another ridiculous club scene. Aren't there any normal night spots in Hollywood? The violent set pieces are generally well executed, no pun intended, the most memorable being a Reservoir Dogs style extremity deprivation to the strains of the radio. The climax, when it finally arrives is surprisingly subdued, though a tacked on final moment of retribution caused the film to leave me rolling my eyes in irritation.<br/><br/>The main problem with Man On Fire is that it's a thin, simplistic story, prolonged to 146 minutes by a desire to show off stylistically. After Creasy sets off on his killing spree, the only thing left is to sit back and count the bodies. There isn't really any interest left in the characters, and the shadowy criminal network offers little more than greedy Creasy fodder. On the whole, it's a good quality action film, so long as you don't mind the bloated run time. Man On Fire is a predictably undemanding, enjoyable piece of entertainment from Tony Scott."

","Tony Scott's newest contribution to the world of cinema is truly a masterpiece.<br/><br/>His choice of main star, Denzel Washington, was solid and reassuring--who best to take the lead role than one of the greatest actors the world has ever seen.<br/><br/>But Dakota Fanning saved it from the standard action/vengeance category. Too many films have relied on child stars and failed simply because they are not believable. Dakota broke the trend by truly grabbing the viewer by the heart and soul and wrenching them when catastrophe finally lands at her doorstep.<br/><br/>As for the film-making process itself, Tony Scott excels. He took the recently favoured ""shaky-camera/documentary"" style and elevated it to a level of artistic expression that anyone else could only dream to achieve. Harsh contrasts and ever-moving subtitles flow seamlessly as emotions run high and morals are soon flung out a Meican window.<br/><br/>In the first half we are treated to a heart-warming, but not annoyingly mushy, relationship between Washington and Fanning, as they both learn to look to each other for what they both needed the most: a father-daughter union.<br/><br/>The second half is a brutal escapade of vengeance and retribution, as Washington inflicts all the pain and rage that the viewer feel with him upon the perpetrators of the horrible act. His journey through the underbelly of Mexico is harrowing, his actions violent and pitiless--and yet we, as the companion on this trek, know they fully deserve the suffering they endure.<br/><br/>The climax is the perfect ending to the perfect movie. Heart-stopping, tense, depressing and yet hopeful---most importantly it is REAL and through that realism we finally exit the theatres knowing Washington is an everyday hero: breaking the rules, taking lives, but for an undeniably good cause.<br/><br/>Downside: thanks to the ever-burgeoning business side of cinema, ads have revealed the hinted-at but not obvious twist halfway through that spurns his quest for attack. This almost makes you wish he'd GET ON WITH IT, rather than allow us o enjoy the growing bond between father-figure and lonely child.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone with a heart."

","You don't often see Hollywood movies getting this violent. Denzil Washington manages to kill off half of Mexico with his vigilante fury after a small girl, who he is paid to bodyguard is kidnapped. The character has spent 20yrs in military service, killed a lot of people and loses his past in a whisky bottle. However when the kidnappers steal the only person who showed him that life was worth living...then ""Only one man..."". You know the sort of thing. Charles Bronson territory but with a bit of feeling, emotion and actually existing to watch. The only thing I felt a little too overpowering was the passion for modern trend fun-effects of undercranking, hyper-fast cranes or pans, bleached scenes, double exposure, bouncing jump-shots and most effects with seen in ""The Ring"" or ""The Grudge"". It's too overdone, but a great film!"

","I have read a bunch of reviews that call this movie something less than what it is. Although the movie is a great action flick it has a more human side to it. Densel Washington portrays a ""bodyguard"" by the name of John Creasy. We watch this fella, who has obviously got some problems, fall into a bottle of Jack Daniels. What else is new. It isn't like we haven't seen a film with this plot before. What is refreshing and believable is the relationship Creasy has with the child, Pita. Dakota Fanning does an excellent job of portraying, what could be a pretentious child, an intelligent child that cuts thru the hard shell of a bodyguard that just wants to do his job. What we actually see here is the transformation of a man that is been trained to do a job but has lost the flame and passion for doing it. He finds that real life belongs to those that have a passion for something in life. Love blooms, as Creasy realizes that this child expresses her love of him without knowing what he does for a living or what he had done in the past.<br/><br/>I thought this was a heartwarming film that catered to the action film freak and also added the touch of human feeling. I give this film high ranks...."

","I really enjoyed this movie. It is very well made and well acted. Dakota Fanning really does a great job in this movie playing the little girl. Denzel Washington is great as always. Giancarlo Giannini does terrific is his role. Christopher Walkin makes his role, as only he can. I don't think anyone else could have pulled off the role. Mark Anthony does alright with his role. <br/><br/>One thing that really started to get on my nerves about the film. The subtitles began to grow and grow. They even started to come up even when English was being spoken. Sometimes a character would be speaking Spanish....then switch to English...then back to Spanish again. This tends to become more apparent as the movie goes on. <br/><br/>I have no real problem with the first hour of the movie setting up the relationship between Creasy and Pita. It really sets the tone for the Bloody vendetta that Creasy goes on when she is kidnapped. It's always better to set up characters and the relationships between them. <br/><br/>The rapid jump cuts began to go a little overboard. The would get to the point when what was happening in the scene was not visible.<br/><br/>I think the only problem that people have with this film, is that it is something different. I enjoy a movie that brings something new to film-making. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoy's action movies. You will not be disappointed with your choice."

One point of excellence was the extensive time taken at the beginning of the film to build the caractures and to allow the viewer to get to know them and understand their relationships.

","I gave this film one star because I couldn't go any lower. Those were two hours I can never get back. I like a lot of Tony Scott's movies but he missed it on this one. The story had great potential and the actors were the best. The direction ruined this movie. The camera work was ridiculous; constantly speeding up and slowing down; stopping and starting; cutting to bad angles. I'm sure he was trying to be artistic but it started as annoying and went quickly to aggravating. And the subtitles...what was the deal with those? It looked like his kids got him some subtitle software for Christmas and he just had to use all those cool effects in the movie. It turned out to be childish and insulting. Let's take an example: One of the Mexican criminals gives a speech, mostly in English. Every time the character uses a Spanish word, they subtitle it, like I am too stupid to understand the context of the speech. When one of the characters slurs his speech, Scott subtitles that, too. Direct it right and you won't need the subtitles. The subtitles fade in and out, they blur, they overwrite each other. Just stupid. While I'm at it, was the mother supposed to be Southern? Some of the words she spoke with an overdone, deep South accent but the rest of the time she sounded straight out of California.<br/><br/>You might look at my profile and think that I am too old to get it. No. The fact is, this movie was just bad. I watched it with my 16 year old son, who has a much higher tolerance for lousy movies. C'mon. He loved ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""XXX."" Even he hated it. If you watch this movie, you have only yourself to blame."

I felt like the character development during the first hour was drawn out far too long.  Once you had the point of what was going on, it was beat into your head a few more times just in case.  Also, the style of the movie is horrendous.  Slow motion and jerky camera flashes completely destroy any tension or emotions that would have been built up by the actors.  Denzel is a fabulous actor, yet I felt absolutely nothing for his character.  Dakota Fanning is a remarkable child prodigy, yet in the end I really didn't care what happened to her.

Bad move, Tony.<br/><br/>But what REALLY surprised was the little Dakota Fanning's playacting. I haven't seen ""I Am Sam"" yet, so I don't know how good she was there, but in this movie she's IMPRESSIVE. And, of course, Christopher Walken as supporting actor is marvelous, no surprises here. The rest of the movie I just can't remember, so I suppose there was nothing worth of mentioning there.<br/><br/>To summarize: visually annoying, sometimes touching, but generally disappointing.

","A guilt ridden, Bible reading, alcoholic ex-counter insurgency assassin, Creasy (Washington), takes a job as body guard for a little girl (Fanning) in Mexico only to see her snatched from under his nose by a Mexican crime cartel. Predictably, Washington then goes on a one man mission of revenge with a promise to ""off"" anyone who profited from the girl's murder. According to his compadre (Walken), he's an artist, his art is death, and he's about to paint his masterpiece. ""Man on Fire"", which fared much better with the public than the critics, is a run-of-the-mill action/drama which fills up its almost 2.5 hour run with lots of concocted drama, super macho action, and annoying visual effects which do more to detract than embellish. Washington isn't the usual sweaty, muscular Schwarzenegger or Stallone one man army and subtitles which jump around on screen changing fonts and zipping form the mouths speaking the Spanish don't help. Nonetheless, ""Man on Fire"" will be worth a DVD rental for Denzel fans and should make for an enjoyable no brainer small screen watch. (B-)"

The dynamic of how Denzel quickly develops a better relationship with the girl that she has with her father is plenty of plot to be going on with and rolls along quite well: however, he unexpectedly and incompetently doesn't manage to prevent her from being kidnapped. And that's where MOF goes off the rails. It turns from a sentimental 'troubled tough guy redeemed by cute little girl' movie into 'alcoholic gunslinger eventually does Death Wish with fajitas'.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken, as Denzel's mentor buddy, demonstrates that Mexico has no decent Euro-hairdressers, and as the movie goes on (and on), you get more and more gimmicky frame-jumps, intermittent subtitles, gratuitous digital effects, and oh, to be honest I gave up at this point. Apparently Denzel (Creasy) does all sorts of unmentionable things to the bad guys, and there's a letdown ending - but frankly, I'd stopped giving a hoot by halfway.

Maybe he should retire until 2101 just so he can detox.<br/><br/>Anything good in this movie is coming out of star Denzel Washington and Brian Helgeland's script. Unfortunately Scott feels he has to shoot the whole script, so we get a half-hour at the end we don't really need - the film should really end when one of the characters (I won't say who) commits suicide to right a wrong; we don't need the ""uplifting"" sequence that follows.<br/><br/>Beyond the unnecessary final half-hour, the film is filled with equally unnecessary flashy lights and rapid-edits that distract from the real drama of the first third of the film, and water-down the potential for real action scenes in the second third.<br/><br/>What's needed here is direction by John Woo, not a potboiling hack-job from Tony Scott, who has clearly lost any sense of what he wants to do in film.<br/><br/>Oh, and just by the way, bits and pieces of this film are borrowed from an underground blaxploitation cult-film, ""Bogard""/aka ""Black Fist"" The existing copy of that film (available on DVD) is a wretched re-edit hatchet-job, but there's enough there to indicate the power of the original - which presents acting as good as we get in Scott's film, and better direction - and with almost no budget, compared with the many millions thrown away by Scott.<br/><br/>You don't need a lot of money to make a good film - you need a heart and a head and the right hormones.

Denzel himself was perfect for the role, an excellent springboard from the ""bad guy"" role in Training Day. He still plays a dark figure, but one with a sense of bearing and even seems to return to faith (in a critical scene involving alcohol and the Bible). While the beginning seems long and drawn out, it is critical and even enjoyable in the light of the rest of the movie. The second half, while it seems like an intense revenge movie, seems to ""redeem"" itself in the end. Here's the spoiler, kids, Creasy's sacrifice at the end of the movie shows that the point is not to murder everyone who gets in your way, but is to be willing to sacrifice oneself if necessary.

","It's hard to top this movie in several ways. Everything works really well here; the casting, acting, script, and cinematography are all first-rate. For the moviegoer, it's a moving, violent story of love and human redemption. For the film critic, there's plenty of sharp technique and technical merit. There are some tactical blunders, and as has been discussed on the boards, the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the CIA agent training angle. However, I took the ending as being more moving due to the fact that rather than pursue the CIA agent's pragmatic approach, Creasy basically commends his soul to the Ultimate without considering the consequences. Like Jesus Himself, Creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice, whether it actually makes pragmatic sense or not. In any case, I appreciated the fact that Creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and just caps the bad guys one by one in his methodical quest for justice, which actually results in redemption both for himself and the innocent. <br/><br/>In any case, this film is very much worth watching if you're at all attracted to the genre. An excellent soundtrack, great writing, flawless casting, and solid performances across the board make this a top-100 (or better) film."

","Tony Scott's Man On Fire is one of those films I can watch time and time again and never tire of, a magnificently melancholy tale of South of the border justice, criminal intrigue and a tequila shot of pulpy, blood soaked style that gets me every time. It's loosely based on a 1987 film of the same name starring Scott Glenn, Jonathan Pryce, Danny Aiello and Joe Pecshi (there's a random lineup, no?), but Scott intrepidly branches off into his own territory, and thank god for his vision. This was the first film in which he really explored his sketchy smokehouse of an aesthetic that he would later take to angelic heights with Domino. Colors blur and saturate, editing rockets by with the force of a bullet in a storm, subtitles appear arbitrarily and seemingly of their own volition. It's a jarring tool set that he employs, and many abhor it. I'm as in love with it as he was though, and whether to throw us right into the protagonist's psyche or simply because he felt the need to paint his pictures this way, the rest of the films in his remaining career carried the DNA, in varying doses. Fire is the key word for this film, in many of it's forms. There's a smoldering ember in Denzel Washington's John Creasy that is fed by the winds of corruption as the film progresses, erupting into a blazing inferno of violence and fury. Creasy is a broken man, haunted by the questionable, never fully revealed actions of his military past. ""Do you think God will ever forgive us for what we've done"" he grimly asks his old war buddy Rayburn (a scene stealing Christopher Walken). ""No"" Rayburn ushers back curtly. It's at this heavy nadir we join Creasy, lost in a sea of alcohol and guilt, an unmooored ship with a shattered hull looking for both anchorage and repair. Rayburn hooks him up with a bodyguard gig in Mexico City, keeping the young daughter of a rich businessman (Marc Anthony, terrific) safe from the very real threat of kidnapping. Dakota Fanning is compassionate, precocious and endearing as young Pita, who spies the wounded animal in Creasy right off the bat and tries to make friends. Creasy draws back in reluctance, but eventually warms up. I love the pace of this film to bits. It spends nearly half of its hefty running time simply getting to know these two characters, forging a bond between them before the inciting incident even looms on the horizon. And when the kidnapping occurs, as it must, the stakes are high as can be and our investment level in the situation is paramount. Setting up character is so key, and Scott nails it with scene after scene of quiet and careful interaction. Then he yanks the lid off the pot, as Pita is snatched in broad daylight, Creasy is injured and the kidnappers vanish into thin air. Pita's mother (a soulful Radha Mitchell) works with the dodgy Mexican authorities and her husband's lawyer Jordan (a sleazy Mickey Rourke). Creasy has other plans. Once healed, he embarks on a mission of fury and vengeance, knocking down doors, removing body parts, inflicting gratuitous bodily harm and using every technique in his training (believe me, there are some interesting ones) to track down those responsible and get Pita back. Washington does all this with a calm and cool exterior, letting the heat emanate from every calculated syllable and intense glare. The descent into Mexico City's poverty stricken criminal underworld is a grisly affair, and all sorts of ugliness is exposed, shredded through the caffeinated prism of Scott's lens. Two cops do what they can to help Creasy, idealistic Guerrero (Rachel Ticotin) and battle hardened Manzano (the always awesome Giancarlo Gianninni). It's Creasy's show though, and he blasts through it like a righteous hurricane of blood and bullets. Scott's films have a knack for ending in over the top, Mexican standoff style shootouts, but the man subverts that here, going for something far more sorrowful and atmospheric, ending an intense tale on notes of sadness and resolute calm, gilded by the aching tones of songstress Lisa Gerrard and composer Harry Gregson Williams. Walken provides both comfort and catharsis, the only beacon of hope for Creasy other than Pita. Unlike John, Rayburn has moved on from the horrors of their past, but one still sees the trauma in his soul when he looks John in the eye and gets hit with what is reflected back. Tough stuff to get right, but hey, it's Walken we're looking at here, and he's brilliant. Rourke has little more than an extended cameo, but his flavor is always appreciated, and he's great too. I had no idea Anthony had the chops he exhibits here, but I loved his arc as well as his performance and he holds his own in a blistering scene with Washington. Washington is an elemental beast, shadowing what's left of his humanity under a cloak of booze and brooding contemplation, until he's coaxed out by the life saver Pita. Then he's a lion, riding guns out into a ferocious swan song of a sunset that may just hold rays of redemption for him. This is Scott at his best, his unique brand of storytelling at its height, his creative juices a canister of lighter fluid set aflame with genius and innovation. A masterpiece."
"Chris_BS1212","8","5","8","24 April 2010"," Washington is on fire in Scott's best
","Man on Fire has a plot seen before in many, many works of fiction and it's more than likely that if you know the premise then you can give a reasonably accurate prediction of what will happen in this film. However it is rare that it is executed so well, with terrific acting, direction, and characters. Tony Scott's directorial style may well irritate many people, the camera rarely sits still, the angle changes frequently and can be quite disorientating in the action sequences. For that reason Man on Fire is best seen on a big screen, then this problem is pretty much eradicated and you can appreciate how effective his style can be, from making action sequences that bit more visceral to his ingenious use of subtitles that reflect the way the character speaking feels rather than merely giving a translation.<br/><br/>Frequent Tony Scott collaborator Denzel Washington stars as Creasy who has a background in special forces/counter terrorism but when we first meet him he's drinking from a hip flask in the middle of the day. We don't learn much about Creasy's past but we don't need to either the pain and trauma is written all over Washington's face and comes out through his dialogue. Washington is on great on form in this film. Creasy is hired by Sammy, a rich businessman and native of Mexico who has an American wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell), to bodyguard their daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning). The relationship between Pita and her new guardian is the centre of the first half of the film. Great child performances are very rare but surely Dakota Fanning gives one here as the adorable child who shows to Creasy what life should be about.<br/><br/>So when she is kidnapped you know all hell is going to break loose as Creasy goes after her kidnappers like a man possessed. Here, in the second half of the film, Scott delivers some fantastic action sequences and what sets Man on Fire apart from many films is that we as an audience care about Creasy and Pita, they matter to us because Scott took the time to show us in the first act. And the film never loses this heart through all the violence that permeates the second act.<br/><br/>There are strong supporting performances from Radha Mitchell and Christopher Walken too but others such as Marc Anthony and Mickey Rourke are a little flat. With the well honed characters of Pita and Creasy Scott has produced a fantastic revenge thriller, this kind of film doesn't get much better than this."

Well-crafted with a first-rate cast the film holds your interest, but the subject matter turns ugly, the direction borders on pretentious, and the story loses credibility as it nears the finale.

"zkonedog","9","3","4","4 March 2017"," A Story Of Redemption
","In Hollywood, ""redemption"" is a character arc that plays very well in the cinemas. One would be hard-pressed to create a more intense, emotional story of redemption than what can be found in ""Man on Fire"".<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on the character of Creasy (Denzel Washington), an alcoholic with a troubled, violent past. After visiting old buddy Rayburn (Christopher Walken), Creasy gets hooked up as a bodyguard for a family in Mexico City. While at first quite distant, Creasy eventually lets down his stern persona for a bit and forms a relationship with the little girl he is supposed to be protecting, Pita (Dakota Fanning).<br/><br/>If you have seen the movie ""Taken"", then you already have a rough idea of how the plot line goes. Yet, under the direction of Tony Scott, ""Man On Fire"" is actually a better, more intense/emotional film due to its gritty undertones. This is a movie that does not pull any punches, so to speak, when it comes to portraying the kidnappings that so often occur in the big cities of Mexico. It is just a very emotional topic and is nailed so perfectly by Scott.<br/><br/>Of course, the hallmark of this film is its acting from Washington and Fanning. I would argue that Denzel gives his greatest performance EVER, while Fanning (as usual) shows acting talent light- years beyond her age. The way those two characters interact with each other truly carry the emotional burden of the movie and provide the reason to ""care"" about what is going on. Plus, in typical fashion, the fiery side of Washington's acting persona is able to be revealed on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>Thus, I consider ""Man on Fire"" to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is equal parts intense and emotional, and great acting performances abound. It is still difficult for me to believe that this flick was not nominated for any major awards (perhaps the graphic violence had something to do with it), because it would have been very much deserved in the acting, direction, and adapted screenplay categories."
"Eric_Cubed","9","3","4","2 September 2015"," Denzel at his best.
","Tony Scott seemed to live in his brother's shadow, but I don't think he got a fair shake, may he rest in peace. I loved Crimson Tide and I loved Man on Fire. His signature dish, to create fast paced, Kaleidoscopic, intense adventure stories marked by formula, but very much enjoyable. Man on Fire is one of his finest works and he directs Denzel brilliantly. Dakota Fanning is great and totally believable in her role. You like her so much you actually start to like it when Denzel starts cutting off fingers to move up the ""bad guy chain."" We get a sense of a man in despair, burdened down by he demon of alcoholism, a life full of pain and regret, who finally sees one last opportunity at redemption and meaning. Denzel replicates this in The Equalizer, but not quite as awesomely as he does here. He is truly one of our finest actors."
"yvonne-91633","9","3","4","1 April 2015"," A Total Emotional Roller-coaster
","Denzel Washington never disappoints and in this better than average crime thriller, he offers up an outstanding performance as the morbidly depressive, alcoholic, ex CIA assassin, Creasy.<br/><br/>Creasy, a man hell-bent on self destruction, has his heart laid claim to by his employer's young daughter, Pita and her mother Lisa, who touch him as no-one else has been able to for quite some time.<br/><br/>When Creasy feels he has failed to protect his young charge, he sets out on a single handed revenge mission, which takes him far closer to home than he could ever have imagined! I have yet to read the book on which the film was based and I am not even sure that I should, as nothing can really come close to the intensity and emotional connection the film made on me."
"stampede187","8","3","4","30 January 2015"," Denzel and Dakota are truly outstanding
","Sensational. Friendship, love, action, suspense, drama, no holds barred revenge.... this film covers all bases and is a must to watch, especially for Denzel and thriller fans. The film slowly builds from a remarkable bond of friendship, into an adrenaline filled treat.<br/><br/>The main thing in the way of a 10/10 for me was some editing during certain key moments in the film, which luckily take little from the overall entertainment value. There are many twists and turns in the film, some of which are surprising; although some were predictable and there were several loose ends needing to be tied up, such as the fate of the helpful reporter. <br/><br/>These minor gripes can easily be overlooked to enjoy a truly astonishing film."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","3","4","16 January 2009"," Firy Revenge Thriller
","'Man On Fire' starts off as a bodyguard-protecting-a-girl thriller and then in the second hour it switches to a revenge thriller. What really stands out is the technical advancement with which Scott directs his film. Though the plot is by no means perfect (due to derailing, plot holes and far-fetched twists) Scott gets the viewer to just roll along mostly because of the hi-tech camera-work and editing. Also the viewer gets to care for the main character Creasy. Even though his fate and actions are predictable, the viewer is interested in how he goes about it. The flashback scenes within the scenes are well crafted. Visually it is impressive as it reflects the unsympathetic Mexican city and the coldness of the heat. Also Scott uses washed out colours and gives it a yellowy tint to give the violence and tense scenes a stronger effect. Denzel Washington pulls off action brilliantly. At first I was a bit skeptical about watching a movie where he plays a bodyguard but he surprised me. Dakota Fanning is good when she acts like a child but irritating when acting like an adult. Marc Anthony and Mickey Rourke are adequate. Christopher Walken is wasted. Sensual Radha Mitchell definitely looks the part of a hot siren mom. The film is more than two hours long but in the DVD there are a few deleted scenes that give extra insight and more depth to the story. There is an alternative ending but I preferred the one Scott retained in the original movie, which wasn't loud or overdone (as would be expected in Hollywood blockbusters)."

","I genuinely feel this film would have been run of the mill, without Tony Scott's unique blend of purposeful action and gritty cinematography. If you have watched this and the knock off equalizer film, you will know why Scott was as good as he was.<br/><br/>The film itself plays out a lost soul (Washington) remorseful and destroyed by the actions of his past. It takes the lively innocences of a young girl (Fanning) to let him feel human again. When Fanning is kidnapped and Washington is blamed, his past comes back to wreak havoc on the truely guilty parties.<br/><br/>The film plays out an emotional rollercoaster of lies, deceit, destruction and death. Who or what will come out ontop. Certainly worth a watch for any purposeful action lover."

"seymourblack-1","9","4","6","6 April 2017"," The Redemption Of A Lost Soul
","Superficially, this movie is an action-packed tale of betrayals, kidnapping and revenge but it's also a story that features some unexpected twists, some well-drawn characters and a special relationship that contributes to the redemption of a ""lost soul"". Brilliantly written, acted and directed, ""Man On Fire"" is gripping, powerful and surprisingly moving at times and it's these qualities that make it so good and so enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>Ex-CIA operative John Creasy (Denzel Washington) arrives in Mexico City to visit his old comrade-in-arms (and fellow assassin) Paul Rayburn (Christopher Walken) who runs a successful security business and Rayburn puts him in touch with local businessman Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) who wants to hire a bodyguard for his 9-year-old daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning). The burnt-out, depressed and heavily alcohol-dependent Creasy is perfectly open with Ramos about his drink problem but is, nevertheless, promptly hired after a short interview.<br/><br/>The children of wealthy families in Mexico City are prime targets for the organised gangs of kidnappers who seem to operate with impunity and demand huge ransoms for the return of the children. When Creasy carries out his duties, chauffeuring Pita to school etc., she tries to engage him in conversation but he resists, preferring to keep their relationship entirely professional. Over time however, he finds it impossible to remain so impersonal with her and they steadily bond when he coaches her to success in the swimming races that she enters. During this period, Creasy becomes less despondent and even starts to show some positive emotions but this healing period is suddenly brought to an end one day when he and Pita are ambushed and a shoot-out ends with her having been abducted and him having been hospitalised after being shot numerous times.<br/><br/>Miguel Manzano (Giancarlo Gianni), a high-ranking agent in the Mexican Federal Investigation Agency, soon arranges for Creasy to be removed to another location to continue his recuperation because two of the four gang-members that he'd killed during the shoot-out were corrupt cops and attempts to kill him were therefore highly likely. Samuel Ramos' attorney, Jordan Kalfus (Mickey Rourke) then takes a leading role in the arrangements for transferring the $10 million ransom to Pita's kidnappers but during the exchange, the money gets hijacked by another gang called ""La Hermandad"". As a consequence of this, Pita's family are informed by her kidnappers that she's been killed and Creasy immediately decides to take revenge on everyone who was involved in the girl's abduction.<br/><br/>The quality of this movie's screenplay ensures that the action never loses its clarity despite all the complications, corruption and betrayals involved and similar skill is shown in the ways in which various characters are introduced and developed. The dialogue is also equally impressive with numerous lines which instantly seem to become memorable (e.g. ""the bullet always tells the truth"").<br/><br/>Denzel Washington portrays Creasy's despair about things he'd done in the past with tremendous power and credibility and his scenes with Dakota Fanning are terrific. Their exchanges provide some of the movie's best moments not least because of how measured and natural Fanning's performance is. Her present to him of a St Jude (the patron saint of lost causes) medallion is also particularly appropriate and poignant, as is the way in which he obviously values it so highly.<br/><br/>This movie's stunts are spectacular and well choreographed by Director Tony Scott whose visual style so effectively reflects the fractured, damaged and unstable nature of the city in which the story's set. Overall, ""Man On Fire"" entertains so strongly because of its technical brilliance, its screenplay and its great performances."

He finds friendship in the innocence of a child, however, and willingly lays down his life to save her; ""greater love has no one than is..."" It's been done before, but this is quite possibly the best that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The reunion between Creasy (Washington) and Lupita (Fanning) at the end of this movie is, without a doubt, one of those scenes that makes any grown man with a soul and a daughter, niece, or otherwise young lady in his life that he loves dearly, tear up, no matter how thick-skinned he may be. There is no trash-talking, no epic gun-fighting, and no explosions; only a brave man accepting his fate; willingly dying to preserve her life and innocence.<br/><br/>This movie is, easily, a 10/10.

","""A man can be an artist... in anything, food, whatever. It depends on how good he is at it. Creasy's art is death. He's about to paint his masterpiece.""<br/><br/>I don't know what it is about this formulaic revenge film directed by Tony Scott, but I absolutely fell in love with it from the first time I laid my eyes on it. As much as I love Tarantino's script in True Romance, I still consider Man on Fire to be Tony Scott's best film. I'm also a fan of Denzel Washington's work so their collaboration together in this film is probably the main reason why I enjoy it so much. This was their first film together, but they went on to make three more action films after this one which I enjoyed to a lesser degree. Scott's last film, Unstoppable was a pleasant surprise, but they never matched the quality of Man on Fire. I'm probably alone in this claim, considering it wasn't received well by the critics. There are two other performances here that I really enjoyed. Christopher Walken playing Paul Rayburn, one of Creasy's (Denzel Washington) closest friend and Dakota Fanning as Lupita, the girl that Creasy is hired to protect. Fanning gave one of the cutest child performances I've seen and you couldn't help but feel enraged during the scene in which she was kidnapped. That believable performance and the strong chemistry she had built with Washington is one of the main reasons why the familiar revenge tale manages to work so well and engage its audience emotionally. These are the roles in which Denzel seems to excel at, and he recently proved it once again in The Equalizer. Man on Fire is over the top in its portrayal of violence and it's very stylish, but I was always entertained. Well I think I've written enough about this film so I'll be off to Blue Bayou now! <br/><br/>""Forgiveness is between them and God. It's my job to arrange the meeting.""<br/><br/>""Last wish?

Without doubt one of his best performances! His portrayal of Creasy is captivating! Creasy is a complex role with many different sides. He is strong, brave, troubled, vulnerable yet caring man. The development of his character is mesmerizing. Denzel handles it with such ease! The supporting cast is also phenomenal. Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, Dakota Fanning to name but a few all putting in top draw performances. The relationship between Dakota's character and Denzel's makes this film special in my view. Some may call it cliché but I thought it was handled superbly by the actors and Scott's direction. The pacing was perfect. The soundtrack is also brilliant. Shades of ""Gladiator"" in some parts but who cares? It does a great job translating the emotion throughout.<br/><br/>Okay, I won't say to much.

","Man on fire is a movie that shows you what happens to people in the bad parts of Latin American countries. In Latin America, namely Mexico, out of all the people who are kidnapped, 70% of the victims do not survive.

This movie focuses on a man who is hired by a rich family in Mexico to be the bodyguard of their young daughter. But when she gets kidnapped, he goes on a mission to kill everybody who was involved in the kidnapping and try to find her alive and bring her back to her family.

","Every once in a while(about once in a decade) a movie comes along that makes what seem like just another film with car explosions and people getting shot full of holes, like an stinky cheese, turn into an true action epic. I will confess something. Man on Fire made me cry like a little schoolgirl. It's an epic and emotional film, that can't do anything besides growing on you. Denzel plays the tough macho bodyguard alcoholic with a harsh past full of regret and death. His client, Samuel, played by Mark Anthony(a surprisingly very good performance, even though I dislike his music) wants him to protect their daughter, Pita(Dakota Fanning) in the harsh Mexico. While their relationship starts off stiff, Denzel can't do nothing but eventually dry up, to the cute and life-happy Pita. <br/><br/>But as in any good action movie, the bad guys just can't keep their fingers of the cookie jar. The premise or plot Tony Scotts latest, is nothing new or even surprising, but it's incredible powerful execution makes up for it. Harry Greg-Williams amazing score, helps keeping the movie very intense and deep. <br/><br/>This is without a doubt, the best Tony Scott movie ever. With this, he is getting very close to Ridley Scott, who has long mastered the concept of epic films. This is a movie you definitely should be seeing. It has everything you could want. Amazing music, great acting, competent directing and stunning action. <br/><br/>9/10"

","Denzel Washington just can't make a bad movie. There is nothing he has been in that I do not love. No, I am not gay, I just think he is one of the very best. Man on Fire is no exception. The story is been told many times by actors such as Sylvester Stallone or Wesley Snipes or Steven Segal, but no one brings the passion and depth to a character like Washington. A man with nothing left, who can't even believe he can be forgiven for what he has done, sets about to make amends for his sins and restore balance to the world. Denzel does it like no one else can. He is the man! I have to also admit that Dakota Fanning was absolutely adorable in this film, and I haven't seen Rachel Ticotin since Con Air - she played a great supporting role. This is one of those films that do not diminish with re-watching like The Mighty Quinn or Devil in a Blue Dress or The Bone Collector or any other Denzel film you can name."

I was so affected by what happened to her that even when I watched the movie again the next day, I still cried. And not just tears falling, but actually sobbing. This movie made me want to go out and buy or rent every Dakota Fanning movie there is. I only saw this movie lately because I wasn't a big fan of Denzel, but when I learned Dakota was in it, I finally decided to watch it. And I'm very glad I did."

And Denzel was great with his Sad Bear Eyes. :) And I'm looking for a soundtrack, cause I really like ""Una Palabra"" and ""Mas"". There are some parts I didn't like, like The Breaking Fingers Scene or the fast exchanging scenes. It's predictable to some point, but aren't almost all movies lately?

","A shifty script and style overkill drowns this over-the-top kidnapping story. <br/><br/>Denzel Washington stars as Creasy, an alcoholic former Marine predictably haunted by the past who reluctantly accepts a job in Mexico City as bodyguard to a little girl named Pita (Dakota Fanning).<br/><br/>
The first half of the movie, which is about Pita gradually drawing Creasy out of his shell, is ok. Washington is his old reliable self and Fanning once again proves to be one of the best child actors working.<br/><br/>
Then, Pita is kidnapped and apparently killed. Creasy swears to the family that he'll kill everyone responsible. Fun! <br/><br/>Director Tony Scott has two great movies under his belt (1992's ""True Romance"" and 1995's ""Crimson Tide""), but this film goes on the pile of his other style-over-substance movies. <br/><br/>In ""Man On Fire"" Scott experiments with all sorts of crazy film and sound techniques (even the subtitles don't stand still), which is pretty cool for about 30 minutes. After that, it feels annoying and manipulative, because it's obviously just there to distract from the very ordinary story.<br/><br/>
What's most troubling is the fact that Creasy's character goes from being a human being in the first half to being a sadistic vengeance machine out of a Chuck Norris movie in the second. If it was a good movie, it might examine what makes Creasy nearly as ruthless and vicious as the people he's after, but instead it just paints him as some sort of big, cuddly, moral hero. We're supposed to love him because he reads the Bible and because Pita names her teddy bear after him (aww!). Probably a good thing she can't see her Creasy-bear cutting off fingers, ears, and blowing people up.<br/><br/>
It's not a terrible movie - the acting is pretty good, and the cinematography is good when the editors aren't trying to give you an epileptic seizure. But this is an overlong and brutal movie (that fails to examine its brutality) and it leaves a sour taste in your mouth, no matter how much they try to cover it up with ""Gladiator""-style singing on the soundtrack."

Once he's assigned to protect young Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, his emotional and redemptive arc is jump-started in the way only an adorable little girl can provide.

Pita changes the behavior of the cold Creasy, making him live and smile again, and he feels a great affection for her.

The cast is composed by excellent actors and actresses, their performances are outstanding, highlighting Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. The cinematography has wonderful moments, and the screenplay has stunning lines. I personally loved when the character of Christopher Walken explains to Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) that Creasey's specialty is death, and he is preparing his masterpiece.

","""Man on Fire"" is a hard movie to like. It is also a hard movie not to like. It could be said that it's three movies in one. The first third of the film is a basic ""getting to know you"" type of movie wherein Denzel Washington's character is hired to be a bodyguard to Dakota Fanning's character. This works well, as he grudgingly becomes her friend as well as her bodyguard. The second part of the film is about her kidnapping and his attempts to find her. It's in this section that the movie goes haywire. You tend to feel, with all the camera tricks, captions with a mind of their own, and jerky, over-the-top direction, that the director was trying to obscure the fact that he didn't know how to tell the story in this part of the movie. He calls attention to himself much too often. Plus, this middle part of the film resembles a Charles Bronson ""Death Wish"" type of movie, about a character bent on revenge, more than anything else, which drags the movie down. The final third of the film is more of a mix of the first two parts. Some good moments, some not so good. There was a lot of work put into this movie. When it works, it works well, and when it doesn't work, it doesn't work at all. It would've been better without all the technical wizardry and just told the story."

The makers miserably failed in copying such fatastic films as City of god and Ammores Perros with its documentary style hand held camera work. This style did not gel with the story. The movie attempted to be Mel Gibson's Ransom and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Collateral Damage at the same time. The contrast was so apparent that the movie could have easily been split into two equally turd-like motion pictures. I can accept that some people may have enjoyed this ""movie"" but it is not acceptable for me to betray my movie-going honor by saying Man on Fire had potential.

In previous movies, he plays the well respected good guy and receives very little attention from the media, but in this movie and in Training Day, he has to change his way of doing business and give in to what our society expects from a black actor. I feel as if I'm watching an old episode of NYPD Blue, camera moving around wildly, making you feel as if you've been drinking. The cameraman who filmed this movie must have drank way too much coffee, the camera moves around wildly giving me, the viewer, a headache.

""Man of Fire"" is close to 2 hours and half when it really should have been at least an hour less.<br/><br/>The way Scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you (the audience) to sit through his film because his constant camera moves and flashes really are a torture for the eye and makes you wanna leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes into it.<br/><br/>At times where the MPAA and studios have questionable attitudes regarding ratings, violence and making PG-13 movies, I find also suspicious that a $70 million movie is made of a B-movie script with a character who cuts fingers, puts a bomb in a man's ass and blows a guy's hand with a shotgun, all this to avenge the death of a little girl who ISN'T even dead!

"rmax304823","5","6","11","8 April 2012"," Rescue From Mexican Kidnappers.
","This begins as an interesting, if not particularly original, story of character development -- the increasing bond between disillusioned body guard Denzel Washington and the artless innocence and open warmth of little Dakota Fanning as the daughter of a very wealthy couple in Mexico City.<br/><br/>I said it was unoriginal because, after the opening scenes, the viewer begins to anticipate the plot. The depressed Washington rejects Fanning's offer of friendship. He tries to shoot himself but fails. Fanning will be kidnapped. There will be some rough detective work in the neighborhoods outside the Pink Zone. Washington will be instrumental in the rescue of Fanning. He will no longer be disillusioned. Justice and happiness and blue skies.<br/><br/>But then it begins to look more interesting because it appears that after the kidnapping and the pay off go awry, Washington is shot almost mortally and Fanning is apparently killed by the kidnappers.<br/><br/>After that it goes completely off the rails. Under Dakota Fanning's guidance, Washington seems to have recovered his self confidence and his religious beliefs. He reads the Bible and fondles the St. Jude medal she's given him. But this is all narrative froth, because Washington's character then descends into torture porn. Informed that Fanning is no longer with us, Washington is asked what he's going to do now. ""I'm going to do what I do best -- kill 'em."" And he does. He cuts off fingers one at a time, shoots off an entire hand, plugs unarmed people through the feet, shoves a bomb up their rear ends and lets them explode, blows them apart with an RPG. This is religion? Whatever is left of the story is effectively ruined by directorial and editing excess. The director was Tony Scott and the editor was Christian Wagner. They do to the images what Washington does to his bound captives. There are lighting-fast cuts, negative shots, zooms, yo-yoing, slow motion, step motion, and fast motion in which people walk around like Charlie Chaplin. It's not just that the overuse of these techniques is distracting. They interfere with our ability to understand what's going on -- who's where, what time it is, elementary things like that.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is okay, not much more than that. He doesn't have a great deal of range as an actor, though he's likable enough. Christopher Walken in a minor part excels, as usual, and Dakota Fanning gives what is probably the best performance in the film. She's ""cute,"" but not the kind of ""cute"" that will enable her to sail through adolescence. She's not sexy like Jody Foster and not sublimely gorgeous like the young Brooke Shields. She's an exceptional actress however. Every line sounds believable.<br/><br/>I don't know about anyone else but all this busyness on the screen leaves me disaffected. I don't know how long that fad is going to last but I suspect that, sooner or later, a generation will watch these old movies and be as irritated as I am. I really don't need constant flashes of lightning in front of me, as if the whole movie were a thirty-second television commercial, because I am more than ten years old."

","Few people can refute Tony Scott's previous box office successes (""Top Gun"", ""Crimson Tide""). Armed with such clout, he surely can saunter in to a pre-production meeting and get virtually any tool he needs to craft his latest ""masterpiece"". ""Man on Fire"" is evidence of such power being abused. Like a child who gets everything he wants, Scott's film turns out just plain rotten. Unfortunately, the audiences who have to endure this latest display of of cinematic spoil are left with the dubious duty of shelling out their hard-earned money to try to follow the scent of this tripe.<br/><br/>And tripe it is.<br/><br/>While the plot (re-hashed from a previous version of the movie) is compelling, Scott ruins his version with his ""look ma, no hands"" jerky camera work, flashbacks, multiple-exposures, frame-dropping, color timing on an acid trip, simulated under/over-cranking etc. etc. etc. His extreme heavy-handed direction not only detracts from the possibility of audiences enjoying the movie, but disables the average viewer from even digesting enough information to follow major scenes.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington delivers a compelling performance as man out for revenge, what parts can be seen between the directorial smoke and mirrors. But while ""Crimson Tide"" explores the mental limits of a man with the power to launch Polaris missiles, in ""Man on Fire"", Washington spends most of the movie spreading his hate in any direction he can aim a shotgun. <br/><br/>Thus, he ends up being is a hood ornament on Scott's freight train as it plummets off a cliff.<br/><br/>""Man on Fire""? If that man is Tony Scott, pass me the marshmallows."

","Man On Fire has a lot of potential, but it was serious letdown. This movie is based on today's oh so popular movie theme: Revenge.<br/><br/>Where to start? Well, the story is acceptable. Washington plays Creasy, an aging war retiree. He travels to Mexico, where rich families are victims of getting their children kidnapped, as the captors release their kids under a high ransom. Creasy protects Fanning's character, Pita. Pita eventually gets captured-Oh No!- and Creasy goes on a killing spree, trying to find her. And there's still 3/4 of the movie to go.<br/><br/>This movie has an acceptable story, but not so great of a cast. This is another Denzel against the world film. If you've seen John Q and Remember The Titans, you'll probably agree. Denzel is suitable for his role. Fanning isn't in the movie much, but the acting she did was overall good. Casting Radha Mitchell was a horrible mistake. She isn't a good actress and lets not forget her changing her accents. Midwest? Southern? Pick one! Worst of all is when she changes her accent in the same scene.<br/><br/>This movie is a little excessive with the violence. There is graphic torture, which isn't in the least bit fun to watch. There are situations where blood is needed, and there are some where it isn't needed. This movie crossed that line.<br/><br/>Creasy is supposed to be this professional superstar at killing. When he's hunting for Pita, he really has no concern for things like innocent bystanders and evidence as he carelessly bombed buildings and explodes people. There's a scene where he ties a man to his car, with a bomb set to go off. The director was crazy enough to put a timer at the bottom corner of the screen...Overall, this is a bad movie."

"bob the moo","Null","8","17","17 October 2004"," An overdose of visual style from Scott and solid turns from the stars don't manage to cover the flaws in this overlong and run-of-the-mill thriller
","Heavily drinking and suffering from guilt over his past, former Marine Creasy arrives in Mexico City to take a job of low rent bodyguard from his friend Rayburn. Creasy's assignment is to look after the daughter of a troubled young businessman, ensuring that Pita is protected from kidnapping attempts. Initially cold to her, Creasy warms to his young ward and in turn she helps him rediscover his passion for life. However when he is badly wounded and Pita kidnapped, Creasy reacts with violent retribution, aiming to bring down the gang of kidnappers from the littlest fish to the top man.<br/><br/>The trailer for this film was enough to make sure that I was interested  the intensive visual style and the tough talk and walk were enough to cover the nagging thoughts that I had basically been told the whole (very simple) plot in about 3 minutes. The strengths of the trailer cover the weaknesses of the film when they are presented in a very short time but the problem with the actual film is that it takes the same approach as the trailer did  ie entice the audience with a different and energetic visual style, along with tough talking and tough walking and hope that they will be so won over by these that they won't notice that the film is actually fairly average in almost every other aspect. The biggest failing is in the plot and the substance of the film as it never really does anything that is unpredictable and it is all rather workmanlike at times. The plot is a standard revenge film but it is rather full of itself and runs far too long to really suit the material  this stuff should be shorter and more brutal instead of being overly long. The running time is a problem because it does feel too long quite a few times but it wouldn't have been if the material had been there to carry it.<br/><br/>Sadly the script doesn't do anything new. We expect Creasy and Pita to warm to one another and indeed they do  not with any touching or moving moments but with obvious moves. The ending is quite touching but by then it is too little too late and the film mainly just threads the line of least resistance with an obvious script. This trend continues in the actual plot, which takes too long to get to the action and then takes too long in delivering it. It is enjoyable to see such brutal violence in such a mainstream movie but Creasy's sudden transformation from flawed human being into near indestructible killing machine is a bit too much to swallow and misses the chance to be a more interesting revenge movie than it ultimately was.<br/><br/>Of course the film does everything it can to try and distract us from the fact that this is an ordinary story by delivering it with all the energy of a child with a load of sugar in it. Scott blurs the shot, jerks it around, uses slow-mo, fades colours, everything  I didn't see it but I did get the feeling that somewhere in there was a kitchen sink. This is not a major problem because it was nice to watch and had plenty of nice touches (the subtitles appearing in rhythm or lingering on the screen) but without substance to back it up then it does feel pretty empty at times. Likewise the cast all try very hard but none of them really have much to work with. Washington rises to the harder role and seems to be looking for darker stuff since his Oscar for Training Day. He is always watchable but he never really makes the role his own or gets to the core of his character (only having Lethal Weapon-style drunken brooding to convey hidden depths). Fanning had the potential to be an annoyingly cute kid but she is better than that and she has a nice chemistry with Washington that makes us feel for her character rather than pray for her kidnapping (which I have done with other child performances). Support is not as good, mainly because they have as little to work with as the lead two but less time to make a mark. Walken is a nice addition but his presence is only a side-issue, which, funnily enough, is what Rourke seems to aspire to in a role that gives him so little screen time that you assume he is a larger character in the story than he appears to be (I don't consider a statement this obvious to be a spoiler!). The rest are OK with good turns from Giannini and Ticotin in thankless characters and a solid job from Mitchell.<br/><br/>Overall this is a very average film that tries as hard as it can to hide this fact for as long as it can. Visually it is impressive but the lack of heart or substance rather detracts from Scott's work  making it come across as noise without content. The cast also try hard and a couple manage to do well even if they have little but the basics to work with. Sadly the running time exposes how empty the film is and soon even the intense visual style of the film became a bit tiresome. Not an awful film by any means but simply an average affair that tries to cover it by overdoing it in other areas where really it would have been better to concentrate on improving the weak areas instead of trying to cover them."
"gregsrants","6","6","12","25 April 2004"," Good Saturday afternoon fair even if overlong
","Looking back on Tony Scott's career you see a plethora of movies that seemed destined for Saturday afternoon television.  Days of Thunder, The Last Boy Scout, The Fan.all were movies that appealed to the testosterone full male audience while managing to do so-so at the box office.   Over the past twenty years, Scott has had the privilege of working with some of Hollywood's elite including Gene Hackman (twice), Tom Cruise (twice), Brad Pitt (twice) and now, with his new film Man on Fire, Denzel Washington has appeared in front of the camera two times for Ridley's younger brother. <br/><br/>
With Man on Fire, Denzel goes back to where he is probably most comfortable in the role of a justice seeking authority figure.  This marks the 10th time that Denzel has played the role of a cop or soldier out for revenge or retribution dating back to 1989's The Mighty Quinn.  This in no way suggests that Denzel has not expanded his acting range since he bolted from St. Elsewhere on television in 1982.  His turns in Glory, Malcolm X and The Hurricane shows just how versatile the actor can be and his five Academy Award nominations and two wins are testament to his tinsel town legacy. <br/><br/>
But I beg to ask why when the script of Man on Fire came across his nightstand, did he jump back into a protector's role that he has done time and time again.  Maybe Tony Scott runs a fun shoot.  Maybe Denzel wanted to get a chance to star alongside Christopher Walken or maybe DW just wanted to spend a few months in Mexico.  No matter the reason, Man on Fire is exactly what you would expect from the same two people who brought us Crimson Tide. And in short, that's too bad.<br/><br/>Man on Fire is set in Mexico and surrounds the kidnapping of a wealthy family's daughter.  Denzel known only as Creasy, is the alcoholic bodyguard who is entrusted with her safety and loses her in a dramatic street gunfight that leaves him with multiple bullet holes.  After a remarkable recovery, Creasy is up and back on the assignment gunning down, blowing up and shooting just about everyone in Mexico that ever looked funny at his young victim.  <br/><br/>As Creasy gets deeper and deeper into the individual cells responsible for the kidnapping, the local police play piggy-back and watch silently as Creasy unravels department corruption, a father's desperate scheme to get out of debt and finally the unveiling of the ringleader of the rash of kidnappings in the country known only to authorities as The Voice'.  <br/><br/>
At a whopping 146 minutes, Man on Fire is about 45 minutes too long for a film of this genre.  It takes nearly an hour before the kidnapping takes place and I was left with a feeling that Tony Scott was unsure of himself and didn't know how to relate to the audience an emotional attachment between Denzel and the young Dakota Fanning.  As a result of this unassurance, we have to spend time with the two in overdrawn scenes including swimming lessons, homework assignments and multiple car rides where the two would talk and argue about things non-relevant to the overall plot.   As trailers revealed a kidnapping plot, as a paying customer, I became antsy an hour into the film and just wanted things to finally play out their course.  <br/><br/>Also a nuisance was the various styles that Scott tries to incorporate into the film.  He uses various film stock, sub titles that appear anywhere except the bottom of the screen and multiple editing cuts and close-ups that frankly just don't work when combined together over the duration of the running time.  Maybe we should all sign a petition and force Scott to see Steven Soderbergh's Traffic so that he could take notes on how to effectively use these different methods to bring a feel to the film without making us as nauseous as the tea cup ride at an amusement park. <br/><br/>
And really, it's too bad that this project fails on these levels.  Denzel, Walken and Fanning all give exceptional performances, and I won't go as far as to say they were wasted, but the potential to make something extraordinary was hidden deep in the script and I wonder aloud what a directorial change might have done to recognize this fact. <br/><br/>
The violence too is unique in its own right.  A scene involving fingers and a car lighter brought back memories of the torture scene in Reservoir Dogs. Another scene involving an explosive butt plug is also something I had not seen before and considering the rash amount of action films that get released every year, that is saying a lot.  <br/><br/>So I guess I give Man on Fire its chops for attempting to be something different albeit its shortcomings are clearly evident.  This is one of those movies that sits on the fence of being a recommendation or a pan, but then I thought that when I see the commercials for `Coming soon to TBS this Saturday afternoon', I have to admit that I will probably be tuning in. <br/><br/>

","Man on Fire (2004) <br/><br/>Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Radha Mitchell, Christopher Walken, Marc Anthony, Giancarlo Giannini, Mickey Rourke, Gustavo Sanchez Parra. Directed by Tony Scott.<br/><br/>Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Former Marine/CIA operative and depressed alcoholic John Creasy is sent to Mexico to help protect the daughter of an industrialist after a series of kidnappings occur in Mexico City. At first Creasy just wants to do stick to his job and nothing else, but he slow starts to befriend young Pita. Pita is suddenly kidnapped out of nowhere and Creasy is badly wounded, but he vows revenge on those who took her and anyone who gets in his way.<br/><br/>'Man on Fire' really could have been another typical, dumbed-down thriller, but it ends up being intense and very different from most in some areas. The plot of course does not sound original at all, and it isn't, but the directing and editing are the main parts that are different.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is simply amazing in his role  he actually gives one of his very best here. I wasn't too big on 'John Q', but I still thought he did great in that film as well and saved it from being below average, and that convinces me that Washington is still one of the best actors working today. Dakota Fanning is very good for her age as Pita, and I think she will probably go on to a higher acting career, as she gets older. The rest of the supporting cast is pretty good too, for those whose faces are familiar.<br/><br/>The real only main flaw here is too much of Scott's visual style running wild. The editing and camera work do get very irritating after a while, though they do work strong in some scenes. I really expected this to be a typical Michael Bay-like blockbuster, but I actually think of it as one of the most underrated films of 2004, and it definitely works as both an action film and a character study. 4 stars out of 5."

","Nothing to like in this one, except for 'the Walken'.  Soundtrack is terrible, doesn't fit the movie.  Editing is horrendous.  Attempt at style in camera work was often laughable.  You cant tint an entire movie blue and pass it off as style.  Subtitles flying in from all over the place, appearing at the top of the screen, and letters disappearing on their own free will was really distracting.  Might as well have casted Vin Diesel in this one.  Denzel's performance was forgettable, and the entire movie played like XXX.  I was skeptical of another 2.5 hour Tony Scott action movie, and rightly so.  This movie offered one of the funniest lines ever though, ""Creasy's art is death, and he's about to paint his masterpiece."""

","Trust me, this is one let down movie that you want to avoid and this comes from one huge Denzel Washington fan.  The frustrating part is that it's 1/3 of a GREAT film.  The first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl he's paid to protect.  The trailers to this movie all mention that she is kidnapped.  So, I'm giving nothing away when I say that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess after she's kidnapped. Whatever the director was trying to accomplish, all he succeeds in doing is making the audience literally nauseous.  Rapid, frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half-hour as Creasy tracks down the perpetrators.  These cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is to jolt you out of the story. I'm sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story signified a change in Creasy's character and signified that a different movie was to follow.  Well, he was right.  The movie that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap.  The result of which is a depressing ending that ruins even the quality first forty minutes of the movie."

","Man On Fire has the style of Oliver Stone on a bad day. In fact, it has the style of a 2 minute trailer. If they re-edited this and toned down the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, this would be a great movie. I'm not saying get rid of all of it, because some of it was effective, but A LOT of it was not needed.<br/><br/>As far as story goes, it was very good. Creasy is the familiar kind of character who is in dire need of redemption, and he receives it from an unlikely person: the child he's been hired to protect, Pita. Their relationship takes a good half hour or so (movie time wise) to develop, so it makes it all the more painful once she's kidnapped and supposedly killed. Of course, I don't think anyone in the audience really believes she's dead. In fact, I would have been more surprised if she actually was. Fortunately there were plenty of twists and turns along the way that made me forgive this predictability.<br/><br/>The movie does a good job of making you care for the characters, but that probably is mostly because of the script and acting, not Tony Scott's hack directing. Denzel Washington gives a wonderfully intense performance as the man on fire, and everyone's favourite lil' child actor Dakota Fanning does a good job of just doing what she's supposed to with her role. She's supposed to be a cute little girl that is instantly lovable and she's able to do it effortlessly because, well, she's Dakota Fanning.<br/><br/>Man On Fire is just about 2 and a half hours long and it kept my interest all the way through. The interest wasn't always positive since I had to roll my eyes every 5 minutes at the nausea-inducing editing. It took away so much!

Great acting by both, and Fanning in particular: she can pull off cute without being schmaltzy or annoying, whilst also coming across as genuine. A big future awaits... However, from the turning point half way through it descends into formulaic Hollywood 'must kill the nasty Mexicans!' revenge stuff, and has been done better in other films.

","I looked forward to seeing this movie because of Washington's great performances in most of his other works. However, my eagerness was dampened early on, not so much by the performances, but by the visual component. This movie made almost incessant use of special effect zoom-ins and -outs. Visually the story was buried in this. I was quickly irritated by this from the outset, and felt like changing DVDs. But because I had just plunked down hard cash for it, I endured it a little longer. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and didn't watch the rest. They used effects like this in Enemy of the State, but with great restraint, mostly when they showed the satellite zooming in on two main characters as they tracked them. But here it was overburdening. This factor alone made it, in my mind, one of the worst films I've ever seen. As for the acting, Washington, with his clean-cut looks and ways, just wasn't convincing as a drunk. His overall performance was less than stellar as well, as was, I felt, everyone else's. For me, a clear Thumbs Down! I'm only surprised at how many IMDb respondents actually thought highly of this trash. This is artistic cinema?"
"dbdumonteil","3","8","20","22 August 2006"," too much fire kills it
","In 1987, Quinnell's book was adapted for the silver screen by Elie Chouraqui, a minor director, responsible of ""Paroles et Musique"" (1984) and ""les Marmottes"" (1993). This version was not a masterpiece and is now virtually in limbo. Unfortunately, it's not this overlong remake by Tony Scott which will set the record straight.<br/><br/>Leaving Italy for Mexico, ""Man on Fire"" is split in two drastically different but globally weak halves. The first one deals with Creasy (Denzel Washington) who is hired as a bodyguard in a well-off Mexican family to protect a little girl named Pita (Dakota Fanning). He's a man with a sad past and a strong bias for alcohol. Maybe will he find solace and redemption thanks to the Holy Bible. Ouch! How original. Actually, this first part piles up the clichés linked to Crasy but also to the unlikely friendship he stroked up with his little protégée. First, sullen and distant and then friendly, he has found a way to approach her by developing in her assertion and setting new targets for herself thanks to a swimming competition. But the evolution of his demeanor and especially his liking towards the little girl is showed in a quite shallow way to be really conclusive.<br/><br/>Now, what about this second part? It completely changes the tone of the film which takes a leap into explosive violence and linear investigation. After his coma, Creasy turns into a real killing machine who exterminates all the ones who were involved in the abduction of Pita. Blood abundantly flows, explosions succeed themselves with stunts and knock-out images galore. Scott and his scenarist Brian Helgeland also felt compelled to include sequences which shelter free violence. One of them was influenced by Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992). It's the sequence in which Washinton is with one of the kidnappers in a car and tortures him to make him speak with loud music on the radio. But in parallel not to stay confined in this assumed perspective, Helgeland tried to introduce twists to boost the interest of the viewer in Creasy's vengeful adventure. Thus, in the middle of this second part, we learn a far-fetched revelation whose nature makes a little think of ""Fargo"" (1996) by the Coen brothers.<br/><br/>The content of the film is made of thin substance and is still plagued by the flashy form. Scott didn't jettison his trademark which mar his efforts. His visual, sound excesses that are supposed to impress and gain the audience's approval make the film distressing to watch in the long run. Hyper images, sophisticated camera work, sharp editing are supposed to be here to compensate the weak potential of the story and it only helps to plague it. Worse: these features sometimes arrive at the most awkward moment in the story and action. Then, the soundtrack is extremely loud and mixed forward. Sometimes, you have to listen very closely to decipher what the characters say. This drawback is more irritating in the second half. ""Man on Fire"" is also ruined by an ugly cinematography. What's the consequence of all this? A large proportion of shots are distorted by one or the other of these drawbacks.<br/><br/>Overrall the other directions that the scenario could have taken to enable the film to take a subtle, rich dimension have been shelved or lightly touched. For instance, the major problem of these abductions of children in Latin America falls in the second category. Instead, Helgeland created a linear, stubborn revenge story which Scott filmed with a festival of shock images and by this ruined the reduced potential of the story.<br/><br/>Even the direction of actors seems absent. Denzel Washington who is a commendable actor is here unable to shade his acting. Christopher Walken, a big American actor isn't given a chance to shine and his part is blatantly underwritten. But the little Dakota Fanning which Sean Penn's fans discovered in ""I Am Sam"" (2001) gives a quite mature offering.<br/><br/>On its release, ""Man on Fire"" was made alluring through an eye-catching cover but this blazing film left me cold. As a scenarist, Brian Helgeland saw brighter days before: ""L.A. Confidential"" (1997), ""grandad"" Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" (2003)..."

","For anyone who is familiar with the series of novels by A.J. Quinnell about John Creasy, ex French Foreign Legionnaire, this movie will be a big disappointment. Man On Fire, the first novel in the series, is set in Italy and the bad guys are mafiosi who kidnap and kill the girl who Creasy was hired to protect. Where the novel is exciting and credible, the movie is not. Obviously, Denzel Washington was available to star in a movie, and Hollywood, in typical fashion, looked for a good story which could be butchered to fit the actor.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother - read the book! If you want to see the movie, rent the 1987 version of Man On Fire. It's not great but it is more faithful to the novel."

I would love to tell everyone the ending, so nobody else would waste their money to watch this movie, but I walked out with about 20 minutes to go because I became so frustrated with it.  It was the single most boring ""action"" movie I've ever seen.  It may have been 2 and a half hours, but the 2 hours I spent watching it felt like about 4 or 5.  It was incredibly slow-moving and, as I've previously mentioned, the directing of this movie was awful, and that's putting it politely.  If it wasn't for the name ""Denzel Washington"", no one would have even given this movie a chance.  The director tries too hard to make this picture ""artsy"" and he fails... miserably.

"stinkerxD","7","2","3","4 July 2018"," A watchable early 2000's action drama
","Man on Fire starts with a 5 minute in your face edit of a man being kidnapped and the steps taken to get him released. I feel it was supposed to be set up for the inevitable scene where are main characters would have to do the same. But this scene actually alleviates the tension from the film because it practically shows the basic structure for the entire movies finale. This sequence as well gives you a taste of the very quick cutting edits that City of God popularized around the time this film was made, but the execution of these edits in Man on Fire just tend to be annoying and makes it difficult at times to fully grasp what's happening as flashback sequences and the scenes taking place in the present are shot, colored, and edited in the exact same way as these flashbacks.
The characters in Man on Fire is what makes this movie watchable, and I would even go as far to say that the first hour of this film was very well done. As you watch this young girl and her body guard interact as a business relationship that eventually grows into a friendship (as cliche and predictable as it might be) is actually quite entertaining to watch. It's only once the inevitable kidnapping and revenge story began that this film began to go downhill. 
So in conclusion, Man on Fire is a watchable film that has a strong first act but a weak second. And although its in your face editing style becomes obnoxious at times, and the story is rather predicatable and cliche, the characters make it worth a viewing."

","Man on Fire is an action thriller that is based on A. J. Quinnell's 1980 novel of the same title.It stars Denzel Washington as John Creasy, a despondent former CIA operative/Force Recon Marine officer turned bodyguard, who goes on a revenge rampage after his charge, nine-year-old Pita Ramos is abducted in Mexico. Among the supporting cast includes Christopher Walken, Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke.This adaptation was directed by Tony Scott, from a screenplay written by Brian Helgeland.<br/><br/>John Creasy, a burned-out former CIA operative and assassin, is slowly killing himself with the bottle. Still, when another fellow retired spook recruits him for a bodyguard job, he reluctantly accepts. A Mexican industrialist, Samuel Ramos and his wife Lisa are parents of Creasy's 9-year-old charge, Pita.When Creasy arrives on the scene, people are in a panic in Mexico City, where 24 abductions have occurred in just one six-day period, 70 percent of them resulting in the murder of the victim.Ramos is going through a financial crisis, and can't afford regular bodyguards. So he hires Creasy at a discount, because despite his impressive resume, it's clear that the man is a drunk. <br/><br/>The first part is all about redemption. In it,we see Creasy is the typical world-weary cynic who wants no complications in life. He just wants to do his job and be left alone.Then slowly, bit by bit, he's won over by the sparkly, bright-eyed optimism of his charming young charge as their friendship starts. One has probably seen this type of movie before especially made by child stars.<br/><br/>The second is extremely violent and it's all about revenge. It all becomes tedious after a while because you know the little girl is going to be kidnapped, you just don't know when. Now the film turns into a violent action film as revenge becomes the central character. Creasy nearly dies during the kidnapping, but when he recovers he hooks up with a Mexico City newspaper reporter and a former head of Interpol, who give him the inside information he needs to track down the organized gang behind the kidnappings.Basically what they're doing is helping a vigilante who can kill at will and not have to worry about the niceties of Mexican law.This part is characterized by flashy camera moves and the style and pace that director Tony Scott is known for in his movies like Spy Game,Enemy Of The State and Top Gun as he pull out all the stops using multiple hand-held cameras, different film stocks, slash edits, and even a hand-cranked camera at times to slow down or speed up the movement.It's also got all the Scott touches as he fills the screen with lots of blood 'n' guts action accompanied by gigantic explosions which are all wonderfully photographed.<br/><br/>Obviously,Denzel Washington delivers in terms of quality acting as we are absorbed by his character and we are left to believe that the relationship he slowly develops with the young Mexico City girl he's hired to protect. But then the strong opening levels out into a long series of action scenes, and the double-reverse ending works more like a gimmick than a resolution. In summary,both parts stand up well on their own, but a person who wants to see one kind of movie may not like the other feeling Man Of Fire is two different movies that is suited for two types of audiences."

","Leave your reason behind and get carried away by this relentless movie of another ""justice whatever the cost"" ""enforcer"", but this time, well filmed, acted, and with a woman that can hold a gun. And without any unnecessary ""love interest"". Which was your favourite scene? Mine was the moment before ""crossing the bridge"" near the end *(can't say more for obvious reasons). Like in Gladiator, but probably creating far better empathy for it's more related to ""something we could all eventually do"". The scene with ""Fuentes"" (the Mexican chief of the brotherhood) is also very good, even funny in a sick sort of way. The kind of image you remember long after the film is gone. The script is perfect, just following Poe's ""rule"" of ""not one word in vain"". Thanks to Amazon I just learnt the auteur is Brian Helgeland (Mystic River, L.A. Confidential). A good story can make or break a movie, no better proof than this one! Unlike in Gladiator, here our hero has a black past to expiate, no family to be lost and then revenged. He's got to overcome himself. As the film presupposes a religious view, we sort of know how things have to turn out. Notice the importance of religion: Casey's knowledge by heart of the Bible, and even Samuel's plush sanctuary at his home, full of candles, obviously built for bargaining with the Guadalupana Virgin.<br/><br/>The fight at the shanty town is VERY real. The film is not (where did all the dwellers go? How did the dirty copper get caught by a single man?) but we don't want "" reality principle"" to be part of our films, right :)? Characters: Casey, a ""philosophical copper"" who can learn to feel sorry for something external to himself steals the movie, the rest of characters are just filling up space, making things happen. He's no dumb killing machine, notice how he deals with ""Samuel"" among others. G. Giannini plays a small yet pivotal role. Pita is lovable, but doesn't overdo it or get sticky. Such gift for acting is rarely seen. Lisa is ethereal but not as stupid as we'd expect from her stereotyped role. Walken and Rourke act as naturally as we breathe. <br/><br/>""Sociology"": Daniel Sanchez ""family first"", Lisa's passivity & machismo and the whole contrast between the isolated ultra rich and the numerous very poor is what sets this film apart from Chuck Norris, Stallone, Van Damme and all the other blockbusters with the same disregard for ""society"" and good taste. The phrase: ""I-I'm a professional"" shows how when the system is corrupt, no individual action could bring lasting change. I think for those of us who inhabit a third world country, this film just shows the future, if not the present if we open our eyes.<br/><br/>Director: Judging from his filmography, this is definitely Tony Scott's Masterpiece! It's hard to believe somebody who made films from Spy Game downwards could achieve something really well done but it's good to remain open minded. Luckily I didn't pay attention to who the director was when I saw it, I humbly recommend the viewer to to the same. I suspect the brothers mustn't be very nice people ""Philosophically"" this film is of course dangerous: ""Justice by your own hands"" leads to an anomic society, and probably even a corrupt state is relatively better than ""might makes right"" alla Thrasymachus (Plato's Republic's). Jeff Shannon on Amazon is as usually accurate: ""both repellently violent and viscerally absorbing"". What glues all together: Music is fine (I couldn't help crying in the end), moving but not overbearing. Photography is just the best, finding beauty where there is none. Edition is alluring but a bit overdone, ""it borrows heavily from MTV videos"" as ""Flagrant-Baronessa"" on IMDb writes on another of Tony's lesser films, ""Domino"".<br/><br/>Remember: ""there's no such thing as tough"". <br/><br/>The sheep that got lost.<br/><br/>PS: By the way, this film ""endures a 2nd viewing"" as J. L. Borges would quip. In fact I just saw it for the third time on air TV, dubbed into Spanish, and I also felt for Casey, so I guess this proves what a good product it is."

","This movie is not for the queasy among us. There is quite a bit of violence in this picture - hence the R rating.<br/><br/>I'm typically not a fan of movies that overdo violence - but make an exception if it is tied to a good story that seems to justify such a harsh reaction. Usually the way a movie gets the viewers sympathies is to tie it to an injustice to a child. Who among us doesn't detest the harming of a child. (In this case, I find it similar to another Denzel film, JOHN Q)<br/><br/>Add to that a sympathetic anti-hero. A former special ops assassin in the character of John Creasy, played so beautifully by Denzel Washington. He has done such horrible things in his past that he resorts to drinking excessively to be able to live with himself. He takes the job as Pita's bodyguard almost unwillingly, but soon grows fond of her, in spite of his best efforts to remain detached. He is devastated when he fails to protect her and determines to seek revenge on all involved - and to at last redeem himself from his failures. Denzel has a unique ability to gain audience sympathies - he is the quintessential ""everyman"" that we all can relate to. I'm not sure Tom Cruise or Bruce Willis ( all considered for the role) could have accomplished this nearly as successfully.<br/><br/>I have to say the director did an amazing job of capturing the mood and atmosphere of the story and the time and the place. What stands out most is the cinematography that utilizes the hyper camera work - with the shaky, hand-held shots and the jumping cuts and editing. It keeps you on guard and not knowing what is going to happen next. It frames a world that is out of control and you feel it.<br/><br/>I loved some of the dialogue and there are some great one-liners in this film: ""A bullet never lies - it always tells the truth""; ""Revenge is a meal best served cold""; ""Forgiveness is between them and God...My job is to arrange the meeting""; ""Creasy's art is death, and he is about to paint his masterpiece.""<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning as Pita was simply amazing. The fact that she was only 9 at the time of filming blows my mind. She is quite a natural talent, and has proved she has staying power so far. She and Denzel shared a great chemistry between them.<br/><br/>The music was a great addition to the film and had one of the most varied selections I've heard. Some of the more unusual choices was a Spanish version of ""Hey Mickey"", Linda Ronstadt's ""Blue Bayou"", as well as the beautifully haunting music that is the same as heard in ""Gladiator"" by Lisa Gerrard. The classical pieces by Chopin and ""Claire de Lune"" by Debussy were unusual choices but worked - I think it helped to give the movie a sympathetic heart to contrast with the violence. ""Una Palabra"" was also a stand out piece and had an eerie and tragic sound - even though I couldn't understand a word.<br/><br/>This is a movie that at times will not only saturate your senses, but also assault them. I guarantee it is not a film you will soon forget."
"Arfpint","9","2","3","2 June 2005"," Tour de Force from Denzel Washington
","This film suffered from a lack of coverage on it's original release, and seemed to be headed for DTV hell. This is totally unjustified, as the direction, performances and even, amazingly, the plot, are superbly done.<br/><br/>The story itself is quite basic; drunken ex-marine gets the job to redeem himself, and ends up feeling alive again, only to have his dreams snatched away, and exacts a bloody revenge.<br/><br/>Note the word 'bloody' there, because the film certainly is that - in spades. Various shots of torture, death and pain are inflicted both on the protagonists and the viewers throughout the film, although Scott never allows the gore to get in the way of an immensely impressive performance from Denzel Washington, who surely is showing the way for truly mesmerising performances. His character, Creasy, is perfectly captured with Washington's moody persona, yet the glances and eventual grasp of redemption is captured superbly by the actor. A film like this will never get to the Oscars but certainly it could not be far off. Credit also has to go to the amazing Dakota Fanning, the only child actor I've ever seen who didn't make me want to throw the TV out of the window. Indeed, her skills actually rivalled those of Washington's, and her heartfelt ""you love me too"" almost brought a tear to this (reviewer) old git's eye."

","When I first watched this film it left a nasty taste in my mouth however I gave it a second chance and found myself enjoying it far more than the first time. The acting can't really be faulted, especially that of Denzel Washington John Creasy as the alcoholic, suicidal ex-CIA officer and Dakota Fanning as Pita, the young girl he is employed to protect.<br/><br/>Some people might think the opening hour is too slow however I thought it was the strongest part of the film as it shows the burgeoning friendship between Creasy and Pita so by the time she is kidnapped the viewer will care about her character and understand why Creasy is taking it so personally. While the first hour is all about setting up the story and character development the remainder of the film is almost non-stop action as Creasy works his way through everybody involved in Pita's abduction and the corrupt police officers who ambushed the ransom drop.<br/><br/>Some of scenes where Creasy tortures those involved for information about those higher up the organisation are fairly gruelling and I can understand some viewers feeling uncomfortable seeing such methods employed by a character we were supposed to identify with. Unfortunately the film is edited in a fairly jarring way with rather too much frantic camera movements, subtitles to words spoken in English and cuts every second or two in action scenes."

","Before i get into the movie, i'd like to state that i am a person who is drawn into a movie with a great plot, great acting, great dialogue, and a great ending.  I do not enjoy fantasy, special effects, and historical fiction movies.  This movie came out on Friday, April 23rd. I saw it in the theater Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  It was the greatest movie ive seen in a very very long time.  I thought that Mystic River was a great film, but this one may have been better.  It kept my attention at every point in the movie.  It took the perfect amount of time to establish Denzel's relationship with the little girl and left the perfect amount of time for his revenge to occur.  The acting was spectacular.  Everyone played their part to perfection, even down to Marc Anthony, normally a singer but who has appeared in a few movies with smaller roles.  This movie was a step up for him and he did a good job.  Walken and Rourke were good in their supporting roles and Washington, who gives a performance better than in Training Day, and Fanning, who at ten years old is a mature actress, should walk away with at least academy award nominations.  This movie deffinately deserves 4 out of 4 stars and is one of the best movies to come along in a great while."

","Some folks can watch this movie without thinking about its detrimental effects on an entire group of people. With a degree in Latino studies I have learned to watch movies with a hermeneutical lens of suspicion - meaning I keep my eyes open for stereotypes and tinges of racism. Don't get me wrong, I want to enjoy the movie and wish that it didn't have racist messages. As I watched ""man on fire"" i made a list of the positives and negatives. Sadly, my list of negatives was much longer than the positives. It made all Mexican people seem like criminals, it made Mexico City seem like the devil's playground and Denzel was the black martyr for a white girl. The only good people in the movie were white, except for Denzel who - thanks to the white child- got over his alcohol problem. This movie was very violent and it is meant to make you feel happy/satisfied to see the Mexican characters ""get the punishment they deserve."" I don't know about you, but I didn't enjoy watching the violence...it went a little too far. Is anyone willing to see the stereotypes in this movie?

","The violence of 'Man on Fire' isn't the problem here. In fact, the hard-as-nails approach we were promised is the reason that I was looking forward to seeing the film.<br/><br/>However, this film is prime example of how to run a potentially good film into the ground. The story is good enough and provides amble motivation for the violent second half. The chemistry between Dakokta Fanning and Denzel Washington is superb and gives the film some heart at least. In fact, the performances are all very good - so why five out of ten? Because Tony Scott and co. can't let a good film speak for itself.<br/><br/>When you've got great locations, a trio of fantastic actors (Fanning, Washington, Walken) and a emotionally charged premise, why do you need over stylised techniques to make the film work? Just about every single frame is spoilt by flickering, blurry or jittery camera-work. For instance, a simple interrogation sequence becomes a pop-video, full of freeze frames, sped-up imagery and so on. What's wrong with just letting the story flow in its own way? The film is also a bit too long. While it takes the time to build a relationship between the leads, it could still have done with taking 20 minutes out or so. But thats not what makes the film nearly unwatchable, its the director who tries to show off every few minutes and massage his ego.<br/><br/>With a different editor and director, the film could have been much better but as it stand, Man on Fire is disappointing."

","This is a really tough violent action-movie which is obviously cynical, but with a really good study of characters in the middle. The director Tony Scott does not hold back this time, he makes that statement in every single brutal, violent and explosive sequence. I happen to own a BIG TV which makes the whole experience very cool indeed. The main character portrayed by an unusually good Denzel Washington make this an ALMOST believable movie. He portrays a drunk poor guy who eventually look upon himself as an angel of justice sent from God. Is this movie beautiful? NO! Entertaining ? OH YEAH! Morally justifiable ? Not even close."
"dromasca","7","5","12","18 September 2004"," well directed and acted, but long and with a problematic theme
","The theme in 'Man on Fire' is problematic relative to the way the movie is being done. Denzel Washington is a tough character with anti-terror background, hired as body-guard to a rich family in order to guard their child daughter. When the worst fear of the parents become true, he swears vengeance to everybody involved, and engages in a killing spree worth a Bronson and Stallone film. The problem is that in those films you know what you buy, and you seldom question the reasons of the violent action. 'Man on Fire' starts differently, it shows a character with sensitivity and morals very well acted by Washington, and the course of violent action he is taking fits bad in the story. It is exactly the moral dimension of the Bible-reading ex-Marine that makes less believable his immediate recourse to weapons and torture against his enemies. <br/><br/>Otherwise I liked the way the film was done, some of the cinema and subtitle techniques are interesting and well combined. The cast is good and well directed, with Dakota Fanning superb in the child role, Mark Anthony , Christopher Walken, and Rachel Ticotin catching good supporting roles.<br/><br/>The film is a little bit too long, with the last half hour section looking like being added later, in a twist that starts after one may think everything is over - but it is well justified after all, now that I am thinking back. A good film overall, worth watching, although not without some problems or weaker sides. 7 out of 10 on my personal scale."

","I'm sure Scot figured that if he spiced up a thin plot with some shaky camera and weird cutting and visual effects, he'd have a winner. Well, it didn't work. He might have spent some time on character development instead. It's not like he didn't have the time, since the story drags out way too long anyway. Denzel and Dakota both do great jobs with what they have, while Walken and Rourke seems to be wasting their time. I hope they got paid well. It's probably hard for Tony to be the less talented Brother, but turning out a piece of garbage like this won't change the fact that he is. Weird effects don't make a masterpiece, but a good story and good characters may do the job."

","First of all, this movie could have easily gotten a 8 or 9/10 from me, if it weren't for a few key flaws. The acting is great, the story is decent, and the soundtrack is amazing. So what went wrong you may ask? Well, the cinematography is absolutely atrocious. I could not believe how distracting some scenes were, with subtitles or names and dates flashing all over the screen. The constant use of overexposing shots was neat to watch for the first 3 minutes, and then you realize with horror that they use the same method for the whole length of the movie: 2 hours and 20 minutes. It honestly makes the movie feel more like a long trailer, music video or tacky commercial. With this glaring flaw, no amount of acting talent could have possibly saved this film from being a nightmare.<br/><br/>But, maybe that's just me. I have friends who have loved this movie and didn't seem to mind all these things that annoyed me to no end. But if you're a tasteful cinematographer or photographer, this movie is NOT for you."
"inc-10","5","3","6","1 September 2008"," Unbalanced in each millisecond
","First half of the movie. Super! A heartless killer finally finds his peace in guarding and befriending little girl. Artistic editing worked here, artificially speeding up that would feel like too long and soapy romantic drama otherwise. You know, man being miserable isn't that cool to watch. Not for longer period. This is where editing and cutting worked fine to still maintain atmosphere. Dakota Fanning is a human bomb! She played better than anyone else in this movie. I really took a more comfortable position: everything I've seen so far looked superb and like a really well justified IMDb rating.<br/><br/>Then comes second half... And it's horrible. Like a good movie cut into half and other half replaced with much worse movie. Something from Steven Seagal's ""movies that didn't even make to video""-collection?<br/><br/>The action-spoiling editing kills last bit of realism, those microscoping bits that somehow escaped from confusing and seemingly totally random and broken plot that covers action part of the film. <br/><br/>This mountain of a man, filled with hate and sadism, starts cutting off fingers and killing people in really painful ways. The character and plot that was so well built in first half falls apart in seconds. He can afford an RPG but not a Kevlar vest. Even though he already has more bullet holes than it would be healthy for a brick wall. He goes head-to-head with half dozen mobsters and doesn't have a single sniper to support him. Hi-class warrior? Experience in anti-terrorist unit? All we see is a black guy performing on Jackass episode ""let's see how many bullets you can survive"". Stupid decisions and editing confirm this MTV influence.<br/><br/>I love a good action thriller. I like gore and blood. But then it's must be produced a man who's not picking flowers in his free time. A gruesome killer is one thing a wannabe daddy or love and care is WAY another.<br/><br/>What a letdown. Final conclusion made me angry, but I when girl hugs him as savior, that man who's covered with blood of numerous people he has just killed and tortured, it really felt sick.<br/><br/>I hoped he survives and redeems sadistic half of the movie somehow. Not in this life. Not in this movie. Why did they end it like this? Why build up something decent and then set it on fire, especially if there's absolutely no need to, and the ""event"" is really a product of not thinking the plot through? I mean, there was zero excuses for protagonist to die. ZERO.<br/><br/>Extremely, extremely disappointing. Because all that power that was put to built into something really valuable - somehow fell apart like a card house. This movie needs a remake with totally different second half."
"Eland15","10","3","6","14 July 2008"," Amazing, absolutely AMAZING
","This movie blew me away; however not the first time I saw it, I had to watch it twice to truly appreciate the message and the power of this film. Maybe I wasn't fully paying attention or maybe I was too young at the time but I am so glad that I watched it again.<br/><br/>If ever there was perfect casting for a motion picture then this would be it! Denzel Washington is unbelievably believable, (then again when is he not believable) and even though Christopher Walken's part is small in this you don't forget him as he helps to develop the story and make Washington's character even more electrifying. Also the supporting cast is more than solid with Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell putting in very strong performances, with Mickey Rourke also worth a mention. However, this is all eclipsed by the youngest member of the cast, Dakota Fanning, who is indescribable as Pita. The chemistry between Washington ans Fanning shines off the screen and you laugh when they laugh, and cry when they cry.<br/><br/>The direction is expertly done, but with such films as ""Enemy of the State"" and ""Crimson Tide"" perfection is what should be expected from a director like Tony Scott. There are scenes around 2-5 mins long with no dialogue and just Denzel Washington on screen that are captivating; a testament to the skills of Scott and Washington, which come together with brilliant results.<br/><br/>It might not be everyone's cup of tea with vivid violence and quite long at 146 mins, but in my opinion it has to have these things to make it the masterpiece that it is. If you like a film that really paints the picture before ripping it up in your face with twists and turns that will leave you with your jaw on the floor then this is the film for you. This film has so much to it that if I said anymore I would probably end up spoiling parts of it for you.<br/><br/>This is one of the few films that has brought a tear to my eye and that was because you care so much for the characters. I think this film has been highly underrated but hopefully it will get recognised for its heart and for the excellence that oozes from the screen on every level."

After a series of man hunting, he had to exchange his life with that of Pita.<br/><br/>I don't think it is a good idea for Washington to take this role for he does not belong to the flock of violent fighters. He can be an intelligent FBI agent (the Siege), paralyzed police officer(Bone Collector), rot policeman(Training Day), skilled boxer(Hurricane), warm father(John Q), but  and a Big But, he is no violent fighter, because there is not much to act, full stop! Besides, he used to act for a mission  he looked for justice and he was the justice. But now he threw away the bible and did things against it. It is a bad thing for a Christian to do!

"livewire05","6","3","6","24 June 2006"," Disappointing
","I was initially very anxious to see Man on Fire. The movie's trailers and commercials had made it seem to be a fast paced, exciting action movie with an almost artistic sense of filming direction. Upon viewing it, however, I was sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>While both Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning had excellent chemistry on screen, and I suppose that it was important for the plot of the movie to create a sense of their mutual attachment, I found the beginning of the movie to be extremely slow paced, and almost boring. If it wasn't for the promise of coming action, I probably would have turned off the film.<br/><br/>Even when Fanning's character Pita is kidnapped (A plot twist which is obvious from the beginning of the movie), I feel the action still does not pick up sufficiently. Washington enacts his revenge on the kidnappers by killing them one by one, but there is only one firefight in the entire movie, which occurs at the initial kidnapping. All of his other encounters with villains are one sided, with Creasy (Washington) torturing them to extract information, and then killing them. While I found his method of killing corrupt cop Fuentes with anally packed C4 to be clever, I did not find the repetitive shooting/cutting off of limbs of the other villains to be particularly interesting.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed by the style of the movie, something I was greatly anticipating. Action scenes are presented in a disjointed manner, with many quick changing camera angles, fuzzy images, and sudden sound effects to create a sense of how disorienting the action is. While this was fun to watch at first, it occurred so frequently that it disoriented me, and actually made the film less fun to watch.<br/><br/>A final complaint I have with Man on Fire is the ending. At the end Creasy gives himself up to the kidnappers in exchange for Pita, and dies in their car. I feel that the ending is trying too hard for drama; this is an action movie, and the attempt to make a statement through Washington's death is out of place. I also found myself wondering why Creasy had to give himself up: I feel he was fully capable of getting away alive. Why did he have to keep his deal with the same people he was trying to kill only hours earlier? Perhaps I'm being too hard on the film because I went into it with high expectations, which it did not live up to. It is not a horrible movie, and there are a few entertaining scenes. It was just a disappointment because I expected something so much better than a standard action/thriller, which is what Man on Fire is."

","Man on Fire was hot. I love a classic tale of good ol' revenge, and what better cause for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl.<br/><br/>The writers did an excellent job in this movie of building the relationship between Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) so that the viewer would understand and actually feel the drive Creasy had to rescue Pita. It was also good that Creasy wasn't a choir boy type trying to rescue Pita through the ""proper"" channels, but instead used torture tactics and street smarts. Some may say, ""Torture is wrong regardless,"" and you may be right, but when you see the pain Creasy goes through due to the loss of Pita and the sheer passion he has for getting her back, you can't help but side with Creasy and pull for him to be even more merciless. There would be no progress if Creasy used diplomacy to deal with the different nefarious gangsters and criminals and he knew that.<br/><br/>Creasy's quest ended with the return of Pita to her mother and Creasy dying in the vehicle of the bad guys. But Creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the movie, it in fact enhanced it by showing that Creasy was willing to die to get Pita back. His death was noble in fact.<br/><br/>Denzel does an excellent job as do the writers. This movie deserves good marks because it definitely was a good movie."
"TalkToMe","5","3","6","10 March 2006"," Too raw for my taste
","You really need a strong stomach to see this movie. Many movies have violence but this one has it in ""spades"". Normal human beings feel revulsion over killing and everything in this movie is focused to make you feel that revulsion and that's my point: The director has gone too far in emphasizing the killing. There were at least 16 people killed including one particularly gruesome scene where several fingers and an ear were amputated. <br/><br/>The plot is simple: Denzel Washington is hired to protect a 10 year old girl, Dakota Fanning, from kidnapping. Despite his best efforts, the little girl is kidnapped. Washington takes his revenge by killing all the kidnappers.<br/><br/>Any adult, but especially parents, immediately understand Washington's rage over the kidnapping and his obsessive desire for revenge: Washington tracks down and eliminates all the kidnappers, one by one. His methods however, are brutal beyond description and that's what is so hard to stomach, at least for me.<br/><br/>The acting is acceptable. Dakota Fanning is charming as a 10 year old. I would have liked to see Washington emote just a bit more. He shows his natural warmth only in scenes with Fanning. The two actors who play the parents, Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell, are deserving of special mention. Their roles were not large but they filled them admirably. <br/><br/>I didn't feel that I could give this movie more than a 5 because of the excess and florid violence."

","Man on fire, is definitely one of the best drama/crime thrillers I have ever seen. Despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well. This is Denzel Washington's perfect role, in which he plays a body guard, called Creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest protégée, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, the very smart, enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things, and acts in a very convincing manner, she has a great future ahead of her. As I said the story is somewhat complicated, in order to fully understand it, you must watch it a couple of times.<br/><br/>This film is made in two parts, there's the first hour, where everyone is happy, nothing's wrong, everyone's just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of Pita occurs and where Creasy is almost killed. And then there's the second part, the rest of the film, where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing, when Creasy's recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and ""La Hermamdad"" that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of Pita.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them. It is a real shame that this film hasn't been acknowledged enough, Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance, and so did Fanning and the director. And even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality.<br/><br/>If you like excellent, slightly deranged, suspenseful thrillers, this is the one to see.

","OK, this may take a while, but bear with me.<br/><br/>**Spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>Quick plot outline for those that haven't seen it. Drunken ex-CIA trained killer, on the verge of suicide, takes a job protecting a little kid in Mexico City. The killer and child develop an almost father/daughter relationship, he starts smiling, stops drinking etc - and then she is kidnapped and presumed dead. The ex CIA guy, still injured from the kidnapping, goes on killing spree taking out everyone involved in the crime. Just as he is closing in on the guy behind it all, he finds out the kid's alive and gains her release by turning himself over to the kidnappers. He dies of his wounds before they have a chance to kill him. The End.<br/><br/>My main problem with this film was the direction; Tony Scott appears to be getting worse. Normally I'm a fan of his work. Spy Game was enjoyable, Crimson Tide gripping, and even Top Gun has its moments (best not to mention Days of Thunder or Beverly Hills Cop 2 though). But Man On Fire irritated me. The frantic camera work, over editing and derivative music - seemed to all stem from the fact that the film was set in Mexico. Just because a film is set 'south of the border', does not mean it has to imitate Traffic. I know the director was probably trying to give us an insight into Creasy's (Denzel Washington) mind, as he goes a rather short killing spree, but he spent an entire hour establishing Creasy's relationship with the little girl. We really didn't need the constant flashbacks to justify every murderous act. When I say Scott is getting worse, I mean his style of directing rather than his films necessarily. The fast cut/moving camera style moments worked in Enemy of the State and Spy Game because it suited the plot (and wasn't over done). Here it's almost as irritating as Moulin Rouge, although nowhere near as nauseating, thank god.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the direction is not the only thing wrong with this film. The plot starts OK, as it sticks to the excellent source material (the book, not the appalling 1987 film). The book is set in Italy, but replacing that with Mexico is sensible, Italy isn't quite the kidnap friendly place it used to be. The first hour, although slow, sticks to the book and builds up the relationship between Pita (the little girl) and Creasy well. Then it all goes wrong. Instead of recuperating after being wounded in the kidnapping, like any professional would, he charges round Mexico City still bleeding from several gunshot wounds. What's his rush? It's not like the perpetrators of crime are going anywhere. There are side plots that are never properly explored or explained. Such as the true level of involvement of high ranking police officials, or the Mexican FBI agent that spends most of his time doing favours for a journalist he's hot for. What should be a nice simple last half of the film, Creasy's bloody retribution, is a mess. I've read some comments from people who hold this film up as an example of a 'non-Hollywood' unhappy ending. This is far from the truth. In the book there is no miraculous resurrection of the little girl. What kind of kidnapper doesn't kill his victim if you don't pay? No one is going to pay the ransom next time someone is taken if they're not afraid of the consequences. As they keep saying in the film, kidnapping is a business. The girl would be killed, and her body left for the parents to find as a warning to the next victim's family. Having Creasy die (possibly) at the end is the usual cop out. He's brutally murdered people; therefore he must be seen to pay the price. Would a highly trained assassin really be that easy to kill?<br/><br/>The one high point of the film was the acting. I not really a fan of Denzel (he said blasphemously), give me Wesley Snipes or Morgan Freeman any day. Denzel always seems to take himself incredibly seriously; someone should tell him he's an actor not Secretary General of the UN (ok, bad example). But in this film he's actually pretty good. Here Tony Scott perhaps takes some credit; Denzel was also pretty good in Crimson Tide. The little girl is played well, Fanning's clearly not from the Haley Joel Osment school of overacting. Christopher Walken is criminally under used however, and it would have been nice to see more of Mickey Rourke (the first time that's been said in a while). But hey, at least Chris Tucker's not in it! (Rush Hour 3 is being threatened)<br/><br/>To sum up: badly directed, but well acted tale, that spends too long reaching the wrong conclusion. If you have two free hours to watch a movie, I advise you to watch Before Sunset or even Spider-man 2, you won't regret it. 4/10"

","Just seen this film and still find it hard to believe that the likes of Denzil Washington agreed to appear in it, and Tony Scott directs it. Though it was good to see Mickey Rourke appearing in a film and not looking like someone who was on death's door for a change.<br/><br/>Brutal and clichéd are how I would describe this film. The idea of the 'lost soul' looking for redemption reminded me of Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. But unlike the western this slips into sentimentality and veers away from the true darkness of the main character. He can kill ""sweaty and corrupt"" Mexicans but the scripts veer away from the true brutality of the main character when threatening a woman or the girl's father. Not that I'm condoning violence against women, more the fact that the film did not stay true to the character - don't worry little girl, I've killed in cold blood, maimed and tortured individuals but I'm really a nice person and would never hurt any true blond haired, blue eyed American! <br/><br/>The choice of music - mournful vocals - was very similar to Gladiator. Were we also have a man of violence driven forward by revenge. But while Maximus was a character trying to escape violence and start a normal existence Creasy just comes across as an unoriginal, unstoppable killing machine. The scene when he was buying guns was right out of an Early Arnie film such as Terminator or Commando.<br/><br/>Finally the direction. What was Tony Scott thinking; stop trying to copy the likes of David Fincher and Darren Aronofsky. Stick to what you are good at set piece over the top action sequences - car chases, impossible shoot outs etc. The 'realistic' gritty edgy style here with digital cameras, ragged editing and jarring camera movements became from tedious very quickly.<br/><br/>Maybe one to rent on a wet Saturday"

","A washed-up former Marine (Denzel Washington) with a terrible drinking problem and haunted by demons due to mistakes made in his past goes down to Mexico City to be a bodyguard to a young girl (Dakota Fanning). It seems that her well-to-do parents (Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell) are scared to death of the recent surge in kidnappings within the city and are desperate to keep their daughter safe. Naturally Washington keeps himself at an arm's length from all those around him until Fanning is able to break his shell with her youthful kindness, friendliness and non-judgmental nature. An unmistakable bond develops between the two and when the duo is ambushed and Fanning is taken by a group of thugs (and Washington nearly killed himself), the only solution is for Washington to go after every individual that may have had something to do with the tragedy. Thus his old cold and menacing ways come back in full force in a ""I'm gonna get you!""-styled revenge ploy. ""Man on Fire"" starts out well and hits a good stride when Washington and Fanning's relationship comes shining through, but her disappearance sends shock-waves to a production that was already walking dangerous territory. Director Tony Scott would rather dazzle with crazed camera shots and distracting elements like giving English subtitles when the characters are actually speaking English than going for the throat with character development and story background. The movie is literally on fire it seems as the entire screenplay (adapted by Brian Helgeland, who has done much better work with triumphs like ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Mystic River"") thrives on chaos rather than coherence. Really the movie makes less sense as it progresses. Washington does all he can in the mess, but Fanning is truly the only notable point in the film (she helped turn ""I Am Sam"" into a minor success by splitting time with Sean Penn). When she is taken out of the picture, a tail-spin occurs that cannot be stopped. Good actors like Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Tioctin and Giancarlo Giannini get lost in a dizzying maze of loud and empty film-making techniques. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

","a few questions:<br/><br/>1.) how many false climaxes did this film have? I thought it would end with the father committing suicide, then it went on and on..was the structure ""interesting"" or merely pointless? who cares about 'the voice'? he gets killed in the final credit sequence by poor giancarlo (come back lina wertmuller,all is forgiven!)<br/><br/>2.) how do you describe those constant jump cuts,zooms, etc.--is there a word for this style of editing?  Whatever it was, it was damn irritating and left me with a profound headache when the film was over.  I have some good thoughts about director Tony Scott because of The Hunger, where Catherine Deneuve was so so so hot, and The Fan, where Robert deNiro gave a great performance in a bad film---but is he always such a bad director? at least, the cinematographer is brilliant. <br/><br/>3.) Is this film absolutely shameless, manipulating every emotion possible in the crudest way--from sympathy for the little girl (boo hoo) to glee at the torture of the bad guys.  As Winston Churchill said about the Germans ""either at your throat or at your feet.""     a sick personality has no middle ground between sentimentality and outright viciousness."

Denzel plays a an ex-assassin who takes a bodyguard job in Mexico City, guarding the child of a rich businessman.  At the beginning of the movie he is alcoholic trying to escape his past and his present, but his relationship with the child teaches him that living is worthwhile again.  When she is kidnapped (and he is shot and nearly killed during the kidnapping), revenge becomes the name of the game. As Walken says of him in the movie, his art is death, and this is his masterpiece.  The plot takes some good twists that I don't want to ruin. This is definitely a must see!"

","Never before have we, as viewers, been asked to cheer so heartily for a hero who brutalizes his victims so graphically. Denzel Washington's character ties a guy up and saws off three of his fingers one by one (although this is sanitized for us -- each time, the guy shakes it off like Denzel had only slapped him). He ties up another guy and shows him how he has inserted an explosive suppository in his rear. And ties up a third guy and blows his hand off with a shotgun.<br/><br/>Yes, Tarantino has already taken us down this gory road, but his protagonists are intended to be amoral cartoons. By contrast, Denzel's character in this film, like his recurring silver-screen persona, is that of the clear and unquestioned ""good guy,"" doing what he has to do, justified in his revenge. I am disappointed in Denzel for making this choice.<br/><br/>I guess this movie teaches us that it's OK to hack off the body parts of prisoners ... as long as they're from a developing country? I suppose this is a new genre: The post-Abu Ghraib action film."
"Critical Eye UK","1","8","24","16 August 2005"," Down, down, down Mexico way
","Revisiting a terrain last explored in the unsuccessful ""Revenge"", Scott's latest Mexican foray looks more like a second draft of his 1990 failure than an original piece of filming. Stuffed full of sub-Peckinpah clichés, neither ""Revenge"" then nor ""Man On Fire"" now comes within a country mile of ""Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia"".<br/><br/>Reasons for this latest failure aren't difficult to pin-point, especially when set against the Garcia template. Man On Fire's screenplay is as one-dimensional as Revenge's, whilst Denzil Washington's performance is only marginally more animated than Kevin Costner's. What's even worse though is the direction: the vapid Scott is never going to be the visceral Peckinpah, so the self-indulgence that always lit Peckinpah's work  irritating yet edgy, self-destructive yet passionate  is in Scott's case, merely tedious.<br/><br/>That Scott (Tony, not Ridley) has long been preoccupied more with the gift-wrapping around the box than its contents is pretty much a given. Nothing wrong with that: Fellini and Antonioni were the same. But whereas they worked to invest the superficial with substance, Scott's devotion has been to achieving the reverse.<br/><br/>The result is achingly predictable  to the extent that it's now reached the point where any Scott movie must have a scene set on a rooftop, not because it's a narrative requirement, but because of Scott's need to film his characters from an aerobatic helicopter.<br/><br/>The outcome, in the lamentable ""Spy Game"", was dire: Berlin from the air, dizzying and vacuous. But at least the Spy Game scene opened and closed on a rooftop, whereas ""Man on Fire"" eschews any attempt to mask its contrivance: the dialogue actually calls for Washington to urge everyone onto the roof, and so the characters decamp from a ground floor interior to the rooftop exterior without demur, there to continue their exchange whilst Scott's helicopter captures unoriginal vistas of Mexico City.<br/><br/>That it's all so tired, and all so trite, may have occurred to Scott at some stage during the shoot, yet the effects work introduced to bring life to a dead script is so bungled that all that the ghosted overlays and chromatic distortions achieve is to render crucial scenes well-nigh impenetrable. So bad is the CGI that one set-piece  the destruction of a nightclub  has all the explosive impact of a small balloon, slowly deflating.<br/><br/>But then, deflation is very much the hallmark of ""Man On Fire"", where expectations are continually raised only to be left flattened. Much is made, for example, of Creasy's attempt to get Pita to react instantly to the sound of the starting gun, but after a seemingly endless lead-up to her swimming competition, the resonance that one might reasonably have expected to find in the subsequent kidnapping scene is entirely absent: guns go off, Pita runs, Pita is caught. For sheer pointlessness, this screenplay is in a class of its own.<br/><br/>Nor are things any better elsewhere. Despite the fact that the stereotypical corruption of a stereotypical Mexico is, in ""Man On Fire"", to be addressed by a special law enforcement unit (and an utterly improbable crusading journalist), the unit, and the journalist, do nothing other than follow Washington around. The script doesn't bother to argue that the freelance Creasy can achieve more than the official investigators, probably because it knows that that would be one cliché too many, and that the arch-villain of the piece is going to be extra-judicially murdered anyway in a climactic scene that Scott doesn't even bother to film.<br/><br/>'Climax' is in any event the wrong word here. 'Nadir' is much more like it, a bottoming out that sees what should've been the dramatic denouement occurring long before the end and a downright laughable end-title sequence that seeks to make credible the quite incredible Creasy and his foe by providing their dates of birth and death.<br/><br/>Like, who cares? ""Man On Fire"": zero rating."
"anhedonia","3","5","13","24 April 2004"," Over-indulgent mess
","The first 50 minutes or so of this film are pretty decent as we see Creasy (Denzel Washington) getting to know Pita (Dakota Fanning), the kid he's guarding. The excessive direction by Tony Scott is tolerable until then because the Creasy-Pita story is engaging.<br/><br/>But then the film unravels completely. Scott, who apparently has no interest whatsoever in maintaining a shot longer than a few seconds, over-directs to the point of it being utterly annoying and ridiculous. The excessive jump cuts and flashy cinematography (which really doesn't work here) become more than mere distractions. Scott might be trying to prove he can evoke the film-making styles of, say, ""21 Grams,"" ""City of God"" or even Soderbergh's ""Traffic,"" but here it just comes off as over-indulgent. What exactly is Scott trying to prove or express when he not only provides English subtitles for Spanish dialogue, but also has English subtitles when the characters speak English?<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine Brian Helgeland, who did such a terrific job adapting Dennis Lehane's novel ""Mystic River"" for Clint Eastwood, penned this adapted screenplay, too - another revenge story. But whereas ""Mystic River"" packed an emotional wallop with believable characters, ""Man on Fire"" just has characters going through the motions. There's nothing here to keep us hooked. That might be Scott's, not Helgeland's, fault. Under the guidance of another director, someone who cares more about story and less about style, this might have turned into a gripping film.<br/><br/>Washington tries hard to rise above the thin material with which he's working. Fanning does an admirable job, too. She's cute, likable and definitely clicks in her scenes with Washington. Giancarlo Giannini and Rachel Ticotin build a nice chemistry between them, but none of the actors in this muddled mess is able to overcome the rather tepid story.<br/><br/>The film is about 50 minutes too long. Toward the end, this film really begins to drag. There are twists to the plot, but many can be anticipated long before they happen. As for one very crucial twist, not only is it predictable, but it doesn't make much sense if you think about it carefully, especially if you consider how parents might normally behave.<br/><br/>""Man on Fire"" just winds up being a nasty, noisy exercise masquerading as stylish filmmaking. If you want to enjoy Washington, you're better off renting ""Glory,"" ""Much Ado About Nothing"" or ""Malcolm X.""<br/><br/>There must have been something in this script that attracted Washington to this movie. What that is, I haven't the foggiest idea. He might want to be a bit more discriminating about the roles he picks. Though, the trailers shown at the screening I attended included Washington in ""The Manchurian Candidate."" What would possess someone, Jonathan Demme included, to remake that masterpiece and set it in contemporary times is beyond me."

","I rented this movie thinking it was going to be a rocking and a rollin' revenge flick, but for the first 40 mins there's no real action, no violence to speak of, it simply follows the blossoming relationship between bodyguard Creasey (Washington) and Pita (Fanning). Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not going to critise the film for it's slow build up. In fact this section was by far the best, as director Tony Scott reigned in his infatuation with over-editing and concentrated on the characters. It's something you don't really see in action flicks, and I was sat there thinking 'I really care about these people, it's gonna be hell when Pita's kidnapped.' Unfortunately the film REALLY lets itself down in the second half. Scott's 'psuedo-style' has always stuck me as a diversionary tactic to mask a lack of content and boy, does it show here. The camera flies all over the place whenever Creasy fires his weapon, so much so that far from 'gratuitous,' the violence seems non-existent, emasculating Denzil's Man of Fire with a wet-paper bag of gratuitous editing (sorry 'bout that last sentence, the film seems to have rubbed off on me in some way).<br/><br/>Wanna see a good revenge flick?

"Antagonisten","2","5","14","17 May 2005"," I want my two hours back
","Once in a while i see a movie so completely and utterly pointless, so bereft of entertainment value, that i wish i could have the two hours of my life back. It's not often, but it does happen. ""Man on Fire"" is one of those movies.<br/><br/>The outlook was rather promising. Academy Award-winning Denzel Washington in the lead, a plot that sounded at least as promising as most of the things coming out of Hollywood and decent director Tony Scott at the helm. Despite all these things the movie falls completely flat. And for this there are several reasons.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is a great actor in my opinion. He's not that bad in ""Man on Fire"" either. I would say he does his best. Acting is in fact not one of the major problems of this movie at all. Rather the complete lack of emotion is what disturbs me. The first half of the movie is a jaded Denzel working as a bodyguard for a little girl (Dakota Fanning). Her parents hired him to protect her from kidnapping, which apparently is a common thing in Mexico. The little girl is kidnapped and Denzel seriously wounded. The rest of the movie is Denzel exacting vengeance on the kidnappers in the most sadistic ways he can think of. Completely without emotion the movie shows Denzel performing one disgusting act after another, with the obvious logic that his violence is justified. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth to say the least.<br/><br/>Apart from the violence then? Well this movie feels in style like watching a two-hour episode of ""CSI: Miami"". The camera constantly zooms in, zooms out, light flashes, focus on, focus off, zoom in, flash, grain, flash. Incredibly annoying to say the least. There was obviously a rather substantial budget behind this movie, yet they completely fail to make it visually appealing or interesting.<br/><br/>To summarize this movie it's a classic tale of vengeance. Movies like this one have been made for a very long time with varying results. Generally i find the genre quite uninteresting, and this is a prime example of that. Seldom have i seen a movie so cold and without emotion, which is of course a bad thing considering we are meant to feel just how justified the protagonist's actions are. The end result is just one blood-filled orgy of violence filmed in a twitchy and annoying way. I want my two hours back.<br/><br/>I rate this 2/10 (2 instead of 1 only because of Denzel)"

","When I remember seeing the previews for this movie and not really thinking much about it. It was almost one of those movies that when you see the preview, its stunning, and then when it comes out, you hear nothing and totally miss it, and your memory totally doesn't correct the mistake of missing it. Man On Fire was one of those movies. I was curious on a rental one time, and I decided to take it home with me, my precious Blockbuster rental in my hands. I watched it, and witnessed such a beautiful movie. It is like none other...drama and action combined to create something amazingly spectacular. The cinematography done by Tony Scott is extremely well done and unique, unlike another movie. The subtitles can explain something without even listening to the actual voices, and the music is very intriguing for the setting. I got into this movie, and ended up buying it as soon as I could scurry out of the household and head over to Best Buy. I've watched it several times now. Denzel Washington (Creasy) does an amazing job with becoming this lost-minded ex-special forces man with no reason to live. Dakota Fanning (Pita) puts life back into him with her undying love for him right from the start. They bond and become good friends, until she is kidnapped by notorious gangsters part of the brotherhood, La Hermandad. Creasy (Denzel) tells the mother of Dakota Fanning that he will hunt down the killers, fearing that Pita is dead. This is where Creasy really shows the person he can become. He uses his contacts from Pita's kidnapping and Creasy's hospitalization to find one of the men and he begins his pursuit. My favorite line of all, is in this movie, when Christopher Walken tells the AFI agent that ""A man is a work of art, in anything that he does....cooking, whatever. Creasy's art is death...he's about to paint his masterpiece."" He plays a very unique roll of Creasy's old partner and friend. After finally pursuing the brother of ""The Voice,"" leader of La Hermandad. Creasy arranges a meeting to trade Pita for himself and The Voice's brother. In the end, Creasy dies from being shot earlier, and his wound getting infected and massive blood loss. It is a very sincere and sad ending, but a great one. I love this movie and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a memorable flick. The story is in depth, everything is explained from beginning to end, and nothing corny at all in any way or manner."

(But come on what did i expect?!?! ... it's a Tony Scott movie.) It's incredible how religiously fundamental narrow-minded and unreflected this whole revenge drama gets. There is so much time wasted with flat stereotypic dialogs, where you almost know exactly what the next sentence will be, before they say them.

The relationship between Washington and Fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed, I believed every minute. The cast is brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke are great as always. Walken lights up the screen for me like no other actor. I would have loved to see more of both of them. The authentic locations are remarkable. The camera work is interesting and different.

"baumer","10","3","7","19 September 2005"," A powerful film with powerful performances
","This comment does contain spoilers!!<br/><br/>There are few actors that have an intangible to them. That innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma, panache and swagger. It's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great. I think George Clooney has it and so does Jack Nicholson. You can look at Clooney's subtle touches in scenes like his one word good-bye to Andy Garcia in Ocean's 11 when they just utter each other's name disdainfully. ""Terry."" ""Danny."" You can pick any number of Jack's performances dating as far back as Five Easy Pieces in the diner to A Few Good Men and his court room interrogation scene. These guys just have it. You can add Denzel Washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does. If you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in The Siege to his impressive tribute to Malcolm X in Spike Lee's film of the same name, you can see that there is no finer an actor working today. I don't mention all of this to insinuate that Man On Fire is perfect just because of Denzel's work, but he is definitely the cog of the production. I was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw, emotional and incendiary all at the same time.<br/><br/>Washington plays Creasy a former spy or CIA agent or one of those covert government operatives. He has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led. He has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man. His friend and perhaps mentor, played very reservedly by Christopher Walken, is living in Mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich. Apparently the kidnapping business in Mexico is so vibrant that these paid former S.E.A.L.s and such can do very well while providing a needed service. Creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty. Marc Anthony is fine as Samuel, Radha Mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife Lisa and Dakota Fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as Pita. I don't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of Pita is nothing short of Oscar worthy. The film's entire first half is dependent on the relationship between Pita and Creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role, perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly. But Fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role.<br/><br/>It is the relationship between Pita and Creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema. Together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them. Tony Scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better. I am interested to see how his next film, Domino, turns out. I think Scott is one of today's under rated directors and with more films like this one, his name will surely be elevated to icon status.<br/><br/>The story has Creasy really taking to Pita, and vis-ca versa. There is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although Pita loves her dad, he is not around much. He is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family. Soon, Creasy is taking Pita to her swimming competition. He is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear ""Creasy"". It's not just a friendship between them, it is more of a kinship, and a deep parental love seems to be present. <br/><br/>The film changes gears when Pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and Creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her. This is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion. And this is where Denzel becomes a tour de force. Like I said earlier, I have seen Denzel give some outstanding performances in films like Crimson Tide and Training Day, but never have I seen him like this. He is a man possessed and with the possibility of Pita being dead, he becomes a literal man on fire. It rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance. Denzel's anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for Pita's violation. This all vigilante justice as the Mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind. <br/><br/>Also what is paramount to this film's audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance. I have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily. They inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die. But not in this film. Writer Brian Helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful. The perpetrators here feel Creasy's wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes. There is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice. He needs information and someone loses a finger. He wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things. There is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film.<br/><br/>Man on Fire is one the five best films of 2004. Now that it is out on DVD, my recommendation is to get the SE. It is loaded with bonus features that include about 6 hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks. 10/10"

I just don't see the big deal about this film; it's not as smart as it may think it is and it tries so hard to be moving that it just comes across as manipulative and overwrought.<br/><br/>This was a simple story and quite an unoriginal one too, really. I didn't mind the first hour, though there were some overly sweet moments, but the chemistry between Washington and Fanning is genuinely good. After the kidnapping it just got too messy and it kinda dragged. Some scenes during that half were so ridiculously ludicrous or just cheesy that you just seem to smirk then really be amazed, because they were so over-the-top, clichéd and at times rather dull. Maybe they could have added some light or black humour into the story or those situations, as there was hardly any to be found. The serious tone and emotional pull that the film had was so pushy in its delivery that it was fairly nauseating when it came to the end. While the abrupt ending just felt like a flat cop out, to be honest. I found it too unsatisfying and hollow to be pleasing and that goes for the formulaic movie as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Tony Scott was so distracting with its flashy slow motion, swirling frames, freeze frame and double screens. It was like Scott was trying to make it standout visually, while trying to hide it's been there done that plot. It might look like a fast adrenaline pack film, but really it's the disjointed editing that gives that illusion because it's was mostly slow story telling. The editing was so annoyingly choppy and with its quite jumpy camera work it was really giving me a headache and the noisy and loud soundtrack didn't help either.<br/><br/>What a waste of superb actors; Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken. There not bad, but with the lack of depth and material they're given, they deserved much better. The only standout performance for me was Dakota Fanning who shined in her part and Radha Mitchell wasn't bad, but the rest were bystanders in this muddled film. It's not entirely awful as it had some moments of superbly built tension and it truly captures a seedy Mexico City that comes across as one imposing stature.<br/><br/>Overall, it's really just an ordinary film that's nothing spectacular or has anything new to show. It's maybe worth look for Fanning's performance, but still the film is equally missable.<br/><br/>Ps I really didn't know that this was a remake or that there was an original French/Italy version that starred Scott Glenn, Brooke Adams and Joe Pesci. Well, maybe that's another good thing about this film?"

","I am from Germany and live in Switzerland, and have seen around me how ugly primitive anti-Americanism can get. So I want to state this is not my orientation at all.<br/><br/>Now, I have read through the first two pages of user comments on this movie, and gave up finding even one single review questioning this movie's incredible message.<br/><br/>Take one of the most politically correct actors active in Hollywood (if not the King of them all...?), Mr. Denzel Washington. I admit I love him as much as anyone else, and I think he gives a good performance here, so that's not what bothers me. Now, put him with the most gorgeous, irresistible little girl on earth (I share the enthusiasm of many for Dakota Fanning, it would be hard not to...). They become friends, she helps him feeling needed as a person again and he becomes a father/big brother to her - to my humble opinion, if quite classical and nothing revolutionary, the scenes where they form that bond are by far the best thing in this movie! - and she DIES, or he thinks so.<br/><br/>Now, you show this wounded man (and very widely beloved actor) getting in to a revenge fury in reaction to being deprived of the one living being who was making him feel alive again, and can we hold back our own sympathy for his state of mind when faced with the murder of a (perfectly lovable, very young) child? STILL, what animates Creasy's CRUSADE has to be called by its name: a personal revenge action that crosses every moral and legal border one can think of.<br/><br/>I don't remember ANY Hollywood movie telling me an ""eye for an eye"" is OKAY... until MAN ON FIRE. Creasy, BY ALL MEANS shown as the GOOD GUY in this movie, moves from personal distress to using the skills learned and perfected during his missions for U.S. governmental secret services - i.e. TORTURE, EXTREME INTERROGATION TECHNIQUE, and finally ARBITRARY EXECUTION - to make the BAD GUYS suffer before murdering them. All because he's mad at them and, to a lesser extent, because the not quite disgraceful nor unsexy mother tells him too.<br/><br/>I'm shivering as I recount all this being in a mainstream movie... and NOBODY seems to flinch !!!???!!!<br/><br/>It's a small consolation that, at least, the incredibly irritating MTV-like flashes and super-short shots bombarding you from time to time have been spotted by some: =shawn_eason= : ""to top this all off Tony's use of Mtv-style filming gave me the biggest headache, far worse than the shakiness of the camera in Blair Witch...sigh why did he need the unnecessary flash zip pow here then there, then back again... my head is spinning."" ...unfortunately, just before that, he considers ""It would of been an OK movie say (and I hate to say it) the girl wasn't alive because then it would of justify his rampage, however, she was alive"" (so, if the girl had actually been murdered, the executions would have been okay...) and he finishes with ""I still think it was OK though."" :(<br/><br/>As well, my enthusiasm for Dakota Fanning reflects in =jana1251= 's comment (at least she doesn't explicitly approve the story...).<br/><br/>The comment title ""does considered, planned out bloody revenge make you go ""oooo""?"" by =Janessa= was very promising, but not at all, it's ""well worth the rental""...<br/><br/>About half of the comments are by women, so the Denzel-magic seems to work equally on both sexes to erase any sense of criticism as long as he is the one in charge...<br/><br/>I AM SORRY for this being a very long comment that does nothing but complaining. But I am genuinely SHOCKED that a movie that is essentially blessing a bloody crusade WITHOUT EVER HINTING THAT THE HERO COULD BE WRONG (that would have made the movie into something more interesting as well as less ambiguous human-wise!) doesn't seem to raise so much as an eyebrow. I don't feel like discussing this movie (which has about as much qualities as it has flaws). Since I'm condemning it from the start, I couldn't care less about the ending being happy or not...<br/><br/>I would recommend to watch it as an incredibly irresponsible statement by the movie industry to a large audience: ""If deeply harmed/wronged/hurt, the GOOD guys are allowed to exercise vendetta in the form of torture and assassination.""<br/><br/>Think about it. Please."

"TheLittleSongbird","6","2","4","10 November 2017"," Denzel Washington is on fire, the film itself doesn't quite
","When people think of 'Man on Fire', they think of this 2004 film but some probably don't realise it's a ""remake"" of a less critically well received 1987 film.<br/><br/>If asked which from personal opinion is better, it would be a hard choice. As an adaptation of the source material, author AJ Quinnell would choose this easily. It is easy to see why that is the case, there are more lines in this version lifted from the source material and more of the spirit is there, apparently Quinnell intensely disliked the 1987 film going as far to saying that he couldn't recognise any of what he wrote in there. On its own terms, it is not an easy pick. Both films are uneven but both films are also very worthwhile (yes, will admit to liking the 1987 film despite it not being a great film), they have a numerous amount of strengths but both have quite a few faults.<br/><br/>Talking about this 2004 film, it's uneven with some things that stop it from being as on fire as its lead performances. As said above though there is a lot to like and enough to make it more than watchable. Visually, 'Man on Fire' has its moments. The locations are both stunning and gritty and there is evidence of a slick atmospheric stylishness and director Tony Scott providing a few inventive touches. The film is hampered quite severely however by Scott excessively going overboard on the visual style, too much of it is more gimmicky and self-indulgent than it is clever and imaginative which is a real shame.<br/><br/>'Man on Fire' has a haunting and cool music score that really adds to the film and drives the action well. The script has wit and tension.<br/><br/>Storytelling, like with the production values, is more problematic. It is very successful in the first half, the central chemistry between Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning is truly heartfelt and beautifully written. Really liked that the care and trust were realistically gradual and not evident straight away. In the more action-oriented and thriller-like second half, the action is well-choreographed and suitably uncompromising, it's fun and suspenseful and it makes more consistent sense than the 1987 film.<br/><br/>It is let down sadly by the pace being drawn out in places while the ending is more logical, more exciting and more emotional in the 1987 film, it's a bit of an illogical fizzler here. The film is sadly rather too overlong too by about twenty minutes, this could have been cleared up by tightening the pace in the second half.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington excels in the lead role as does a charming and beyond her years mature Dakota Fanning. Their chemistry is one of the highlights of 'Man on Fire'. The supporting cast is more uneven, with a fun if underused turn from Christopher Walken and a strong Radha Mitchell but Mickey Rourke especially is wasted in a role little more than a throwaway. The villains too could have been more threatening. Scott's direction succeeds in the action and direction of the actors but is really messy visually.<br/><br/>Overall, worthwhile but not the on fire film it could and should have been. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

","What to make of this film? In the first half, we have Washington and Fanning giving lovely performances as a bodyguard and bodyguardee, who bond as he looks after her. Of course, there has to be an eventual kidnapping, and that certainly happens. <br/><br/>The result of it should have had me in tears. I'm that kind of sap who would be heartbroken by such a thing, even in fiction. But I felt absolutely nothing, and part of that has to be because the characters themselves hardly seemed to have any emotion. <br/><br/>Warning - Spoiler Ahead! - They thought the girl had been killed, and yet her loved ones behaved more like they were just sad because she'd gone away for a while! I know it's each to his own, but I could not believe any loving mother (and an eventually loving bodyguard) would have reacted in such a subdued manner. <br/><br/>But anyway, once this does happen, it's ""Death Wish"" time, as Washington sets out to avenge all who are responsible for the dastardly dead. Director Scott threatens to give viewers permanent migraines with his dreadful, hyper-kinetic style, making the film look like a bad rap video, and as for the subtitles... Sometimes the characters speak in Spanish, sometimes in English. And sometimes the subtitles come up when they're speaking in Spanish, and sometimes in English! It's as if the subtitler couldn't keep up with the change in languages, like, ""Oops, he spoke English there, I shouldn't have put that one up. Oh damn, missed that Spanish one!"" And the way they zoomed in and out, went left to right, up and down... and whatever else they did... were they meant to be some kind of joke? <br/><br/>Somehow, despite the movie going on and on and on, and with all these flaws, it did keep my interest. Oddly, I think I should really hate the thing, and I'm not sure why I don't. Maybe that, no matter how bad some of it was, it was intriguingly so. <br/><br/>But I'd better stop thinking about it all now. I think I feel a migraine coming on."

","This movie hits every trite cliché in the book, both before and after the kidnapping. As a bonus, this is basically two, two, two movies in one!<br/><br/>This first is ""drunken man finds redemption and sobriety and reason to be happy in friendship with small child"" and this is probably the better part. Dakota Fanning plays the typical winsome blonde kid who somehow cracks past Denzel Washington's crusty exterior. Fanning is a little cutie, and Washington is certainly a strong enough actor to pull this off. Still, you've seen this done before, and done better. <br/><br/>The second half of the movie is the ""one man obsessed with revenge, oh and by the way, he happens a trained killer."" You'll recognize this trope as having been done before and better. Denzel Washington is a fine actor, but he's a bad Schwarzenegger (for all his limitations, Ahnold is very good at amoral obsession, which is what Denzel is going for here).<br/><br/>It's not that it's a bad movie; there's too much talent (or at least experience) on both sides of the camera to make this bad. Still, it's trite and cheesy. There are better ways to spend 146 minutes of your life."

","Frankly speaking I am not buying the whole story. The main guy is former assassin with the years of experience. So why the heck is Creasy doing so many silly mistakes? Starting the armed crusade against a lot of bad guys and still wearing no bulletproof gear of any kind, especially these guys almost shoot you to death a while before? Professional assassin? And what about running across the city where the corruption is at that scale that nobody is surprised that yet another policeman are involved in another crime? But it's even better - what about running across that city with a guns, shooting down all the bad guys, who are on a top of kind of mob, shooting them in the way everyone see you and know you, and you still do not need to bother anyone chasing you in revenge?

"Skutter-2","5","2","4","7 July 2007"," Needs some fat burnt off.
","A decent but not a great film. At its core Man on Fire has a strong simple revenge/redemption storyline- pretty basic stuff we've all seen before but can work well if done right. In other words it's all about the way it's mixed together, not the actual ingredients. To a certain extent Man on Fire gets a lot of it right in terms of its recipe but in other ways it drops the ball. The movie is pleasingly gritty and doesn't pull its punches making for some strong visceral storytelling and giving the movie an edge of realism. The acting is good. I'm not generally a big fan of child actors but Dakota Fanning does a great job. Denzel Washington is good at these stoic tough man kind of roles (And not much else- he's kind of good at what he does but is basically one of those actors who is the same in everything he does). The early part of the movie with them bonding could have been truly painful given how clichéd and saccharine the material is but it is pulled of fairly well due largely to the performances by the two leads. The contrast of these scenes with the more violent thriller material later in the movie works surprisingly well, somehow managing not to come of as obvious and manipulative. However, Tony Scott's increasingly 'stylised' style of direction was very distracting and pulled me right out of the movie. Techniques such as coloured lens filters and rapid cut editing can be used to good effect if used correctly in a movie but here and in a lot of Scott's recent films such techniques are used constantly with neither rhyme nor reason. Also the movie needed to be edited on the whole a lot better. It moved far too slowly and could easily have lost at least twenty minutes- the last few scenes really dragged not because the later scenes were badly done but because by that point the movie had lost all impetus. There wasn't really enough story for 140 minutes. The whole thing seemed over-baked with the excessive running time and over-direction. I'm sure there's a better, leaner film somewhere inside Man on Fire."

Creasy finally locates employment from a friend, Christopher Walken,(Rayburn),""Domino"" who suggests he become a bodyguard for Dakota Fanning,(Pita) who is a young girl from a wealthy family and her mother Radha Mitchell,(Lisa) seeks this protection because of some kidnapping in the area.

"fdecker-1","5","2","4","18 December 2006"," Great script, Great Actors, Terrible Director
","Oh what this movie could have been in the hands of a competent director. It is just difficult to watch such heavy handed directing and distracting cinematography. I realize that a director wants to convey pacing and mood with they style of the lighting and the movement of the camera, but the style used in this movie comes across as a bad music video and an attempt to be art-house hip.<br/><br/>Can't we just watch an interesting story without overbearing technique? Do we really need low-key lighting, heavy grain, jump cuts, white flash frames, and the stupid and distracting jerky-cam? This movie succeeds if the director wanted us to feel nauseous and have a headache for 2 hours.<br/><br/>The movie is shot in a gritty, grainy, depressing style with camera work that looks like they just gave an 8mm home movie camera to a 4 year old and let it be edited by his younger sister using band-aids and a glue stick. I have a real problem with this ""style"" and can't say enough bad things about this kind of cinematography. It's annoying and apparently panders to 13 y/o Playstation and MTV addicts with ADD. Maybe director's of photography think that if they use a blue/green transfer, or skip the bleach step on a print or do whatever nonsense digitally to make the image look completely artificial, they will win a technical achievement award.<br/><br/>When will they realize that part of the glamor of Hollywood is the beautiful wide-screen images? It doesn't always have to be Technicolor type color, after all the X-Files is different than Oklahoma!, but if I wanted to experience what Tony Scott has given us with this movie, I would take LSD. Save this kind of experimental film-making for the 10 minute student shorts at USC. It's the story, stupid. When technique overshadows the story you've forgotten what it is to be a filmmaker."

I have seen several reviews that don't share the same view.<br/><br/>The direction, cinematography is amazing. The camera angles, fuzziness, shakyness all potray a hot humid, corrupt, modern day world. It portrays Creasy's struggle with the drink, at times you feel the intoxication, the blurryness through the camera shots. It is very effective. I don't feel it detracts from the film at all, in fact I feel it adds to the overall 'feel' of the film. It was correctly placed. Locations are shot wonderfully, and I can say after a recent trip to Latin America it appeared to capture the feel of the continent very well.<br/><br/>Was pleasantly surprised as I did not watch the film at the cinema due to indifferent reviews, and so glad reviewers on here loved it and so do my friends who have seen it as well."
"Naburba","6","2","4","26 June 2006"," Overrated
","Man on Fire consists of a cliché'd script, mediocre acting, horrific editing, and failed attempts at compelling drama.<br/><br/>All of the characters have been seen in countless movies before:<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays the stoic but lovable bodyguard. Dakota Fanning plays the smart little girl who befriends him (a la Leon, but not as well done). Marc Anthony plays the desperate indebted father (a la Fargo, but not as well done). Radha Mitchell plays the sobbing mother who can't help but be attracted to Denzel's character. Christopher Walken plays an old army buddy (or something of the sort).<br/><br/>Acting: Even with a weak script, Washington and Fanning give a believable performances and have nice chemistry between themselves.<br/><br/>Walken and Washington, on the other hand, have absolutely no chemistry. In their scenes the writing oftentimes feels confused, as if it wants to hint at their shared past but instead alienates them from the audience.<br/><br/>Pacing: Many points in the movie, mainly in the beginning and toward the middle, drag on way too long.<br/><br/>Editing: The film is edited together like an extended music video with very quick jump-cuts, inter-cuts, and other shots that disorient the viewer more than anything else. Solemn scenes where Denzel's character is alone in his room drinking are edited together faster than full blown action sequences. <br/><br/>That said, some of the action scenes are very well done. You can help but smile when you see Denzel shoot 4 people in a row before taking cover behind a car. Him setting up an RPG-7 in an old man's house was another cool moment.<br/><br/>The few musical cues used in the film are cheesy at best. At one point Denzel's character says to the mother ""I'm going to kill them all"". Immediately we here funky background music cut in. Give me a break.<br/><br/>Even the movie's tagline is a tired cliché: ""Revenge is a dish best served cold.""<br/><br/>Story (*SPOILER*): The movie became cold once (we thought) Fanning's character had been killed. Showing Denzel's character getting revenge was fun to watch but the emotional link to the characters had been severed at that point.<br/><br/>Then the sad twist ending was a pathetic attempt at tragedy.<br/><br/>Avoid this movie. Watch the trailer and draw your own conclusions from that. <br/><br/>In my version, he kills all the bad guys (Mexican kidnappers), gets the girl (Mitchell's character), and then drives to America with her and her daughter while all the Mexicans at the border chant USA!! USA!!"

","There is very little Denzel Washington can do to shock us anymore at this point in his career but I was stunned by his performance in this film. He plays a former assassin eager to keep his past in the past as he slowly wastes away to booze and what not in Mexico. One day, his friend and former accomplice Rayburn (played by Christopher Walker) convinces him to take up a job as a bodyguard for a rich young couple's played by Radha Mitchell (in her element) and Marc Anthony (he continues to try and show us that he can do other things besides sing well) daughter Pita (played by the heartwarming/heartbreaking Dakota Fanning). Pita, a young girl of say seven-ish or tops ten-ish develops a school girl's crush on Creasy (Washington's character) and very soon she is able to melt his heart and create a worthy enough relationship with him that is enough to tug at his heart when she is eventually kidnapped and held for ransom. That's the first part of the film, and during the whole ordeal you will feel like you're actually watching Washington in two different films. Like a 2 for 1 so to speak. The second half of the film is spent on his ultimate revenge and bringing losers to justice. The problem with kidnapping in Mexico is one of the highlights of this film and it out to bring shame on the law makers and politicians of the country."

He notices that life isn't that bad after all. Until one day.. She gets kidnapped! All his rage comes out of him and bodies start dropping. I think that this would actually work in true life. Because when you've lost something very important and you're willing to give your life for it you do it! In the movie Greasy starts bloody war against the whole underworld and finally destroys every single bad guy.

The acting is flawless, and the characters fit their parts perfectly. I loved the film style and it was only surpassed by the soundtrack. The jumpy, edgy movements of the camera and the unnatural colors, along with the music, clashed in an inexplicable way. Harry Gregson-Williams was most definitely the right choice for the music composer. This movie is an essential part of anyone's DVD collection.

The film is outrageously cool and is one of the most compelling and realistic revenge movies ever made. Easily. Denzel gives his most frightening performance ever as John Creasy and is backed up by Chris walken and Mickey Rourke. Both in great roles. When i first heard about it i thought it was'nt going to anything special with films like 'Kill Bill'and 'Walking Tall'just coming out i thought it was just going to be your average revenge film. But its not at all. With the setting being in Mexico City which i have heard is a terrible place for any human being these days,the cracking storyline and twists which regularly pop up and an awesome realism to it it's very different from any of Scotts films and any other revenge thrillers. Altogether i thought it was terrific and was a killer to any other film you would probably see this year. So if you see only one film in 2005, make it Man On fire. You'll love it."
"dogsmoke","5","2","4","28 March 2005"," Did not meet expectations
","Having previously seen Tony Scott's Spygame I was looking forward to seeing this. Although Spygame had some irritating camera techniques whereby it would zoom in and out very quickly, pan and scan, colour bleach, all for no apparent reason other than to (coupled with the slightly corny music) give it a pop video feel, I felt the movies strengths outweighed it's weaknesses and maybe TS was cutting his teeth and trying out new techniques in order to refine a new style.<br/><br/>After seeing Man on Fire it would appear that TS loves these meaningless camera-shake, v.fast pan and zoom stuff and used it most of the time. I love new techniques, but when they actually obscure what you are trying to see, then clearly they are not efficient. Maybe TS should watch a bit more Luc Besson ;-)<br/><br/>The story started off well paced and had enough characterisation to involve you with the actors - notably the complex relationship between the American/Mexican couple, and of course the bodyguard and little girl.<br/><br/>However when he goes on his trail of revenge, he displays all the psychotic and sadistic tendencies of the people we are supposed to hate. It also becomes the ""1 Man takes on the world"" which unless you are VERY young is hard to take seriously. Besides the films initial premise was much more intelligent than this, and the feelings of paranoia and vulnerability were intense. Further to this presumably to be a successful kidnap gang you would need to be ruthless, efficient and good at your job. The men he was chasing seemed to me to be portrayed as clumsy (apart from The Voice) and just good fodder for whatever torture he had dreamt up.<br/><br/>In conclusion - in many respects this is a compelling film, but I felt that Tony Scott unintentionally trivialised it by going down the pop-video, lone man kills everything route. From the first 35 minutes I expected so much more, and had it not been for the excellent performances from Denzel Washington, Christopher Walken and Dakota Fanning, plus the ever brilliant Rachel Ticotin it would have been hard to stomach the remaining minutes.<br/><br/>In conclusion: worth a watch if you are in a kick-ass hate mood, but if not I think there are other films by Tony Scott more worth watching."

","I'll be one to defend this movie, I thought it was very good! Even though I'm getting really tired of the ending being so sad, I found myself hoping for someone to come in to save Creasy and was happy that Pita made it back to her family. Denzel Washington was great as I have come to except of him as did the rest of the cast. I find it more of a disappointment that ending wasn't better....but hey as Sid 6.7 said ""Thats life! no saving, no resetting"" If people would understand that when a movie is made about a person and there life it can't always have the happy perky ending you want , it's just not how life is....so we as film go'ers gotta understand when seeing a film that is based on life and times of one person. For sure I will recommend Man on Fire to anyone that ask about it and will one of the films on my list of DVD's to buy."
"synthetikxspark","10","2","4","17 September 2004"," The single best movie released this year - SPOILER
","This movie is absolutely amazing - the dialogue, casting, acting, and the emotion alone carried this film. You watch a sad and basically death ready man change because of the girl he is hired to protect. (Nobody could have played this character better than Denzel) You watch his sadness and anger go away and you see him appreciate life again through his relationship with the girl(someone else could have played the character but Dakota Fanning did an excellent job). To stop with the plot points for a second you know someone did an excellent job in the filming process when you can watch a man change not only physically but emotionally and feel that change happening. Back to the plot ... deeper into their relationship the girl is kidnapped and Denzel's character is wounded in the fight for her. Once out of the hospital he swears revenge and death on everyone involved in the kidnapping. Great plot twists which were not obviously intentional if intentional at all include the family lawyer, a very specific cop, and the girl's father....(minor spoiler) The best part of this whole movie is that they lead you to believe that the girl is dead, even throw in a scene to lead you to believe she is alive and when you discover they aren't talking about her, you fully believe she is dead. But she's not. That was genius. To get honest and personal I cried like a baby when she got out of the car and ran to Denzel. This was an incredible movie possibly Denzel's best acting ever and an amazing script that not only makes sense but makes you feel. 10/10"
"Yokam","Null","2","4","10 September 2004"," It doesn't get worse than this. A truly ugly, hateful movie
","I could say I'd keep this short and sweet, but this excrement of a waste of a movie is long and repugnant. I thought 3000 Miles from Vegas, or whatever that abortion was called was the ugliest most vile movie ever made... now its belt has been ripped from its syphilitic body by this pile of puss. Please, if you have never seen this movie, stay far, far away, because even renting it, and holding the jewel box in your hand will cause a rash and a horrific smell that will make Lady MacBeth's ""spot"" look like a smudge.<br/><br/>This truly boarders on a snuff movie. A bad one at that. Tony Scott has always been a hateful, vile man who makes movies that show his own self-loathing. As a ""man"" he is unable to feel for anyone or anything, nor have any normal relationships, so he defecates on the screen and hopes he can spread his unhappiness, and perversions onto the general public, feeling that if they all have his disease, he won't be alone anymore. But why would someone with such talent and soul as Denzel agree to be a part of this disgraceful waste? <br/><br/>I've heard that filmmakers with the lease talent and the biggest egos serf the web to read their reviews... no matter where they come from, so obviously Tony will be here. So let me tell you to your face, Tony-boy. You should be arrested. You should be put away. It should be a felony for you ever to make a movie again. There's a reason you hate yourself so much... because the world truly hates you for the projectile vomit that spews from your work. As with the director himself, this smut is tasteless, humorless, and devoid of an ounce of either tension, entertainment, creativity or purpose.<br/><br/>In this monstrosity, a young girl is brutally murdered by corrupt Mexican police, and in this movie, it seems anyone who is Latin is dirty. So we have to watch as Denzel, who was her bodyguard, and let her be captured and killed, methodically goes around the slums of Mexico systematically and with psychotic sadistic glee torture anyone who was involved then killing them with childish ""creativity"". So... you want to see this? Tell you what. My dog got into the Bacon-Bites today, and has left massive puddles of diarrhea on my concert porch. Come on over. And look at his handiwork. You'll find it much more pleasant. As for Tony and his ""ilk""... we can only wish that there's a Denzel out there who wants to stop all you from your own evil deeds, and rid this world of your movies once and for all. Now that would make a great story!"
"CitizenCaine","8","2","4","14 August 2004"," Denzel On Fire
","Director Tony Scott's heavily stylized remake of an inferior 1987 film is essentially a two part drama: protagonist Denzel Washington, as an ex-CIA/mercenary type, happens upon a purpose to look forward to living again, instead of looking backward at his past, and once he aligns himself with that purpose, he makes decisions to preserve it. Washington is befriended by little Dakota Fanning, who is always believable here and never cutesy. They form an unusual bond due to her curiosity and his duty to protect her. In the second half of the film, Washington dispatches a multitude of baddies with methods that haven't been utilized in some time. He becomes a man on fire after living with subdued, emotional indifference for a long time. The problem is we don't know enough about his background to understand what brought him to that point. However, it doesn't take much for us to understand his new-found redemption in his relationship with Dakota Fanning as Pita. The film stretches credibility somewhat in the second half when Washington goes on his rampage, and many films like this become too formulaic and systematic in their execution. This film is not really an action/revenge film; it's a film about finding a purpose, fulfilling one's duty, and finding redemption. As such, the ending will be disappointing to those audience members that view this as solely an action/revenge film. The film is peopled with several good supporting actors in small roles: Christopher Walken, Rachel Ticotin, Giancarlo Giannini, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, and Mickey Rourke among them. All of them lend good support in a labyrinthine plot that redefines the already known corruption of Mexican officials. The film is both extremely sensitive and violent in turns, which is unusual for this type of subject matter. It's also rare to see an African-American protagonist, especially in this kind of film, that doesn't succumb to behavior and/or personality quirks that are typical of his culture or race. Not without some faults, including its possible over-length and music video-like moments, but still a very entertaining, intense film. *** of 4 stars."
"jotix100","7","2","4","31 May 2004"," Driving Miss Pita
","Maybe because director Tony Scott's background, this film, at times, feels and has the look of a dramatic musical video, or maybe a commercial for weapons of local destruction. The script by Brian Helgeland, the adapter of Mystic River, doesn't live to the original novel in which the movie is based on. <br/><br/>This tale of kidnapping and revenge gone wrong, will please a lot of people, but when one sits down to analyze the plot, a lot of things are not clearly answered. <br/><br/>We know that Creasy, the new body guard has a drinking problem. He likes his Jack Daniel more than he likes himself, or the young girl he is hired to protect. Gradually, he warms to Pita, who adores him instantly. When he is wounded in the kidnapping attempt, Creasy gets his act together and he is ready to kick ass. Only at that point the film comes alive.<br/><br/>Mr. Washington's scenes with Dakota Fanning, the precocious actress who plays Pita, are very well done. They are probably playing themselves pretending to be in a movie. Miss Fanning is an amazing girl, much older and wiser than her 9 years seem to indicate.<br/><br/>In the film the bad guys are Mexican. It's ironic that at the end, Mr. Scott has to dedicate the film to the wonderful and magical place that Mexico is. Sure, if I were Vicente Fox, Mexico's president, or the minister in charge of film licenses, I would have declared Mr. Scott as PNG (persona non grata) and would have made him pack up his gear and go north of the border to get the baddies, pimps and prostitutes and make his film in Hollywood spending about four or five times what the film ended up costing in Hollywood South."

The story has themes like love, friendship, pain, loss, self-sacrifice, despair, death, life, family, and finding a reason to live. So many themes.<br/><br/>I mean you got Denzel Washington who is great at what he does and Dakota Fanning who as a kid could expertly cry (e.g. War of the Worlds 2005) and can easily make you believe she is in serious distress. Radha Mitchell (the mom) did pretty good too. Giancarlo Giannini (director of the AFI) also did good, as did Rachel Ticotin (the reporter). Christopher Walken (Denzel's friend) did ok. Jesús Ochoa (a very bad guy) did good. Gero Camilo (someone's brother) did really good acting too. Overall, good American and Mexican cast.<br/><br/>The plot is great from start to finish. As the movie progressed, more and more layers to the plot are revealed with the addition of some nice amount of ""action"" as well. I really liked the fact that the movie took place in Mexico and that a couple pieces of their culture were showcased, which were corruption and impunity.

","The acting in this film is so unique in a way that only Tony Scott and Tarantino can pull off. It's phenomal! It's just a gift to everyone!! You've got a great cast of high-caliber actors, and the director did everything he could to not restrict anyone, and seemed to really let everyone be loose to see what kind of improvisational things they could do in the moment. I would bet $1000 that Tony Scott did not ever yell ""Just read the lines off the script"" during the filming of this movie. That's the part that puts this film in greatest of all time territory. Like Christopher Walken licking his fingers before uttering ""Creasy's art is death,"" is just something that no one else could really pull off, and I'll never forget.
The bond that builds throughout the film between Denzel and Dakota Fanning that starts with Denzel trying to push her away and then he just can't fight it anymore so he almost takes her under his wing like his own daughter creates this emotional bond to the film that I don't think has ever been done as powerfully in any other movie. What it does is set such a heavy anchor down that when the film takes are sharp left turn with Dakota being kidnapped I wanted so badly for Creasy to get his revenge on the kidnappers and any and all torture was totally justified! Denzel makes one promise to Dakota Fannings mom and that's that he's going to kill everyone involved with the kidnapping.
One crazy thing that I would have liked to have seen more detail about was how the lawyer(who is played by Mickey Rourke) is killed. It's like a ""WTF"" moment because Creasy goes to kill him, but by the time he gets there he's already dead floating in his pool with his throat slit and there's a bloody Japanese katana laying on his desk. Like It's Mexico City! When did the Akuza get involved in this and decide to kill the lawyer?? You can't just put a bloody katana at the scene of his death with no explanation!!
Anyways Despite the confusing lawyer death I still give it 10/10 and the best action movie I have ever seen."
"ferni-tierni","10","0","0","7 April 2020"," Analysis/Opinion Man on Fire demonstrates hope in the brink of catastrophe.
","Man on Fire demonstrates hope in the brink of catastrophe. Creasy is depressed and an alcoholic when he gets introduced to the stable, religious, and happy Ramos family. He gets resistant to establish a connection with Pita, but as the plot unfolds he inevitably develops a very strong bond with her. Dakota Fanning does a brilliant performance as the sassy, know-it-all, tender kid that wants to have friends. The connection between Creasy and Pita gets excellently driven by the mentor/father type of relationship, and the movie immediately showcases the inadequacies that Samuel Ramos had as an authoritative father.<br/><br/>The transformation of Creasy is clearly displayed on screen as he starts to get closer to god and less to his addiction. At the peak of Creasy's stability is when Pita gets abducted. This is when we get to know the destructive side of Creasy. The death artist as he is christened by Rayburn. He created killing people into an art, by instituting justice in a broken system that was Mexico's judicial system. The movie crudely shows the revenge scenes where Creasy goes full sanguinary on the judiciales. Those moments were an exciting addition to the whole revenge story that was being built from the start of the movie. Oddly enough you start to feel that they deserve a cruel punishment for abducting and killing a child.<br/><br/>The religious references were also a maybe necessary adornment to the gloomy and gory atmosphere that was created. Saint Jude of desperate and lost causes was a beautiful memento that Pita and Creasy shared where they connected, and he finally was able to rest in peace after getting some redemption. At the beginning of the movie Creasy asked Rayburn if he believed there was any forgiveness for what they did, and at the end of the movie Creasy found his forgiveness by saving Pita and being protected by Saint Jude.<br/><br/>The movie gives a bit of bad reputation to Mexico, but it was an interesting take on Mexican corruption and how enmeshed it is in government systems, to the point that the police works together with the criminals to abduct children. The first scene that we see in the movie is the declaration that there is one kidnapping every 60 minutes in Latin America and that 70% of the people do not survive. That is enough statistics to merit a story that emphasizes the problem that exists in Latin America."

It was like two different films.<br/><br/>It wasn't that battle-mode Washington was bad, it was just that it broke the continuity.

Preceding ""Taken"" by two years, this film still owes some of its story nuance to ""Commando"", which pioneered the ""bad mofo rescuing young girl"" formula.<br/><br/>Tony Scott's glossy, slick look with over-saturated color is fully on display here, and his frenetic style is replete with the required quick cuts. It totally works, and adds to the mood and atmosphere that Scott sets. The tone of the movie is quite dark and grim, and it compliments Scott's style very well.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington graces the film and the viewer's line of sight with his presence, looking just as cool and awesome as he usually does. He gives his awe in this performance, as usual, but he's not the usual likable, everyman Denzel. He's more stoic and reserved, and totally fits the role. Christopher Walker is also awesome in a supporting role.<br/><br/>This gritty action crime thriller is accentuated with graphic and gritty violence, though to call it an action film is generous. There aren't really action sequences per se. There's a great street shootout, another street scene where Denzel blows up a car with a bazooka, and a scene in a house where a dude's hand is shot off. This is not an action-packed movie like ""Taken"", and though it has the same themes, it chooses to to emphasize the melodrama and human side than the action, which totally works.<br/><br/>This is one of the many awesome masterpieces that Tony Scott has made, which makes sense since he's one of the greatest film directors of all time.

","2 May 2004. It's not easy to blend the movie genres of action and drama into a composite whole successfully along with bits of independent film editing and photographic techniques. Tony Scott has presented the audience with a toned-down action film with a heightened sense of drama between Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning (from SciFi Channel's ""Taken"") and included ""Proof of Life,"" and ""Traffic"" concepts to make a rather marketable product with a new look. While the ending is a bit Americanized and there are some rather ludicrous plot devices involved with Denzel Washington's skill and almost superhuman stamina (compare Sylvester Stallone in ""The Specialist"") the overall movie is a solid presentation with a much stronger emotional content, meaningful dialogue.

"flicklover","10","0","0","6 January 2019"," A very effective revenge story!!!
","Man On Fire is a film that i.have seen now many times. The truth is that the story is really just a run of the mill revenge story. What makes this film so good is the acting and the execution if the story. Denzel Washington has always elevated any film that he's in just by his presence. His performance in this film is one of his best. He takes the material to a much higher level.<br/><br/>The basic story is that John Creasy, the character played by Denzel Washington is hired by a young wealthy couple in Mexico to protect their daughter Pita, played by Dakota Fanning. Creasy is an ex-Special Forces operative that is an alcoholic and hates his life. He us full of guilt at all of the things that he has done. He goes to Mexico to see an old friend named Rayburn played by Christopher Walken. Rayburn offers him the job to protect the daughter of Samuel Ramos played by Marc Anthony. He and his wife Lisa played by Radha Mitchell need to hire a bodyguard to fulfill the requirements of their kidnap and ransom insurance since they live in Mexico City where there are a lot of kidnappings. Once Creasy arrives, Pita wants to befriend him. He resists and tells her that he is not being paid to be her friend. One night, Creasy tries to kill himself with a gun but the cartridge fails to fire. Pita persists in getting Creasy to open up and gradually he does. He helps her with her swimming competition, and they talk while she does homework. Slowly, Creasy begins to care very much for Pita. He even tries to stop drinking. One day while waiting for Pita to finish her piano lesson he notices so.e cars pull up to where she is waiting for Creasy, they are there to kidnap the girl. A shootout ensues and after Creasy is able to kill a couple of the kidnappers he is shot and Pita is taken. Initially, in the hospital Creasy is a suspect in the kidnapping and is going to charge with the killing of two police officers that were part of the kidnapping. Fearing that Creasy would be killed by the police, an agent of the AFI named Manzano and Rayburn take Creasy out of the hospital to protect him. Meanwhile,the kidnapper called The Voice contacts Samuel Ramos about negotiating ransom for Pita. Samuel is assisted by his lawyer played by Mickey Rourke. After tget agree to a place for the money drop their is an ambush and the money is stolen. After the ambush apparently Pita is killed. When Rayburn tells Creasy about Pita being dead, Creasy decides to find and kill all of those involved in the kidnapping and death of the girl. Rayburn helps him obtain some weapons and Creasy begins to investigate. The film at that point becomes what really could have been just a standard revenge film. Creasy goes and finds the perpetrators and kills them one by one, finding out more about the scheme to kidnap Pira along the way. The difference here is that before the revenge aspect of the film starts the film takes its time in exploring Creasy, Denzel Washington is great at showing the pain that Creasy is in and his lack of will to go on. Dakota Fanning is terrific as Pita. She comes across as a good but precocious girl that seems lonely. The chemistry between Washington and Fanning is really good. The scenes between them come of as very real. They don't come off as cute, but have a real tenderness that works. We get to like and feel for Creasy and Pita, so when she is gone and Creasy goes out for revenge there is an emotional core there that makes what's going on more compelling. The film is directed by Tony Scott with a lot of visual flair which is usual for him but he plays good attention to the characters in the story. Needless to say Creasy gets the bad guys and the film ends in a more or less predictable manner but is done with such conviction that it works."

","The movie sets up the plot really good, covering a real world problem that faces us as people. The characters each have a really interesting backgrounds, the only problem I have with these sort of movies is that the good guys drive cars that stand out because in the movies the important cars are always black and either a Mercedes or a big Chevrolet suv. The ending is so emotional that I was crying."

","Despite the film's predictability, thanks to Denzel Washington's presence, it manages to stay interesting throughout. 
A typical revenge story here, with Denzel playing a mysterious bodyguard, who, seeking redemption for his past sins, accepts a job offer to guard rich parents' (Radha Mitchell and Marc Anthony) daughter named Lupita (Dakota Fanning) in the midst of a highly active kidnapping the rich kids season in Mexico City. 
What makes this film standout from amongst it's genre peers is the level of intensity, which isn't lowered from beginning to end, with a few minor coffee breaks here and there. 
It is well acted, with Washington stealing the show with his portrayal of this complex character, with barely any backstory, but still interesting enough to root for. The supporting cast consisting of such well-established names in Hollywood as Christopher Walker and Mickey Rourke felt kinda misused, and their screen time is extremely short. Especially Rourke. With his charisma, there could have been so much more to his lawyer character then we got. 
I absolutely loved direction and effective editing, with it all being flavored by an awesome soundtrack. 
The plot, though, could have been better structured then it is done here. The antagonist is an empty space. As sad as it sounds. I did not buy into the whole ""plot twist"" either. The script just seemed unfinished, as if it was completed as they were going. 
Overall, the film is more then watchable. The ending is surprisingly satisfying, and the production is top notch. But the story and it's main concept was a huge ditch, leaving much to be desired. I'm scoring it 7/10. It's a great film, but could have been so much better."

","So i'm aware that when rating Man on Fire with 8, i'm giving it more than i gave other movies with possible better overall actor's performance (let me revise that, probable not possible), better directing or even better stories. But when i'm rating the movie, i'm not rating each of this aspect and then deliberate what the appropriate rating should be by balancing this marks; no, i'm not a professional movie critic and in any case i don't know how they rate their movies. I'm ratting it as a whole, as an assemble, without actually thinking of each of its components, and that's why Man on Fire gets a 8 rating, because the outcome of more than 2 hours feels like a 8 out of 10. If I like to remember Denzel, i'd like to remember him for roles like this one, if i like to remember Walken it is for performances like this one, same for Dakota. I liked the soundtrack, the story was fine and developed not too fast, not too slow, the direction didn't bother me. I got more than i expected, and i didn't think i'll give a movie with Marc Anthony as an actor such a high rating, but i did and i'm pleased that i did. Certainly, things are always possible to have been made better, but i'm thinking that everything matched the other in this movie, they were all at about the same level. If a better direction would be made it could expose flaws in acting, if a better cast would have been put together, maybe flaws in the story would be more obvious; but just as it is everything seems to be in its place, not too much not too little of it. In my opinion this movie is one of those we'll miss when we'll see the latest Denzel's, Walken's or Dakota's films, because they don't make them like this anymore."
"Maziun","7","0","0","22 June 2013"," Good action/thriller
","Man on fire"" is a good movie that ranges in tone from sentimental to brutal . It's the second adaptation of A.J Quinnell's novel with the same title . The first was made in the 80's . Denzel Washington is great as Creasy , a former CIA assassin who searches for redemption . He's got a death wish and he tries to find meaning of life in Bible and alcohol . A friend (Christopher Walken ) finds him a job in Mexico City as a bodyguard . He has to protect Pita (Dakota Fanning) – daughter of wealthy family from kidnapping . Mexico City in this movie is a grim and unpleasant place where almost every day people are kidnapped . If you thought that only movies from 70's and 80's were able to show big cities as hell on Earth you're wrong. Kidnapping , violence , greed , corruption – it's all here. No wonder Quentin Tarantino likes this movie. Anyway , friendship is growing slowly between Creasy and Pita . The relationship between them kinda reminds me of the relationship between Natalie Portman and Jean Reno in ""Leon"". Creasy becomes a father figure for Pita and she in return brings some joy in his life. Tony Scott (RIP) was able to capture those intimate moments beautifully. Washington and Fanning have a great chemistry together. <br/><br/>You have to wait for some action until the half of movie , when the tragedy occurs . The first half of the movie feels like a melodrama ( a good one I must say ) , while the second half turns into detective story (Creasy is searching for answers and eliminating bad guys ) . I was all in tears at the end.<br/><br/>Washington gives a very emotional and engaging role . Creasy tries to appear stoic for the whole world , but the viewer is able to feel his pain in smallest gestures or words . Fanning makes Pita an incredible lovely , easy-going but also quite mature character . I'm surprised she didn't received Oscar nominee for her role.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke also appear in this movie and give a solid support . I wish we could see more of Walken's character . He's good in his role , but I still feel he was kinda wasted in here.<br/><br/>Tony Scott makes this movie more than just a simple ""revenge movie"" . His able to capture the drama , while still making the movie entertaining and never boring despite it's quite long time. The screenplay written by Brian Helgeland is intelligent and gives ""MOF"" a feel of 70's movie . Some of the dialogues are wonderful and very memorable : <br/><br/>-""A man can be an artist. In anything, food, whatever. It depends on how good he is at it. Creasey's art is death. He's about to paint his masterpiece"". <br/><br/>-""Forgiveness is between them and God. It's my job to arrange the meeting "" <br/><br/><ul><li>""I am the sheep that got lost, Madre "" </li></ul><br/><br/>Paul Cameron's cinematography is stylish , while the Editing by Christian Wagner has clarity. I still think the movie is too flashy for it's own good . It was probably supposed to create a chaotic feeling matching Creasy's emotions. I understand that , but it was over-used . After some time my eyes were tired and I was really glad for every scene without flashy visuals . Oh , and the movie is half an hour too long.<br/><br/>There is some raw brutality in this action drama . The scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful . There are some nasty murder and torture scenes here. Good music too. Overall , this is a good movie from Tony Scott . I give it 8/10."

","I am not a big fan of D Washington but Man of Fire is a good movie. Washington plays the serious quiet role excellently. I doubt we will ever see Washington do a comedy! Man on Fire is about an ex government agent out for revenge. The Man on Fire is well motivated, and quietly good at his craft. One sees how the mind of an assassin works. The movie has the predictable surprise plot twist at the end. Watchable and entertaining. Man on Fire is well directed and acted. I found the movie left a message about how evil people can be. Man on Fire reminds me of the 1970's Charles Bronson movie era. I give Man on Fire a seven out of ten."

","This film tells the story of a former US Marine, John W Creasy, who is haunted by his experiences and dark memories of when he participated in numerous counter-terrorism black ops. He travels to Mexico to visit his old friend and army buddy, who works as a security detail for some Japanese businessmen. His friend persuades him to settle for a while in Mexico and recommends him for a bodyguard job, guarding Pita, the young daughter of a rich couple in Mexico City. Pita shows Creasy ""that it's alright to live again"" and a strong bond forms between the two, only to be shattered by Pita's kidnapping. Creasy swears revenge and goes after the kidnapper's and Pita's fate.<br/><br/>The film has excellent cinematography, with hand-held camera during most of the film. The first hour focuses a lot on the characters, which is something rarely done by action films. This allows the viewer to immerse himself in the story and get quite invested in Creasy's and Pita's friendship and later on to Creasy's quest. The acting is superb, and it's worthy to note here, that Dakota Fanning plays an excellent child character. Very rarely, do I see children actors perform so well, and usually they just end up being annoying and unnecessary characters. In this case, Fanning will give you one more reason to cheer when Denzel Washington goes to town with the baddies.<br/><br/>The film suggests at the end that it's a true story, but it's not. It's a remake from 1987, and it's based on the first of a series of books of military/action fiction, about the character of Creasy.<br/><br/>My only pick with the film is the ending (SPOILER ALERT): At the end we see Creasy tracking down the boss kidnapper's family and holding them hostage. He contacts the kidnapper and offers their lives in exchange for the kidnapper to turn himself over to Creasy. The kidnapper reveals that he has Pita alive and well and that he'll give her back, in exchange for his family AND Creasy's life. Creasy agrees without hesitation and surrenders. Where this ""sacrifice"" makes for a dramatic end, it is an overly unnecessary one. First off, Creasy already holds ransom the kidnapper's brother, pregnant wife and her children. This should have been more than enough as a bargaining chip. Secondly, he's shot on the chest earlier, but could have easily survived that if he seeked medical attention from one of the numerous allies he has in town, so giving himself up because ""he's already dead"" is not a valid reason. So what Creasy does is highly illogical and as I said again, and can not emphasize this enough UNNECESSARY. The only reason it's there is to make the audience cry or something, but if Tony Scott wanted to end with a sacrifice, he should have built it up in a way that it didn't feel forced. A sacrifice is dramatic when it is a sacrifice that must be done otherwise there can be no victory. Otherwise it just leaves you with a bitter feeling. Also, the film was not based on a true story as the film suggests at the end, so the sacrifice was not something that happened in real life either way. (SPOILER ENDS)"

Also, two key scenes with Mickey Rourke were not used that would have added much to the film- especially the one where he gets killed.

","SPOILER ALERT! From my perspective, this is a very well-crafted film, and we must give credit to director Tony Scott.<br/><br/>He begins by casting one of America's most reliable actors in the lead role -- Denzel Washington. And this performance of Denzel's is excellent because he is walking the tightrope of a man who is seemingly a failure and an alcoholic, but who learns to want to redeem himself because of the little girl he is protecting. And, here, he even has the ""look"" of someone struggling with alcoholism. And talk about being gritty!!!! He certainly is in the second half of this film.<br/><br/>Naturally, in a film about kidnapping, there are good guys and bad guys. And one of the questions here is -- is one of the ""good guys"" really a ""bad guy"". To tease us, Scott selected Christopher Walken as one of the ""good guys"" -- a friend and former associate of Washington's character -- and Mickey Rourke as the lawyer of the kidnapped girl's father. Now we know the kind of roles each of these movie sleaze-balls often plays, so the viewer's mind suspects them throughout the film. And then there's the victim -- Dakota Fanning -- who was only 10 years old when she made this film...and turns in a simply remarkable performance. And to top things off, Marc Anthony (the singer) plays Dakota's father (and does reasonably well in his acting), although the better performance is by Radha Mitchell, as the mother.<br/><br/>Yes, much of the early plot is fairly predictable -- it's clear from the beginning that Fanning will be kidnapped, it doesn't take long to figure out that she and Washington will develop a special rapport, and it's clear that Washington will rescue her. Nevertheless, it's so well crafted and well acted that it doesn't matter...the film still holds your attention. And in the second half of the film there are some twists -- reasonable ones -- but surprising nonetheless. And, the ending is not what you will expect.<br/><br/>The photography is a little harsh, but in this case it adds to the suspense.<br/><br/>This is a great film, that although long, will keep your attention. Highly recommended."

True retribution for those who profit from the misery of others, Denzel Washington (as bodyguard Jon W. Creasy) paints his ""masterpiece"" in his acting career by visiting death upon anyone who profited from the kidnapping of his charge, the amazingly gifted Dakota Fanning in Mexico City. His systematic approach to finding those behind the layers of protection provided by corrupt cops and an ineffective judicial system is awe inspiring and makes you say ""finally"" if only to yourself. Christopher Walken adds his talent to the pool in describing Creasy as an artist whose craft is death and warns the seemingly only non corrupt police commissioner to ""stay out of his way...he'll deliver more justice than 10 years of your judicial courts"". Why this movie reverberates so much with me? Because there is none of this PC endings that the vast majority of movies today end with...the protagonist catching a criminal who without a doubt of his guilt deserves death....but stays his hand in favor of handing him over to the justice system for punishment. That this wastes countless millions of dollars and provides an industry for morally corrupt defense lawyers usually counting on technicalities to get their clients acquitted is something that has always struck me as incredibly wasteful.

","""Man on Fire"" is an emotionally riveting action-thriller and crime saga complete with solid acting, captivating visuals, a strong script and excellent direction. Denzel Washington delivers a powerful performance as burned-out CIA agent John Creasy who takes a job in the as a bodyguard for Lupita Ramos, daughter of Samuel and Lisa Ramos in a turbulent and violent period in Mexico's history. Kidnapping's occur daily. Families live in constant fear. The police are corrupt and inept as stopping the violence. All these factors contribute to the film's excellent build up to the movie's finale where Creasy embodies the films title.<br/><br/>In the interest of keeping this review short: I love this movie. I loved the performances (Dakoda Fanning is going to be one of this generation's break out stars and delivered a perfect performance). I loved the realism of the film in exposing the corruption of the Mexican government. The story captivated my senses and threw me into a fantasy world that realistically could never exist (the revenge plot). The film is a tragedy in a way because I have visited Mexico a number of times and love the food, people, and culture. It's sad to see what it has become today.<br/><br/>The twists and turns of the movie take some thinking, but ultimately the viewer is able to put the pieces together and figure out what really went down.<br/><br/>Excellent performances by Walken, Mitchel, and Anthony! <br/><br/>On a side note, I agree with another reviewer that audiences go to movies nowadays with too high of expectations. Its entertainment folks! Want to your life changed? Visit your local church. Until then, sit back, relax, open a cold one and enjoy the ride! <br/><br/>To address some of the criticisms:<br/><br/>1. Annoying editing <br/><br/>There seems to be a sizable number of people annoyed with the films ""Meth Head"" editing style. This decision on the part of director Tony Scott was implemented to give the viewer an insight into the mind of the film's protagonist (Creasy). We see and feel the anguish and torment of Creasy. It is far from distracting (want a real headache? Watch Cloverfield or REC then get back to me on this film). It works. With the use of subtitles, I actually learned a few Spanish phrases as well. <br/><br/>2.Too violent <br/><br/>This movie is called ""Man on Fire"" for a reason folks. It's a revenge story. What are you expecting? I for one fully supported Creasy's methods in the film (too bad it cannot work realistically). This is exactly how you deal with the scum of the earth. If you really want to see violence and torture, Google search photos of what the drug cartels do their opponents today in the real world (one photo had mutilated body parts littered across a city's sidewalk and one person's face completely removed from his skull). Batman should take notice: you don't negotiate or reason with terrorists – you kill them! Ray said it best: ""He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than all your courts and tribunals combined, just stay out of his way."" If your not one for violence, stay clear of this film."

","This film works so well, partly due to the fact it's based on a true story, is a revenge flick but has a soul to it without being a vehicle to justify copious and profusely bleeding baddies for Denzel.<br/><br/>The story takes a while to get going, but once it does, it doesn't really let up. Denzel is Creasey, a mysterious and stoic former soldier now turned soldier of fortune/ bodyguard with a strong predilection for booze. Walken is now trying to shake the creepy villain role with him as Creasey's war buddy who does private security ""ferrying workers"" across the Rio Grande from El Paso to Mexico to work. He takes on a job merely to ingratiate himself to Rayburn, Walken's character.<br/><br/>Then the daughter, Pita takes a fondness to Creasey much to his chagrin as he's not particularly social or fond of anything besides Jack Daniels. What works is the reticent chemistry between Pita and Creasey who later comes to reciprocate his fondness of Pita's charm. Much like Mathilda and Leon in The Professional. Sans the sexual innuendo and alcohol.<br/><br/>The narrative actually has a poignancy as it begins with Creasey's self-destruction, and becomes a love story and eventually descends into the dark recesses of a revenge flick. Scott actually let the story breathe and didn't try to cut corners for the sake of action. Actually, he did the story justice by exploring the relationship of Pita and Creasey, thereby giving the viewer a place as the 3rd person among Pita and Creasey.<br/><br/>All of this culminates in a dark juxtaposition to the jovial friendship as Creasey goes to seeking trouble in the form of revenge, and finds Pita's abductors.<br/><br/>This is evidence that Scott is capable like his brother Ridley to tell a story that does not necessitate blowing things up when he works with Bruckheimer.<br/><br/>Maybe Scott had something to say or prove to his critics . Because he followed this up with...Domino? A movie made just to justify his ""exorcising his rock and roll demons"" in the same aesthetic he uses in Man on Fire. More kinectic and saturated shots combined with rapid fire editing and under/overexposed frames."

Both 'sides' take hits, to the bad guys (including cops) there are 4 down, to the good guys – namely Creasy – he is left for dead in a pool of his own blood and awakens days later from life support to be told that Peta is dead. A victim of a failed ransom handover that turned into a shootout.<br/><br/>Furthermore he receives the good news that as the 'America' he is initially somehow to blame for all of this.<br/><br/>Well Creasy ain't havin' it. Without waiting around for the proper rehabilitation he heads out; not to solve the case but 'kill anyone there, anyone associated or anyone who profited' from the abduction of Peta. He receives Lisa's full endorsement, asks Walken for help and is offered assistance from a female reporter tired of the injustices who feels that a rogue Creasy will achieve more than the cops who are all either corrupt or focused on 'live' cases.<br/><br/>Man on Fire is actually far more violent and aggressive than 90% of Denzel movies, as he uncovers the truth and traces the leads back to those who ordered the kidnapping Creasy leaves a trail of tortured, bloodied bodies in his wake. He doesn't mince words or waste time moralising, if you fit the criteria as being marked for death then death is what you shall have and you ain't gonna like it when it arrives (ummmmm, ass-bomb?).<br/><br/>I should also mention some of the more effective use of subtitles this side of the Crank films (for different reasons I guess), in Man on Fire the subtitles become part of the film, making them easier to read and interpret (I mean from an urgency and intensity standpoint, not language.) As always Tony Scott proves he is a better director than given credit for, especially for 'movies' instead of 'films'. His 'movies' are action packed and always geared more towards the entertaining than the preaching, teaching or seeking critical acclaim. His recent runaway train flick Unstoppable was way more entertaining than it had a right to be and Déjà vu is a totally underrated and too frequently ignored gem.<br/><br/>It is all too easy to complain about a director getting things wrong and then clumsily inserting your own 'if only he did this' stuff, but with Scott it is quite often the case that revisiting the film in retrospect shows that he got it all right. He seldom aims for the stars with his flicks but always seems to make the best of what he has available to him, thankfully that often means Mr Denzel Washington, one of the most reliable men in Hollywood.<br/><br/>That helps.<br/><br/>In saying that if I had a diss at Man on Fire it is too long at 140 minutes. But rather than just being a question man I will also be an answer man: the swimming training sequences could have easily lost 10-15, the casing the bad guys another 15. This film loses 20 odd minutes and it is instantly a lean, mean 8 / 10. As it stands it remains a slightly bloated, violent revenge flick that builds speed nearer the end.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. Not as good as Déjà vu and probably less entertaining than Unstoppable, but Man on Fire gives Tony Scott and Denzel Washington 3 for 3 in the 'worthwhile' stakes."

","A lot of people have panned this movie and as my heading states I am going to end up saying this every time I review a movie. If you go into every movie expecting to have your life changed for the better and that the two hours you spend are going to greatly enrich your self worth you are going to be disappointed with 99% of the films that have ever been made. Man On Fire is cool. It is 2 hours+ of entertainment. Denzel does what Denzel does: he's hard at the beginning, begins to bond with the girl (Dakota Fanning, who does a good job) and just as their relationship as mentor to student is beginning to mature she is taken. Long story short, Denzel kills his way to the top of the kidnapping ring. Most of he negatives I hear about this flick are based on the way it is edited and the relationship between Denzel and Dakota. First of all, the movie is put together in an interesting way. There's stop and go footage and the subtitles aren't just streaming across the bottom of the screen. There's some usage of color and music that I think is pretty cool too. As far as the relationship between the two main characters: she's a smart little girl who he thinks he's not going to like. They end up finding a common bond in swimming and they develop a friendship. Any deeper than that and the movie is eight hours long. Brass tacks: Man On Fire is an entertaining movie and is well worth your time and cost of a Netflix. When did everyones movie viewing time get so important?"

"james-keith","9","0","0","16 June 2010"," Revenge and Punishment
","Man on Fire (2004) takes place in Mexico City where a number of kidnappings have swept through the area. John W. Creasy (Denzel Washington) is an ex-CIA operative/assassin and an alcoholic who visits his old friend Paul Rayburn (Christopher Walken) in Mexico City. Rayburn gets Creasy a job being the bodyguard to Samuel and Lisa Ramos' (Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell) nine-year-old daughter Lupita ""Pita"" Ramos (Dakota Fanning). Pita brings the meaning of life back to Creasy and he develops an affection for her. When Pita is kidnapped and presumed dead, Creasy promises to killing anyone involved in, or profiting from, her abduction. <br/><br/>The theme of this film is revenge and punishment. Creasy is willing to give his life to punish those responsible for Pita's kidnapping. In some way, Creasy is also punishing himself for the terrible acts he committed while working for the CIA. This idea is supported in a few different forms. The first is Creasy's constant drinking and the lack of interest in life. Secondly, Creasy tries to commit suicide. This scene is lead by Creasy making aware that he was once religious, but now is not, by finishing a verse from the Bible that Sister Anna, Pita's teacher, started. Creasy then hurts Pita's feelings by being cold to her in the car. That night Creasy drinks heavily, wondering if God will ever forgive him for what he has done in his CIA days. Creasy then loads a single bullet into his gun, puts the barrel on his head, and pulls the trigger. However, the bullet did not fire (almost like faith) and it is from this point on Creasy grows closer to Pita. Lastly, Creasy sacrifice's himself for Pita's safe exchange and knows that he will ultimately die as a result.<br/><br/>Man on Fire is similar to Taken (2008), starring Liam Neeson. In both films the main characters, John W. Creasy and Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), are retired government agents and have extensive skills in killing. Pita and Kim (Maggie Grace), Mills' daughter, both are kidnapped and Creasy and Mills go after the ones who are responsible, showing no mercy. <br/><br/>The techniques used in Man on Fire play a significant role in supporting the theme. There are two prominent styles or techniques in the film when transitions take place. One style is a very calm, ""normal like"" transition between shot-to-shot and scene-to-scene. The other is very frazzled, confusing, even violent style for the shot-to-shot and scene-to-scene transitions. The audience is actually exposed to this violent technique of editing in the beginning of the film before the title is displayed. The introductory scene shows a man and woman walking peacefully together through a crowd of people in Mexico City. The transitions between shots are made up of flashes and multiple images of the same shot, layered on top of one another. Each ""layer"" is at a different zoom position creating a chilling ""ghost"" effect. The there are church bells ringing, children laughing, ""swooshes"" sounds, thunder, and a choir singing lightly during these frazzled cuts. Then an industrial music track cuts in stopping all previous sounds just as a car pulls up and men violently kidnap the man who was walking with the woman. The music is somewhat loader than the previous sounds and there is screaming in the background. The kidnappers through the man into the car and drive off. Then the title, Man on Fire, is displayed.<br/><br/>After the introductory scene, the film is shot in a more normal manner with straightforward transitions and no dramatically sounds. However, this all changes the moment Pita is kidnapped. The cuts from shot-to- shot and scene-to-scene become more dark and violent reflecting Creasy's state of mind. In the scene that the first person Creasy captures and tortures for information, the same industrial music from the beginning of the film starts playing, indicating the violence that will follow. This scene is the ""tipping point"" of the film. From here, the film is much more violent than the first half. Creasy is on a one-way path to get revenge on those involved in Pita's kidnapping. As the Mexican police detective questions Rayburn to better understand Creasy, Rayburn tells the Mexican police detective ""a man can be an artist, Creasy's art is death... he's about to paint his masterpiece."""

","Basically, the movie might be one of the most mesmerizing titles made by either of the two Scotts(Ridley and Tony). Let's make it straight, the movie deserved its hype as one of the most stylish actioner/thriller ever made.<br/><br/>When it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts really make a perfect duo. Both this movie and Deja Vu are better thrillers you can expect. Washington really got very comfortable in the shaky cameras and every executing scenes in the movie. One would easily be related to his character's emotions therefore enjoyed all the killings on the road. It's a success that they created a super-dark Mexico city with a lot of shits happening. One would be easily convinced by the extent of corruption depicted in Man On Fire. I don't know what would the Mexicans think when they watch this......<br/><br/>Well, let's face it again. It's among the best of the Death Wish genre, but it also suffered from extensive amount of violence. It's a bit annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the movie very realistic and let Denzel Washington play the ""missing sheep"" type of tragic hero. In the end, they even had the kidnapper shot in his own swimming pool like a documentary. I was checking on IMDb if the movie was based on real events for that...... So that's for your consideration if you also finds the movie's theme is a little bit phony.<br/><br/>At the end, I hope one would not take this movie for real.<br/><br/>8/10 for art direction/editing/cinematographic/Denzel Washington."

","Revenge is the theme of this Denzel Washington thriller that offers its share of action, mayhem, murder and grisly bloodletting. The essentials are a bodyguard's search and destroy mission as his charge, young Dakota Fanning, is kidnapped from school, which is exactly what Washington was hired to prevent. The Mexico City locations are as chaotic as the storyline moves towards its predictable, violent conclusion, with plot twists along the way. Washington, a former CIA operative with a drinking problem, gets a good reference from a former fellow agent which sets in motion the plot's outline. Washington and Fanning have a great chemistry between them and after a troublesome beginning, the bodyguard and his charge become the best of friends.

","Denzel Washington is a fine actor but, for me, he's at his weakest when playing villains (American Gangster), or troubled, moody men as he does here. That's not to say he doesn't give a good performance, but he wouldn't have been my choice for the part of John Creasey, a disillusioned, borderline alcoholic former agent who takes a job as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy young Mexican man and his American wife. The Mexican guy isn't as wealthy as many people believe, which is why he employs Creasey, a choice he comes to regret when little Pita (Dakota Fanning) is predictably kidnapped.<br/><br/>Man on Fire isn't exactly a forthcoming film, releasing information to the viewer on a strictly need-to-know basis (if that). As far as I'm aware, we never find out how Creasey came by the wounds on the back of his hand that Scott's cameraman seems so fascinated by, nor much about why he is so troubled in the film's early stages. It's almost as if a whole chunk of back story has been unceremoniously dumped in an attempt to trim down a running time which, at nearly two-and-a-half-hours, is still twenty minutes too long.<br/><br/>Creasey develops a close relationship with his precocious little charge (Fanning's character is eight-going-on-forty-five) which is over-played a little immediately before her abduction, and he is overcome with a murderous desire for vengeance when he awakens from a coma to discover the handover of the ransom money was botched and she has been murdered. Before you can say 'superhero' Creasey is ignoring the two bullet wounds he has recently suffered and running around Mexico City knocking off members of the shadowy organisation he discovers are responsible for her death.<br/><br/>This is an entertaining enough film, and the plot holes aren't too irritating, even though one of the twists is fairly predictable. I was definitely entertained as I watched, and the lengthy running time only started to tell in the last reel as the film seemed to struggle to tie up all its loose ends. Scott's edgy style of direction works very well at some points but smacks of 'look at me' self-satisfaction at other times and, as is so often the case, the flashy direction merely serves to distance the viewer from the story as we focus on all the jigging about the picture is doing (when I was a kid we'd have had the TV repairman out to some of the stuff that's going on here.) The story itself becomes less of a study of one man's slow descent into self-destruction (which isn't really that interesting anyway) and more of a straightforward action-revenge movie following Creasey's emergence from his coma – which is probably when most of the target audience will perk up.<br/><br/>Creasey's methods of execution are certainly imaginative: I'm pretty sure that never before in the history of cinema has a character suffered death by 'bum bomb' before so Man on Fire can give itself a little 'pat' on the back for that one, although personally I can't imagine any injustice great enough to compel me to consider going anywhere near another man's bottom to seek revenge. I've got to admit that, for one mad moment, I did think that was going to be the movie's final twist, judging by how gingerly Denzel hobbled over that bridge to meet his fate, but thankfully it wasn't to be."

The daughter play by Dakota Fanning is smart, likable and chatty, she gets along with everyone, even Washington who is resistant to allow his feelings come out (due to his turbulent past involving his job). This relationship between Washington and Fanning's characters is the cornerstone of the movie and takes a little bit before they really let each other both in. When Pita (Fanning) says to her bodyguard ""Creasy, You're smiling"" we really see how much of a liking these two have for each other.

","Denzel Washington takes on a Bruce Willis role in MAN ON FIRE and does a great job. He plays a burned-out operative who agrees to guard the daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a wealthy family living in Mexico. Not surprisingly, she ends up kidnapped, he is nearly killed, and it quickly becomes apparent he was hired to be the dupe. Instead of returning to the states, he goes after the kidnappers. The rest of the film is pure action and nasty revenge, as he has been told the girl is dead. A great vehicle for Washington, wonderfully written and directed, but with some rather oddball artsy photography that detracts (see it and decide for yourself). Christopher Walken plays an old agency buddy, and Giancarlo G. is an investigator. One of Washington's best and unfortunately rarely seen on TV."
"neil-476","9","0","0","11 January 2009"," Hard but excellent
","This is a startlingly good revenge movie.<br/><br/>Washington's burnt-out bodyguard is given plenty of time to establish where he is starting from as Dakota Fanning's Pita, his young charge, begins to work some healing magic on him. The fact that this relationship takes nearly the first half of the film to build, and doesn't simply happen, makes it the more realistic. Therefore, when the inevitable kidnapping takes place and the ransom delivery is bungled with horrible consequences, Washington's icy and implacable (and almost stately) march of revenge is completely understandable - this is personal.<br/><br/>All the cast are quite excellent, but it's good to see a streak of mercilessness cutting through Washington's normal civilised facade.<br/><br/>I had it in mind that a particular individual was involved from fairly early on, and wasn't too surprised when it came out. And I had a horrible feeling that Hollywood was going to do its usual copping out towards the end which, sure as shooting, it did. The ending was good, but the alternate on the DVD was better.<br/><br/>Highly recommended although beware the violence factor."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","0","13 July 2008"," Washington asserting family values? Not so much. But it's a thrill ride.
","You kind of get exactly what you expect out of ""Man on Fire."" Denzel Washington kills people, there some seriously innovative and abstract camera-work and editing from one of the finest action directors in the last 20 years (Tony Scott), and there's even a mystery to unravel. The film even bravely attempts to bring in a family oriented theme in what it tries to sell as an unlikely relationship between Washington and Fanning. But understand that this is an action film first, and even if it takes about an hour to get that, it's the truth. It's good, but it's mostly an artistic action piece. <br/><br/>Washington's bad ass named John this time is known as just ""Creasy."" From the start he is an enigma. All you can really tell is he's sort of a war-torn alcoholic ex-US Intelligence assassin. With no other direction in life, he agrees to take a job as a body guard for a wealthy guy in Mexico City (Marc Anthony), where many kidnappings have been happening recently. There he forms this ""unlikely bond"" with the daughter Fanning, who of all her roles, this is the least annoying I've seen. She breaks his tough skin and then things take a scary turn when she is kidnapped. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, that above paragraph is the first hour of the film. I understand the need to establish the relationship, but it all kind of becomes amoral anyway when Creasy decides he's going to kill everyone tied to the kidnapping. The rest of the film is Creasy seeing red and just taking it to everyone. As much as you understand the motivation, it just doesn't click right when he goes on this spree. He's very good in the role--outstanding I would say, but as a film the cohesiveness doesn't exactly work. I would give high marks to both halves of the film, but they don't exactly mesh together.<br/><br/>Scott's use of flashing and repetitive images that he slows down and speeds up works better in the second half to accommodate the intense revenge/action scenes, but it feels a bit out of place in the beginning. Scott usually only uses it as it ties in to Creasy's past, but his past is not exactly something the film explores--it sort of takes it for granted. In general though, it's cool and unique and shows why Tony Scott is capable of handling any action film.<br/><br/>I think what I'm saying is go in for Denzel and for the action, but I think that's what most people interested in watching ""Man on Fire"" are looking for anyway. Perhaps the family element will go over better with some more than others, but I see no family values in a film where Denzel is depriving people of fingers, no matter what they try and convince me. This is a great premise and an entertaining film and worth a watch."

The emotion that he displayed playing opposite child actor, Dakota Fanning, who in and of herself was excellent in portraying her role. The emotion that she displayed showed her intensity and ability to consume her role and convince the audience that this was actually occurring. My only complaint with this movie was the slowness with which the story developed.

","Great movie. I have never seen the previous movie, or read the book, but as a stand alone work, I enjoyed this movie. I don't question why Denzel died in the end. It only makes sense for his character (wearing the patron saint of lost causes says it all). This man sought forgiveness for what he did, he can't find it in a bottle, he can't find it in a bible, but he finds it in the innocence of a little girl. When that is taken from him, it's the final straw. The only thing he saw as good was destroyed, and he sought revenge, and cared little if he lived or died. Once he found out the girl was alive it was too late for him, he did what he was supposed to do, save the girl and in doing so, found his own redemption. This movie would have been horrible if he lived. Just had to be."

","To all of you who began to watch this movie and decided it wasn't moving fast enough, shame on you! The beginning of the flick is purposefully drawn out to build up the conclusion. If we would not have witnessed Creasy's growing attachment to little Pita, the end would have no emotional effect. Dakota Fanning never ceases to amaze me, either. It's hard to believe that child is only twelve years old! She performs better than most of the mainstream adult actresses. Denzel, as always, gives a knock-out performance. Even Christopher Walken's character is worth the view. Who else could play a slightly deranged ex-assassin as well as he?"

","A typically classy performance from Denzel, who seems to be open to harsher scenes and less sympathetic roles as he gets older (like Training Day). Radha Mitchell is almost excellent - a little bit too cool most of the time, but her grief is well done. I'm not sure how old Dakota Fanning is playing here (8? 12?) but she's as precocious as ever, and a few of her lines/reactions are way too studied to seem real. Thankfully she never gets too annoying, but she's on that borderline all the way through. Imagine if you had to sit through a film with her & Hayley Joel Osment in it! (although if they died suddenly, tragically and violently, I'd go). She's worse in Hide & Seek, and we'll have to wait and see for War of the Worlds.<br/><br/>Anyway, Man on Fire - nice to see a film set somewhere different (Mexico - and not the tequila-sodden, cactus-strewn desert bit).. The tone is fairly cold (Tony Scott's films have a similar 'real light' sharpness to his brother Ridley's - not too many bright colours). And I particularly liked the refreshing way the authorities 'dealt' with Denzel on the rampage (not saying any more than that). Very good killings - gritty and inventive, yet not really glorified. A few more would have satisfied my bloodlust. And although he doesn't have much to do in this, it's always a pleasure to see Christopher Walken on screen. Good ending too. Not much of a soundtrack at all (that I noticed - apart from stealing the opening notes of one of my all-time favourite classical pieces 'Clair de Lune'), but it's not that sort of film. If anything, Man On Fire could have done with a sub-plot; it would have been more involving. But generally a good film, and slick without feeling formulaic.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: a few details mentioned went unresolved (or unexplored) not plot holes, just omissions..? And why couldn't Denzel be called something other than 'Creasy'? It kept sounding like 'greasy' to me, and I had to keep reminding myself it was his name and not a statement.<br/><br/>8/10 for me, with points off for never really getting exciting, and because Dakota Fanning came off as over-rehearsed and precocious."

We follow the detective work which leads to deeper and more sinister characters. The action is also very well done. Every bullet and every movement is expressed with detail and purpose. This is action as art. The violence is an emotional factor in which we see the repercussion of good and bad actions for all parties involved, seen through excellent cinematography and editing.

Director Tony Scott has also done a terrific job making a very dark mood and set to the whole movie, though switching from rock hard violence to pure love between Denzel's character and the little girl he is babysitting.<br/><br/>Mexico City being at the edge of crime insanity with an enormous amount of kidnappings going on. Caseay gets a job as a lifeguard for a small girl living in Mexico with her parents. Everything seems to go well, although Caseay's got a mysterious edge to himself, not letting people get to know him that well. So the little girl and Caseay soon starts developing a unique friendship, and for the first time in a very long time he finds reason in this life to actually live. But so the nightmare happens and the little girl is kidnapped. Now, Caseay returns from a serious injury to kill the kidnappers and all of the people that's served on it, one by one.<br/><br/>MAN ON FIRE is without doubt one of the most pro action/thriller's in quite a while, so I really recommend it for everybody enjoying a good movie, and character performance!"

","I've been very impressed with the choice of films Denzel Washington has been associated with lately. 'Man On Fire' gives Washington another meaty role where we see him revenge a little girl's abductors. He, John Creasy (Denzel Washington) accepts a position as a bodyguard to Pita. The viewer has to be aware of the time in Mexico whereas rich and notable families were being targeted for kidnappings/ransom. Organized crime involving law enforcement departments (corrupt police) all play a partprofiting in this kind of extortion. It's unbelievable how everyone (media, Government etc) seems to know what is happening, but no one is capable or willing to do anything about it until John Creasy comes onto the scene.<br/><br/>Creasy vows to kill all who are responsible for pita's abduction.with no exceptions. The story was quite moving and the performances were excellent, but the camera work in some parts was extremely distracting. I don't know the term given to it.like it was a stop start slow motion snap shot. This is the only aspect I didn't really like about the film because it made it difficult to focus properly on what was going on. Other than that pretty good.8/10"

","Creasy (Washington) needs to do something in order to forget his past. Rayburn (Walken), a friend who lives in Mexico, fixes him a job at a wealthy man (Marc Anthony): protect his little girl Lupita(Fanning). Creasy and Pita don't get along at first, but develop a bond. One day, she gets kidnapped. Denzel is superb as usual. Washington really looks like the hard@$$ Creasy is in my mind. Dakota Fanning is perfect as the funny Pita, who kinda reminds me of Gollem from the LotR-trilogy. <br/><br/>I at first didn't understand the ending. Why didn't he take the big guy out? I didn't understand. Then I saw the deleted scenes on the DVD. Turns out Creasy has a little present tucked under his shirt. Guess what: he takes the leader out with a bang, no pun intended. <br/><br/>According to me, the movie could've taken a bit more time. I thought Creasy and Pita became friends too fast and I'd love to see Creasy kill more people. I mean... with his imagination... he could do lots of funny things."

","What a great movie! I did not really know what to expect, but I was intrigued by the kidnapping-in-Mexico scenario as I have been to Mexico City and experienced the environment and the extreme precautions that are essential to survival first hand. The story line is very believable and the slow ""endearment"" process of the two characters - body guard and ""guardee"" is the perfect set up for the rest of the movie. Creasy is a beaten man who slowly finds value in a more personal relationship with a little girl - she helps him feel something again as he helps her her believe in herself. Then, after the unthinkable happens, the revenge sequence of discovery and doling out of justice is superb and a credit to the writers as well. The only negative comment I can make is the deliberate jumpy-camera technique used multiple times throughout the movie. I got it the first couple of times and found it to be annoying later on. However, it did not ruin the movie for me."

","That's pretty much what this movie is about. Denzel Washington plays Creasy, an ex-assassin hired to protect the cute little daughter of a wealthy industrialist couple in Mexico City. The daughter gets abducted by some career kidnappers which makes Denzel extremely livid. He goes out with the intention of destroying everybody responsible and/or involved with the kidnapping, which provides for a good opportunity to see people buy the farm in horrible ways. My choice of the word destroy is not an exaggeration. With one guy in particular, he stuffs a wad of plastic explosive up the dude's butt and well.... you put the rest together. The movie in itself is entertaining but kind of thin. I mean, it's a very simple plot. Yeah there's a twist or two but the movie is basically what I mentioned earlier: a kidnapping and then a tour of revenge. There are some good lines here, my favorite being the one where Denzel says something along the lines of forgiveness being a matter to be discussed between the guilty person and God and he's just there to arrange the meeting. Couple that with the fact that he's holding a rocket launcher while he's saying it and it's pretty funny and frightening at the same time. I thought the dynamic between Creasy and the little girl Pita (Dakota Fanning) was genuinely touching. Though I knew that she was going to be kidnapped, it only made their early scenes together more emotional. One thing that left me feeling a bit annoyed with the film was the direction. I love Tony Scott but I think he can get a bit ham-fisted with the visuals. The combination of shaky camera work, Ginsu knife editing and bleached out color nearly made me go back to the credits to make sure that the movie wasn't directed by Michael Bay. At points, the camera moved so much that I was wondering if they were administering shock treatments to the camera operator while he was working. Even something like the pouring of a drink is filmed to be an all out assault on the senses. The use of subtitles are executed in such a way that they call just a little too much attention to them. While it's an interesting aesthetic choice, I don't need to see subtitles flying in from the right side of the screen and then have half of the words fade out and the rest of the letters explode outwards... Christ, just keep it simple! Anyway, to end the review, I'll say that I enjoyed the movie but it could've used a little less style and a bit more substance. Denzel makes this movie more than watchable and while it's not the most violent movie I've ever seen, it's always fun to watch people get creamed, especially when they deserve it.<br/><br/>RATING ***1/2 out of *****."

Faith is more than trust and loyalty.<br/><br/>At one point in this movie, the hero Creasy exchanges gunfire with some criminals (kidnappers) in a church, interrupting a man's prayer. Creasy excuses the interruption, saying to the man that the guys had done evil things. The man asks him, ""Isn't that between them and God?"" Creasy responds, ""Yes, it is, but my job is to arrange the meeting."" This is not a flippant, smug or condescending response. It is genuine and heartfelt. The man seems perplexed by it, however, and even Creasy seems surprised by his own answer ..... as it suddenly dawns on him that he has no choice but to do what he is doing, that the purpose of his mission is greater than any personal meaning or political ideal, that whether he lives or dies during this mission is not a matter for consideration.

","Denzel does a great job playing a former government agent assigned to protect a little girl from kidnapping in Mexico City. When he is assigned he is ready to kill himself.

"kezop_male","8","0","0","12 January 2005"," A Revenge Flick that Works, Mostly.
","Revenge flicks are as predictable as ""Rocky"" knock-offs. Take a highly trained, ex-super soldier/spy, disgrace them from continuing their previous profession, show them struggling to adjust to the civilize world. Next, have them fall in love, begin to heal, and for real fun, have the object of their affections snatched away from them. Suddenly, all the killing to come is justifiable homicide. Each death is cheered.<br/><br/>That's the structure of this Denzel Washington flick, but guess what? It works, mostly. Sure, there's the unbelievable back story of Denzel being an ex-super soldier/spy. It's established early that he's a man of unusual prowlness when it comes to killing. Just as it's established early that he's no longer able to continue his previous profession. In this case, alcoholism. None of this is a spoiler, since it's all given away in the first 15 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>What makes this movie exceptional (not great, just noteworthy) is the way mostly believable way the filmmaker justifies his relationship with the little girl. Even Denzel's motivation for letting go of the bottle is relatively believable.<br/><br/>Once the killing starts, we're rewarded with mostly believable acts of revenge killing on Washington's part. Only one killing is patently over the top in it's cuteness (the one under the bridge).<br/><br/>I guess the filmmaker hoped to have you drawn deeply enough into the characters and the story to forgive the clichéd ending. The killing under the bridge signals the end of believability for the movie as it races to tie up all the loose ends and give the required happy/sad ending.<br/><br/>I liked how the movie was directed and shot. It's use of subtitles is wonderful. Subtitles that actually ADD to the composition of the shot and reflect the emotion of the moment. A bit cartoony at times, but mostly, very effective and fun. The creative use of subtitles, along with the feel and visualness of the movie, will last much longer than the paper thin plot."

"trynityseven","8","0","0","18 December 2004"," does considered, planned out bloody revenge make you go ""oooo""?
","Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning impressed me to no end in this film. Giancarlo Gianinni was underutilized in a near-promising role, Rachel Ticotin's role was left unfulfilled, with dangling plot devices left hanging and the resolve and necessity of her character is basically ignored once that character's actions culminate in the event Scott used them for. He threw her away and left me wondering what happened.<br/><br/>The plot was relatively common in its underlying themes, but its execution in both the portrayal of the two main characters by Washington and Fanning, and the fascinating photography effects and dialog captions used by Scott to draw the viewer in to the disjointed and seemingly random violence of the particular aspect of the life of Mexico City residents, and the mind of Creasy, make it a worthy film. My greatest complaint, besides the under-usage of some of the supporting cast, is the over-usage of the photography effects. To some degree it would have been MORE striking if those effects had been used with more reserve. By the end of the film they had been used so often that they no longer served their purpose with the same efficacy.<br/><br/>I've seen people complain about the ending, but I think it fit perfectly with the progression of the character of Creasy. <br/><br/>*SPOILER* Creasy evolved from his lost-self to his found-self through his relationship with lupita (Pita). Pita, expertly portrayed by Fanning, won us over with her strength and wits and genuine charm. And later, Washington won us over with his unrelenting drive to avenge her loss. The character of Christopher Walking was GROSSLY underutilized, but his narrative-like contributions painted a haunting picture of the evolution of Creasy - and the carnage he would bring down around the heads of those who'd taken the girl. If Walking painted a picture of what would come, Washington competently, and understatedly fulfilled that vision with remarkable power. I found myself confidently rooting for his vicious revenge to be enacted in ever-greater measures of creative pain on ""those who were responsible, those who profited, and those who looked at him."" By the end his injuries and purpose had basically done what they were supposed to do. Though the end might have felt anticlimactic to some, I don't think this movie was at all about the ending. Rather it was about the journey from the beginning to the ending - the climax seemed to be somewhere around the blowing off of fingers, or possibly the blowing up of something, or maybe even a suicide. <br/><br/>*end spoiler*<br/><br/>This movie is harsh. It is intense. It was well-made and worth watching. I don't recommend it for the young or the squeamish, as it is violent and gory in the extreme. But it is a fascinating take on a common western theme with expert photography and deft portrayal of characters that possibly could have been better-written, but probably not better acted.<br/><br/>Definitely worth the rental. If you're a fan of action features, this is not exactly that. There is action, but the heart of this movie beats in what drives it - and if you don't feel yourself hunkering down and waiting/wanting for Creasy's revenge to culminate then you're not paying attention, or you just don't like these kinds of movies."

Although there is the odd cliché, it is a disquieting, atmospheric film, thanks to a committed performance from Washington and a strong supporting cast.<br/><br/>Of particular interest are the camera techniques used by director Tony Scott (Enemy of the State, Spy Game) and director of photography Paul Cameron (Swordfish, Gone in Sixty Seconds). They hand-cranked the camera to speed up or slow down movement, used reversal stock to make the colours brighter and shot the film at varying levels of quality, which all serve to increase overall tension and gain insight into Creasy's extreme headspace.<br/><br/>Although there's a slightly weak ending, 24's Jack Bauer would definitely approve. ***½/***** stars."

But one afternoon she is kidnapped, and he is shot multiple times trying to protect her. As he lies in the hospital bed all bandaged and bleeding, Pinta's parents (Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell) set up a ransom; however, the money gets stolen at the drop. Once he recovers, he turns to his friend Rayburn and a newspaper worker to help him gain revenge on Pinta's kidnappers.<br/><br/>The message portrayed in the film is never give up even when fate is not in a person's favor--the outcome might surprise them. Also, keep an open mind in any situation and do research before a person forms an opinion-miracles can happen. Be aware of whom to trust: they may not be who a person thinks they are. There is a large amount of emotion bringing the film close to the heart and home.

All characters is well established, in fact the times spends so much time in establishing plot and characters that the movie, especially in the first half, becomes very slow paced and you just wish that it could skip along and bring on what will inevitable happen. I can think of some scenes that could be shortened or cut entirely (for example Pita's extensive swimming). Unfortunately the pace only picks up a little when Creasy goes on the revenge trip. One redeeming fact is that the movie is brutally blunt and honest, does not shy away to show some brutal moments and scenes. It seems that Creasy is actually rather inventive when it comes to revenge. However, there are some things that are really annoying. For one the characters switch between Spanish and English in the middle of conversations and a lot of the dialog is printed out on the screen, regardless of it needs to be translated or not.

Then after the father drops the round in the chamber, and shooting it, there is NO POSSIBLE WAY FOR THE SLIDE TO LOCK BACK WITHOUT AN EMPTY MAGAZINE IN THE WEAPON. You can see the pistol with the slide locked back laying on the floor. I wish the weapon suppliers would notice these small errors and correct them. People who know weapons see these errors and it ruins the effect of the movie. We know what the weapons are capable of and know how these weapons function. When you do something out of the norm with them, the mistakes are well noted and it ruins the movie for sticklers for correctness. The same as having a body guard who does not wear a bullet resistant vest."
"misteme2003","7","0","0","27 October 2004"," Great film, minus the MTVesque editing...Denzel Washington performs ?SPOILERS?
","Just rented and watched this film last night and what a surprise!! Denzel Washington proves yet again his diverse talent and praiseworthy abilities as an actor. He plays a detached, ""has been"" ex-CIA agent with an impressive investigative/agent history who's hit the bottle and lost his way in life. Enter Christopher Walken as his long time friend who genuinely cares about his struggle and helps him get a job as a lowly paid bodyguard in Mexico City for a little girl, Dakota Fanning (who starred in ""I am Sam"" and is a wonderful little actress who will no doubt have a successful future in Hollywood). <br/><br/>The movie, although a long 2 hours+, spends the better part of the first half developing the relationship between Denzel's ""Creasy"" character and Dakota's character ""Pita"". While it was less than exciting to watch it was necessary to show the growth of their love for one another to support the latter half and plot of the story. <br/><br/>The little girl is kidnapped and from that point the story becomes ""A man on Fire""..Denzel is ""reborn"" and out for bloody revenge for the ""loss"" of the little girl...some grisly scenes, one after the other dominate the rest of the film. Now despite the fact that Denzel's character takes matters into his own hands and is, in reality..committing unspeakable crimes himself, we care too much about him and the little girl to hold him accountable.<br/><br/>There are suspenseful moments in the movie, with a predictable turn of events (although the back of the DVD hints to this with the comment ""He will stop at nothing to save her"") and the viewer is not so surprised. But it's not a psychological thriller, so it's not a fault of the screenwriter or director. <br/><br/>I found this a tender movie and sincerely vested in the character Denzel plays. I shed a few tears at the ending and for that I give the movie 7/10*..<br/><br/>A few minuses...the annoying MTV video like editing. It was full of fast, rapid editing, with too colorful, or colorless close up shots in the beginning..at times you almost felt like you were watching an MTV video without the music (Marc Anthony's presence in the movie added to that message in my opinion, a not so good choice for those who casted him, physically he fit the role...??? his acting ability) It reminded me of the technique used in ""Traffic"", which is new and creative, but distracting for the audience. <br/><br/>What were they thinking when they brought in Marc Anthony?? His supporting role was somewhat significant, but no awards there.<br/><br/>Also, Mickey Rourke...overshadowed..a waste of talent there. I would have like to have seen his part expanded, because in the context of the story, it WAS significant...<br/><br/>Overall a great film, definitely don't miss this one. Consider buying it..also of noteworthy mention was the score (if you can get past the MTVesque editing...a little bit of Lisa Gerrard's engaging voice is thrown in, who was also involved in the score for ""Gladiator"")<br/><br/>If you can get past the annoying editing style, and somewhat predictability of the plot, you'd be hard pressed not to enjoy this one..a pretty good drama/action piece."
"DrLenera","Null","0","0","26 October 2004"," Revenge thriller with good build up and great potential...but it might have been nice to be allowed to SEE the revenge
","Man On Fire is a particularly infuriating film because it starts out so well. Admittedly it's basically a pretty unoriginal revenge thriller rather unnecessarily stretched out to two and a half hours. However, for the first hour the film works well. The pace is leisurely but the tension does build up, Denzel Washington makes his clichéd hero-trying-to-drown-his-sorrows-in-drink a reasonably rounded character, and his growing relationship with young Dakota Fanning is well handled, quite affecting while avoiding mawkishness. Eventually she is kidnapped and killed, and, as Washington decided to kick ass big time, one thinks ""yes, this is where the film is going to kick off"". After all, roaring rampages of revenge are always more powerful after a long build up so we care more.<br/><br/>Except here we don't. One of the most annoying ""fads"" in current cinema is the MTV style, a-cut-every-second style of film-making. Admittedly, there is sometimes nothing more boring than when a camera is just pointed at the actors, but Man On Fire goes to the other extreme and takes it all a stage further, in fact sometimes director Tony Scott seems to decide not to show us what is going on at all. Two potentially strong scenes, a shoot out in a street and Washington torturing a man by cutting off some fingers, are completely ruined by excessive editing and alterations to the film stock whilst others are considerably weakened. Washington wastes villains and often in nasty ways, but we probably see less than 50% of the action. This means that when the end comes, far from being moved, we just don't really care.<br/><br/>What a shame. Most aspects of this film are solid if hardly great. Funny how one bad aspect of a film can sometimes be responsible for almost completely ruining it."

","This film is over the top at times but just portrays what parents would love to do to the people who kidnapped their children.<br/><br/>This film is simple but keeps you interested all the way through and even though the revenge acts are a little over the top, it still makes good viewing. The story line of a former marine who's life has hit rock bottom and has trouble with alcoholism, and then for a little girl to reignite his soul and believe in life again, makes a great story on it's own. So this and the added action of revenge when she is kidnapped makes this a film for most movie lovers who like a good story and action.<br/><br/>Apart from all the gruesome revenge scenes I was a little disappointed in seeing that the only people that really did strong were firstly Dakota Fanning (Pita) and Denzel Washington (Creasy). You don't see too much of Dakota but, what you do, makes you think she is a very promising actor. And it's good to see Christopher Walken as a good guy!"

"Sfpsycho415","8","0","0","13 October 2004"," Excellent action/drama---8/10
","Man on Fire takes the standard revenge story to a whole new level. Denzel Washington stars as Creasy, an alcoholic ex-marine who is hired to protect a young American girl (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City during a wave of kidnappings. Denzel and Dakota have an amazing chemistry on-screen, making her character's kidnapping and Creasy's ensuing killing spree much more effective. Washington is again Oscar-worthy in a performance which is as good if not better than that in Training Day. Fanning is charming as usual and you become attached to her as Creasy did. The great cast also includes Christopher Walken (who is especially good in this movie), Rachel Ticotin, Giancarlo Giannini, and Radha Mitchell,(who also turns in a really good performance, not to mention hot.)<br/><br/>The movie is directed by Tony Scott, who has directed some of my favorite action movies, such as Enemy of the State and The Last Boy Scout. He does a great job here as well, with some great shots and a clever way to put in subtitles. However, some of the quick cutaways and camera movements do get a little annoying, but it is a minor drawback. The only other flaws, which are little bigger, were that it could be a little predictable at times and the ending could have been better. By better i mean letting Creasy live! I hate when they make you love somebody whether hero or villain, just to have them killed. That really doesn't take away much though, because it could also be really unpredictable and the ending is powerful, but i am sure everyone would have liked to have a more Hollywood ending to this one. Usually, i don't like Hollywood endings, but i really wanted Creasy to live. Damn reality!<br/><br/>All in all, Man on Fire is one the best movies of the year and is packed with action, drama and great performances. This should win some Oscars but the Academy sucks so it won't. 8/10"
"Anchi27","6","0","0","13 October 2004"," Nice work everybody !
","I had to watch the movie twice. The first time I didn't like it very much, but after seeing it again, I realized why : I never paid attention to the small details that are so important, the camera was annoying and I was pretty sleepy :-) But the second time, I was prepared, so nothing could escape me, not a single detail and I can only say : Nice work everybody! Yes, it is a long movie (more than 2 hours), but it is divided in two separate parts. Creases life with Pita and Creases life without her. The acting is perfect. Denzel Washington plays 3 characters in this movie- first, he's the suicidal drunk, then he meets Pita and she awakes Creases will for life & love (or as Christopher Walken well said: ""Pita taught him it was OK to live again."") and the third character is the worst- he becomes this enraged man, ready to do anything to get Pita back. But even in that part when he plays the ""bad guy"" you are with him, because you can feel his rage, you understand that everything he had has been taken away from him, and this time he will not turn the other cheek! A great transformation from this fabulous actor that never stops amazing me. Little Pita is played by young Dakotta Fanning and believe me, she did an excellent job- you just must love her! She looks so fragile and naive, but in the same time you can see that she is a strong and mature girl who already learned that life is not a fairytale. Walken's performance is excellent like always,so I don't have to talk much about his role- he did a great job...again. The story is a cliché, but the interesting thing is that it doesn't end as the other movies with similar plots. It goes further, doesn't stop when you expect it to, but continues to surprise you till the bitter end. That's what is so good about this movie. It's like many others, but it's still original and unique. There are some things that are not explained well, like why is Crease in such a mess? I know that he was in the army and probably killed a lot of people, even had been tortured, but so was C.Walken and he's doing just fine! The main parts are very interesting and, at times, even amusing. It's a warm story about a man who has nobody and meets a little girl who shows him that despite everything, life still has it's good sides. Quite optimistic. The only thing I didn't understand is the end. This is probably a SPOILER : if the kidnapper said I will give you a life for a life, why is he taking his brother and Crease? That's 2 lives, not one. But then I think- he was so wounded by the end of the movie that he would probably die anyway. There is one thing that most people didn't like, but I found it pretty interesting : it's the camera tricks- the blurring, choppy shots and other visual effects that have been labeled as the ""MTV production"" or something like that. I didn't find it annoying, on the contrary, I think it gives the movie that something that makes it different and interesting to watch. Tony Scott did an excellent job. I had no doubts about that. All in all, it's a solid 8 out of 10."

","I put off seeing this movie, thinking it an atypical thriller (which are fine, if you are in the mood for atypical). I was pleasantly surprised at this movie. Everything was done very well! Story, direction, cast, acting, production... Washington really pull of a great job here, convincing me of his character's burdens without diminishing the realism of the film by over-explaining it. This may be his best. The whole cast was great! One thing I really love about a movie is getting little details right. Technical details like the delay between lightning and thunder. Dialog, sounding not rehearsed (a Walken trademark) as with subtle human mannerisms...lots of little details make this movie special to me. And Dakota, not too precocious with an imperfect smile, really does win your heart. The filming style really adds to the tensity of the movie. The unique use of subtitles, only when necessary to bridge a gap between viewer and information otherwise lost, was outstanding! It prevented any tarnishing of the films realism, and and also added some subtle atmosphere to a scene. I will add this to my collection. Excellent movie!"

I was very pleased with the characters, and with this movie being two hours, it did go into detail on the story and characters. It's interesting to see a different kind of life in Mexico and the kind of culture it possesses. After about the first half, the story became more predictable and was easy to figure out the ending. Denzel Washington did a very good job in portraying a body guard, and the overall cast was very good.

","This highly improbable story (is it veridical I mean inspired in some real events?) is well told indeed in a bright succession of short plans and brief sequences that rivet your attention all the time with no gaps in the action from beginning to the end. Denzel Washington is superb as the cold blooded bodyguard that starts a series of well planned and executed killings to revenge the murder of the child that he protected. There is not much more to say about this movie because the simplicity of the script doesn't allow great raptures of creativity or imagination. Therefore this movie can be classified more as an honest work of an artisan than a masterpiece of an artist."

Everything else about this film is somewhat annoying. Denzel does not play nor make us believe he is the alcoholic he is supposed to be. It might not even be possible for him given his face & looks & movie-to-movie screen persona. Then he's an All-American coach for a scene, or two.

Denzel Washington's portrayal of a tortured soul was on par with his usual excellence. Dakota Fanning is a natural on screen and instantly causes the viewer to love her character. The chemistry between the two was very apparent as their relationship grew from protector/protectee to friends. The gruesome scenes as Washington exacted his revenge on all involved with the kidnapping of Fanning's character, were digestible because of the anger the situation builds in the viewer. The movie is definitely worth watching. Be prepared for an emotional ride!"

He'd basically be able to walk a bomb right under their noses. It worked pretty well with that sleazy guy under the bridge.<br/><br/>Just wondering. Otherwise, it was intriguing to see an action hero/anti-hero really offer himself up as a sacrifice. Usually it's a gambit to set up the high-drama escape sequence."

There's a lot of cruelty, gore and violence in the movie, but not what you can call 'unreasonable' violence.

I've never been there. <br/><br/>The thought that this kind of thing happens there is so horrible and terrible I can't bare it. God bless all the little children that have had this happen or that might have this happen. As a parent, I have to say that the possibility of something happening to my child, kept me awake nights. I was probably way too hard on my daughter while she was growing up, but nothing bad ever happened to her. I frightened her too much with, staying close to me. She's probably way too causious[sp] now because of my fears. Oh well, she's in her twenties and nothing bad ever happened, so there you go.<br/><br/>This was an excellent movie. The story line kept me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Mark Anthony's conflicted performance, his business failure, and his guilt after admitting he went along with the kidnapping was really powerful. Mickey Rourke's performance is, as always, very strong. Mickey, I miss seeing him in more things. I really do, but he looks so different now -- so corrupt somehow. I know that's probably not what he intended, but that's how he looks. I wish he'd do more things where he's a conflicted good guy, instead of always the bad guy. He's been type-cast now as the villain and I'm sick of it. Mickey has the acting skills to do anything. <br/><br/>The mother -- Radha Mitchell -- this was a fine performance from her. I can't find any fault in it. Wish we'd seen a bit more from her. I loved her in Pitch Black. Rachel Ticotin is always a very strong actress -- I loved her in One Good Cop with Michael Keaton.

On the surface, it appears that he is just a playboy, but the lunch scene, plus his affection for Denzel, show he isn't that shallow. <br/><br/>Denzel Washington's character clearly returns from the dead (figuratively) because of love (as does Dakota's mom). His willing sacrifice is the final act of redemption. (I think Denzel's grandmother would approve of this film.)<br/><br/>10 minutes into the DVD, Mark Anthony is reading Denzel's resume. If you pause & advance frame by frame, you see the resume is actually for a Mr. Rosche, NOT Mr. Creasy (Denzel's character).

Of special note is the mature performance of Dakota, who is all of 10 years old, but has the acting ability of a seasoned pro. Mark my words, she may be a child actor now, but when she becomes an adult she won't be known by her childhood movies. She will be known by her talent, whit, and strong charisma.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie was well matured, and did not feature the cliché's that are typical of this genre.

I believe Denzel Washington gave a convincing and professional performance and deserved the praises that showered on him, even from the critics who slated the movie. Well, the movie itself is not genial at all and crossed the line of reality; what in my opinion is so unlikely is this man fighting and killing all by himself (except for Cristopher Walken's help) this powerful brotherhood of cops, corrupts politicians and crooks, that make the film less effective and even disturbing.

","""Hombre en LLamas"" is the title of the movie in Mexico which translates directly into ""Man in Flames"". The flick is a very refreshing and powerful look at the tired old cliché formula of revenge. This movie came out in the United States in April, 2004. Same as other ""revenge"" movies like the superb ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" and the flawed, but entertaining comic book adaptation ""The Punisher"". I'm not gonna go into details about the plot, because you all know that Denzel Washington stars as John Creasy, a former CIA assassin who is hired as a bodyguard in Mexico City. His job is to protect Pita, the daughter of the wealthy Mexican industrialist Samuel Ramos. The film looks great, it has an energetic direction by Tony Scott (even though a lot of people didn't like it) and it also has great visuals and awesome setting since it was shot on location in Mexico City.<br/><br/>I have to give props to Brian Helgeland for the great script which is according to our times, since Mexico is on number 2 on the top countries with kidnapping problems. Just below Colombia which has a lot of kidnappings because it is one of the biggest drug suppliers in the planet. Corruption and organized crime has always been a problem in Mexico, and I liked how it was portrayed. Still there are some DISCREPANCIES that I really hated. For example *MINOR SPOILER* When Creasy goes to ""The Voice's"" house it is certainly a crappy house barely with a roof. That can't be true, kidnappers in Mexico after they have committed a kidnapping successfully and jack a load of cash, they buy houses and cars and they're not discreet at all. Anyway, enough of my ranting. This movie was VERY GOOD. I recommend it to everyone who wants to have a good time. Well acted, well paced, well written and well directed.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"

","This movie has (the late) Charles Bronson written all over it, from producer Lance Hool (who did many of Bronson's early 80's films) to the character's name: Creasy (you mean Kersey?). A shame that Old Leather Face is no longer around, too, since this would have been one of his best films, a great send off to be run at retrospective film festivals for years to come. For Denzel, however, this is absolute slumming as an actor. He passed this stage over 20 years ago as a bit player on ""St. Elsewhere"", and for some reason of late has decided to take every 'Man On The Edge' role that comes along. In a movie like ""The Hurricane"" it works. Here, overrun by Tony Scott's ""NYPD Blue on Fast Forward"" direction, it doesn't. Obviously, 2 time Academy Award winner Washington needed something after his performance in ""Training Day"" to prove he had more to give us, but I couldn't help thinking of Buzz Aldrin after the first Moon landing - how his life had peaked in achievement and depression set in. Well, unless Denzel goes back to playing varied characters, a career depression will soon set in, because I haven't seen him break out of the Edgy Man persona since ""Philadelphia"", though I did happen to like ""John Q."", even if few else saw it. I love Denzel, one of the best actors in a long time, but he is typecasting himself for no reason when he has the power to take any role he wants."

","First, let me acknowledge that there are some unanswered questions. First, just what did Creasy do that caused him to feel so completely down on himself before he met Pita? That question is never answered, only vaguely hinted at, at best. OK, so he was a professional assassin. No big deal - he did what he was paid to do, and he was good at it.<br/><br/>So, what happened? Did he accidentally kill a bus of Catholic School girls when completing an assignment? I wish we knew.<br/><br/>Other than that, the movie did make a lot of sense to me. It had a believable plot, and moved in a logical way. Yes, Creasy's desire for revenge is predictable, but looking at the character, in his state of mind, it would also be his only shot at redemption. He is using this terrible gift he spent 18 years training to refine to close the books on people who make a living causing harm and pain to innocents. The only other choices he seems to have are to run away to the US, or go to Mexican prison for killing 2 ""off-duty"" cops that were in uniform at the scene of Pita's kidnapping.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had with the whole story was the ending. In the last minute, there should have been a pan shot of the bad guys driving away, with Creasy's dead body in the back seat, going to a wide-angle view of the two cars rolling down the highway - and erupting into flame just after Creasy's watch ""alarm"" beeps. Mission accomplished."

","I live in Mexico City and this movie moves me to comment on it. Although several persons didn't like the movie because its editing as a music video, I think this kind of editing perfectly reflects the kind of city we live on: contrasting colors, people fast pace and chaos. Beside the leading actors performance, the supporting cast is excellent and deserves special attention (e.g. the character of 'the voice' sister is truly exceptional). Violence and express kidnapping are sad things that are currently happening in our city but are common in other major cities around the world. Unfortunately, for us locals, the movie has several geographical and social inconsistencies. I recommend this movie and my only regret is that there wasn't more involvement with local cinematographers that could have helped in giving it a more realist setting."

","As a citizen of Mexico City, this movie had moved me like no other action movies had. You can have fun with those, but never feel as excited, angry and touched by one, as this one does.<br/><br/>To live in this city, to be exposed to everyday kidnaps and robbers and stuff, to be actually IN the movie, to feel like i was watching what I watched the same day on the news, but with a big black guy with a shotgun making justice to all of we who had been related to kidnaps ... this movie its a relief! It's a big explosion of power images we all needed!!!<br/><br/>Kidnaps may be one of the worst crimes we're exposed to. And this being the everyday routine by living here is really crappy. It's nonsense. We all feel useless as we are, because this things are happening right now not very far from where I'm typing and we just can't do anything about it. And there's virtually no one making the difference in here. It's very much frustrating. It's quite inspiring to watch Denzel Washington doing all that people what every citizen of this city would like to do to those bastards! We would like to have thousands of big black guys with shotguns cutting out the fingers of every people involved in brutalities like those! <br/><br/>We came out of the theatre very excited, very free. Talking a lot about it and about how we need people with courage to do what Creassy does. It's powerful! It's a great action movie but with the plus that gives the feeling of actually hating the bad guys of the movie. Its not like when you see James Bond killing an evil doctor who wants to take over the world or Jean Claude Van Dame kicking his karate opponent's ass. It's being a badass with guns, shooting to people who are real, and who do deserve the worst of the world. Who we would like to do what this character, Creassy does!!! Action movies at its best!<br/><br/>Now I wonder how this was made. It kinda' feels as if it was a present from Hollywood to us in Mexico City. As if they said: -""We're Hollywood, the parents of action movies; here you go, a gift to all of you guys who need some relief of your sad and terrible situation. Hang in there"" And its frankly great! I hope some one in here feels as inspired as I am, so maybe the movie makes all the way into creating a solution to the terrible situation we're living in here. Maybe not by the authorities, but by some lunatic with guns. I don't care the ways, we just need to stop it!<br/><br/>And I could not finish the comment without giving credit to the amazing acting and performance of Denzel Washington and especially of Dakota Fanning, who every time I watch in a movie keeps getting better and better in her acting. That girl's just great; she's gonna get to the top! I wish I had a daughter like that!<br/><br/>Great action movie! In the name of Mexico City: Thank You!!! We needed this!"

","Went and saw this at the theatre last night.<br/><br/>My wife and I made up two of the total of three people in the theatre so it was like a private screening.<br/><br/>While I am probably going to criticise this film more than I praise it, my overall impression of the film was good and I give it 7/10.<br/><br/>I won't go into the plot as it must be common knowledge.<br/><br/>The directing on this film was solid and I have few complaints about that.<br/><br/>
Hey! It's a Tony Scott film. Like his other works such as Top Gun, Days of Thunder, True Romance, Crimson Tide, etc, what were the people expecting who are knocking this film so badly.<br/><br/>The film was a bit overlong at nearly two and a half hours. I do think it may have tried a bit to hard to be a very good film and thus Scott left in some bits that should have been cut. It was probably 20 minutes too long.<br/><br/>The film falls somewhere between a drama, thriller and action film without being outstanding in any of those genre.<br/><br/>The story was good and Scott spent time trying to develop the lead characters so the audience would form a bond with them before getting down to the business end.<br/><br/>Without wanting to sound too wishy washy, this was both a strength and weakness of ""Man on Fire"" depending on what you are looking for in a film.<br/><br/>The acting was ok. Denzel was Denzel, playing a character that could have been transplanted from many of his other films.<br/><br/>The need for him to dispatch or interrogate each villain in a different manner irked me a bit. The method by which Denzel dispatched the guy tied down over the hood of the car was ridiculous and in my opinion damaged the credibility of the film. <br/><br/>Denzel wasn't playing the sort of character to beat about the bush or over-complicate proceedings, so I don't know what was with that rubbish.<br/><br/>The tragic ending to the film was appropriate, yet should have been done differently. It bore striking similarities to Scott's sibling Ridley's ""Gladiator"". Very unoriginal, even the score seemed plagurised.<br/><br/>I did think the film tapped into our emotions nicely, invoking emotional highs and lows, a couple of genuinely supenseful moments and also great anger and hatred after everything turned to custard.<br/><br/>Who didn't want Denzel to track down the bad guys and exterminate them all? <br/><br/>
This hard edge was what made the movie superior to recent kidnap films such as ""Ransom"" or ""Proof of Life"" which both had happy endings. ""Man on Fire"" lost this edge at the end when it developed into a kind of happy ending.<br/><br/>
It stretched credibility that such evil guys didn't carry though with their threat, yet never made contact again with another ransom demand.<br/><br/>A ""Get Carter"" (1971 version) kind of ending would have been a more fitting kind of finish to this movie.<br/><br/>Overall a good film, though it could have been better."

","Spoilers warning !<br/><br/>It was Air Canada's new pitch, the brand new Airbus 340 with individual TVs mounted on every seat in Economy, allowing the passenger to choose from a dozen films to watch any time, plus the ability to pause, fast forward, rewind (I have NOT received any commission from the said airline). I had been some twelve hours in the plane and had watched two movies. In picking Man on Fire, I didn't notice that it was nearly two-and-a-half hours long. Nor did it matter, as I wasn't in a hurry to get anywhere anyway.<br/><br/>On the super mini screen mounted on the back of the seat in front of me, the movie just looked a little unreal. I had no idea how recent was the movie and I didn't have the opportunity to check out the cast beforehand on IMDb as I usually do. Other than Denzel Washing (the only reason for choosing this movie), I only recognised (or thought I did) Christopher Walken. I was too lazy even to read the little introduction in the flight magazine. It was a few days later that I found out that the little girl is played by Dakota Fanning, who made such a wonderful impression in I Am Sam, as well as appeared in earlier movies Sweet Home Alabama and Hansel and Gretal. (Does this girl make only movies with three-word titles? Her next one, I noticed, is 'Hide and seek'). <br/><br/>The story started slowly, but it didn't take long to catch on to the main focus of the first part of the movie, the development of the friendship between downhearted, alcoholic ex-CIA assassin Creasy (reminiscing of Tom Cruise in Last Samurai and Viggo Mortensen in Hidalgo) (Denzel Washington) and the little preteen girl Pita (Dakota Fanning) he has been hired to protect from increasing kidnappings in Mexico. While unreservedly predictable, the development in this first half is very watchable, thanks to the performance of the two principals.<br/><br/>The tone of the second half changes, as Creasy goes on a furious revenging rampage after Pita has been kidnapped, and thought dead. This lengthy, graphically sadistic quest would be an ordeal to some in the audience, but a joy ride to others. To me, under the particular circumstances (i.e. having got up at ungodly hours in the morning to go to the airport and having spent some thirteen hours in flight), it was something that barely kept me awake.<br/><br/>The ending is somewhat contrived but after 146 minutes, you really don't much care. In my case, there was at least nowhere to go. In a regular cinema, however, even if the audience had enjoyed the movie, to various degrees, they must be anxious to go, I would imagine."

","What a great show.  I have never been much of a fan of the many short cuts and overlays which appear in this film. (Not to mention all the hand held stuff)  For some reason it just didn't matter this time. Denzil Washington has to be one of the finest actors in America today.  Radha Mitchell played such a fine part, it took me half the film to recognize her as an Aussie. Like fine wine, Christopher Walken gives another fine performance. The script seemed simple, but you can't ignore Tony Scott - The energy in his directing is more than apparent.  This is what the movie Fallen (Another Denzil Washington thriller) could have been with a good director and a better script.  Don't miss one of the best 'non animated' films of 1994. The best Denzil Washington film since Crimson Tide. I especially like the tribute to Mexico at the end - I suppose Mexico City would be special if only the cops tried just a little to hide the fact that every single one of them is corrupt.  I've been to over fifty countries around the world - The places I will never return to are Mexico and Zimbabwe. I'll take a corrupt U.S. White House over Mexican cops anyday."

","The script goes places Hollywood usually won't go, with a depiction of sheer ruthlessness which has few precedents in the cinematic canon. This is a refreshing change. We've had enough of wronged good guys who catch up with the villains only to show them mercy, turning away saying ""you're not worth it,"" and only when the bad guy goes for his gun will the hero finally finish him off. Unfortunately, the film throws away much of this built-up credit with a totally-unjustified rabbit-out-of-the hat ending which taints its original purity of vision. The whole thing is rendered with the Scott brothers' trademark visual panache which, personally, I can't get enough of. Among the minor irritants was a score which seemed to specialise in recycling Hans Zimmer's riff from Gladiator which the great man has already recycled plenty of times himself. On the whole, the film is definitely worth seeing. <br/><br/>To Unemployed Critic : if you really believe that The Punisher is a superior film, and that Man on Fire deserves only 1/10, it's not hard to see why you are unemployed. With aesthetic judgment like that, you should be shovelling fries for a living and, let's face it, you probably are."

","Browsing over comments, how disappointed i was to see people sucked in with a couple of the lesser points of the film, rather in its entirety being a excellent film with some very well thought out moments.<br/><br/>Washington again goes out his natural self playing 'Creasy Bear', a man and ex-assassin having lost the will to life, only to be saved by the small girl he is trying to protect. The moments of torment in the film, and the quiet will to take care of matters after they have gone down all but showing why this man is a heavyweight in the Hollywood A-List. Granted, the role was nearly completely typecast for him, but just because a glove is tailor made doesn't mean it doesn't do a great job.<br/><br/>Little Dakota Fanning playing her role with a maturity some adult actors can even get right was almost a slap in the face with surprise, but a welcome one at that. Her bond with Washington truly one of the high points of the film, and that in time we'll only see her more and more.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert so bare with me. Some reviewers have talked about the movie being too depressing, which to tell you the truth is a joke. Too long has Hollywood tried to stick to the tried and true methods of 'Happy Endings' and that the good guy always wins and goes home happy. Its the depression this film places on the end that is refreshing as is some of the editing work. The morales that society carries do leave you feeling sad, but not all stories are made of sunshine, and why this films choice was a welcome one.<br/><br/>Special effects and editing again one of the main things of this films talk. The use of text upon the screen a nice touch to drive home key points in the film, but sometimes a little overdone. There was also some talk of people being unable to understand half the time what was going on, i'd have to ask if they rival Forrest Gumps' IQ. The film was clearly set out, able to be understood and watching it through a second time, you'll be able to see some of the earlier conversations undertone kept the story toward the end true.<br/><br/>Another quick mention is the score of this film. Keeping with the theme of the location and of the drama taking place, from rave scene heavy to the quiet lone piano as the kidnapping fell into place, shall be one to look for in store."

","Granted, I saw this as an in-flight movie, so I probably didn't get the full experience -- though my audio was fine, my video consisted of two choices -- a seven-inch screen twenty feet away with proper color or one four feet away at an angle where everything is tainted greenish-brown, or wholly inverted color, so dark blues show up as pale greys, and so on. Adds a wrinkle to the viewing experience, to say the least, and they told us up front the movie had edited for screen size, content, and time. And they weren't kidding; the credits rolled as we were just about to land (I half-worried they would cut off the finale).<br/><br/>All that in mind, Man is still a pretty good film. Denzel Washington plays Creasey, a hard-edged ex-agent who's seen better days and is set up by his pal Rayburn (Christopher Walken) for some bodyguard duty in Mexico, where apparently kids are kidnapped with alarming frequency. While Creasey is kind of a crab, the child, Pita (Dakota Fanning) is enjoyably precocious, but in a good way. Her infectious good humor rubs off on Creasey, who slowly begins to crawl out of his shell when of course she is kidnapped.<br/><br/>
Most of the rest of the film chronicles Creasey's efforts to resolve the situation, with varying degrees of inventiveness and violence (though I imagine some of the worse violence was trimmed from my version), and surprise, surprise, Denzel is incredibly effective in the type of role you associate more with someone like DeNiro. Denzel plays the hard-ass amazingly well, and he gives the role a nice subtle emotional undercurrent. Walken is good, but he's not in the movie enough for my liking -- a little more of him would have gone a long way. Fortunately Denzel gets to play off Dakota Fanning, so we can understand his quick bonding with the girl. Fanning is her usual excellent self (she's given more terrific turns than most actresses ever do, and she's what, eleven? What a future she could have!) and her Pita is really easy to like.<br/><br/>The film is violent, but not more so than most R-rated fare, and at least it offers some character and emotional context to go with all the explosions and gunshots. While Man might not be everyone's cup of tea, itâs certainly worth a rental if you get the chance."

","Man on Fire is an excellent action movie with well developed characters and a fast moving plot line that never bogs down. I felt Denzel Washington's performance was as solid as his turn in the overrated Training Day. It is heartwarming to see a character who starts with nothing in his life to be happy about and nothing really to live for, find a purpose and a peace in protecting and spending his days with a little girl. The worst part about the movie is the directing of Tony Scott, who does everything in his power to distract you from the characters on the screen with camera tricks and over-direction of the film. Had Scott used a more straight forward directoral approach, the film in general and the performances by Dakota Fanning and Denzel would have received more praise. Definitely worth your time to check out an action film with some heart and soul."

I might have been able to predict the movie had I not been on the edge of my seat wondering what was to become of the four primary characters that I was now somehow personally connected with.<br/><br/>What was so riveting about the film was its potential to be terrible, the possibility that it could have been like all of the others of its kind. The acting is not necessarily extraordinary, but the way the story is told makes you a part of the movie. <br/><br/>At the end, we all want to be Crecie; we all want to rescue the sweet little girl. But, we cannot, Crecie is in a class of own, touted by the always timely Christopher Walkin character. Crecie is a lone cowboy. How un-escthoteric would it have been if Crecie would have rescued her unscathed himself. In the same way, the film would have lost all its shelf had Crecie been murdered by them. The near perfect ending was the culmination of a great story. It kept Crecie an outsider hero. This movie harkened back to the John Wayne, Tombstone, and Unforgiven days when sometimes men had to define the law with a gun, some big cajones, and by being an outlaw.<br/><br/>The director does not settle at telling the story, he makes you a part of it. It has a life and a character all to its own and you cannot escape being a part of it. Have you ever been to Mexico? Had you not, after seeing the movie you would have felt like you had. The director highlights all the right elements of the script instead of trying to make it something it was not. <br/><br/>I cannot even begin to explain why this film did not do well in theaters.

","Ex-special forces bodyguard is hired to protect family, little girl gets kidnapped from under bodyguard's nose, bodyguard lays out some major firepower and goes after the bad guys.  The setup is pretty predictable, and goes about according to formula, but somehow, the movie still moves me.  The various twists and surprises along the way aren't what do it, instead, it's how much emotional depth the movie manages to achieve. Creasy (Denzel) is a veteran of some pretty shady operations in service of God and country.  Like his old combat buddy (Walken) he's haunted by a past that he seems incapable of escaping.  He's had his fill of death, but fighting is about the only thing he knows how to do.  So he takes the jobs, and buries his pain in Jack Daniels.      He winds up in Mexico, guarding a little girl who takes an instant liking to him.  At first, it merely annoys him, but she slowly wins him over, and starts to bring him out of the black hole he's been trapped in for so long.  He acts gruff and unapproachable, but he desperately needs someone to care about him.  The love of a child gives him back some of the hope he'd lost.  The development of the relationship between them is excellently done, much better than I'd expect from a shoot-em-up.      Of course, everything goes horribly awry when the abductors show up. When they drag the girl away, screaming for Creasy, we're angry not just because we supposed to be, we want these guys dead just as much as Creasy does.  When he first showed up, this was just a job.  Now he's willing to put his life on the line for her, and we can't help but sympathize.

Denzel's character then goes on a crusade to prove his own innocence (as some believe he is in league with the kidnappers), find the kidnappers and gets his revenge for killing the child he had come to love and exposing the bad guys.<br/><br/>If you think I have given away most of the plot let me tell you  WAY NO! There are subtle layers in this movie, there is a lot of intrigue and double-dealing going on, and the ending is very good and perhaps not at all where some would think we are leading  and I think we could definitely subtitle this movie as `revenge is sweet', the squeamish might want to look away on occasions, I know I did cringe a few times!<br/><br/>This is a great dramatic film thriller, and there are very few of these around. I would recommend this to any adult who is sick of sequels and special effects  this is original and quite a dark and sinister story, and the acting is excellent from all the lead characters, including Marc Anthony who I only know as a singer!<br/><br/>Definitely an 8 out of 10 movie!"

","My boyfriend and I went and saw this movie the other night. We thought it was well written and it had a great cast. Denzel did a great job as usual. If you have kids and they want to see it, just keep in mind that there's a lot of violence. There's about 1-2 minutes of sexual conduct and thats it. I would really like to know if this movie is based on a true story. The ending makes me think it is, but the dates given at the end would make it impossible to produce a movie in that short of time.

The story between ""Pita"" and ""Creasy Bear"" is beautiful and real. You see the relationship grow and even the most cold-hearted person will shed a tear at some point. This movie brings to life the war within ourselves as well as within our everyday lives. The portrayal of Mexico City was amazing. Throughout the movie, you hear that Family is all-important.

He doesn't care who he kills, what he has to do to get her back, and even risk his on life for her. I thought Denzel in this movie was good like he always is. Fannning was excellent which makes me forget about her role in The Cat in the Hat. Christopher was great in his few scenes as Denzel's old friend.

","""Man of Fire"" is a long film, yet it maintains the the audience in suspense till the end. Creasy (Denzel Washington) is an international assassin who is hired by a Mexican CEO to protect the daughter, Pita (Dakota Fanning) from the Mexican kidnappers who are rampant in that country. Dakota is a naive young girl who trusts everyone. She plays well and endears the audience for more. Denzel is his usual intense self with another outstanding performance in a difficult role. Pita's mother, (Rafha Mitchell) is also well played and her emotions are worn on her sleeve throughout the film. Christopher Walken plays Creasy's old friend who attracts him to Mexico to obtain employment from Pita's father. There is intrigue, and violence. The cinematography is at times television in quality, but this technique is useful during some of the more hectic scenes.<br/><br/>""Man on Fire"" is worth an afternoon at the movies."

","Well I came into this movie with very little expectations and knowledge over the basic plot. Unlike the other movies which were heavily promoted this one came in with a little hype and fanfare.<br/><br/>I was rather surprised that they would actually pair up the talented Denzel Washington with the promising Dakota Fanning. But it was quite a pleasant team up.<br/><br/>I feel that Fanning has continued to grow as an actress ever since I first saw her in an episode of CSI.<br/><br/>Denzel being Denzel as usual chose a rather dark character torn by his past and present obligations. At first your see a no nonsense all business man with hints of hurt because of his past. The he becomes a warmer person as he bonds with his ward. Soon of curse we see him change again to this intense and ruthless man bent on revenge. That's what's so good about Denzel is that he is able to easily convert form one character trait to another. I just wish that he would try to get other roles and quit with all this dark characters.<br/><br/>I actually found the choreography good at times especially in flashbacks.<br/><br/>
I did however found the subtitles a little distracting especially when they would jump up in the middle of a conversation.<br/><br/>Also there were quite a few characters which I felt was rather unimportant and were placed in there just to fill in some minutes. Walken's role a fine example of such a character.<br/><br/>The score was okay but the acapela female voices were not that effective relative to Ridley Scott's Gladiator.<br/><br/>Overall it was a good film from director Ridley Scott.

Not his best performance, and not the best movie I've seen him in, but as a friend of mine stated last night, ""this is about vengeance, and I can relate to that"". Definitely had some really cool scenes.<br/><br/>The skinny: Former Special Forces Agent goes down to Mexico to see his friend and former service buddy who has made a good living for himself.

Bodyguard tries to be tough, but through the daughter finds will to live again just as the daughter is taken.<br/><br/>Then you have a former military specialist incensed and goes out to kill everyone involved.  There are a few twists to the plot, but most of it is fairly straightforward.  This is about a man going out to kill the people who harmed the one person who touched his heart.<br/><br/>The stunts weren't as over the top as some blockbusters are, but the dramatic effects of the actors provides them with something besides electricity.  They are given life though rage and vengeance, and any viewer who has felt these things will have no problem empathizing.<br/><br/>The screenplay was a little overdone, modifying angles and focus to make it similar to other thrillers like Seven.  While it does have a decent effect, it creates more of an otherworldly perspective on the picture.  This is assumed to have provided to allow the viewer to get a sense of feeling the rage of Creasy, though to some viewers it may not have it's desired effect.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching, as this movie will move you. 6/10"

Denzel does do the movie justice as Creasy - the troubled bodyguard, the bond with the kid did make it a bit melodramatic but it's nothing really big - the second half of the movie it really picks up as Creasy returns to his old ways.  what was really interesting was that Christopher Walken was actually a good guy in this.<br/><br/>I like my action movies and this worked so 9/10"
"flickershows","6","0","0","5 May 2004"," Hero Or Brutal Sadist?
","Tony Scott is one of the modern maestros of fancy editing, zippity camera-work, and slick violence. So it's a shame that 'Man On Fire' is closer to the ugly sadism in 'The Fan' than to his wonderful techo-thriller 'Enemy Of The State'. Scott's films are fairly empty and derivative at the best of times, but he knows how to shoot action. Reuniting with Denzel Washington (they made the dynamite submarine drama, 'Crimson Tide') and working from Brian Helgeland's screenplay, this seemed like a can't-miss flick. Well, it missed.<br/><br/>What went wrong with 'Man On Fire'? Is it too long? Yes. Apart from the rock-solid Washington and the mere presence of Christopher Walken (playing *GASP* a good guy), is the cast mostly forgettable? Uh huh. Does Scott over-do the visual tricks when he should just let his story work on its own? Yup. Is the movie just too gruesome in the final hour when the hero turns vigilante and shows how they used to do things in Special Ops? Oh yeah. But at least the film is not boring or stupid. Denzel Washington is responsible for a lot of what DOES work, and he's given the opportunity to play a troubled hero in the first half and a sadistic hero in the second half. Actors love challenges like that and it's hard not to root for Denzel when he's kicking the asses of a bunch of guys who deserve it.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning continues to seem like she's an alien from far, far away. This little girl is too grown up for her own good. She can act, though, and her relationship with bodyguard Denzel is nicely developed. They're about the only characters who matter. Everyone else is window dressing. This isn't a terrible film, but it's not one of Tony Scott's best. He usually finds a way to make his violent flicks fun. There isn't much humour or fun to be found here, though. Even worse, there are no surprises in 'Man On Fire'. Geez, if you don't see the plot twist coming from 4 theatres away, you need to see more movies. But I liked the way he used (and sometimes OVERUSED) subtitles.<br/><br/>Maybe that's the kick in the head. Here's a movie about kidnappings and children in danger and murders and torture and betrayal and money and Mexico. It's got Mickey Rourke and Chris Walken in supporting performances. The lead is one of the finest actors in Hollywood and his young co-star is the female Haley Joel Osment. The director has made his millions working in the action-thriller genre. And still...all I can remember is the subtitles. I guess that's the essence of Tony Scott, style over substance. In 'Man On Fire', the gap between style and substance was a gigantic chasm."

The story was straight forward and not much to it, not as violent as people make it out to be. Dakota Fanning is really going to go places, she was great in this. Movie coulda been shorter, no need to have a slow start. Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke were almost non existant to the movie, so all that really mattered was Denzel which was fine with me.  It is sad to think that all of this is really going on in Mexico, that the police and law enforcement officials are in on some of the biggest kidnappings themselves there. The Mexican government needs to wake up and quit allowing such things to take place, not that this doesn't happen in other cities, but when it happens in other cities the people that get caught really wish they never were involved in police corruption. I guess the question is, is it proper to cheer for a guy going on a rampage and doing his own justice by tourturing and killing people for information? all I can say is I wish they had more guys like him, then terrorists would start being more afraid."

","This movie is one of the most emotional action movies I have seen in a long time.  It is definitely not the best movie Washington has been in, but it definitely shows off his amazing acting skills once again.  His portrayal of the broken down John Creasy is so awesome and so intense and he proves once again why he (along with Tom Hanks) is one of the best actors of the past 15 years.  He tugs at the hearts of the audience with his relationship with Pita (Dakota Fanning) and he pumps the adrenaline of the audience when he wants revenge for her kidnapping.  Denzel Washington can pull a crowd into a theater with his performance alone and that is what he has done here.  The movie is a bit slow at times but the performances of Washington and Fanninng (who should have about 30 Oscars before she is done, and I say this when she is at the age of 9!) make this movie worth seeing. Even Marc Anthony and Mickey Rourke do a good job in their supporting roles.  I also liked the performance of Radha Mitchell as the desperate mother wanted to get her daughter back.  She and Washington have some very interesting scenes together, I really enjoyed when the two of them were on screen.  I also need to give a mention to Christopher Walken's performance as Creasy's close friend Rayburn.  Now, his part is not huge but boy does he make the most of it.  He has some crazy lines that really entertained me and  he plays the part of this dear friend very well, there is just not enough you could say about him, he is one of the best. This movie is entertaining, emotional, moving and so very well acted especially in the case of Washington.  I am so impressed everytime I see him act, he has made so many so-so movies turn into really good movies just by having him act in them.  If anyone wants to see the very definition of acting go see any Denzel Washington or Tom Hanks movie, and since this is the most recent one with either of them in it then you should definitely spend your money on it.  The storyline is exciting and sad but overall this movie was quite enjoyable, go see it if for nothing else then just to see Denzel Washington act."

","Denzel Washington has become the most commanding actor in Hollywood. He may be in a bad film, but always gives a 3 dimensional performance. This film is really nothing more than a revenge drama.Denzel plays a man that gets hired to protect an American girl in Mexico City. He is an alcoholic, he is troubled by his past, the film never reveals too much, but he is in pain. He develops a bond with the girl, and it would be easy for this to be present this in a cute way, the relationship develops slowly, the movie doesn't rush it. When Washington finally cares, it is believable. She is kidnapped, what ensues is essentially a revenge spree from Denzel. The movie is glossy, but brutal, the audience wants Washington's character to prevail, but it isn't the kind of action movie that one cheers at. Tony Scott uses his usual frenetic editing, it is effective, but is distracting at times. But Denzel end his cast keep the movie interesting. Christopher Walken has a great supporting role. The movie never goes for a heroic tone, but it is escapism, Death Wish comes to mind. The difference is Denzel Washington, he makes the movie riveting instead of mearly watchable.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

Particularly,it's Washington,Walken,Mitchell and Dakotah Fanning who add weight to the material. The violence of the last hour and a half contrasted with the quiet charm of the first fifty minutes could almost make TWO movies.   It's tempting for your more cynical audience member to laugh off the heavy-handed sentiment and morality of the film,but given the set-up of the story, it would seem rather out of sync if it became completely amoral and dark. Director Scott's overusage of jump-cuts,fancy editing and(for lack of a beter word to describe it)subtitles threaten to turn this film hokey,so the pressure is on the leads to deliver something sober and true and they just achieve it. Denzel in particular is very good at switching from reflective,depressed former government op to steeled,enraged and efficient killing machine,and it is nice to see Walken play someone who is NOT a creepy,edgy baddie for once.

It was so adorable and heartwarming...I think I would have liked the movie more if it focused on the way she was able to break down his tough coating and bring out the sweetness in him. I loved the scene where she noticed him smiling and when he was training her for swimming and advising her to burp. I think a few more of those lovable scenes would have been nice. The rest of it was good too, and kind of exciting. It disturbed me a little bit at how ruthless Creasy could be to the people he was getting information from but the action was exciting. The end, though I wont give it away, was a bit depressing. It's not the greatest movie ever, but it's not a bad one either. Good acting, good plot, good SFX.<br/><br/>7/10"

","The movie works on a number of great levels, resurrection, redemption, justice, suspense, and finally the triumph of love. All the purists that want to reduce it to so many technical faults or successes simply miss the big picture, you are drawn in from the beginning and kept raptly engaged for the full length...and I, for one, have no regrets at its duration. Denzel plays his role with the proper restraint, anguished but not hand wringing, joyous but not ebullient, vengeful without being merciless and triumphant without arrogance. Dakota Fanning is truly sweet without being cloying, and their relationship never seems forced or artificial. Some have said that the lead in is a bit long, but without the time and attention to the development of this relationship the movie would fail miserably. Christopher Walken, who is worth watching when just reading a phone book, also keeps his often manic persona under wraps. The understanding that he is a thinly restrained dangerous man is transmitted flawlessly. The rest of the supporting cast is more than adequate, with Giancarlo Giannini's character especially intriguing...As you might guess, I recommend this movie."

","*some spoilers*<br/><br/>Despite being sold as an action flick, ""Man On Fire"" is essentially a gripping, dizzying (literarily)  thriller with a couple of action sequences and yet another typical fine performance by Mr. Washington and yet another -aren't I cool with my jaggedness and rough direction/editing- by Mr. Tony Scott.  Plus a script that is a bit more clever than it should be, these elements work to help us forget the film's familiar, generic core, and by the moment I saw the vengeful Washington character torturing a corrupt Mexican cop by cutting off his fingers as Puccini's famous aria ""Un Bel Di Vedremo"" played in the soundtrack, I had to concede I was viewing quality entertainment.<br/><br/>Which is very surprising, considering that I'm not a big fan of the -you wronged me I will wrong you and your clan- formula.  In those cases the heroes or anti-heroes rarely get my sympathy should they come into danger due to the fact that they are placing themselves in danger by their own will and the fact that they become no different then the scum they will inevitably wipe out, an irony I'm very tired off.  What's unique about MAN ON FIRE is that its vengeance theme is character driven--for a moment an unsociable, hard and cold man experiences friendship with a young girl only to have this contact with innocence and to his humane side snatched away from him.  It is a relationship that, however ephemeral is touching and effective in the way it makes sense out of the brutality that ensues.  The Washington character, one realizes, isn't a noble man resorting to extreme violence for a loved one. He's a monster reverting back to his former self only because a cruel world wouldn't let him be any other way.  It's a dark, gloomy and slightly depressing universe MAN ON FIRE is set in--a world in which no good deed goes unpunished and evil is prevalent even among the supposed victims and good guys.<br/><br/>But the narrative is gripping, as are the few action sequences.  Rather than driving the film what little action there is emerges from the story in a suspenseful, focused fashion--not needlessly prolonged, but cleverly short and maintained while managing to add on to the atmosphere of Hell that drenches the film.  I heard somewhere that the original MAN OF FIRE had the little girl dead--and most of the film the Washington character is under that presumption.  The ambiguity regarding her supposed death this time, I assume, is a result of Hollywood being Hollywood.  This time, quite frankly, I wouldn't have it any other way, because Dakota Fanning, despite being creepy in the sense all precocious child actors are creepy, is irresistibly cute and charming.  Killing her off would've been a bit too much.<br/><br/>
""Creasy is an artist.,"" says a horribly underused Christopher Walken, ""He's about to paint his masterpiece."" Well, the Bride's vengeance and its repercussions is more of a masterpiece--but Creasy's is nonetheless thrilling.  Though Scott here is overly self-indulgent with his familiar brand of direction through unceasing camera movement/too much editing he's confident and, in toto, handles the material well and makes Man On Fire acceptable entertainment in every sense.  He who demands more had no right walking into it in the first place."

","When I first saw the previews for ""Man on Fire"", I honestly didn't know what to expect.  There have been a lot of revenge movies out lately - ""Punisher"", ""Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2"", etc.  I honestly expected it to be like that.  I personally, didn't like either of those movies.  Anyways, I went to go see, ""Man on Fire"" tonight.  What I saw, honestly blew my mind.  I was so impressed by both Denzel Washington, but mainly Dakota Fanning.  I have seen her in other movies, but this one really impressed me.  The scary part was, she looks so much like my niece that it chilled me to the bone.<br/><br/>
I loved the way it was portrayed.  Creasy (Denzel) as the ex-military ""Soldier of Fortune"" hero who drinks a lot and has basically given up on life.  Then you have Pita (Dakota), the beautiful and very intelligent ten year old (and she is 10 too!) who gets under Denzel's skin and makes it okay for him to ""live"" again.   You have Samuel (Marc Anthony), who plays the concerned father without singing for once and his beautiful wife Lisa (Rahda Mitchell) who actually plays the concerned parent that enlightens Creasy character that Pita has a special love for him and wants him to be happy.<br/><br/>Somethings that bugged me for starters is that the movie DOESN'T HAVE A SOUNDTRACK!!!!   This movie is great and the singer from Gladiator (When Maximus is walking in the wheat fields when he dies) sings songs for this movie as well.  But, there is no soundtrack.  I would love there to be a score for this movie, but I have found none.   One of the other things that bothered me was the fact that the acting surrounding Marc Anthony's character ""Samuel"".  It wasn't that the acting was bad...it was terrible. You see the character crying and such and you can tell that it is fake. Even when he smiles, it looks like he is putting on a facade.<br/><br/>
I did not know at the time of watching ""Man on Fire"", that it was a remake. The ending actually made me believe that this was a true story.  I returned home and did research on it and found that it was NOT a true story.   I was actually kinda hoping it was.  But all of the acting, except Marc Anthony's character was amazing.  I can not wait to get this movie on DVD when it comes out.  Very very powerful, especially the ending.  When ""Pita"" screams, it was like - ahhhhh. It was bone chilling.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone.  Cheers!"

","In a day and age when there is such an urgency to shoot a film and then edit it, then get it out as quickly as possibly to the mass produces, it is so refreshing to see a film that goes an extra step for their viewers. Director Tony Scott does just that in the movie A Man on Fire. Scott is so cutting edge with his camera work and his sense of style is so realized and clear. One of the nicest things about Scott's directing, was his contrast between so many things, such as quick and slow, and light and dark. I can only imagine how long it took to draw out the extensive story boards that had to have been used, and the different shots. The subtitles were even given extra attention, which I wasn't sure that I liked at first, but why not? My only conclusion for my initial dislike is that we as a society are so use to being dealt the bear minimum. It really grew on me.The acting of course was superb, and quite breath taking. His manipulation of the camera is not a nauseating ride, but an exhilarating look into what movies could potentially be. This is film making at some of the finest that I've seen in a long time, and I'm looking forward to Tony Scott's next film."

","""Man on Fire"" is a remake of a movie from back in the 80's.  Never did see it but I'm guessing it's nothing quite like this. John Creasy is a Jack Daniels swilling,down-and-out former CIA assassin who just happens to come across an old colleague, Rayburn (Christopher Walken) while in Mexico. Rayburn gets Creasy a job as a bodyguard for a businessman's daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning).  If you've seen the trailers, you probably know what happens next. After the first 50 minutes of quiet banter between Creasey and Pita, the movie dissolves into a loud, out-for-blood revenge movie.  This change of pace is fine at first, but couldn't make sense of the direction after that, when the killing starts.  Between the herky-jerky camera styles and washed out colors, it's hard to stay focused on the plot. Can picture Tony Scott on a mechanical bull. Most of the characters look like they could use a transfusion along with Creasey. The actors do great work here, hard to find fault in that at all.  A more subdued style would have worked fine and maybe shaved 20 min. off the final time of 142 min.  The ending alone could have been compressed a little. With so much violence during the last acts of the film, the ending leaves you wanting just a little more to go out on."

"mr_movie_2004","8","0","0","27 April 2004"," Ultra stylish take on the revenge genre
","Tony Scott has displayed his extraordinary stylistic vision, in a genre that most directors handle with a very ordinary treatment.  While the constant camera movement, fast cuts, and unorthodox editing will inevitably receive a love-it-or-hate-it response, you must at least respect Scott for having the courage to take a chance and do something different here.  He has taken what is a pretty standard action-suspense yarn as far as material and storyline and turned it into an intriguing visual piece.  <br/><br/>The plot of this film is nothing particularly new or interesting.  But screenwriter Brian Helgeland, most famous for scripting LA Confidential and Mystic River, has done a nice job of creating a set of interesting and sympathetic characters and unfolding the events in such a manner that the viewer is never entirely sure of what will happen next. <br/><br/>
Another strong point of this film is the excellent cast.  Denzel Washington was a perfect choice as the taciturn and troubled Creasy.  Dakota Fanning is one of the better child actors to come along in some time and proves it in providing a key performance as Pita.  Mickey Rourke is perfect as the sleazy family lawyer.  Christopher Walken is great as usual as Creasy's close friend.  Even Marc Anthony, better known for his music career, does well in his role as Pita's father.<br/><br/>Despite it's strong points the film is not without flaws.  It runs about 15 minutes longer than it needed to, and some of the more sentimental moments are a bit cheesy.  But the overall product is a good one.  Scott, as always, handles action with a deft hand but beyond that he proves that he has made many strides forward as an artist with his bold approach to this film.  This combined with the strong performances of the actors involved provides an end result that is an interesting, violent, and ultimately different film.  As previously stated, this is a film that people will either strongly like or dislike.  I enjoyed it a great deal."

Denzel and Fanning played their roles to a high mirror shine, and the contradiction of ""the good guy has to do good things"" was thankfully shattered as Washington's John Creasy tore through worthless kingpins and corrupt cops like a lawnmower through dry grass.  Walken also, although is part is minute had some of the best lines from the film as well as Rhada Mitchell's dead on portrayal as Fanning's loving mother was simply haunting and resonant.

","OK, as far as violence, vengeance and virility go, this rivals any Charles Bronson flick.  It also has a grittier ending than the first attempt at filming this novel back in 1987.  (That movie also had a great cast at the time, even though it may have been made in Italy, and was headed by Scott Glenn.  I like Glenn and almost all his work but Denzel Washington brings something extra even to roles that may not be that sparkling.)<br/><br/>DW plays the same ""hero"" as in the first film since the two screenplays are based on the same novel.  This one is set in Mexico City, presumably because Latin America now has the kidnapping reputation that Italy once had. Again, the bodyguard Creasy looks after the young daughter of a rich local.  The daughter, of course, brings out the lost humanity of the bodyguard with a past.  Surprisingly, the screen pairing of Washington and the currently ubiquitous Dakota Fanning works, even for a curmudgeon like me.  (I'm sure she is being regularly injected with anti-growth hormones, even as I write this, in order to keep her kid/star power mojo and paychecks at their peak.)<br/><br/>Once a kidnapping goes very wrong, Creasy recovers in record time from his wounds and, lacking any other avenue than just returning to his formerly empty life, goes on a meticulous journey of revenge/vigilante justice.  It is implied here, as in the previous film, that this is the only justice available and, therefore, justified in its way.  This justification is validated by a brave reformer reporter and a high police official (the Italian Giancarlo Giannini, coincidentally) who seems to have no other way to fight the widespread corruption in the police and the kidnapping-as-business of organized crime.  More entertaining help is provided by old comrade-in-arms or comrade-in-atrocities, Christopher Walken.  He underplays here, but it is true as Roger Ebert, I believe, once said that he enlivens a movie just by showing up!<br/><br/>Objections?  Mercy or due process are missing altogether and some could argue that it reinforces racist or elitist approaches to justice by a lone American.  There may be some truth to this but given the set up of the plot, novel and movie, the people Creasy hunts down are about as mundanely evil as it comes and as well-protected in official circles as they can be. (Essentially the same situation is propounded in the 1987 film in Italy so the same arguments would have to be made there, as well.)  The movie is lengthy, especially when you divine very early the identities and motives of some of the ""surprise"" bad guys.  No, I'm not giving anything away.  What do you think when you see Mickey Rourke as a lawyer?!  If you were watching almost anyone but Denzel Washington during all this time, you might begin to tire.  It is far from a perfect film or premise but it is stylish and it is Denzel Washington and it is compelling within the world it conjures."

","Man on Fire has its moments of originality but the movie as a whole seems to be a bust.  The plot, involving Denzel as the bodyguard of a young girl who he bonds with, takes its sweet time setting up.  However, once his character shifts into 'revenge mode', its a nonstop avalanche of bombs, bullets and blood.  I liked the parts with Christopher Walken (who desperately needs a star vehicle for his massive talents), as well as the unique torture methods that Denzel utilizes in his pursuit of the Mexican mob and corrupt Mexican cops.  However, this film shoots itself in the foot by convoluting the storytelling in two ways.  Firstly, the film is roughly two and a half hours long, a bloated running time that could have been remedied by excising fifteen or twenty minutes of needless exposition.  Secondly, director Tony Scott employs far too many camera tricks to tell the story, the most I've seen in any film since Natural Born Killers.  It gives the movie the look of a music video, using techniques which are not only unnecessary but which also distract from the emotional character driven drama.  A good film but it could have easily been much better."

The entire supporting cast brings an amazing level of legitimacy to what is otherwise another revenge flick.<br/><br/>There are also some very creative film and editing techniques on display here, but they often become distracting (think MTV with a more bleached out look...but out into hyperdrive!), and there's no comparing the original's more satisfying conclusion to the remake's far more solemn and melancholy one. In fact, had the ending been better, I would have easily ranked it among the best of the year, and would want to watch again. As it stands, I don't think I'll be seeing this again anytime soon. **MINOR SPOILERS** The final scenes dealing with the last baddie on Creasy's list shown right before the credits seems clearly an after thought. It's as if the filmmakers looked at how sad the ending was, and decided to tack on a little extra to give the audience more of a gratifying end. It seems very clear this black and white ten second scene was done in reshoots, shooting two actors separate at the last minute in someone's backyard (well, it looked that way!) and then quickly slapped it together. Many will also find the outcome of Creasy's character very unsatisfying. **END SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Walken pops in with some memorable moments and then we never see his character again! Then there is the subject of little Dakota. First, she was amazing. She truly is a gifted actress, but were there no other physically more similar actresses to the Spanish singing crooner Marc Anthony? Why wasn't she Hispanic? It's a strangely white washed bit of casting that along with some other plot holes, it does hurt the credibility of the film.<br/><br/>As it stands, Dakota and Denzel have real chemistry, there are some truly satisfying ""revenge"" moments, a great supporting cast (Walken delivers a very strong understated performance...but where'd he go later?) and some inspired (although often distracting) visual flair. You'll be quoting the movie for days later with it's memorable dialog, but many will not be satisfied with the end (the audience I saw it with didn't seem to happy). So far, of all the revenge flicks out right now, KILL BILL is still the best game in town. (P.S., try watching the original MAN ON FIRE with Scott Glenn, Danny Aiello and Joe Pesci.

","I was able to catch a screening of the film Man on Fire, and I must say I was surprised at how entertaining this film actually was. As one can see there is no shortage of revenge films at the theaters in the last few weeks and this one stands out.<br/><br/>The film deals with a highly troubled ex soldier who reluctantly takes a job as a bodyguard for a young girl in Mexico. The emotionally detached Creasy soon becomes a ""father figure"" to the young girl as she restores his faith in life and renews his purpose. When she is kidnapped Creasy goes on a revenge spree leaving a trail of bodies up to the culprits who took her.<br/><br/>Man on Fire is brilliantly directed by Tony Scott, who combines strong visuals with a lot of humanity. There is very little action for the first part of the film as it mostly focuses on the relationship between the two principles. However when Creasy begins ""his masterpiece"" you won't leave un satisfied. The audience cheered when Creasy returns to the life he left and the techniques he despises in order to return the only thing that truly matters to him. What makes this film so entertaining is how straight forward and linear it is told. There is no time wasted on meaningless sub plots and Creasy questioning himself or techniques. It's a revenge film and it delivers on all fronts. Denzel is at the top of his game particularly in a sequence in which his character decides to give life a second chance which serves as the catalyst for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The violence is quite graphic in a few parts, (the first villain who dies, doesn't get it too easy) although it is only quickly shown or cut away from and is not be labored or done senselessly. Creasy only kills the true dirt and no one else. He is a skilled assassin and does not enjoy killing, therefore the only people who die are the ones who truly have it coming.<br/><br/>
All in all if you like action films that try to inject some humanity behind the violence then Man on Fire should deliver. Also kudos to the person who edited this film. It is unique in it's visual style and consistent and original in many ways(ie the subtitles). Think Spy Game visuals. Check it out!"

","With Denzil Washington, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke and Dakota Fanning on board, this film could've been something special. Unfortunately, Tony Scott blows the whole affair with his awful direction and use of the most annoying gimmick seen in recent cinema history - novelty subtitles! Brian Helgeland's average script serves up nothing in the originality stakes, but with a competent director helming the tale, we may have had a pretty good 'avenging angel' flick. Instead, Scott indulges his 'artistic' whims rather than concentrating on telling a story  the result is a 140 minute piece of self-indulgent dreck that irritates and bores in equal amounts. Even when the 'action' kicks in (and it takes a long time to do so), you'll probably find yourself with finger poised over the off switch. Life is too short for pretentious drivel like this.<br/><br/>The constant choppy editing, flickering images and pointless use of out-of-focus shots will make your head hurt and the aforementioned subtitles, which even appear when the actors are speaking English, do nothing to help matters. If you insist on watching this, keep the paracetamol on standby."

","I'm a big admirer of Tony's great achievements like ""Top Gun"", ""The Hunger"", ""True Romance"", and ""Crimson Tide"", but lately, IMHO, his work has fallen just an inch above mediocrity, and with ""Man on Fire"" he didn't even reach that mark. It seems like he tries to compensate the lack of a good script with a bunch of editing efx with numbing color filters and shaking camera shots as well as hyper fast zoom ins and an exasperating abuse of slow motion takes. This pretentious flick looks more like a huge MTV gangsta rap video where great actors like Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken are forced to ""pose"" instead of acting, to achieve this over wasted 360 degree shots just to make the scene look cool, well, it didn't work for me, If I would wanted to see pretentious editing efx I would go with a Darren Aronofsky film. But what bothers me the most is the way Mexican delinquency is portrayed, now don't get me wrong, kidnapping has become a very serious issue in Mexico, that can't be denied, but instead of giving the issue a serious approach, Mr. Scott goes for the Hollywood formula of transforming Mexico City into a fantasy place full of mariachis, massive raves and colonial streets with no traffic jams!!!, and the kidnappers are ""professionals"", very intelligent villains with unlimited resources that spend their time thinking how to conquer the world as they twist their moustaches. Maybe it's just that I live in Mexico City, but it really bothers me the cartoonish view Americans have of Mexico. At the end, this movie is a monumental mess with a lot of plot holes, clichés, and stereotypes with just one redeeming aspect that can be summarized in two words: Dakota Fanning<br/><br/>My rating: 3/10"

Hollywood doesn't respect other countries culture (in this case is Mexico) and treat them like trash. Tony Scot should come back to his adds and forget movies. He doesn't have talent and conscience.

","Man on Fire is film I fondly remember from 15 years ago (saw it when it released).
A friend of mine brought this movie up and I couldn't remember pretty much anything from it, which was a bit alarming, as I'm a movie guy.
So, I decided to watch it again, and I wish I shouldn't.<br/><br/>While the story and dialogue were top-notch, the pacing and editing were pretty mediocre.<br/><br/>Tony Scott is dead, and I hate to bring this up, but this is the worst cut film, I've ever seen with a rating above 5 in IMDB!
The quick super-cut of frames with different color grading and object distortion was not overly-used, it was literally in every second scene!
I imagine someone showed Tony this new cool thing to do and he just loved it so much, and went like, we need this as much as possible!
Well, Tony, it's amateurish, it's nauseating and doesn't bring anything to the picture!<br/><br/>Same can be said about the pacing. 2 hours of 40 mins tops scenes, stretched out as much as possible to the point where I can swear some scene were blatant copies of a scene from 10 mins ago.
Acting was mediocre, beyond Denzel and Dakota, the rest were a bunch of cliched characters and mediocre actors. Especially, Christopher Walken, he was abysmal in this.<br/><br/>I won't even mention how the movies was aiming to be realistic, and it was, before the last 40 mins where Denzel goes into Commando mode, only to be shot by the only person, who can barely use a gun!
And, how does he stay alive and active for 4-5 hours when being shot in the bloody chest!<br/><br/>Overall, this is a simple revenge story film we've seen over and over again, but this one is poorly cut, overblown and throws it's realism concept out the window after you've endured it for a whole 2 hours!<br/><br/>A solid 5.5-6/10 for this, but nowhere near the 7.7/10 in IMDB."

Denzel does his usual superb acting job, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell as daughter Pita and her mother Lisa Ramos also do fine jobs. If not for the photography I would probably give this flick about a 7. The movie runs a bit too long in my humble opinion. But who was the person in charge of photography??!!! Paul Cameron?? If I had been watching this on the big screen I would have had to leave after an hour because of a splitting headache. The camera is out of focus and jiggling about 1/3rd of the time!! Just horrible. However, I did learn something from this movie; namely, that in Latin America at least in the early 2000s (this movie was released in 2004), there is a big problem with kidnappings."

","Man On Fire is basically a revenge flick with a little redemption along the way.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays John Creasy an ex CIA man who has both lost his faith and become an alcoholic due to guilt about his past. Whilst visiting an old friend and colleague in Mexico (played brilliantly by Christopher Walken) he stumbles into a job of bodyguard to Pita Ramos (Dakota Fanning) a young girl from a rich family of Mexico City.<br/><br/>What makes this movie work even more so than the interesting style of photography against a good soundtrack incorporating a great revenge style story is the chemistry between the two main stars Washington and Fanning.

","This movie is truly remarkable. There is no doubt in my mind that story to this movie is one of the most under rated of all time. Man on Fire gives such a emotional look into the life of ""Creasy"" that even the ""strongest"" of people will choke up. This movie is a must see for anyone who is comfortable with some intensely violent scenes. However, the violence does serve a purpose and it is not merely for the sake of pleasing the gore addicts. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Be sure to pay close attention to Creasy's change in attitude during his encounters with ""Pita Ramos"". The score also provides an amazing effect to the characters' emotions. Tony Scott is a genius film maker and I would be very interested to hear why anyone would dislike Man on Fire. If anyone has any questions regarding the film, post them and I would be more than happy to help you answer them if I have the time."

","I just have to say it, this is an excellent Denzel Washington movie, and I can not believe he did not win the Academy Award for best actor, because he did a splendid job. In the film, Washington plays Creasy, a bodyguard for young Pita, the daughter of rich aristocrats living in Mexico City. His assignment, to protect the girl at all costs, even with his own life.<br/><br/>To help his fledgling business thrive, the girls father sets up a kidnapping, only to see it go all wrong.

""Man on Fire"" is very edgy and dramatic to say the least. The best part is that the film is based on actual events.<br/><br/>This film deserves the best, and here, that is what it gets, which is why 10 out of 10 is the least I can give to a film that shows us if we love someone enough, we are willing to bet our life on them."
"JoeMcCain","10","2","5","1 September 2005"," A special, intriguing, discomfiting near-master work
","'Man on Fire' is a film in two parts. . . .no, that is wrong, it is a film in two halves – one as bright as a little girl named 'Pita' and the pleasure she gives us -- the other as dark as the terrible density of a Black Hole that crushes even light itself.<br/><br/>Unlike so many films which are in two pieces -- for that is their flaw, they don't make a complete, smooth work – the two opposing halves of 'Man on Fire' fit as tightly as the Yin and the Yang, diametric opposites seamlessly welded into a whole.<br/><br/>We are first seduced into a rather sweet un-cloying film, as Denzel Washington's 'John Creasy', resists ... then yields to an increasingly swift glide from a shelled and cynical and absolutely alone near-alcoholic into the persistent affection of the 10-year-old Mexican-American girl he is hired to protect. Hired on the cheap, ""because I drink."" <br/><br/>'Pita', wonderfully crafted by the very young Dakota Fanning, has a wisdom and a charm that seem to sometimes arise in the only child who grows up in a difficult but not cruel situation, and has the time and space to develop a strong character, a 'center'. Pita is friendly, and so is disappointed when rebuffed by Creasy, but not hurt. After a step back for a long look at him, this musing little girl decides Creasy is worth the siege.<br/><br/>She draws him into a game of emotional chess, which he will not admit he is even playing until he is checkmated. In turn he helps her surmount an athletic obstacle, and the reward to him – and to us – is her elation.<br/><br/>Creasy and Pita have become close. 'Close' is something Creasy has not felt in a very long time. A friend says much later in the film, ""She showed him it was all right to live again"".<br/><br/>This sweetness -- not of saccharine, but of a complex natural honey -- becomes more and more disquieting. For we know he is a bodyguard hired to protect this little girl -- in a Mexico City of 24 child kidnappings in six days. So, we also know the attempt on 'Pita' will come. HAS to come. And because of the dark staccato march of the film, we know that the attempt will be very hard, probably brutal.<br/><br/>And after the kidnap comes – chaotic, violent, messy – a wounded Creasy mutates swiftly into an indomitable arsenal of vengeance from which even Dumas, author of 'The Count of Monte Cristo', would recoil. There are many kinds of anger – wild rage . . . molten fury . . . a cold and measured wrath. It is the last that is the most dangerous, because it is an anger that thinks and calculates and cannot be distracted. It is John Creasy's.<br/><br/>His friend 'Rayburn', played wonderfully by Christopher Walken, describing Creasy's anger as an art, says – ""He's about to paint his masterpiece."" Creasy formulates a solo raid on the complicated forces of gang greed grafted to official corruption that engineered the kidnapping, with a 'little help from his friends' – a former fellow counter-intelligence operative, a veteran Mexico City newswoman with a mission to expose rotten special police officers, and an honest police official of courage and a profile too public for the corrupt to dare touch.<br/><br/>There has never been a Reaper so Grim as John Creasy. His retribution is absolute, merciless, and thorough, with little 'touches' that an artist of any kind tends to apply to a 'masterpiece'.<br/><br/>It is often a difficult film to watch, because it is so raw, so real, so visceral and yet so intelligent. Our emotions and our intellects – that is to say, our knowing minds – are drawn toward and into its center, which swallows us like a slow, inexorable python.<br/><br/>It's a smart film, an intelligent film, and inside are some of the tightest turns and twists outside of the human intestine, which is where we are taken -- into the bowel of crime and corruption. There are too many surprises to follow, except by rushing to catch up, but none are gratuitous, none are forced. And all are intriguing.<br/><br/>Tony Scott's direction of Brian Helgeland's script increases our discomfort with a pace often pierced by rapid, unclear shards of sequence that unsettle us, and a murky frame here and there – 'What the hell was in that pool?', ''Who yelled that?', and just plain 'Hunh?' As with all good films that plot well, there are plants here and there – but some pay off, and some never reappear at all, which adds further to our dis-ease. We can never be certain of anything in this shifting five-dimensional work.<br/><br/>And Denzel Washington's craft and depth and range are just splendid. As is the rest of the cast, without exception, that I noted.<br/><br/>Though the film may stumble at moments, it dares to do so much that the missteps are forgiven, as might be the few human errors on a wondrous sculpture. The belief one is forced to suspend on occasion is surrendered gladly, for we know that neither life nor real art can be perfect. Both must just do their best.<br/><br/>There has never been a 'perfect' film, and never will be. So we must give the well-crafted superlative near misses the 10's. – in lieu of 9.58's and 9.79's.<br/><br/>'Man on Fire' is a flaring 9.65 – meaning, a '10'."
"pc95","5","2","5","31 July 2005"," Predictable, poor music/soundtrack, glorification of violence
","One of the worst pretentious, unintelligent ways to ruin scenes in a movie is to misplace or indulge in music, soundtracks, or sound effects that have no business being there. A woeful trend in movies nowadays is trying to substitute indistinct female singing to somehow enhance poignancy or emotion - IT Doesn't WORK and its a terrible cop-out to adding proper music or even silence. It's mindless and destroys the picture, much like when well placed sounds/music make a movie so fantastic and memorable in its positive counterpart. Man on Fire suffers badly from this. The cinematography is at times interesting, but gets distracting. Denzel Washington does a good job, but he's done much better, and the child actress Dakota Fanning was much too adult-like - whether that was a character problem in the writing, or the the actress herself, or maybe even the direction or a combination, it doesn't matter. Finally, the movie is badly predictable. It's introduction is too long, and Ceasy's killing spree is glorified and preaches violence as a cure-all. One of the main attractions is the setting of Mexico City - some excellent visuals and atmosphere....however, poor soundtrack and mindless revenge served in a predicable manner pull down this movie to less than average."

","I avoided this for years, because... well because Denzel bothers me. He's probably a nice man. He does a very fine job of projecting a sort of jolly wisdom on screen. But every character and every stroke within that character references this persona. It isn't even him, its his public face. Its the most annoying sort of pseudoacting I know. Unless the movie hinges on this particular and very narrow notion, he fights it.<br/><br/>So we end up with a failed picture with a guy in it that we just have to love, or at least admire. Whether we like it or not, race matters in this, because the type he draws on for that personal origin is that of the wise black uncle. He did choose that face after all. Though Forest Whitaker (for example) is in much the same spot, he's chosen to be a real actor, a different man each time we see him.<br/><br/>So that bias kept me away from this. My loss. Washington really does work here. Its not because he is any different than elsewhere. But because the filmmaker was intelligent enough to know the man's limits and build the movie around them. <br/><br/>And what a construction! Yes, it can be said that Tony also makes the same movie each time. Yes, he uses the same devices each time, striving for the same effect. But he's getting so darned good at it. His dynamic camera is so integrated with his jumping cuts  the most energetic in the business  that while he invented none of it, he surely is the master. I need to go see his TeeVee work on cerebral detectives now. I must.<br/><br/>That camera tension is something worth noting, and why it works. Its because the camera stands in for our eye. If managed well, we accept it as our eye, and when it moves, we accept that we would be and are moving that way. When it slides from a face to an object, we believe that we would have done the same, noticing something that may or may not be important.<br/><br/>We have the running camera here, making us less of a ghostly, gliding observer, but a human running one, panting, eager. SInce Creasy is so cool, it casts us as actually more in the story than he is. The roles are reversed a bit: though he makes things happen, he is the viewer and we are on the street.<br/><br/>Brothers. The Coens. The Quays. The Scotts. Cinematic genius in pairs.

","You want a revenge thriller that isn't run of the mill ? Difficult task considering it's been done . In fact this entire film is a remake of another film from the 1980s when action thrillers were very fashionable . They were also fairly low brow with a host of big name stars or relatively well known actors , or relatively well known wannabe non actor stars ( Hello Chuck Norris ) getting a bit mean and moody and dispatching bad guys who were invariably part of a multi ethnic street gang or nasty communists in a variety of cruel and explicit ways . It's been done before and you'd better be bringing something new to the table . Considering MAN ON FIRE was written by Brian Helgeland the signs might be promising . Helgeland might be rather hit and miss but anyone who wrote brought LA CONFIDENTIAL to screen after everyone considered it to be unfilmable does deserve some respect . Dare I say that if it doesn't work out Helgeland might remain blameless ? <br/><br/>I'm afraid that Helgeland has to take some blame for this movie failing . I read the synopsis and apparently it's about a bodyguard on the revenge trail after some seriously bad gringos because they've overstepped the mark by kidnapping a little girl . Obviously it wasn't a local Latina girl because that'd be business as usual so the audience are asked to empathise with the victim because it's a blond American child - and she's been kidnapped by Mexicans .Probably conscious that this film might inadvertently become a recruiting film for the Aryan Brotherhood the producers hit upon the bright idea of making the American bodyguard black . This is one of two major problems the film has <br/><br/>1 ) It stars Denzil Washington <br/><br/>2 ) It's directed by Tony Scott <br/><br/>The major inciting incident of the actual kidnap doesn't take place until an hour in to the running time so thanks for nothing Brian and before we get there we have a character piece . See the problem ? We have a character piece starring Denzil Washington and directed by Tony Scott . Washington has always left me with indifference . He's not bad but by the same yardstick he's not someone who ever gives an outstanding performance in my opinion and he's asked to give a multi-layered performance as nice guy turned cold hearted assassin . A slight fail . What is an epic fail is someone thinking Tony Scott is a natural choice for a character driven story . He certainly doesn't give the impression he's suited for the talkative slow burning early scenes . When the action does finally take off Scott does what he normally does and ramps , over edits and uses crash zoom lens giving the impression you're watching a monster hybrid between a video game and an advert for rum . I suppose it could have been worse and we could have got Ben Affleck starring in a film directed by Michael Bay but that's not much in the way of praise as to what we did get"

You can really believe him as the rage engulfed bodyguard and he seemed like a real tough guy, the kind you really don't want to mess with. All this and he can still use the term ""catches my fancy"", how cool is that?! Having said that all the cast are great, but the three names you will know are Mickey Rourke, Dakota Fanning (of war of the world fame) and Christopher Walken!

Another surprising actor was the little Dakota Fanning. We have seen Dakota in I am Sam, Hide and seek and War of the worlds. Dakota gives a excellent performance and the chemistry between Denzel and her is very heart warming. Christopher Walken is good in a supporting role. This is Tony Scotts Best movie he has directed. The violence is superb. The scene where he cuts of the bad guy's fingers is Superb. The bomb planted behind the mans private was very amusing. I have seen the alternate ending of this movie on the DVD. I think the previous ending would of been better. Those who haven't seen the DVD special features. The ending has Denzel going to the Voice's house and in a final confrontation, Denzel smiles as he pulls out his timer watch, with a bomb planted on him. He Explodes, killing himself and all the baddies in the house. But, apparently this scene was already featured in a previous movie. We have seen this sort of thing in Leon. Anyway, Man on fire is a Brilliant entertaining movie."

","You've never seen a kidnap film done like this before. Director Tony Scott's flashy gem is more than the action extravaganza that it implies. Essentially a film of two halves, the first dealing with the father and daughter like relationship between Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning, the second dealing with Denzel's invigorating revenge after Dakota is kidnapped and presumed dead. Scott impressively takes his time with the first half developing a real bond between the two leads. Denzel gives one of the greatest performances of his career. He begins as a burnt out alcoholic haunted by his past as an assassin who's soul begins to heal due to his bonding with Dakota only to be forced back into his old ways demonstrating how ruthlessly efficient he can be. Sound familiar? This could have more in common with a western than anything else. Dakota is a revelation and there is great support from Christopher Walken. The Equalizer should have been called Man On Fire 2."

","I wonder if Bryan Mills read the case files of John W. Creasy before he went to retrieve his kidnapped daughter four years after Creasy's bloody rampage. Hmmm.<br/><br/>You want no-holds-barred revenge? No sympathy, no mercy and no escape? Meet the established unforgiven Creasy as he takes on his new role of bodyguard to safeguard an insurance policy. Oh, and a little girl in Mexico City.<br/><br/>Extremely bad hombres or ""professionals,"" are kidnapping citizens in Latin America at an alarming rate. This is one of those stories. <br/><br/>After what seems like the LONGEST OPENING ACT IN CINEMA HISTORY, or roughly 34.25% of the full movie, they've established the unredeemable ""hero"" and drunk becomes lovable to both the audience and the little girl he's hired to protect. Bam! Surprise, she's kidnapped. After a botched ransom drop-off, Creasy's bent on revenge against the organization who kidnapped his little friend. <br/><br/>And ""revenge"" is putting it mildly. What he does to these disgusting humans would make Satan flinch. <br/><br/>Problems. You have to get used to a shaky cam. It's Director Tony Scott's signature move, but it's enormously distracting for the most part. Okay, all parts. Also, as stated, it takes an enormous time to get to the goods. Literally all he's trying to establish in those first 50 minutes could've been summed up in one quarter the time or less. <br/><br/>I only saw this movie once and near the time it came out, around 2004+. That was about 14 years ago and I remembered only one scene - hint: it showed more uses for a car's cigarette lighter than just for smokes. So, this was like a fresh viewing for me and still I could predict practically all that was going to happen. It's not hard to figure out the story - even with the camera abruptly shaking every few moments.<br/><br/>Now, the positives are worth the whole experience. Denzel Washington (Creasy,) as always, was fantastic. Believable human being from start to finish. The supporting cast, including Christopher Walken and Rachel Ticotin, also very good. I did like the cinematography and the unapologetic and brutal/true view of the ""interrogations"" from Creasy. <br/><br/>RIP Scott, and I know what he was trying to accomplish in this movie, especially in the opening 34.25%, but seriously, read my synopsis above and skip to about 45 minutes into this. That's about how much could've been cut from this overlong film to make it tighter and so that we could get to the actual plot.<br/><br/>This uses the backdrop of Mexico City and all the kidnappings from horrible and vile people. But, really, this is Denzel's movie. Any true fan of Denzel needs to see this excellent performance of his. Well, those people and people who wanna see the bad guys really, REALLY pay for their greedy sins.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: In-between 24's Jack Bauer and Taken's Bryan Mills is John Creasy. If you liked the first two I mentioned, you'll warm right up with Creasy. Heck, throw in The Transporter's Frank Martin and have a TV/Movie marathon. So, watch, in any particular order: 24: Season 8, Taken (avoid the sequels,) The Transporter 2 (#1 is optional, but #2 fits more here) and Man on Fire. Now that...would leave anyone exhausted from all the eye-for-an-eye blows and still pleased with the ride."

","While traveling to Mexico City to visit an old friend, an ex- assassin gets a job as a bodyguard for a small girl. After she gets kidnapped and he's badly injured, not waiting to recover, he sets out to eliminate the ones responsible, one by one, hoping to get to the bottom of this despicable act.<br/><br/>It's a brilliant thriller which focuses on Denzel's character as he unwillingly starts to bond with the little girl he's being paid to protect and the entire killing spree that follows after her kidnapping. Although apparently long, it manages to be very interesting throughout its entire length, without a single dead moment or event which shouldn't have been there. We're about to find out a big conspiracy which slow unravels, one killing at a time, ultimately leading to a highly unpredictable but very satisfying finale. Creasy is excellently played and described, making the whole atmosphere even more tense and thrilling as time goes by. The plot is also very well thought and complex, creating a great and unique atmosphere in which the whole action can be displayed in its entire beauty.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I am a big fan of Denzel, his acting really being top-notch in all movies I have seen with him, especially in leading role, as he manages to transmit a lot of emotions and feelings with everything he depicts. He has a great ability to transpose into his characters, especially in this type of movies, making almost all of them one of a kind. It's a true pleasure to watch him act and this movie is no exception. On the contrary, it's one of the best!

The editing of some scene(where the camera shakes, a lot of cuts happens. I don't know the right term for this) was simply annoying. If I somehow saw this in big screen I wouldn't be surprised to see some people get dizzy!! If the movie lacked this annoying bit I would've given it 7/10 easily.<br/><br/>One thing I loved about this movie is how adorable Dakota Fanning was. Her acting was superb and complementary to the great acting from Denzel. An on the topic of Denzel's acting we cant expect anything less from the great actor.<br/><br/>All in all this is far far better than typical action movies which addressed some real life problem of that time period in an entertaining way.

If you like a well thought out revenge story, where the lead character is not a Rambo-wannabee but a trained, calculating, intelligent, and totally ruthless professional, then this is the movie for you.

","Man on Fire, a powerful film on the theme of redemption. Indeed John Creasy (Denzel Washington) , plays a former operative agent now turned body guard to a young girl (Dakota Fanning). She is kidnapped and Creasy will be on her search without pity for anyone involved. All through the film, we will learn more about John Creasy and his past. One of his dialogues with Paul Rayburn (Christopher Walken) Creasy will say: Will God forgive us for what we've done''? Rayburn's answer is a small smile and says: ''No''. In addition, a recurrent scene appears many times showing a person in the water then blood fills the pool. You can't have a better symbol of a the redemption process gone through by Creasy as it will foreshadow the failure of his quest. One can go on and on in the analysis of the character's search for peace and answers to what he has gone through in the past and the will of a new beginning. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves to talk about a subject, in this case redemption, which the movie has a lot to offer in terms of content."

The movie stars Denzel Washington as bodyguard John W. Creasy (who was originally played by Scott Glenn in the 1987 version.) who is hired to protect a young girl named Pita Ramos (played by Dakota Fanning)who then gets kidnapped by these unknown people in Mexico as well as corrupt cops (which doesn't surprise me that much because Mexico is a very corrupt country.) The movie also has a great supporting cast that includes Marc Anthony as Pita's dad, Mickey Rourke as the family attorney, Christopher Walken as a good friend of Creasy's, and Radha Mitchell as Pita's mother.

Scott was a visual virtuoso whose movies were always worth watching, even when the writing wasn't up to snuff. MAN ON FIRE unfolds logically and, when the s--- hits the fan, it hits the fan HARD. This is the kind of movie I tend to prefer when it comes to the Driven Man out for Revenge: it's uncompromising and, ultimately, very, very satisfying.

","The only thing about this movie that reduces the vote from 10 to 9 is the editing which sometimes looks like an MTV music video.<br/><br/>Besides that, this movie is great. Acting is super and the script is good. The story might seem shallow and lame, but when watching the movie, it is to the contrary. The interaction between Creasy (Denzel) and Lupita (Dakota) is great and very believable. I understand a love story between Creasy and Lisa (Lupita's mother) was cut out, and I am happy that is the case. When I watch the movie, I see ""something brewing"" between the two of them, which adds to the depth of the movie and to the characters. Creasy's character does not go well with an outright love story like that...but on the other hand, his feelings for Lupita is very believable and it is actually quite heart-breaking to see how little innocent Lupita can break through the thick wall of loneliness and pain that surrounds Creasy.<br/><br/>The action is great and just enough. Walken is, as always, excellent in his supporting role. It is just something about that guy...just watch him deliver the following sentence in the scene when he talks to the police officer and takes a piece of food: ""A man can be an artist...Creasy's art is death...he is about to paint his masterpiece.""

And because of this, her kidnapping is genuinely harrowing . . . and his quest for payback is just brutal enough to make you cheer the man on. Tony Scott's frenetic editing always keeps you on edge, and the emotional depth in Helgeland's script is what really makes that ending a one-two punch. <br/><br/>This is a well-written movie, and these two characters will linger in your brain long after it's finished. <br/><br/>7/10"

"cathalokane","7","1","2","27 January 2014"," Entertaining film but a little formulaic and predictable
","This is an enjoyable film. Everything is coherent and well produced, the scenes flow nicely into each other and the relationships feel real.<br/><br/>The problem is that the plot is blatantly signposted for you from an early stage. You are literally bludgeoned over the head with ""this girl is going to get kidnapped"" from a very very early part of the film. As a result, the relationship that is central to the emotional hook of the movie, mentioned above, feels a little forced. You know what you are being prepared for. The girl is getting kidnapped, so the film is trying to make you care about this fact, in the lead up to that event. It just felt a bit contrived to me.<br/><br/>My only other minor criticism is that the actors are a bit too type-cast. You can tell from the opening ten minutes which actors are going to have been involved in the kidnap, because the actors picked to play these parts look like ""baddies"" - the Dad and the attorney being the two primary culprits. Is there really any need for this? Especially when you aren't supposed to know the person is involved until the end. Could the film not have benefited somewhat from the Dad being cast as a lovable teacher type rather than the slimy gangster type? I was well aware that Daddy was going to be involved in the whole operation from the moment I laid eyes on him.<br/><br/>Other slight criticisms are deserved in the gratuitous but brief love scene between the Mum and Dad. It just felt utterly pointless and out of place to see her take her top off and it also not in the spirit of the movie - as their relationship really wasn't important. Also, the 3/4 times that Debussy's Clair de Lune was tossed into the mix also seemed slightly odd.<br/><br/>I am nitpicking a little bit with the above, as overall the movie is competent and tells its story well. It's a solid film that will satisfy those looking for an uncomplicated dose of Saturday night entertainment."
"JolinKnight","9","1","2","23 November 2013"," Hope or no hope
","Some see hope from the movie while the others suggest that if you think deeply you will find it is actually hopeless rather than hope. In my opinion regardless of the original expectation of the director what I see from the movie regarding hope subject is hopeless.<br/><br/>Start with the issue high frequent kidnapping, it depends on nothing but the corrupted society, only reform the regime can help. Along with the development of the drama it is found that the cops is helping and the officers are not helping but filling their own pockets. The only force citizens depending on to against crime is part of crime, so where is hope, there is only hopelessness left.<br/><br/>Then Pita's successful rescue is due to a well trained agent in other word luck the possibility of which is one in thousand or much less. It is typical American film tie all the hope on a hero then the hero saves the world. If you come out of the film facing the realistic world, well you put you hope into wrong bank. You are gambling as stupid as gambler.<br/><br/>Finally it seems this society has hope. There are people representing justice like the journalist and the special department officer. However after watching the sexual trade between them it needs to rethink about the justicial side. As if the justice can be bribed by sex this time it cannot make sure it cannot be bought by money or power next time.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the emphasis of this film is not hope or justice but the heroic action. However under a dim background like this this film not only fails to show the audience hope but owe they a happy ending as well. But it is great movie it performs this way with its own reason, what is that it your turn now to see the film."

","Certainly one of the finest movies I have seen for quite some time. Exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film. Denzel Washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date, and the rest of the cast perform beautifully. Christopher Walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as I would have liked. A story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love. This is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener. All in all, a truly gripping film from beginning to end. Highly recommended"
"christophe92300","6","1","2","22 August 2013"," Enjoyable
","Assuming that kidnapping is a common thing in Central and South America, Tony Scott and his writers deliver an action movie far from being original, but rather striking thanks to, for instance, powerful scenes such as the interrogation in the car.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie, which sets and develops the Pita-Creasy relationship, is a bit long — particularly considering the viewer quite clearly knows what is going to happen —, but leads to an ultra dynamic second part in form of a killing spree, with an excellent Denzel Washington, driven by his characters feeling of vengeance.<br/><br/>On the whole, the film is enjoyable, however, on the form, two elements are questionable. First, although the cinematography is very dynamic (Scott's trademark), it is sometimes too stylized and almost epileptic with those headache inducing short cuts, zooms and flashes. And second, the soundtrack mixes too many styles and therefore clearly lacks coherence. Finally, and more generally, one could blame Man On Fire for being sometimes a but too cliché, and a bit too schmaltzy with grandiloquent violins, especially in the first part."

","This is the 1st movie review I have ever written so bear with me-<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes of Man on Fire I was super entertained. The director did an amazing job of introducing Denzel as alcoholic Creasy and Fanning as Pita. You could see Denzel and Fannings bond grow and grow, it was awesome to see and I could not wait for the plot to unfold. And than the plot came along and the director f'ed up a could be incredible movie. He introduced lame distorted and fuzzy scenes and made the movie annoying and hard to follow. This was most annoying during the scene at the club and other super climactic scenes. These scenes were also way to short as I felt like I basically watched Creasy go around Mexico City and every 5 minutes kill a guy who would give information as to who the next guy was. There was never any roadblocks and Creasy just went around for over an hour doing what felt like the same thing over and over again, against very powerful people. Finally the ending came along and saved me from turning the DVD player off. The ending was absolutely superb. There was a cool (but semi predictable) twist and the ending was extremely satisfying. I just wished the real meat of the movie would have been better because it could have been an incredible action sequence had it not been so repetitive. Overall it is still a movie worth watching because of the superb acting and a great beginning and ending. Nonetheless I have never been so disappointed after such a superb introduction.<br/><br/>Personally id give this movie somewhere between five and six stars."

Its purported intelligent twist, which I guessed with certainty past one hour of its 2:30 running time, is nothing if not the old Hollywood compulsion of tying up all the knots and leave people safely satisfied.<br/><br/>Another reviewer on IMDb states this is a violent film and that it ignores 30 years of social blablabla, but the only violence in this film(other than the cartoonish deaths and bullet wounds), is the ease on which they turn the very serious issue of kidnapping into a thrill ride, all the while pretending they are serious in their approach.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of good things in it(Denzel is top form in this one), and there are far worse offerings, but it really only works in the shallowest of ways.<br/><br/>How this has a 7.7 rating in this site is beyond me.<br/><br/>PS: for a truly good film on vengeace, try ""Oldboy""."
"sddavis63","5","1","2","25 October 2008"," Denzel Washington's Performance Is Better Than The Movie As A Whole
","I watched this movie largely because of the presence of Denzel Washington in the cast. He does not disappoint. His portrayal of Creasy is both powerful and believable, and he does a good job of showing the character's development over the course of the film from a cold and largely uncaring figure (""I'm your guard, not your friend"" he says to young Pita, played by Dakota Fanning) to his final admission that he loves her, a love portrayed by his self-sacrifice for her sake. As strong as Washington was, however, the movie on the whole disappointed me.<br/><br/>The two halves of the movie are very different in tone. I thought the first half was the better. Although there's a bit of a mystery to Creasy's background, except that we know he used to work in counter-insurgency and has a drinking problem, the characters are otherwise introduced nicely and pretty well fleshed out. The first half also offers a truly scary portrait of child kidnapping in Mexico. The second half was less satisfying. It became extremely violent, losing its focus on the characters for the most part. It lacked flow and it was difficult to follow at times. I was also a bit put off by director Tony Scott's ""style"" for lack of a better way to put it. His directorial decisions were at times quite irritating - and must I point out that you DO NOT need English subtitles when the characters are already speaking English - which for some strange reason happened a few times! In spite of these weaknesses, the movie manages to hold your attention, largely because you really want to find out what has happened to Pita, and the ending was a noble ending rather than a classic happy ending, which would have been too easy to include. Overall - 5/10"
"Jtbone3141","10","1","2","25 August 2008"," Truly Amazing-Two Films in One
","Tony Scott's masterpiece plays like two films in one: a heartfelt drama and a scorching revenge saga.<br/><br/>The first half enters John Creasy (Washington) into a violent world of kidnappings and corruption. He is a former assassin who is bored of life and is an alcoholic. By his friend's suggestion, he becomes a bodyguard to a young child named Pita played fantastically by Dakota Fanning. His alcoholism and crankiness would chide most children away from befriending him, but the relentless Pita defrosts his heart and makes him feel like a person again. He puts down the bottle and picks up the Bible. And laughs. And smiles.<br/><br/>But one day, corrupt police officers attack him. Being outmanned, Creasy is left for dead as Pita is kidnapped before his eyes. A negotiation occurs between the kidnapper and the family, but the result is heartbreaking, and destroys Creasy's world of happiness.<br/><br/>Creasy puts the Bible down and picks up the gun. Assisted by a reporter and a police official, he swears to destroy every last person who had anything to do with Pita's kidnapping. Thanks to his experience in the military and covert operations, he goes on a murderous rampage against the brotherhood, La Hermandad, notching an incredible body count. He leaves few people still alive and many dead. Creasy is relentless in finding the truth behind the failed negotiation and Pita's kidnapper. And no one can stop him.<br/><br/>Watch this film if you get the chance. It is brutal yet brilliant, bloody yet beautiful. Wonderful acting and a good script highlights this masterpiece of an action movie. You won't be sorry for the two and a half hours you've spent."
"filmaker44","10","1","2","24 June 2008"," Great Film
","Man on Fire is an amazing film because of the emotional arc the main character, Creasy, makes. He starts lost and calloused by the life he's lead until he meets Pita, a young girl he's hired to body guard. It is through the love Pita shows Creasy that gives him the will and strength to live again. The dynamic between Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning is wonderful. They each do a great job building their characters and relationship together. The film itself depends on the strength and believability of Creasy and Pita's bond. The audience needs to feel for Pita, and in conjunction, feel the pain Creasy experiences when he loses the one person he really loves. We understand the drive behind Creasy's every move.<br/><br/>Another element that works in favor of this film is its visual style. It follows suit with some of Tony Scott's other films, but is used very well in Man on Fire. The cinematography, film development methods, and editing scream at you throughout the film. It creates a chaotic feeling matching Creasy's emotions. The film also expands and compresses time in appropriate places. For example, the kidnapping scene is edited to be much longer than the event itself. Life happens in real time, but an individual's perception of an experience is very different from what actually happens. In this sense, the way these sequences are cut together work better than cutting ""in real time."" The nature of this film is often bloody and violent, but it equally exposes the power of love and friendship. This balance is the film's greatest accomplishment. It creates a powerful, emotional journey that moves me every time I see the film."

The mom (Lisa) shows just how dangerous a mom can be when you mess with a child.

"noam-reisner","9","1","2","21 February 2006"," A revenge tragedy for modern time - breathtaking
","Wow! Wow, wow, wow, WOW! When a good director, honing his skills in a particular genre over many years, suddenly brings it all together in one film the result is almost always breathtaking. Tony Scott's ""Man on Fire"" is such a film and is guaranteed to stand out as Scott's ultimate masterpiece for many years to come. ""True Romance"", Scott's super cool breakthrough crime thriller which used a typically brilliant screenplay by Tarantino was fun, funny and dripping with coolness, but ""Man of Fire"" shows that Scott can do heavy drama as well as cool, slick action. Denzel Washington digs deep in this film to some of his darkest demons and pulls out a performance that is inspirational in its complexity and depth. The key to the film's success is in the relationship between Denzel's character, a washed up black-ops mercenary now working as a bodyguard, and his ward, the wonderfully mature yet very vulnerable Dakota Fanning. Once you believe the relationship between the two characters and the degree to which the young girl helps the old bodyguard to find new meaning in his life, the rest of the tragic film just falls into place, and boy, do you believe it! The first half of the film is one of the best character development sequences I have ever seen on screen - perfectly written and inspirationally acted. Scott uses his trademark style to bring the two characters together while continually suggesting in the background the menacing danger of Mexico City's crime-ridden streets and the inevitable tragic turn of events looming over the characters' blossoming friendship. A classic revenge tragedy, ""Man on Fire"" is not easy to watch. The second half of the film, to some no doubt gratuitously violent and at times even self-indulgently so, only works because of the first half of the film and because your sense of sympathy for Denzel's tortured vigilante is overwhelming. If the ancient definition of tragedy is that it raises in the viewer emotions of pity and fear then ""Man on Fire"" is Scott's hardboiled answer to Shakespeare's Hamlet. I doubt Scott will ever repeat this level of intensity, where his trademark erratic visual style is for once justified and where all the elements come together to deliver what is to my mind the most powerful cinematic experience of the last year, if not of the last decade."
"Alex-372","7","1","2","15 February 2006"," The Revenge Of Creasy Bear
","What to say. This is a revenge flick that pretty much touches all bases. Traumatized and alcoholic special forces type Creasy gets a job through an old war buddy, babysitting little Dakota Fanning.<br/><br/>Which is all cute enough, until she gets kidnapped violently, and Creasy is almost killed, but not before taking out four of the assailants. (Just a quip, but why isn't he wearing an armored vest?) Taking only a few days to recover from one shot in the arm and one shot to the torso, Creasy goes out to exact his own brand of vengeance.<br/><br/>So far, so good.<br/><br/>The problem comes when Denzel as an action hero does not seem to enjoy the usual perks that go with the role. One, why does he never get the girl (and no, I'm not suggesting any steamy love scenes between Denzel and Dakota - just any girl, really)? Two, why does he die in his own movie? There was no point to it. Bruce Willis gets to walk away at the end of all the Die Hard episodes - why not Denzel? There was no point to the exchange at the end of the movie. Sanchez just wanted his family back, he had the little girl, so swap them for each other. Why swap the little girl for Sanchez' family and Creasy as well?"
"jax713","4","1","2","4 February 2006"," Hot turns to cold
","I can't imagine what director Tony Scott was thinking when he shot this film. He took a wonderful cast and put them on the ""crush"" setting of a blender and came up with a concoction of so many flavors, you don't know what it is. Man on Fire went down in flames for me. First of all, is Mexico City the completely lawless, politically corrupt city it is portrayed as in this story? My goodness, remind me never to go there. Then there is the revenge-religion-redemption-martyr plot which ricochets around the viewer's head ad nauseum so that you don't know what to think or feel from one scene to another. Add to this other plot lines of a Mexican mob that kidnaps children for money, rampant greed, and parental dysfunction. Then top it all off with gyrating camera-work, sporadic & strange subtitles, plot holes, and supporting characters who seem not really part of the story but exist only to accomplish certain tasks needed by the main character.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, but I think Denzel's character was supposed to be a really bad guy whom I shouldn't have liked, or at least been wary of. Well, I did like him which turned everything that happened inside-out and it made the ending illogical and sad. Are you supposed to feel sad at the end of a so-called ""action"" movie? Are you supposed to feel glad or puzzled by a suicide? Are you supposed to feel a grinding in your ears when a movie shifts gears? When a movie devolves from engaging to annoying to consternation to distaste, it's just not working.<br/><br/>Denzel is in usual excellent form as is the rest of the cast all the way down to the most minor roles. But the direction, the musical score, and the overall tonality of the movie is a mess. It's a good example of how actors sign on for what appears to be a quality project and then are completely at the mercy of a director who is having a profound creative breakdown. Four stars for the incredible cast and a great beginning of a story that takes too long to ultimately grow cold."

"tstostad","8","1","2","13 January 2006"," An action film for people who don't like action films...
","Every now and then something comes along that transcends its genre. This is such a film. The plot summary reads like every ridiculous Charles Bronson vigilante revenge flick you hated in the 1980's, or like half a dozen over-hyped efforts by Mel Gibson for that matter. And in most respects this film does not strive for much more: don't look to it for ""deeper significance."" Do look to it for a shining example of what the genre could be, in the hands of a serious director. The slightly edgy, stylized editing (rapid scene changes, copious cuts, black-and-white flashback stills, and even occasional subtitling in varying fonts and sizes) seems informed by a music video sensibility,but is effective and not at all annoying. Washington's performance is pitch perfect; he is entirely believable as a haunted soul slowly healed by the innocence of his charming child client. And the young Flanning is affecting in a way few child stars have ever been. In short, this film steers a wide berth around the action genre's most common pratfall: unlike 99% of action movies, we actually care about the characters in this film, and while they are in jeopardy--basically the whole film--we cannot peel our eyes from the screen. If you are like me, in that you cannot recall enjoying an action film since Luc Besson's ""Leon,"" then ""Man on Fire"" is definitely the film for you."
"esteban1747","6","1","2","29 November 2005"," Good but excessive violence
","The plot is relevant nowadays when gangs are operating freely in several Latin American countries, but the film contains too much violence and scenes of torture. Denzel Washington appears here as a hard man, ex- CIA agent, who knows how to kill and to get the right answers using any abusive method. Everything goes around that explosive area of Juarez-El Paso, where certainly violence occurs very often and kidnapping is a job. The film shows well how corrupted is the police, something that seems to be common in that site. At the end police, lawyers, and even the father of the little girl were all involved in kidnapping an innocent for getting a heavy ransom. The director Tony Scott, in addition to the excess of violence, used some camera movements very unpleasant to my eyes. Those persons beside me also criticized this ""innovation"". The film is worth to be seen, but it has these deficiencies."

","Went into this movie not knowing what to expect. By the end of the movie, ""Man On Fire"" had entered my top 10 movies of all-time.<br/><br/>The movie has lots going for it. A great cast, a great story and great directing. At face value this movie is about an angry man trying to exact revenge. It's about so much more though- love, redemption, sacrifice...and more. There's some violence, sure, but I think this is one of those movies where it's required to truly reflect emotion. Definitely worth catching on DVD, which features an alternate ending (although it wasn't what i expected, still good). Definitely some of Denzel's finest work, up there with ""The Bone Collector"" and ""Hurricane"". Good jobs also by Dakota Fanning, Marc Anthony and Rahda Mitchell."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","2","7 October 2005"," Creasy Bear (spoilers)
","I'm not quite sure what went right with Man on Fire. I mean, really, it should be a terrible film. Just take the excess of style (hand-cranked shots, flying subtitles and schizophrenic editing) and the sickeningly cute child. Nine out of ten children in films make me wish that greedy Mexicans would kidnap them  take them away and get them out of my sight. Plus there's a potential for something queasy and unwholesome in the relationship between man and child  I don't really want to watch the Gary Glitter story. But somehow some way the film overcomes all these obstacles and produces something remarkably effective.<br/><br/>I guess the main reason the film works is because the relationship between Creasy and Pita works. Like I said before, in the wrong hands it could come across as something unhealthy. Instead it's rather, well, sweet. And a lot of the credit for this has to go to Denzel Washington. He plays everything quite deadpan and his reactions are understated so you never feel that he's a Jesus Quintana type of character. And although some of the scenes are amusingly trite (""Creasy, you're smiling"") they work because Washington underplays them. He gives a rather hackneyed script a hell of a lot of class.<br/><br/>Credit also has to go to Dakota Fanning. Yeah she's predictably precocious but she's not overbearingly cute and she can hold her own in a scene with the likes of Washington. Plus, rather strangely for a child actor, she's quite endearing. Therefore, for once, you can understand the killing rampage that ensues.<br/><br/>And the killing rampage itself is magnificent. Although I'm undecided as to what I like more: the fingers being cut off or the bomb up the bum. I mean, the bomb up the bum has a bomb up the bum, but I like how sadistic the finger torture is (the whole film makes me want to hug my inner-fascist). That being said, though, I do love Washington's performance in the bomb scene (""I wish you had more time""). And the moment with Denzel walking in slow motion with the bomb exploding behind him is the best shot in the film  it's the, er, 'badass' shot.<br/><br/>But the rocket launcher/motorcade scene also deserves respect. In fact, after Death Wish 3 and now Man on Fire I've come to the conclusion that you just can't go wrong with rocket launcher violence (especially when it takes place in an elderly couple's house). And the casual Terminator-like shootings that follow after the explosion are great. Rocket launcher + casual shootings = success.<br/><br/>Another thing that I get a kick out of in Man on Fire is the religious slant (Creasy reads the Bible). This obviously isn't just any normal act of vengeance; this is a righteous act of retribution; Creasy is an avenging angel (he doesn't even care that he's killing himself). Just take one of the best quotes in the film: ""Forgiveness is between them and god. It's up to me to arrange the meeting."" Very Biblical. Then there's the bullet that doesn't go off when he tries to commit suicide. The film might as well just come out and say it: god saved him. But making it even funnier is the way that he later gives the same bullet to Pita's father. He practically forces the bloke to try and kill himself and then says, ""I'll pray for you."" Of course this time the bullet goes off. I guess it must have been god's will.<br/><br/>And also helping with the whole quasi-religious subtext is the fact that the film is played like an opera  you've got Pavarotti playing when he kills the cop and when he pushes the car off the cliff. Everything in the film is heightened, everything button and dial is switched up to maximum. There's no room for subtlety here.<br/><br/>But the fact that the film isn't subtle doesn't matter one bit. In fact, if anything, it makes it more enjoyable. I mean, sure, the fractured editing is a little wearing and the visual pyrotechnics bludgeon you somewhat, but I love all the clichés in the film. My favourite is the drink problem. There's nothing quite as much fun as a down and out, lonely man who loves the sauce  and although I perhaps didn't appreciate them in the way they were intended, I loved all the moody shots of Creasy drinking; you just know that only a vengeful killing rampage can get him on the wagon. And I also like the way that a beard (well, and an affinity for booze) is the only thing you need to show that Creasy (at the beginning) is troubled. In the movies a scruffy man equals a tortured man.<br/><br/>And do I need to point out the genius of this line: ""Creasy's art is death. He's about to paint his masterpiece."" Just brilliant. And the fact that the delivery is completely serious cracks me up even more. (The whole film is ludicrous but for some reason I'm with it all the way.)<br/><br/>I also like all the ""Creasy bear"" stuff. One I find it funny and two I actually find it weirdly touching: how could you not be inspired to kill lots of people after reading ""I love you Creasy Bear"" over and over again? Hell, I hate children, but reading that would even make me bloodthirsty.<br/><br/>And yet another thing I like about the film is the unashamedly emotional ending. It's a right wing, fascist, Biblical, action weepy. It's perfect for people who like to see lots gratuitous violence but who are sentimental saps too. In other words, people like me. I love you too, Creasy Bear. Er, I mean, yeah, good work Denzel."

","""Man on Fire."" I have to admit, after reading the previews and hearing the title, the only reason I chose to watch Tony Scott's latest film was an uncharacteristic craving for some brainless, gun-heavy, Dolph Lungren-style action. And I have to say, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>But in a good way. Anyone watching this film for the first time will not be expecting much in the storyline or character-building department, yet Man on Fire is one of the best films for doing this that I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>The movie boasts former two-time Oscar nominee and one-time Academy Award winner Denzel Washington in one of his best performances in the lead role of John Creasy, an ex-CIA operative who's hired to protect the daughter of a wealthy Mexican businessman. Creasy is on a path of self-destruction before his ex-colleague Ray, played reasonably well by Christopher Walken, lands him the job. Presumably meeting Ray's hopeful expectations, the bodyguard work gives Creasy a new purpose, effectively keeping his 9MM at a safe distance from his skull.<br/><br/>Washington paints Creasy as a man who is as washed up as one can get: regretting the past and giving up on any hope of redemption. He's a man who has incessantly drunk himself away from his physical peak, finding little solace in The Bible and looking vainly for a place to end his life. Pita, his charge, immediately makes an unlikely connection with Creasy and, in the words of Ray, ""showed him that it's okay to live again."" Dakota Fanning is perhaps the best child actor working. Pita is made likable, intelligent and funny by Fanning, who brings out another dimension in her 9-year-old character by being able to brilliantly portray an emotion before swiftly moving onto another one. Whether purposeful or not, her voice has both the essence of a child's innocence and an adult's thought, making Pita's kidnapping all the more heart-wrenching.<br/><br/>The physical contrast between Washington and Fanning coupled with their poles-apart acting styles makes for some amazing chemistry. Though her early attempts at connecting with Creasy are somewhat akin to trying to draw blood from a stone Pita eventually succeeds, and although first reluctant to communicate with Pita, Creasy eventually becomes a mentor, almost a father, to her. So much so that when Creasy, after being hospitalised by the kidnappers, swears to wreak bloody vengeance on the organised faction behind her capture, we wonder exactly how this is going to come about.<br/><br/>That's where the real character building of Creasy begins. From his statement ""I'm gonna kill 'em. Anyone that was involved. Anybody who profited from it. Anybody who opens their eyes at me,"" to the end scene, we see that Creasy is in fact a highly trained unstoppable killing machine incapable of remorse for his enemies. The detached and almost polite way in which he horrifically interrogates the kidnappers en route to their master puts Jack Bauer's ""Tell me where the bomb is!"" to shame.<br/><br/>This is perhaps the film's greatest strength: it is not a preachy revenge flick. Creasy does not learn that killing is wrong, a la Collateral Damage, and does not find the value of human life. He kills and kills and kills and kills until his job is done and revenge is served, but we still cheer him on because we too feel anger towards these so called ""professionals"" who ripped Pita's childhood away from her. In turn, that's exactly how Creasy dispatches them: professionally, be it by calmly cutting the fingers from a corrupt Mexican policeman's hand or casually informing another of the C4 lodged in his anus.<br/><br/>Artistically, this film is something of a masterpiece. Director Tony Scott has (perhaps over-)used montage editing to its full effect here, shooting one sepia-soaked scene over another and putting a gritty texture into the film's presentation that matches its story. Working in tandem with Harry Gregson-Williams' spicy score, Scott has created something that is as enjoyable to look at and listen to as it is to follow. A special mention must go to the revolutionary use of subtitles.<br/><br/>A stunning piece of cinema, then, that has been let down by a lack of hype and bland storyline synopses. Man on Fire is a rarity: an undervalued remake that infinitely outclasses its own subject material. Enough to set the audience alight."

","Man on Fire (2004) is a action thriller that gets your adrenaline going from the the beginning to the end. Denzel Washington plays John Creasy, a burned out CIA agent who is sent to Mexico City by his friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken) to protect Lupita ""Pita"" Ramos (Dakota Fanning), the daughter of an industrialist (Marc Anthony)and his wife (Radha Mitchell). Creasy and Pita suddenly become bonded to one another. When Pita is kidnapped; Creasy, seriously wounded, vows revenge against those who were involved with the kidnapping. With the help of a newspaper journalist (Rachel Ticotin), Creasy discovers that the crime was committed by a organization of corrupt Mexico City Judicial Police officers and her father as a way to get his company out of debt. Determined to get Pita back, Creasy must risk his own life to get the bad guys off of the streets and get the girl that he was meant to protect back to her family. Man on Fire is a true action movie that is worth a perfect 10!!!!"

","Man on Fire is a heartfelt drama/action that is about a bodyguard named Creasy(Denzel Washington) who spirit is rekindled by a little girl named Pita(Dakota Fanning)but when she is kidnapped he unleashes a one man war on all her kidnappers. I never really looked at Tony Scott's work prior to this but he did an amazing job in this film, every angle captures the setting beautifully and the action scenes are well choreographed. The acting is great, Denzel makes the movie hitting every emotion that is needed to drive the scene, Dakota hit the spot as Pita being bright,graceful and intelligent and Christopher Walken is as good as ever as Creasy's partner. On the flip side this movie ending is questionable(I won't ruin it but I felt it could have been done better)but it doesn't ruin the movie and is a decent ending. 8.5/10"

He puts in a searing performance as Creasey, an assassin turned Body-Guard who's emotionally and psychologically damaged and who finds redemption in an eight-year old girl, portrayed by the brilliant Dakota Fanning who is the most talented actress of her generation. Her character Pita is the human heart of the film and one is left genuinely shocked when you think her character is killed off.<br/><br/>Radha Mitchell and Marc Anthony portray parents caught in a terrifying situation and until the denouement one is filled with pity for them. Radha Mitchell, easily recognisable from ""Pitch Black"", puts in a good performance as a grieving mother and Marc Antony is surprisingly good in his role. The supporting cast is filled out by Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke, and in this case one is left guessing as to who the villain will turn out to be. (Surprise!) The film is extremely violent and is filled with disturbing images not suited to sensitive viewers or kids. Tony Scott's direction is tight and the use of sub-titles is highly effective. The cinematography is excellent, employing the same grainy look used to great effect in ""Traffic""."

This movie is unrelenting and holds no punches, a breath of fresh air.....don't let it pass you by.

","This is one of those movies with an emotional storyline that is almost a lock to draw you in. Jaded former CIA guy is coasting through the last days of his life, trying to gain forgiveness or understanding from God for the things he has done. Takes job protecting a little girl in one of the most crime-infested and corrupt cities in the world. A bond between the two is quickly formed. Bad guys steal here away, somebody has to pay and in as barbaric of way as possible. Yep, the revenge angle is strong. The little girl was very cute, and a good person (Dakota Fanning really is quite good here). We really want to see the people that took her and are believed to have killed her, pay for what they have done. And they do. Sadly, it takes a former assassin from the US with terminal wounds to dole out any kind of justice in Mexico. I guess we feel good when we see those responsible die one by one. The only problem is that we are forced to see so many trademark Tony Scott (he really is a hack) MTV moments. The ridiculous settings, the endless slow-motion shots,the excessive close-ups of guns and bullets, etc.. Moreover, the plot-line is given away very early. Gee, Mickey Rourke seems to be too big of name to have no real purpose here (or does he?). The reality is that most people will figure out quite early who is really behind the events and you would have to be a total moron to not know that someone who is supposed to be dead, is not really dead.

","I must admit before i watched this movie i was sceptical of how it was going to be. Thankfully it was pretty good, mainly down to denzel's acting abilities to really reel you in. The directing was o.k, i personally prefer Ridley's movies, but Tony is pretty good. Apart from the camera effects which were used too much in the film and sometimes start to grind your eyes a bit, most of the film is very good. I was also pleased to see Chris walken back on top form, Tony scott brought out his finest performance in True romance, and brings out another one in this movie. This is a true revenge movie, and has violence in abundance. Denzel is cool, calm and collected as Creasy the assassin/bodyguard. And the ways he disposes of the bad guys is pretty damn cool. This reminds me a little bit of Leon, with the fact that Crease learns how to smile and be happy again with the help from a little girl,(not in a sick way) and when that is taken away from him......people pay. This film isn't perfect due to the direction, but it is truly entertaining, and one of the best action flicks from 04. 4/5"
"ebert_jr","Null","1","2","1 January 2005"," Intense!
","Violence that might seem exploitive in other films just seemed so right in this picture. And, there's just so much to like about 'Man on Fire', that I think its weaknesses are easily forgotten. It's strengths, like the acting by Washington and Dakota, are superb. For a young child, Dakota comes across with an amazingly mature and intelligent screen presence well beyond her years. Even her voice seems to belong to a older actress. It's actually a bit bizarre on second thought. Denzel is just great in this. He doesn't have a lot of lines it seems but does connect the story with the viewer in almost every scene, often with just his expression.<br/><br/>At first, I wasn't sure I liked the directive style by Scott, which in parts reminded me of the way music videos are shot. But the film grew on me until I actually started making mental notes about certain scenes and some nice artistic touches. Some scenes give certain sequences a sort of hazy air about them, where time passes quickly (even for movie time) resulting in an overlapping of sequences where one seems to fade out while the next comes into view, hanging around longer. This interesting technique just underscores the internal struggle Denzel's character goes through. He is the textbook textbook antihero I think, he drinks, he coldly murders ""the bad guys"" (and there are plenty of them in Mexico it would seem) after wringing information out of them. There is rarely mercy shown, and his acts would make Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry blush. There were moments when I felt Washington just seemed too nice and looked to handsome for any of this to be believable, not even a scowl on his face as he pulls triggers left and right. In the end, what he brings to the picture is allowing the audience to get inside his character's head to make a connection or bond. Understanding what he's trying to accomplish is easy, together these helps propel viewers through the violence, and we relish, maybe squint, but believe it deserved. The ending was a bit Hollywood, but who cares, he's a 'man on fire'."

Hey movie makers, a little goes a long way! I was impressed with the photography for a while. Then it started to wear me down and I missed stuff.<br/><br/>This stark limited chromatism really makes a movie quite unenjoyable like Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"".

"mostlygreek","10","1","2","5 November 2004"," is it better to burn out than fade away?
","Denzel washington gives an great performance as creasy, an alcoholic with a military background who is hired to protect a young girl(played by dakota fanning). The story is set in Mexico city where kidnappers target wealthy families to make huge amounts of money from their ransom.<br/><br/>Tony scott directs a fine cast that includes christopher walken and mickey rourke. The whole film is a blur of various shooting techniques and a vivid soundtrack that suits the mood of a very threatening and alien Mexico city backdrop. <br/><br/>Dakota fanning is excellent as the young girl who creasy must protect, and washington himself is quietly convincing as a man with a past he isn't proud of and a future he knows is empty. But its his friendship with the girl that becomes the heart of the movie. As they bond after an uneasy start, we can see just where tony scott is taking us..so when things do take a turn for the worst, we are fully prepared for it. In fact, we are just waiting for for it to happen. And thats when the pace of the film begins to pick up. Scotts direction revels in showing us the mindset of each character, and soon the plot becomes a by the numbers trail of revenge and information gathering.<br/><br/>However, man on fires strength is the emotional weight that these scenes carry. Scotts investment in his character's relationships almost justifies the violence. And as an audience we are made to feel that creasy's dark side is completely reasonable, no matter how grisly his actions. That might disturb some audiences, but in todays society, it seems that an eye for an eye attitude is not so terrible an idea- at least in scotts vision of society.<br/><br/>If this film has a fault, it isn't the plot, the script or its execution. Its the wealth of good actors that are neither used or developed nearly as much as they could have been. But as in scotts earlier movies (true romance being a prime example), the cast,even if under-used, add a rich quality to the proceedings and audiences will feel in good hands throughout.<br/><br/>Strong story, strong cast, and confident direction make this one of the most interesting releases this year. And if you don't mind your action with a spoonful of sentimentality then you'll enjoy the fact that this film chooses to fade away instead of burning out at the end."

Tony Scott still has not made a classic film to date. WHY was this film made? I could not give you a truly honest answer, except to entertain the audience mindlessly with brutality. Recommended tag-line, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back meets The Passion of The Christ meets Ransom meets Heat meets Hannibal meets CandyMan meets Leon meets Seven- rather pointlessly- like turning up to a professional football match featuring no strikers, no goalkeepers, no referee, no linesmen and no pitch."
"rosscinema","6","1","2","24 October 2004"," Over the top but effective revenge flick
","There are so many reasons to dismiss this overwrought action film but in the end I had to be honest with myself and admit I enjoyed most of the chaos that ensues in this. Call me human! Story is about an ex-military officer with a long resume in anti-terrorism and weapons but his past is haunting him and he's become an alcoholic. Denzel Washington is Creasy and while in Mexico City visiting his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken) he is referred for a job as a bodyguard for a young and wealthy family. Creasy works for Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) and his American wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell) and most of his job consists of watching their daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) whom he slowly begins a friendly relationship with.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>One day Pita is kidnapped and Creasy shot and wounded in the process and as he lies in the hospital he learns that she has been killed when the drop-off for the ransom went badly. Creasy eventually gets well enough to promise Pita's family that he will track everyone down that's involved and kill them and he does this with the help of a reporter named Mariana (Rachel Ticotin) and an Interpol expert named Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) and he soon finds out that there are many people involved in the recent kidnappings in the city. One by one he finds people that are connected and he gets enough information from each of them before he kills them and all this leads to a mysterious man known only as ""The Voice"".<br/><br/>This film is directed by none other than Tony Scott who specializes in these action films and he usually does them with a visual flair that's evident here. But even with the visual style this film can't hide the many things that could have (Should have?) ruined this and the first thing I asked myself was how can a 6'1"" black American roam about Mexico City without being noticed especially in those rat infested barrios? Washington's character seems to have an unlimited access to any weapon he wants not including the money he's shelling out. One other observance is the extremely loose fitting suits that he wears during the film. Couldn't someone point him to a tailor? But while I point out these flaws I'm the first to admit that Washington is very good in this film and delivers a first rate performance despite the silly material. Fanning bats her eyes and gives one of her patented cutesy roles that screams ""AAWWWWWWW""! The film is just way to long at almost two and a half hours(!) and it resorts to some incredibly violent scenarios but I still recommend it because as a ""Man determined to get revenge"" genre film and the strong performance by Washington it's a film that does hold up enough to entertain most viewers."

","Some other comments indicate that the first 50 minutes (which shows how Creasy and Pita formed a close bond) was boring. I have to disagree. That was the best part of the film for me. It was refreshing to see a 10 year old with such compassion and insight, especially since so many children in films these days are portrayed as overly cute and precocious, with no substance or empathy. I had never seen Dakota's acting before but now I understand why she is so admired. The 2nd half of the movie did make me squirm a little, it was rather hard to watch and a little unbelievable a times. Also, the visual effects throughout the entire movie were annoying at times. But all in all, I would recommend this movie and give it an 8 out of 10. Denzel's acting was great as usual, I've loved every movie I've ever seen him in.

Fifty minutes to set up the relationship between Denzel and the kid? Come on. I understand wanting to provide a little extra time to show how and why they care about each other, but it is just too much. Move it along.<br/><br/>Also, the ending is just bad. I'm not going to put in a spoiler. I'll just say that the ending goes against the premise of the entire two and a half hours that came before it. It's just not good.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the revenge stuff in the second half of the film is excellent, minus the crazy editing. I was even willing to set aside the fact that I had to wade through 50+ minutes to get to it.<br/><br/>I wanted to see this in the theater and everyone I know who saw it really enjoyed it.

Washington's performance was, as always, excellent. Dakota Fanning was superb. Micky Rourke was lacking. But even the best performances can not shine through poor direction and production. The photography during the action scenes was poor at best. The use of profanity by Radha Mitchell was unrealistic. The painted backdrops were much, much too obvious. The closeups were far too reminiscent of the old Spaghetti Westerns. The constant switching of languages, especially between the same people in the same conversation, and subtitles jumping all over the screen were extremely distracting. And I really don't believe, even in Mexico, dancers at a rave would continue dancing and cheering while someone fired a sawed off shotgun several times in their midst. But worst of all were the extremely bad visual effects. The story line, although old and tired, was somewhat revived by good acting and an unusual locale.

I never saw many ads for this movie and only wanted to see it because I think Denzel Washington is one of the best actors in America today. I have always been disappointed that he had to win his Academy Award in Training Day. This movie makes up for it, and I think it redeems him as a good actor. (I think everyone will agree that Training Day was not his best effort as an actor.) This movie appears to be filmed entirely on location in Mexico City. Many views of the city are presented. You see the very affluent neighborhoods and the very poor neighborhoods. In Mexico, you are either in poverty or rich. There are very few in between, which is why so many make the trip across the border in hopes of a better life not just for themselves, but for their entire family. I think the characterizations were fabulous. I felt real empathy for the characters. The script was fantastic. A bit predictable. But, for me, there is no ""unpredictable"". Tony Scott directed the film. I think he did a great job getting great performances from the actors. Dakota Fanning was made for the role of the kidnapped girl. She presents herself as very intelligent and yet vulnerable. I think -- if she can keep herself from being exploited by her parents and from falling for the falsity of Hollywood like most child actors -- that she has a career ahead of her that is worth following. The action in the film was great. Who doesn't enjoy seeing vigilante justice? This is a ""what comes around goes around"" film. If you like crime drama, action, good scripts and story lines, you should enjoy this flick. Keep the Kleenex handy if you are sentimental.

Every time I watch this movie I am reminded of the humanity only children can bring back to a soldier's tired and often psychologically burdened existence."

","Excellent Cinematography, as in it is both beautifully shot and edited. I love the creative use of subtitles (CG). It is a very intense movie that will keep you captivated. For an Action/ Mystery/ Thriller type it goes much deeper than the ordinary Hollywood Claptrap, which definitely appeals to egghead types like me. This movie is definitely an at least once see movie. The trailers for this movie did not do it justice in the least. It looked pretty trite from the ads, which disappointed me since I am a big Denzel Washington fan. But, oh, did he ever give a great performance. Add to that great performances by the entire cast and you have a great movie"

","John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is a drunk and an expert at dark ops. An old friend Paul Rayburn (Christopher Walken) brings him to Mexico City where there's a wave of kidnappings. He's hired by the Ramos family (Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Dakota Fanning) as their driver and security. When the girl is kidnapped and the ransom is botched, he becomes a man on fire.<br/><br/>Tony Scott has all the skills of a great action director. He wants to built up Creasy's relationship with LuPita so that it becomes reasonable for him to react that way. He wants Creasy to love LuPita. I'm not opposed but it takes too long. There's got to be a better shorthand or there has to be more interesting insights. At almost 2 and a half hours, it could easily lose 30 minutes. Scott has thrown every camera tricks into the action in the 2nd half. It becomes quite mind numbing. This too could stand to be trimmed. All of it is too long for a fairly simple vengeance movie. It's really an hour and a half movie stretched out for an unnecessary extra hour."
"chaos-rampant","Null","1","3","9 August 2012"," The bullet lies
","The first half of this is much better than the second. That is because it is rooted in relationships between people that you can abstract from. You have a scarred man entering a household and upsetting balances, though he will not touch anything. You have a bright young kid eager for discovery and reaching out to people. The two of them together, in the same car, are a bit of a movie contrivance, but nonetheless manage to hit it off running and do well. I want to quote another reviewer here, who described Dakota Fanning as a girl with 'an old soul' and that is apt. She has a way of projecting emotional wisdom well past her years. Denzel Washington is outmatched.<br/><br/>Chekhov's rule was that once a gun is featured in a story, it has to be fired. The rule is about narrative economy. Nothing should be a spare part. <br/><br/>We have a gun here that does not fire (the suicide attempt), and that is transformed in the pool to a gun that inspires and sets you free. This is a clever twist that sublimates expected violence into something quite different, a more liquid , elemental exchange between souls. Water seem to be inherently cinematic, but few directors dare cut into it. Tony Scott does, and everything to do with waters is worth seeing.<br/><br/>But, the reason this was made at all is so that gun can be fired and kill people. We want to see things blow up - this is expertly rendered in the rave party scene as people cheering a giant fireball, an ingenious bit of referencing adrenaline junkies that we are.<br/><br/>So the second half is the typical revenge flick where the angel of death runs around righting wrong. It doesn't much matter that it's unbelievable in the extreme, you sort of expect that. Scott's convulsing camera fits both the man and a convulsing world of crime and poverty, so it's not that either. It usually seems like affectation because we associate the grungy look with MTV, but Scott's hands are good and cinematic.<br/><br/>It's that the girl has been removed from the picture, and with her any trace of intuition except what Creasy has preserved of her memory. And both Washington and the character he plays have the same limitations: they can emote and convey within a very small range. So that memory is preserved with a lot of seething anger, and gunplay, and Washington offing scum.<br/><br/>Bleh. The gun not firing was truth after all, truer to life."

","From director Tony Scott (Top Gun, Crimson Tide, Enemy of the State), I was hoping this action thriller film would be more enjoyable. Basically a wave of kidnappings have swept in Mexico City, and Rayburn (Christopher Walken) has brought ex-CIA operative/assassin John Creasy (Denzel Washington) to be the bodyguard of nine year old Lupita' Pita' Martin (War of the World's Dakota Fanning), daughter of industrialist Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) and wife Lisa Martin (Silent Hill's Radha Mitchell). Creasy is against it at first, and when he does accept with nothing better to do, he is at first in no mood to socialise with Pita, but she does slowly get him to open up to her. But Creasy's new found purpose is taken away when Pita is kidnapped, and he is now out to kill anyone involved with or profiting from the kidnapping. Also starring Giancarlo Giannini as Manzano, Total Recall's Rachel Ticotin as Mariana, Jesús Ochoa as Fuentes, Mickey Rourke as Jordan Kalfus and Angelina Peláez as Sister Anna. The friendship between the ex-assassin and the little girl hits the right notes, but I agree with the critics that the film slips into absurdity Washington is out for revenge, and only a few explosions and some violence keep you hooked. Worth watching, at least once!"
"zardoz-13","7","1","3","22 June 2007"," ""Man On Fire"" simmers but rarely blazes . . .
","The Denzel Washington movie ""Man On Fire"" (**1/2 out of ****) suffers from poor plotting and a bad ending. Hopelessly downbeat and riddled with clichés galore, this predictable but atmospheric abduction mystery thriller focuses largely on its charismatic star. However, alcoholic bodyguard John Creasy generates little of the charisma that most Denzel Washington heroes beam with blinding wattage. British director Tony Scott has cast his winsome Oscar-winning star against type as a depressed, low-key, guilt-stricken individual with few reasons to live. Although this self-pitying protagonist serves to stretch Denzel's acting range, very little about John Creasy as a character appears remotely appealing. By the way, a bodyguard who shuns body armor is asking a little too much in a shoot'em up saga. Bulletproof vests make or break this kind of crime genre picture. Furthermore, Scott and scenarist Brian Helgeland keep us at arm's length from Denzel's unglamorous character to make him look more credible. Incredibly, for a brooding, action-oriented suspenser with an antsy documentary flavor, the best scenes in ""Man On Fire"" occur when Denzel's washed-up ex-soldier Creasy carries on conversations with a delightful Dakota Fanning as the inquisitive child he shields from the evil kidnappers in crime-ridden, corrupt Mexico City. Mind you, the shoot-outs look great, and the middle part of ""Man On Fire"" resembles vintage 1970's Charles Bronson vigilantism with its cynical disregard for life, but the movie only comes alive when Denzel and Dakota are together on screen.<br/><br/>As John Creasy, Denzel delivers a thoroughly convincing performance as a former U.S. Special Forces anti-terrorist expert who has hit rock bottom and desperately needs a job. Creasy looks up an old buddy, Rayburn (Christopher Walken of ""The King of New York""), in Mexico, and Rayburn lands him a job as a bodyguard for a wealthy Mexico City businessman whose young daughter, Pita (Dakota Fanning of ""The Cat In The Hat""), makes a prime target for kidnappers. Early on, we're told kidnapping is rampant in Mexico City, and Samuel (Marc Anthony of ""Hackers"") hires Creasy, even though he knows Creasy drinks. Predictably, during the first half of ""Man On Fire,"" Pita draws Creasy out of his self-destructive shell. She even names her pet bear after him. Before long Creasy gives up trying not to be Pita's friend and becomes her surrogate father. The scenes where Creasy trains Pita for a swimming match represent the high point of this uneven but entertaining opus. Predictably, kidnappers grab Pita and blow Creasy full of holes, not enough to kill him, but enough to slow down the movie. Again, where is the ubiquitous bulletproof vest? Half the action epics made these days stage the dramatic near-death scene where the resilient hero takes ten shots in the chest then sheds his shirt to reveal his slug encrusted body armor. Not Creasy. He doesn't wear armor, so we have to wait for him to recover from his wounds.<br/><br/>About two-and-a-half hours in length, ""Man On Fire"" lurches along under Tony Scott's self-consciously artsy, pseudo documentary style. After a while, the jiggling camera technique that gives the film its newsreel quality will get on your nerves. When the kidnappers are gunned down trying to retrieve the ransom, everything goes haywire. Not surprisingly, the thugs holding Pita say they have killed her. The rest of the movie follows Creasy as he hunts down anybody who had anything to do with the abduction. ""Man On Fire"" ranks Denzel's most savage film. In some ways, it resembles the Luc Besson man/girl thriller ""The Professional"" where a pre-teenage girl taught an adult male how to appreciate life. Refreshingly, neither Scott nor scenarist Brian Helgeland of ""Payback"" fame make up any excuses for their hero's murderous rampage. Creasy kills each of the kidnappers without remorse. Along the way, Creasy uncovers a ring of corruption in the Mexico City police that defies imagination. Nearly every cop is on the take and they live in terror of assassination.<br/><br/>When Tony Scott makes good movies, he helms memorable classics like ""Top Gun,"" ""Beverly Hills Cop 2,"" ""The Last Boy Scout, """"True Romance,"" and ""Spy Games."" When he makes bad movies, he cranks out crap like ""The Fan,"" ""Revenge,"" ""Days of Thunder,"" and ""Crimson Tide."" Sadly, ""Man On Fire"" belongs to the latter category. If ""Man On Fire"" weren't bad enough for Helgeland's half-baked script, it turns out this movie is a remake of an abysmal Scott Glenn movie from 1987 called ""Man On Fire!"" Aside from Denzel's superb performance, ""Man On Fire"" simmers but rarely blazes."

","the revenge thing is nice here, the stirrings of parental love, Denzel is just fine, the setting is interesting, but the story is simply cracked, the problem is that too much is going on in a small space, its overdetermined, but the main problem is that even though the money handover was botched, and we assume the child was killed, why didn't they try to confirm this?????? And why was the child kept alive, the ""voice"" said its business, but what business, he clearly hadn't tried to renegotiate, until it was thrown in at the end, like everything else, way bummer, but the good news is that Denzel dies, given what a slaughter machine he was, this is only responsible artistically, unlike the recently released movie Shooter, where Wahlberg lives, even though he's killed about 65 million people. Anyways, I really wanted to like this movie much better than I actually did. It was fun to see Denzel playing a conflicted, but deadly person, like Training day, which was a lot of fun."

","Tony Scott has created a dynamic masterpiece with his 2004 film Man on Fire which was released on 8th October and made $23 million dollars on its opening weekend. Starring Academy award winner Denzel Washington, who plays a burnt out ex CIA operative/assassin, but later his friend Rayburn (academy award winner) Christopher Walken brings him to Mexico City, to be a bodyguard to 9 year old Pita Ramos (Dakota Fanning) who is the daughter of an industrialist Samual Ramos and his wife Lisa. Creasy accepts the assignment as he has nothing better to do. Pita manages to make Creasy smile again as he spends more time protecting her, and manage to become close friends.<br/><br/>This all seems fine, but when Pita is kidnapped during a shoot out, although wounded, Creasy swears revenge on all those who are involved. This takes him on a rampage of destruction, this all pays of with great violence e.g. tying a guys hand to a steering wheel and cutting his fingers off one by one without regret, another example is putting a c4 bomb up a guys arse and getting to see him get blown up, its pretty terrifying, but at the same time brilliant.<br/><br/>Overall a top class piece of film, superbly acted and passionately written, this can not be mist because of the gruesome violence and electrifying story line."

","This is a good film, but flawed. I think Denzel Washington is a great actor, and there are fine supporting performances here, notably Christopher Walken in the kind of understated performance he has rarely been given a chance at in recent years. It's good too that the film allowed time to build the relationship between Washington's and Fanning's characters - usually these revenge flicks spend only a few minutes on this, here it's about one third of the movie. <br/><br/>Having said all that good stuff, it isn't an excellent film because:<br/><br/>* it is self-indulgently long <br/><br/>* the plot is formulaic and the twists rather easy to spot. <br/><br/>* There is some unconvincing mawkishness, especially around the girl's teddy bear. <br/><br/>* shots of Denzel looking moody don't really give him the depth of character that I think the director was trying to convey.

","Thats if I could describe this movie in a few words. It shows how far one man would go to avenge a little girl, that he was hired to protect as a job he didn't want to do. Creasy begins to show a loving side as he helps the girl Pita with her swimming and eventually he smiles and even laughs, as Creasy turns to be like a father to Pita. But when she gets captured, Creasy is shot multiple times and loses a little girl he was grown to love. This movie started off good, and I thought was an OK film... until Creasy just started torturing everybody he knew was involved with the kidnapping. I almost laughed when I found out she was still alive... only because I was thinking he killed all those people for no reason now. I wasn't laughing in any way to down the film just at the amazing twist toward the end. What really shocked me was how he got shot again. I knew that something was wrong. And I was shocked at the ending. This movie gave me the same feeling SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) did at the conclusion of the film. Speechless... and a interesting feeling in my stomach. Maybe because the main character died after all he did throughout the film. Certainly a great movie, and would recommend it to anyone into Action films.

","""Man on Fire"" is an original, modern tragedy of sorts, a lost man's redemption by love and sacrifice. Extremely well acted by an all-round great cast, the film features a tight story line and refreshingly terse editing. Good dialog throughout with some great lines (although it's hard to pick all of them up in one pass). The original, creative photography style is abetted by the exotic Mexican locations. Simply slam-bang action. Denzel Washington is in great form, and Christopher Walkin has a great small role. What more could one ask for? If violence puts you off, maybe there's that, but otherwise, this is just a top-notch film. Key relationship between Creasy (Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) is unique and well developed.

She almost immediately picks up that Creasy is sad or depressed, but he doesn't talk to her very much when she asks him about it. He tells pita that he is being paid to protect her, not to be her friend. Pita, however, does not give up on him. She even names her favorite teddy bear ""Creasy Bear"" because she see's Creasy as ""a big sad bear."" After some more time, the two begin to bond more than ever, as Creasy helps Pita train and become a better swimmer. She improves quite a bit, and wins her competition. As soon a she hears her name announced as the winner, Pita climbs out of the pool, and leaps into Creasy's arms. Creasy was almost as happy as Pita was.<br/><br/>After the competition, while Pita's parents are away on business, she has lunch out with Creasy and two of Creasy's friends. It was then that Pita gave Creasy a gift that she had bought with her own money- a little case shaped like a brown bear, and inside that was a necklace with a symbol of Saint Jude-Paitrant Saint of Lost Causes.<br/><br/>One day after Pita's piano lesson, a group of men try to kidnap her. Creasy tries to save her, and shoots two of the men. He ended up getting shot himself, and Pita immediately runs to his side.

The men grab Pita, toss her into their car and drive away.<br/><br/>When Creasy recovers, he stops at absolutely nothing to find and rescue Pita.

","The novel this movie is based on had a first adaptation in 1987, but I haven't' watched that film , so I cannot compare. As for this new adaptation, it is a story about kidnappings, ransoms, revenge, and corruption in the city of Mexico with Denzel Washington playing the main role: an alcoholic ex-marine disenchanted from life that ends up working as a bodyguard for a rich men's little daughter (Dakota Fanning -this kid is just one of the most impressive young actors ever-) . Putting aside the ideology of the film (pretty fascist and violent, just like ""Dirty Harry"", ""Lethal Weapon"", and stuff like that), what we have here is a rather commercial picture directed by the man who made ""classics"" such as ""Top Gun"" or ""Days Of Thunder"", nice filmed action, with bad constructed characters (what the hell is going' on with Washintong's character? Why has he ended up like that? Maybe I missed something...). As usual in this kind of artifacts the Americans are the good guys, and the mexicans-russians-whatever are pretty pretty bad guys so unscrupulous... <br/><br/>OK let's give it a 6.5/10"
"BrandtSponseller","8","1","3","18 July 2005"," Fairly intense film for the right audience, but has some structural flaws
","Do you like ""MTV-style"" editing and cinematography? If not, steer clear of Man on Fire, because visually, it's two and a half hours of non-stop ""extended techniques"".<br/><br/>The bigger question, for those of us who at least do not mind that style is whether it works for the film. It's not always clear why Man on Fire was composed in this unusual manner, but it's at least usually interesting. There are occasional elements--like the ""floating subtitles""--that seem ill advised, and there are other flaws, but during a good chunk of the latter half, Man on Fire is a solid ten. For me, the film averaged out to a low eight, or a ""B minus"".<br/><br/>Although it's just implied in the film, we can tell that Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Rayburn (Christopher Walken) have known each other for a very long time. Rayburn is living in Mexico, where Man on Fire is set. He's well off. Creasy has just arrived in Mexico, and we learn, partially through implication again, that he's been basically ""on the run"". Apparently, Creasy and Rayburn have some dirty secrets in their past, although we never learn exactly what.<br/><br/>Through his Mexican contacts, Rayburn discovers that Samuel (Marc Anthony) is looking to hire a bodyguard for his wife, Lisa (Radha Mitchell), and daughter, Pita (Dakota Fanning). Creasy ends up taking the job.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we've learned during the opening credits that per the film's world, at least, there is a kidnapping in Mexico about once every sixty minutes. When you put all of this together, it's pretty clear where Man on Fire is headed.<br/><br/>And that's one of the problems. We know that surely there's going to be at least a kidnapping attempt. Yet, director Tony Scott takes an hour just to establish his characters and set the scene. The first hour of the film tends to drag. Yes, it's nice that Scott decided to add some depth to his characters, but an hour is simply too long. There's an unofficial ""rule"" in screen writing that says you should arrive at your principle dilemma by about twenty-five minutes into the script. That's stretched out to sixty minutes here. Man on Fire is actually a remake of a 1987 film by the same name directed by Elie Chouraqui. That film was only ninety minutes. I'm not sure why Scott and scripter Brian Helgeland decided to extend the story so much (although I'd suspect that it was to try to incorporate more of the original novel by A.J. Quinnell), but it just wasn't a good idea.<br/><br/>Related to this problem, there's a ""false climax"" at around the two-hour mark that seems like a natural stopping point, but the story continues for another half-hour. This material is engaging enough, but except for the very ending, it seems like it would have been better for most of it to appear before the ""false climax"".<br/><br/>At any rate, structural problems aside, what makes Man on Fire work as well as it does is the gradual transformation of Creasy from a bit of a sad sack, drunk has-been to an unstoppable vengeance machine. The middle section becomes fairly brutal, and the combination of intense violence and ""arty"" cinematography works well.<br/><br/>The performances are all good to excellent. Fanning has been impressive in every film I've seen her in so far. Walken is a bit underused, but the focus is on Washington, who is somewhat in a Training Day (2001) mode, and excellent at that.<br/><br/>The Mexican setting is very attractive visually. For most audiences, it gives Man on Fire an almost otherworldly feel that helps sell what turns into almost superhuman abilities for Creasy. Scott also tries to make the film more believable by having a ""where are they now"" tag at the end. That can backfire for some viewers--my wife was impressed thinking that it was based on a true story, but actually lowered her score when she learned it wasn't, because of believability factors (she also was bothered by the same structural problems that I thought were troublesome, plus, unlike me, she often dislikes endings where not everyone walks away happy and satisfied).<br/><br/>As for the MTV-styled visuals, Scott's camera is almost constantly in motion. There is a lot of hand-held work, a lot of shots going in and out of focus, a lot of quick cuts, a lot of superimposition or ""cross-fading"", a lot of unusual film and color processing, and so on--even though I like arty cinematography a lot, and I found much to praise here, it even began to make _me_ dizzy after awhile. The visuals are oddest during the beginning, as otherwise it's fairly straightforward dramatic material. The energy of the visuals provides a very strange contrast to the deliberate pacing of the character development in the first section.<br/><br/>But the bottom line is that this becomes a fairly intense actioner/thriller. It's nowhere near ""perfect""--you need a lot of patience and a lot of time to spare, but viewed under the right conditions by someone who doesn't mind the flashy camera-work, Man on Fire is definitely worth a viewing."

","Excellent. Powerful.. Emotional... Innovative... The only real problem i had was in the casting of the supporting players. There are PLENTY of Mexican and/or Chicano actors who, in my opinion, would probably have done a better job than the players who were used. Carlos Gomez, Ricardo Chavira, Jacob Vargas, and pretty much the entire cast of Amores Perros, to name a few.<br/><br/>Giancarlo Giannini, an Italian, was struggling badly in his role as the Chilango (a denizen of Mexico City) police inspector. As was Rachel Ticotin, a Nuyorican, as the investigative reporter. Poor Marc Anthony, another Nuyorican, was simply not ready to take on such a dramatic role. Their ""Mexican"" accent when they spoke Spanish was atrocious, and unfortunately, reminded me that i was watching a film each time they opened their mouths.<br/><br/>Shifting gears, it was hilarious, in a good way, the way that Creasy (Denzel) simply barrelled his way up the food chain of the organized crime circuit ""La Hermandad"" with such relative ease. You'd think after he took out the first few peons, the higher-ups would catch on and be at least SOMEWHAT ready for him. But anyone who knows how the United States of Mexico functions (or MALfunctions) would've laughed tongue-and-cheek at his brazen bravado, as it was totally plausible.<br/><br/>A Home Run..."
"Blade_Le_Flambeur","6","1","3","17 June 2005"," An entertaining movie - though it the visuals ultimately detract
","'Man on Fire' is an action film that tries to go beyond, like A.J. Quinnell's novel. Rather than focusing purely on action sequences, director Tony Scott (Top Gun, Crimson Tide) and writer Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential, Mystic River) attempt to build a relationship between the characters. The attempt is admirable but the film ultimately falls to clichés and unnecessary, fast-paced editing.<br/><br/>Creasy (Denzel Washington) is an American in Mexico City, hired to work as a bodyguard for a wealthy family. All around the city kidnappings are happening at an alarming rate. Lisa (Radha Mitchell) is nervous and convinces her husband Samuel (Marc Anthony) to hire Creasy as a protector for their young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning). At first, the relationship between Creasy and Pita is strained but eventually they come to gain affection for each other. Creasy is an alcoholic shell in the beginning of the film and uses the job as an opportunity to stop his habit. He's an extremely mysterious, quiet man who Pita eventually opens up. Nasty consequences ensue, when Pita is kidnapped and a ransom is demanded. Creasy is shot at the scene but eventually recovers and with weapons from Rayburn (Christopher Walken) decides to personally hunt down those responsible. As the film continues the conflict gets wider and wider as he searches for answers. Soon a conspiracy involving a corrupt lawyer (Mickey Rourke) is uncovered leading to even more gruesome violence to a suspenseful conclusion.<br/><br/>'Man on Fire' had potential as a film, being based on a great novel but Scott and Helgeland ultimately cut short on the relationship in order for action. Dizzying, MTV-like editing is used for many of the action scene and it feels as if Scott is trying to emulate both his brother, Ridley and filmmaker Oliver Stone. In 1994 Stone released 'Natural Born Killers' which used aesthetics as a focal point to the narrative of the film including some hyper-real scenes. Scott seemed to favor using a similar technique in 'Man on Fire' however the negatives outweigh the positives. The cinematography by Paul Cameron is at once ferocious, especially considering his work on films like 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' and 'Swordfish'. Christian Wagner (True Romance, Mission: Impossible II) edits with the same kind of speed but instead of adding to the film it also subtracts. The action scenes feel unnecessarily disruptive and it's when the violence on screen happens that Scott actually gains momentum. These scenes last more in the memory than the relationship. Helgeland's script dramatically makes cuts to the novel, and frankly it's uncertain that he even read it! Characters are made into two-dimensional pawns, the setting is changed from Italy to Mexico City, and whole chapters of character development are swiftly cut.<br/><br/>Washington and Fanning give the appropriate energy for their characters, especially the former. Washington is a talented actor and his performance is one of the good factors of the film. Fanning also is entertaining as always, particularly in the bonding scenes. The rest of the cast is not worth much mention. Walken plays the role straight, which is disappointing considering his good work in 'Catch Me if You Can'.<br/><br/>In the end 'Man on Fire' gives into the typical formula. The visuals can be arresting, the action is entertaining, and the leads are worthwhile but the mess created by the filmmakers ultimately drags it down to mediocre or below good.<br/><br/>6/10"

Creasy was an absolute great character. Denzel made me feel for this man that seem to be lost with a soul that was to be forever buried within. Pita brought Creasy back to life and we were able to see a soul that was smart, vibrant, humble, and most of all loving and loyal. Dakota was wonderful as Pita. Pita was smart and loving. Pita was able to see the soul that rested within Creasy and she was able to bring it back to life. Denzel brought me on this cinematic journey with him. I was able to experience all the levels of emotions (hurt, anger, love, renewal, and revenge, just to name a few). Denzel and Dakota what a great acting team! Man on fire, sets me on Fire!!!"

","Cast is good - Denzel, Christopher Walken, Rhada Mitchell (Australian actress), Dakota Fanning, Mickey Rourke. It is filmed well, nice shots, good soundtrack, edgy editing, but the plot is thin, formulaic and the so-called 'action' is just an excuse for bloody violence. The five out of ten is for the cinematography and soundtrack. The shots of Mexico are lovely. But I don't understand why we need so much blood - is it to make a point? I also don't understand why Denzel would want to do such a movie when he has already won Oscars and other plaudits for his obvious acting skill. The violence takes over the acting and all you see is people's hands, ears, heads, etc etc being chopped off and people shot, etc etc."

","This is one of my favorite movies, as I too like the ""revenge"" genre. Denzel gives another great and believable performance and Creasy. He is an ex covert operative whose demons from his past make him want to blow his own head off, which he attempts and the round doesn't go off. I guess that was saying that he is still supposed to be alive. When Pita shows him that it is OK to live again, and then she is taken and he is critically injured, my stomach literally turned. When he leaves the hospital early and they tell him he is going to die if he does, the way he says he is going to ""I'm gonna do what I do best. I'm gonna kill em. Anyone who was involved. Anyone who profited."" He says this with such a cold feeling, you can feel the hatred through the screen. When he finds the first guy and tells him if he lies, he is going to cut his fingers off one by one...I couldn't help but think that was very cold-blooded and I would do the same thing if someone too my kid.<br/><br/>All in all, a VERY underrated movie. I like the washed out film similar to THREE KINGS. Tony Scott actually made a movie that has an in depth story line, unlike his usual fare (Top Gun, Days of Thunder...he is a Jerry Bruckheimer fav), and the choppy shooting helps you feel the emotions the characters go through.

"lavatch","Null","1","3","6 March 2005"," Creasy: The Michelangelo of Assassins
","Denzel Washington is always watchable and compelling. In ""Man on Fire,"" he plays a character named Creasy, a former secret ops assassin who is hired as a bodyguard to protect the young daughter of a wealthy couple in Mexico. At the time, Creasy is down on his luck, battling alcoholism and depression. While he reads the Bible and knows scriptural passages by heart, it turns out that the little girl named Pita (wise beyond her years) brings Creasy out of his funk. <br/><br/>From the outset, the film's premise is that Pita will be kidnapped and Creasy's skills as an assassin will be the main interest of the film. According to Creasy's friend Rayburn (played by a portly Christopher Walken), ""Creasy's art is death, and he is about to paint his masterpiece."" The best part of the film is the banter between Creasy and Pita. In the chauffeuring and the homework sessions, it is clear that these two characters formed a human bonding that resonated with lively, engaging dialogue. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film turns into a high-tech version of ""Death Wish"" with the Michelangelo of assassins proceeding through a string of brutal vendettas. The film is definitely not a promotional travelogue for Mexico; the only Mexican character with any ethical human values was Rachel Ticotin's journalist. For this story, was it really necessary to have 146 minutes filled with so many sleazy characters and violent scenes? And why wasn't there an explanation of the cause of the depression of Creasy, filling in the gaps of the mystery of his past. The film was skillfully and stylishly directed, and there was a strong supporting cast. But every time they mentioned Creasy's name, it sounded as if they were saying ""Greasy."" Denzel Washington is one of the finest actors of this era. But he deserves better film projects than this one."

Cutie-pie Dakota Fanning does a great job too, that little girl is such a great actress already it freaks me out, she has the acting chops of somebody twice her age! The story is very solid, and the way he gets back at the bad guys, in this case the corrupt Mexican officials, you just have to get up out of your chair and cheer for this guy. Christopher Walken, one of the best actors ever does not disappoint either but could've been given a better role. Marc Anthony is decent, too, I mean for the kind of role he was given he did a good job, although if you're a fan of his, his character might disappoint you towards the end. The director did a pretty good job with the scenery and editing too, the Japanese-styled subtitles, the color palettes, it reminded me a lot of ""Traffic"" which I also loved.

"peter-856","8","1","3","15 February 2005"," Sympathy for the devil
","It was only a matter of time until Hollywood got its act together and began to examine the rise of the right wing in America: in this case, the unfettered power of capitalism over the rule of law. The genius of this film is that it looks at evil through the eyes of an evil protagonist, who introduces himself by asking his buddy ""Do you think God will forgive us for what we've done?"".<br/><br/>Why should we care? We care because the man who plays the evil character is an actor of INCREDIBLE power and dignity and because the first third of the film is given over to him enjoying a glimpse of the possibility of redemption. The courtship (I mean nothing smutty by the use of that word) between Denzil Washington and the preternaturally talented Dakota Fanning is the awakening of a deadened soul and it shines brightly against the sickening disorientation of the rest of the movie, as investigation becomes classical revenge tragedy, (here's the spoiler) until the rescue of the child turns it back into a 'American hero gaining moral advantage over lowlife foreigner' diatribe.<br/><br/>For this film to be a work of realist genius it only needed to follow its own logic and stick to the death of the innocent. That is what drives Creasy to commit a variety of grotesque murders with which this innocent viewer (albeit, drinking Glenmorangie) was prepared to sympathize. Hollywood's determination to always provide 'closure' on every moral dilemma is at the root of America's failure as an imperialist power: the subject nations suffer, while they tidy it up for their own consumption, and thereby continue the belief that they only need to keep feeling sorry for the victims and everything will be okay.<br/><br/>The music is brilliant, by the way, and the editing is incredible, and the use of subtitles within the screen is the most respectful to the speakers of a foreign language that I have seen: the whole inter-relationship between Protagonist imperial observer eye (America) and Antagonist subject sufferer eye (Mexico-in this case, although it could be a lot of countries, including...ummm...Iraq?) is a lot more objective than we are used to. By Hollywood standards this is a bloody intelligent film and all concerned come close to actually saying something truthful.<br/><br/>In the end, though, the devil's pain is his own, and I prefer to let him suffer."

","The movie takes on the terror of just living in Mexico. Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington set up to the kidnapping to perfection - creating their roles, the mood, including the dangers, but holding a keen core relationship which is both awesome and an understanding of their roles. After the kidnapping, Denzel's character is everything he claimed to be earlier, and now he proves it. His character is ruthless, yet he has the talent to employee wit, wisdom, physique, and courage to bring the audience to somewhere they can't imagine. After viewing this movie, one is certainly aware that kidnapping is as real in Mexico as is portrayed in this movie - why would anyone live there let alone visit! Denzel also portrays the hope for liberty -- the sacrifice of one for another -- perhaps the only true answer toward dealing with terrorism."

","Director Tony Scott, who some have dubbed the ""lesser"" Scott brother (and the one to call when Ridley is unavailable), has had a wildly uneven career over the last 15 years or so. He has his own trademark visual aesthetics down pat, and has directed some relentless action bloodbaths in his career (""The Last Boy Scout,"" ""Revenge,"" ""True Romance"").<br/><br/>But since the mid-90s, Scott has tried to relieve himself of those stylized action flicks in favor of more ""respectable"" Hollywood productions, and ""Man on Fire"" is the latest effort. While ""Man on Fire"" boasts some terrific visuals and action, somewhere in the middle, things are lost, but the film isn't a failure because of that.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, I actually enjoyed Tony Scott's take of ""Man on Fire."" It has a worthwhile star, Denzel Washington, plot and performances from much of the supporting cast. The problem is, Scott's rendition of ""Man on Fire"" is simply too much. It suffers the most from a buildup that seems more perfunctory than dramatic, and bad pacing due to Scott's over-indulgence into the characters.<br/><br/>Washington plays Creasy, a bodyguard with a shady past, who is hired by a Mexican businessman named Samuel (Marc Anthony) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell) to protect their young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning). When Pita is kidnapped, Creasy embarks on a mercilessly bloody quest of vengeance to find those responsible, and eventually traces those links back to the family household that hired him.<br/><br/>The film focuses pretty much, for almost the entire first hour, on the developing relationship between Creasy and Pita. And therein lies the problem: the previews had led us to believe that Washington was going to kick some serious a** but unfortunately none of that occurs until the last 45 minutes or so. So until then, you'd have to sit through a lot of dialogue and people standing around talking.<br/><br/>None of that is bad really, except if you're more of a fan of bloody thrillers (which Scott had become famous for during the 90s), but ""Man on Fire"" is made more for those who like action movies with a purpose, other than blowing stuff up.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning are both flawless, in roles that really are moving and profound, as are most of the supporting players including Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Christopher Walken, and Mickey Rourke. Scott himself is showing signs that he's maturing into a true filmmaker and is not living in older brother Ridley's directorial shadow.<br/><br/>""Man on Fire"" does of course contain many of Scott's trademarks, including twisting, beautiful cinematography and visuals, tough, convincing characters, and stylized bloody violence. Scott even makes good use of the lush Mexican setting and uses them substantially in staging the action sequences.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Man on Fire"" gets a ""7,"" and I certainly enjoyed it a lot for what it was."

It is a movie experience that is truth-filled and artistically-well-presented. I loved Scott's use of camera angles and camera speeds etc., and the way he weaves his unusual love story with the dark world of kidnappers and their victims.<br/><br/>I think that this is an experientially driven work dealing with corruption and fear and extreme human conditions and forces that breed industries of fear such as kidnapping or terrorism. These realities press up against us in our everyday world. At the same time Scott and the actors treated the subject I felt with truthfulness and heart. Many if not all of the main characters are based on real experiences - first the experiences related by A.J. Quinnell in his novel, and secondly those of the many persons interviewed in Mexico. This all came together sublimely to produce a very compelling film. Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning are honest and spontaneous. Christopher Walken is wonderfully real and likable. The whole cast gave performances that will be a pleasure to pull out and enjoy over and over. I also recommend viewing the directors comments (and possibly the producer  Lucas Foster, screen-writer - Brian Helgeland, and actor -Dakota Fanning's comments) in the special features section."

Until she gets kidnapped. This is where the movie picks up the pace a bit.<br/><br/>SPOILER (needed to include to properly express my opinion)<br/><br/>When John is told that girl is dead, you just hope that Creasy kills the bad guys in a ruthless manner for what they did, and he does just that. In my opinion he was too nice to them towards the end. They got what they deserved, because the police sure weren't going to do anything about it. Anyone who calls Washington's character in this movie ""inhumane"" has grossly overlooked the personalities, actions, and planned actions of every villain he kills. Had he not cared so deeply for the girl, he would not have gone to the lengths he did to find justice. The more ""John Creasy's"" there could be in this world, the more humane and better this world would be. If you like this movie, I recommend ""Walking Tall""(2004)."

","I am a college student at Texas A&M University and I thought that this was an awesome movie for college students or any age actually.  All the action kept me on my seat the whole time and I thought that all the actors/actresses were stupendous.  The little girl in the movie was so easy to relate to and absolutely melted my heart.  The plot was full of twists that I would have never guessed myself.  I was also very impressed by the good sense of moral value that the movie incorporated.  The Bible and prayer were all important aspects of the movie that I really appreciated.  The thing that really got me was the ending.  I mean, it actually made my fiance shed a tear!  I WOULD SEE THIS MOVIE:)  Thanks!"

","I am not very good at writing reviews. I am a big fan of Dakota Fanning's, but never was one of Denzel Washington, so I was a little hesitant to watch this movie. My mother is a big fan of Denzel's and she told me that she liked the movie, so I decided to give it a chance and watched it. I honestly liked this movie a lot, even though I kind of figured out who all were involved in the kidnapping. What I liked, was how Denzel took charge after he began to figure out. I would recommend this movie. I am sorry if this wasn't any help at all, but it just goes to show that if you give a movie a try when you aren't a big fan of somebody, you may just find out what you have been missing all along."

","I just finished watching this movie and I have to say it was terrible. <br/><br/>* Spoilers ahead *<br/><br/>There were tremendous plot holes at every moment. Why didn't the ""body guard"" wear a bullet proof vest? Why were the doors of the car unlocked? Why is the girl safe when she's at school or somebody's house? It was painfully obvious every time they were setting up a plot device. I knew exactly what was going to happen ten minutes before anything happened. The way they set up the story they made the whole movie into 1 giant cliché after another. Every thing in this movie I had seen a thousand times before in countless other movies. The only reason why it gets any stars at all is because visually there were some pretty shots, Walken is always great, and they did a good job of making Dakota seem cute. Other then that, if you've seen any other 10 movies in your life you've seen everything that happens in this movie."

The movie is very predictable with a minor 'twist' in the end. Mostly, it is full of clichés- burnt out veterans, stereotyped, cold blooded kidnappers, one lonely reporter on a mission to change the world, corrupt cops, the loyal friend- it's all in there like a paint by numbers. Only it isn't half as fun as that.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to write a review without giving away whatever little semblance to a plot it has to offer, so let me just warn you: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. DO NOT BELIEVE THE REVIEWS HERE.

"movieguy1021","3","2","12","1 May 2004"," Man on Fire: 3/10
","Is it just me, or can action movies never be set in America anymore? They all either take place overseas, or the main character at least travels there. In Man on Fire, Tony Scott's attempt to be cool, it mostly takes place in Mexico City to prove to the dimwitted public that, yes, America is better than any other country. To prove to everyone how good America is, Scott has actors who speak with American accents who have lived all their lives in Mexico. People with southern accents don't trust Americans because they're ""foreign"". It's even worse when the actors attempt to put on a decent accent, and by even worse, I mean laughably bad.<br/><br/>John Creasy (Denzel Washington, in a one-note role) is a former assassin who has become an alcoholic. He is hired by a Mexican family (or an American family with southern accents) to protect their young child, Pita (the ubiquitous Dakota Fanning) from the recent onslaught of kidnappings. About halfway through the movie (where it could have stopped and been a mediocre drama), she is kidnapped. Creasy swears vengeance on everyone who helped kidnap her. You know, these revenge movies always stay fresh and never get old after a while.<br/><br/>My largest complaint was the directing by Scott. Neither of the Scott brothers (the other being Ridley) are very high on my list, and Man on Fire just backs up my statement. Scott tries to be all ""hip"" and ""turn of the century"" by not keeping the camera still for even one frame. Even when two people are talking, the camera's continuously moving in circles. It's enough to make you sick. If that's not bad enough, Scott plays tricks with the camera related to focusing so oftentimes you can never tell what's happening, which is not helped by the choppy editing. Perhaps some of the minimal action could have been considered exciting if we were able to tell what the hell was going on at any time.<br/><br/>Enough about the technical aspect of the movie, which was bad enough. The movie, touted as a no-holds-barred action movie, does have holds barred (whatever that may mean) and is not able to be called an action movie, simply because there is no action. There is nothing going on for the first half of the movie (which I have said before) except for a brief montage of how bad Mexico City is for kidnapping (which is only referred to once more, and it's impossible to tell what is happening then, also). The first half explored the bonding relationship between Pita and Creasy, which is supposed to explain why Creasy would be so hell-bent on destroying everyone who kidnapped Pita. However, there is no chemistry between the two, and the basis of their relationship doesn't even make sense. Pita's mother tells him that Pita wants to be friends with him, so this hard-as-nails ex-Marine decides to be friends with her. If he were TRULY a tough nail, he wouldn't have given in. So why did he do it? To further the ""plot"", of course! The main thing is, though, that the character of Pita is just too damn annoying to care about. Fanning had just come off of her star-making role in The Cat in the Hat, and here again she plays the precocious child who is amazing at everything she does. This is supposedly a true story, and if this was just supposed to be an ordinary family torn apart by the kidnapping, why would this child be an expert at swimming, playing piano, extreme ease of talking to adults, and, most of all, being so annoying? The world may never know.<br/><br/>Once the second half of the movie starts up and Creasy begins to get mad, every single plot development that could have slowly happened in the first half comes in. It's a leisurely movie, and then BOOM plot here, here, and here. Add a few random acts of off-screen violence and you get what naive critics call a ""non-stop"" action movie that's so violent it should be banned. Give me a break. If this was truly an action movie, wouldn't action take place throughout, and, more importantly, wouldn't it be exciting? That's the aspect that's most needed in Man on Fire but is not used-whatever action there is is not exciting. The acts of torture are a little out of the ordinary, but are not used properly or done in a way that makes sense (re: the man tied to the car). In closing, if you want to see a young precocious kid acting annoying and a famous actor sleepwalking through a boring, meaningless movie with no action, then Man on Fire is your best bet.<br/><br/>My rating: 3/10<br/><br/>Rated R for language and strong violence."
"glaneljhonathan","6","1","4","31 January 2020"," Wannabe Léon: The Professional
","I love Denzel Washington & almost all his movies, he has a particular charm to him, especially in Equalizer, Flight & Inside Man. I love him even as a bad arrogant man, because his acting is on point, even if the movie itself isn't great. That's why I hated him, or rather his character in Training Day, but because of his good acting.<br/><br/>This movie though, unfortunately lost me completely on the stupid editing, plus the diabolical background sound, which was nothing short of cacophony, even when the credits roll. Even horror movies can do better and make cacophony sound as euphony. I don't know if it took a toll on me because of my ADHD or what (anyone else out there?), but never have I ever been so starved of entertainment in order to like this movie so desperately, just because it uses a unique style & technique, and I never will. A similar technique was later used in the show ""Narcos"", which was way cleaner, and I loved it, because it made sense to use it, unlike here.<br/><br/>Among around 900 top movies I've seen so far, entirely from the beginning to the end, with all my focus, I've never found any other movies as seriously irritating as :
1. Pitch Black
2. Man on Fire.
And for both, 75% of the reason was because of the annoying editing. Man on Fire has a better story atleast, and I can't complain about the acting as well, but the choppy editing disconnects you so much that your suspension of disbelief just goes away & you disconnect & now realize that you are just watching a movie, constantly, instead of being invested in the story - and that's never a sign of a good film! Many things just feel like they are happening randomly.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't coherent, it felt like a wannabe Leon the Professional, a wannabe biography (ending), but I still rate it 6 because it was not as bad as Pitch Black. Pitch Black was an absolute hell of an emotional torture, plus it's a nightmare for anyone with serious epilepsy! The very mention of it generates an unfathomable wrath within me, especially because I still can't figure out how did so many people love it so much when myriads of better movies exist. Do they really have no other option, or do they really watch a movie once in a blue moon, that they find disgusting B movies cool. If you wanna watch good B movies, watch Tarantino!<br/><br/>Sorry for the tangential digression though."

"susannacoleking","8","1","4","12 August 2007"," Near perfect, if watched on television.
","When my dad first rented this movie, we watched the first hour or so together, and when we stopped for the night I was left wondering how it earned an R rating. So far, it'd been nearly clean enough to be a PG film, or at least a PG-13, instead of its harsh R.<br/><br/>Then my father watched the second half, without me, and informed me it was so violent that, pretty understandably, at age 14, I wouldn't be allowed to watch the rest (though he told me how it ended). A couple years later, I caught it on TV and become absorbed once again. I kept waiting for the horrendous violence my father warned me of, but it never happened. That's when I realized most of it had probably been edited out for TV.<br/><br/>That's the beauty of watching engaging films that are peppered with a touch too much violence for the young or the squeamish on TV. If I had seen the rest of the film on DVD, I might have wrote it off as being a bit too rough, but on TV, it was near perfect.<br/><br/>The cast is quite stellar, and I especially enjoyed Denzel Washington (in what I believe to be one of his best performances) and the relationship between his Creasy, and Pita. I also, was quite mesmerized and impressed by Radha Mitchell's solid performance, an actress whose name was unfamiliar to me, at the time.<br/><br/>Just as engaging as the cast though, is the cinematography that is both unique, in a most excellent way, capturing a sort of pressing heat and urgency, as well as, the bustling spirit of Mexico City.<br/><br/>All in all, worth a watch, especially if your fans of any of the main cast who give concrete performances or a fan of director, Tony Scott."

But it was NOT AN ACTION MOVIE. It was not what I wanted. I wanted ACTION. May be with some dramatic elements but action.

"SteakSalad_101","10","1","4","23 December 2006"," A violent revenge story with a heartwarming twist
","It is an absolute rarity that a movie comes along like the 2004 remake of Man On Fire. Set in Mexico City, Man on Fire takes on the dramatic and dark plot line of ransom kidnapping, violent revenge, and how horrible a shattered family can be all put into a blender and coming out as a well made, fruitful smoothie. Denzel Washington takes on the gritty role as Creasy, an ex-CIA assassin who's burnt out and completely given up on life. Reluctantly he assumes the role of a bodyguard for a 9-year-old girl in Mexico City, the daughter of a very rich couple, as kidnapping in Mexico City is at an all-time high. Dakota Fanning, my favorite actress and one of the best in Hollywood--assumes the role of 9-year-old Pita, the girl whom Creasy is protecting. They start out on the wrong foot--Pita tries to get close to Creasy, yet afflicted by his past, he is an anti-social person who stands alone. Eventually, though, he softens and the two become very good friends and Creasy begins to realize that maybe life could be worth living. Suddenly, the charming and touching moments are shattered when Pita is kidnapped by gangsters and Creasy mortally wounded. Convicted of killing two cops during the kidnapping, Creasy goes on the run and his life is once again broken when his newfound best friend has been kidnapped and there is no sign of her. With nothing to lose, Creasy embarks on an objective to kill all people who were involved with the kidnapping in any way, shape, or form. The movie is beautifully executed, punishingly brutal, disturbingly realistic, excruciatingly violent, and just may be the best movie I've seen in a WHILE. All the plot summaries on the Internet for this film, including mine, are misleading: the film is NOT about revenge...it's about something much more deeper and emotional than that. The execution of the film is seamless: you experience every ounce of love, hatred, and vengeance right along with Creasy through the entire movie. You can't help stop and say during the film, ""This is exactly what I would have done."" I would recommend this film to absolutely anyone, especially those who are fans of the Kill Bill movies. This is one of the best 5 films I have ever seen in my life. Rent it, buy it, watch in on TV, whatever--just don't miss it!"

"Jobi14","10","1","4","17 August 2006"," A well thought out, well made movie
","First off, I'd like to say I did not believe Denzel Washington deserved the Oscar for Training Day. I really believed he deserved one for his performance in this film.<br/><br/>Creasy is a character you can neither love nor hate. He is not a good guy and we know it because he has killed before. But neither is he evil. You can't dislike him. In this film, he becomes the body guard of a well-to-do family in Mexico City. He is ordered to protect the daughter of the family (played by Dakota Fanning).<br/><br/>However, in a city where kidnappings occur every day it is hard to prepare for any and everything. She is kidnapped and, after a bad ransom exchange, presumed dead. Creasy then goes on a war path to track down the men who killed her.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion, this is a fantastic movie. By the end, I was so enthralled by Washington's character that I cried for the last twenty minutes of the film. And I am definitely not a crier.<br/><br/>I know I'm a little biased because I believe that what he does to the men is the just and right thing to do.<br/><br/>Also, the music is SO SPECTACULAR!! This is definitely NOT one of those films where they randomly chose some music director and some random composer who wrecked the film with awkward and misplaced music (See The New World starring Colin Farrell). The song ""Una Palabra"" by Carlos Varela is perfectly placed and signifies a great deal at that point in the movie.<br/><br/>Watch it and see for yourself!!!"

","I hadn't noticed but looking at my DVD collection it seems that every other film I have is a Denzel Washington movie. The actor is phenomenal! The only other working major movie star working today that I would call phenomenal would be Al Pacino. He's another actor that will not disappoint. I won't go into a litany of names of Denzel Washinton films but Man on Fire is among them. It's kinda shame that I don't go to the large complexes anymore and usually wait 'till a movie is out on DVD (the public has become overly rude, ill mannered and thoughtless- cell phones, etc.) Much has been written on this board about this wonderful movie and I can only say that like most I can't get over how well the whole thing works. I'm a huge fan of Tony Scott and have an idea of his work. I also like his brother Ridley Scott. Anyway, Man on Fire is right up there with Washington and Scotts best pictures. And Dakota Fanning is right up there with Washington. Violent but an enjoyable experience. I give it a ten. Coda: oft times American writers seem to enjoy putting down Mr Washington's movies. When usually the public will flock to the very movies that have been given a ""thumbs down"" or some tepid review. I find that puzzling."

I find myself having better things to do with my time, that is probably why I feel compelled to write this as the movie deserves high recognition for all of the intensities that are absorbed after watching such a movie of this statue.

At any time the acting could go 'over the top' but it doesn't - congratulations to Mr. Scott for keeping the cast under control, but yet free enough to make it all real. The cast is great! From beginning to end the film will keep you at the edge of your seat. But remember - this is an action film, a suspense film and there are some bloody scenes - some are quite on the edge, but again, it never goes over the top. Camera techniques are great! As we move into new technology, there are ways the director with a strong collective group of artists can make things come alive in a new way. And as mentioned before, the use of subtitles - just wonderful, inventive. My only complaint - not speaking Spanish I wish we had translations of the music. That is my weakness - not speaking Spanish, so my apologies. That is the only part that frustrated me with the film. Congratulations to Tony Scott, his entire crew, a superb cast, an amazing script.

"bangban_tribudiman","10","1","4","19 May 2006"," stunning acting and high powered action
","This is not a brainless revenge movie, you begin by being introduced to the characters, with the outstanding acting talents of Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken. Director Tony Scott does a brilliant job at making you feel for the main characters all most immediately. Once introduced to the gifted young Dakota Fanning, you can already see the contrast between her happy character and that of the drunken Denzel Washington. The time spent without action, but where Denzel and Dakota are becoming familiar lasts over an hour but it is clear that Denzel has feelings for his bodyguard subject. When Dakota Fanning is taken, we see a magnificent shoot out between Washington and the kidnappers before Washington finally falls. From then on you see the heavily dismayed Denzel easing his way through the bad guys, killing them off one by one. But does he get what he wants? <br/><br/>Man on Fire also shows the acting brilliance of an old legend in the shape of Sin Cities very own Mickey Rourke. Another familiar face is that of Rhada Mitchell famous for playing the wife of Collin Farrell in Phone Booth. But Man On Fire isn't just a small revenge picture with Jean-Claude Van Damme it includes brilliant acting from the offset, and a subtle emotional outlook. <br/><br/>In my opinion Denzel should have had an Academy Award for this. One of the best movies around to date. A must buy for anyone who likes Washington or revenge movies."

","I just watched Man On Fire for a forth time and I cannot get enough of it. This time I was on a train going back to college trying to pick out some symbolism in it. In my mind, I think Creasy is to be portrayed as Jesus/God. I know I may be wrong, but think about it, Sister Anna asks Creasy if he has ever seen the hand of God in is job or something like that. Then in a few scenes later, there is a close up of Creasy's hand grabbing Pita's out of the water. As if Creasy is Pita's God and she is seeing God's hand. that's a little confusing, I know. But Later on there is a rave scene where Creasy is firing his gun up in the air with the whole crowd screaming, as if he is controlling them. and what about those scars on his hands? maybe symbolism of Jesus' hands with the nails through them? And finally at the end ""The Voice"" says, ""I will give her life for your life"" or something around those lines. Like Jesus gave his life for us, Creasy gave his life for Pita's life. And then when he is walking up that hill, it seemed to it was being set up like Jesus walked the hill before dying on the cross. I could be totally wrong on this, I just started reading The Bible after I saw this movie, so I could be wrong. I have been religious and attend church, but to say I know everything about Jesus would be incorrect. What do you think guys?"

Lupita or Pita), who is a a lovely, intelligent child.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the entire process of Washington and Fanning becoming close and would not have changed a single moment.

","I really didn't like this movie. Especially the music video, quick, flashy editing style annoyed the hell out of me. On top of that the runtime of 146 min was about an hour too long. The script was slow, messy and came across as very fictitious, although it was based on a true story. On the positive side, the little girl Dakota Fanning was a wonder to look at. She gave light to every scene she was in. At times though she came across as a little bit too mature for her age, what was caused by the bad dialog provided to her. I'm not big Denzel fan, his Training Day performance was overrated, as was the entire movie, but he was OK in this one. All in all I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, especially not you epileptics out there. 4/10."
"Anonymous_Maxine","4","1","4","28 April 2004"," A revolution in subtitle technology!
","In a time when the cineplexes are heavily populated with revenge tales, Man On Fire (which could just as easily have been titled Kill Bills or The Other Punisher or Walking Tall and Furious) is not exactly a breath of fresh air. Denzel Washington takes on the role of a family-less drifter of a man trying to outrun a past that is never explained very clearly, beyond the fact that he is trying to drown it in a bottle of Jack Daniel's, but even then only long enough to allow the audience to develop a healthy bit of doubt about his character. Maybe it would create more tension later if we weren't really sure we could trust him or not. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Denzel Washington, a massively talented actor, has become increasingly typecast as the desperate black guy determined to break any rules necessary to get what he wants, be it a heart for his son, revenge for the alleged killing of a girl that he was just hired to watch, etc. I was disappointed by Training Day because it was more violent than it had any reason to be, and John Q looked like just another desperate father trying to save his son tale and turned out to be exactly that with no twists or anything added to make itself necessary. Structurally, Man On Fire is designed a bit like Out of Time (one of Denzel's better recent movies), with much of the first portion of the film dedicated to presenting the flaws in Creasy's (Washington) character. He has a dark past, he has no solid footing anywhere so he kind of drifts around in search of meaningful (or, failing that, meaningless) employment, and as he explains to a cautious mother as she interviews him for the job of being her daughter's bodyguard, he drinks.<br/><br/>
Speaking of the daughter, Dakota Fanning is an impossibly adorable child actor, and it seemed like a shame to me that Tony Scott didn't think that was enough to endear her to the audience. Instead of making her a charming ten-year-old daughter (actually, I think her character in the movie was even younger than that) who could have been further endearing because of what would be an expected level of fright at her surroundings (being a little American girl living in the heart of Mexico City) they go so far over the top that she ultimately becomes the kind of child that could only exist in an action movie where she gets kidnapped. Within a minute of introducing her onscreen, we have already learned that she plays the piano, speaks two languages (granted, this is to be expected since she's American and lives semi-permanently in Mexico City), and says things like `Yes, mother,' and `Right this way, Mr. Creasy.' What kid talks like that?<br/><br/>
On the other hand, it later makes more sense that she is portrayed as Super Daughter, because `Mr. Creasy' later goes on to exact Super Revenge for her kidnapping and apparent murder. This, unfortunately, is where the movie really begins to slip. Man On Fire may have a lengthy running time of almost two and a half hours because it took so much time at the beginning to introduce us to Creasy and, more importantly, to show the relationship between him and Pita (Fanning) develop from uncomfortable to inseparable. It soon becomes clear that the reason for this is to create a strong enough bond to justify Creasy going on to brutally torture the men involved in her kidnapping. Make no mistake, the audience suffers through these scenes as well, so you better make sure you're also pretty ticked off about the kidnapping.<br/><br/>(spoilers) Creasy delivers the cold platter of revenge to several of the bad guys in such ways as cutting a guy's fingers off while his hands are duct taped to the steering wheel and then cauterizing the stubs with the cigarette lighter, and even better, informing a man tied to the hood of a car that while he was passed out (presumably from being beaten), Creasy took the liberty of inserting a highly explosive suppository which will detonate after his little interview. Pretty creative stuff, and exactly what our base human instincts like to see happen to someone who would kidnap and kill a little girl, but once the vicious revenge has been delivered, she turns up alive! OOPS!<br/><br/>Admittedly, they're still bad guys. They still kidnapped the girl and demanded money, but as it turns out, it was the father who planned the thing in the first place, and he gets the most merciful killing, if you would qualify his death as a killing, per se. Why is the man who is guiltier than anyone, and the worst person in the world to have done what he did, given the most mercy? The other guys tried desperately to convince Creasy while he tortured and killed them that they were only following orders, they were only doing a job and they were impartial, and it turned out that they were telling the truth. Criminals, yes, but did they really deserve explosive suppositories? In one scene, the father tearfully tells his wife that he thought their daughter would be treated well, that she would be watching cartoons and eating ice cream, and given her physical state when she turned back up at the end of the movie, that probably is how she was treated.<br/><br/>
The question is not whether Creasy can be expected to have known this. He was convinced that she was dead, and really had no reason to believe that she was alive. The problem is that this is how the movie was written. The plot did not happen accidentally, it was deliberately created this way. We are given an abduction set-up, briefly informed of the family's large-scale financial difficulties (the rather ham-handed foreshadowing of who was behind the whole thing), and then Creasy goes on his rampage. The movie exists so that this man can seek brutal revenge against the killers of a young girl, then she turns up alive and not a word is spoken about the delivery of harsher deaths than were deserved. Maybe this was why Creasy came to the end that he did. He was beyond redemption and was driven off in the custody of the bad guys, presumably to be tortured. Luckily for him, he drifts peacefully off into a calmer death than he could otherwise have expected, his medallion of the Patron Saint of Lost Causes in his hand.<br/><br/>The ending is really the only part that is morally justifiable. Creasy can't live happily ever after because of what he has done, but he can't really be blamed exactly because of what he thought that he was seeking vengeance for. The direction is innovative but unnerving, with Tony Scott's signature lightning fast editing (better used in intense action scenes than throughout an entire film, as you can see here) zooms across the screen, with the exposure also inexplicably flying up and down like a roller coaster, blinding you one second and then darkening so fast that it's not always even the next second. Sometimes it's blindingly bright one second and then dark later in that same second. I imagine the point is to throw the audience off a little, make them feel just a little uncomfortable, but didn't the snapping off of the fingers and the sizzling cauterizing of the stumps already do that quite enough? Evidently not, so while you're busy chasing the most energetic subtitles in film history across the screen, try to remember that yes, revenge is a dish best served cold, but it's at least as important to keep in mind that it is a dish best served to people who really deserves such large helpings."

","Thought the acting was really good. Denzel as usually gave a great performance. However thought the story could have been told equally well around 2 hours. The statement that Denzel was going to ""paint his Death masterpiece"" never materialized. He did not go ""above and beyond"" the call of revenge so my question is why make the masterpiece statement to begin with? There were many parts of the movie that slowed down and made you ""look at your watch"". Did not like the ""stylish"" jerky/out of focus camera work that accompanied too much of the filming."

","MAN ON FIRE (2004) **1/2 Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Christopher Walken, Giancarlo Giannini, Rachel Ticotin, Mickey Rourke, Jesus Ochoa. Washington stars as a former special ops named Creasy who attempts to battle his personal demons by working as a bodyguard for a wealthy Mexican businessman to protect his young daughter (the always wiser-than-her-years excellent Fanning) from a rash of kidnappings in Mexico City which ultimately tests Creasy when the inevitable occurs sending him on a one-man rampage for justifiable vengeance. Brutally violent and highly stylized signature director Tony Scott's excursion into the darker depths of one man's vendetta to overcome his shortcomings hangs a tad heavy but Washington as usual is solid and riveting while Walken provides able support. Brian Helgeland's screenplay adaptation of the story by A.J. Quinnell mixes some ingenious moments of retribution with stark open-eyed ruthlessness."

The police know at the end who ""The Voice"" and his brother are. But it is played out like they are able to ""get their life back"". Rubbish ending to what was a reasonable film. The acting was good by all concerned, and the idea of the cop and journalist getting together to help solve the case is an old plot line. Why he didn't call the journalist prior to the hand-over is stupid. The cops lost them all, of course, just a pity this well used and over used plot was used did not help the quality of the film.

","Some where amongst the flashing strobes and frame chopping that permeate this film you can just manage to make out a black guy who appears to have some serious anger issues. There's also a little rich girl who gets kidnapped and lots of Mexicans who are mostly bad. 'Man on Fire' as we are expected to know our heroic paparazzi target (*flash* *flash*...) is a graduate of the Rambo school of unstoppable killing machines (once our fuses get lit). Films of this ilk can be entertaining, amusing even if you're my way inclined - I've often found myself on the end of odd stairs after chuckling out loud at a decapitation, but they can't be anything more than that, in particular they can't expect us to care about the characters or storyline whom are to movies what myths are to Mythbusters which is just a show about blowing things up. This is Man on Fire's undoing as amongst AIEDs (Anally Inserted Explosive Device) and torture scenes we are distracted by emotionally charged drivel revolving around aforementioned little rich girl who we all know will be fine in the end.

"mizz_gakhal","10","1","5","11 May 2007"," man on fire....
","Once again, Denzel Washington portrays a flawed character who is out to set things right. This, of course, is not a stretch for Denzel since this is often a staple characteristic in many of the roles he takes on. And while I respect his willingness to play less-than-perfect, vulnerable characters, he might be getting a little too comfortable playing these parts. Don?t get me wrong, I?m big fan of Denzel Washington. He?s probably the best actor in Hollywood right now and Man on Fire does nothing to hurt that status. Denzel manages to carry Man on Fire on his back and makes this movie much more interesting than it would have been without him.<br/><br/>Man on Fire is a LONG movie. While the plot is engaging and suspenseful, Denzel?s mission to make a ?masterpiece? of his quest-for-revenge eventually becomes a bit monotonous down the final stretch. His self-made mission to kill anyone involved in the kidnapping is a welcome idea, but too much film time is given to scenes where Denzel only gathers small bits of information. Sure, it all adds up in the end, but if some of these creeps had spilled their guts and gave up better details, we could have probably omitted at least one full revenge sequence.<br/><br/>My biggest beef with Man on Fire is the lack of presence from our primary villain. When a film spends almost two hours building up an anti-hero (in this case, ?The Voice?), we, as an audience, deserve some sort of reward for our endurance. I do not believe every ending needs to resolve happily, but I do believe a quality confrontation was needed in order to gain a sense of satisfaction about our two-and-a-half hour long marathon.<br/><br/>I do commend Man on Fire for being the first film in a long while to cause my eyes to get misty in a blatant, but effective, tear-jerking conclusion. If you don?t feel any emotion during the end of the film, you are a heartless soul! Seriously though, the filmmakers really do lay it on thick in Denzel?s final conversation in the movie. In my mind, I was cursing them for their almost over-the-top attempt to make the audience weep, but privately I was happy that they did. It was an effective, emotional exchange that made the entire movie worthwhile.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken is not given the most involved role, but he excels with what he is given. As one of the world?s greatest supporting actors, Walken adds some weight to this movie and is probably given the film?s best lines in his final scene when he is describing Denzel?s vengeful activities. The little girl in this movie is really wonderful in her role and because of her effective performance, you truly feel saddened about her kidnapping.<br/><br/>I thought a lot of the filmwork was just plain overdone. In most movies, the camera is like the eye of the audience. In such an instance, we are usually given an unintrusive perspective of our main characters. In Man on Fire, there is a reliance on the camera-work to set the mood of the film instead of allowing the characters and their environments to accomplish that. There are just too many camera effects and too many stylized subtitles that cause Man on Fire to forfeit some of its dramatic essence.<br/><br/>All and all, I enjoyed Man on Fire. While it?s not without its flaws, Denzel and Co. turnout a respectable effort. If your question is, ?should I see this movie??, as long as you are comfortable with the overall runtime, you should be good with seeing Man on Fire."

","Based on a solid (if somewhat classic) story of personal redemption with a very good cast, Man on Fire had everything to succeed had the camera operator and editor not been high during the whole making of the movie. The constant motion, the odd cuts and abrupt transitions, while they may work well in a 2 1/2 minute music video, do not translate all that well to a two+ hour movie. I found it really irritating after about 20 minutes, and I have shot my share of experimental stuff. I even considered giving up on the movie at one point, even though I quite liked the movie, but it really was too much to take.<br/><br/>I guess the younger crowd raised on hysterical MTV style images will probably be more tolerant. However the rest of us with an attention span of more that three seconds may find it painful.<br/><br/>I really would have rated the movie 8 or 9 if it hadn't been for that issue. A shame really...

","Having been a huge fan of AJ Quinnell for a couple of decades I was excited to see the movie. Sam Elliott originally played the main character now butchered by Washington.. which for the record I adore. But this is an absolute crap show. The books are suspenseful, tragic, based in Malta and Europe on the whole and nothing about this film gives or does credit to the actual story it's based on. The filming style itself is an epileptics nightmare and the ending should have been much different and everything about it was wrong. An absolute disappointment from minute one to the final scene. If they'd called it anything else and not tried to ride of the fan tails of Quinnells fan base it may have had some merit although the aforementioned terrible shooting style would have still made this hard to watch. One of the beat things about Quinnells books are they're not entirely predictable, in fact they are possibly the best of this genre I've read (start at the very beginning although you'll struggle to find them now as they're out of print) However this movie is formulaic and utter crap. Terribly shot, awful casting acting, adaptation, everything. It's all wrong...if I could give negative stars I would."

After kidnap of Lupita Denzel Washington takes revenge and makes the things set right again.

","Tony Scott's latest film sees the bombastic director moving further away from the action excesses of earlier in his career to concentrate on this deeply moving, human drama. The success of the whole movie hinges on the wonderful relationship between the young and brilliant Dakota Fanning and Washington, giving definitely his best performance in a film so far. This movie has all the trappings and storyline of a typical revenge thriller, with Washington going around cutting the fingers off crims and exploding them with C4, plus loads of gritty shoot-outs and other associated dramas.<br/><br/>But the film actually works best as a slow-burning suspense flick, about two very human people. There's Fanning's child, wise beyond her years, and Washington, burnt-out yet packed with emotion. The chemistry between these two actors is brilliant and the film is surprisingly sad, having me in tears at some points. The other cast members – Walden, Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, TOTAL RECALL's Rachel Ticotin as a reporter – are there to also give good performances, but they definitely come in at second place compared to the movie's central relationship. A realistic, suspenseful film which offers a glimpse of how things really are."

","Man on Fire (2004): Dir: Tony Scott / Cast: Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Rachael Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Marc Anthony: Action film that starts out well but ends not so well. It regards revenge in its most unpleasant. Denzel Washington plays a former assassin smitten by guilt and resorts to alcohol until he is assigned to protect a young girl played by Dakota Fanning. As predicted Fanning will break Washington's barrier. Then she is kidnapped leaving him unconscious with bullet wounds. What is truly disturbing is the climax upon climax third act where Washington pursues those responsible for the kidnapping and murder of the Fanning character and the revenge he obtains in the most heinous sense. Director Tony Scott presents realism yet there is nothing short on its lead performance that stands out in this film. Excellent work by Washington who goes from grief to a hint of joy until that joy is removed giving way to vengeance. Fanning is a fine young talent but her appearance is pretty straight forward presenting nothing less than expected. Rachael Ticotin as an aiding journalist steals her moments. Radha Mitchell as Fanning's mother is underused. Marc Anthony plays Fanning's father who hires Washington on to protect her. Not as good as it should have been but it does carry a great theme regarding bodyguard duties and the flames of revenge. Score: 6 / 10"
"Rickting","6","0","2","29 April 2015"," A punchy, intense thriller that unfortunately wastes a fair amount of its potential
","Denzel Washington is a troubled hit-man who gradually becomes friends with the young girl who he's acting as a bodyguard for. When she's kidnapped, he literally goes around killing everyone who might have been involved to find the truth. Man on Fire, from the underrated Tony Scott, is a film of two halves. In the first half, Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning (The girl he's looking after) form a friendship and it's touching and well played. Dakota Fanning is excellent, while Denzel Washington once again proves a master of providing compelling performances without being hammy and loud. This has some well handled character development and Washington is a character we can get behind and sympathise with. Then, Fanning gets kidnapped and the film becomes an over the top, hard hitting, brutal revenge film which is good enough, but lacks the emotional dimensions of the first half. The first half is more interesting, even though Denzel is moderately calm and it doesn't involve him killing everyone. However, isn't Denzel going into full on badass mode the premise of the movie? Thus, MOF fails to deliver on the promise of the premise.<br/><br/>To its credit, MOF is more emotional than many films of its type. The script is decent enough, although it lacks charisma. Throughout MOF never reaches its full potential. At first, it has some dull moments but then later on it goes overboard. Tony Scott was a good director, and he directs the film well some of the time, but even when characters are just talking or nothing is happening, MOF still looks like it was filmed inside a rave. With indulgent shaky cam, random slow motion and crazy editing which often makes the film look like a terrible hip hop music video about clubbing, you may want to bring the painkillers since this might give you a headache. It works some of the time, but it can get pretty annoying. Combined with the lack of charisma in the script, the film never hits a peak or has a proper finale either so the action can feel a bit underwhelming. Still, its intensity, punchiness and acting is to be admired, although both the audiences and critics got it wrong. 39% on Rotten Tomatoes is too low, 7.8 on IMDb is too high. This is similar to The Equalizer, which also has Denzel Washington in vigilante mode and involves a precocious child actress. This is probably a better movie, but The Equalizer is more enjoyable.<br/><br/>6/10"

","This film had the potential to be really good. The plot was average but could be turned into something really good. However, the film did not deliver. It was extremely long and quite confusing. Scenes were edited a lot to add more effect - this just made me more confused. I definitely would not recommend this film. It's long when it doesn't need to be. It's confusing because there seems to be too many characters and too many things going on, thus you just don't even care what's going on! I'm very surprised it has such a high rating...<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD: <br/><br/>1. Guy is losing hope. Gets a job as a security guard for a rich family to look after a young girl. Becomes close with the young girl who gives him hope. I have summarised the first 1 hour of the film. The first 1 hour of the film dragged on! I kept wanting something to happen and nothing did! The first hour showed the audience how much the girl meant to Creasy (the security guard). Nothing interesting happened at all. You could skip the first 1 hour of this film and you'd still understand the film... That's how irrelevant it was.<br/><br/>2. After the girl gets kidnapped... I understood a little bit of what was going on. After that... I didn't understand it at all. Too many people seemed to be involved and it was very confusing.<br/><br/>3. So at the end Creasy dies... So what about that news reporter? What happened there? <br/><br/>4. The editing of the scenes probably made me more confused. As soon as Creasy was going to do something violent the editing started.

","Tony Scott's direction is incredible. This film is on my top ten of all time. Very few films have ever so strongly impacted me personally as this did, and I am not sure I can adequately describe why this is so.<br/><br/>The emotional transformation of Denzel Washington's character John Creasy in this film is stunning and his finest performance to date. His Academy Award for Best Actor in Training Day is one a dimensional cartoon personality deserving no comparison to the complexity of John Creasy. The only great cinematic performance I can begin to consider in his category is Paul Newman in""Cool Hand Luke,"" and arguably Russell Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind."" Denzel Washington may be the best male actor alive at this time.<br/><br/>This film is a brilliant masterpiece- filled with memorable scenes in which Dakota Fanning becomes an A-List Star, a fantastic musical score intertwined with the most creative cinematography since Conrad Hall. This is a powerful film: not for weak at heart, elegantly beautiful at times and harshly realistic at others. A film that flew under the Academy Award radar or too far above their vote-for-our-friends intellect.<br/><br/>In two words simply stated- ""See It!"" You will be glad you did."

This is hardly a movie about ransom. It feels more like a movie about drug trafficking, except that the drugs are only a minor issue here.

","Once I got my head around the location, I then needed to get my head around Scott's direction. I was kept on my toes. The camera angles, speed of shots were alien to begin with. I realise it adds to the foreign-ness of the film. I love this film, my only detraction would be Dakota Fanning's screeching. I'm not a fan of her 'wise beyond her years' style either. Doesn't make her lovable. But, she's all grown up now and we won't be hearing any of that anymore. Some of the characters: Aurelio (the Voice's brother) was also in City of God and I'm getting a better understanding about life and death in South America. This is an emerging genre and Man on Fire is as good a way of introducing you to it. Great film, shows Washington's dark side and how this girl steals his heart so much that he will do anything for her."
"shannenashford","10","0","1","28 January 2012"," Excellent. I love this film.
","I really like Man on fire, I think that it is far from the other millions of cliché action films, in that as well as the fast moving scenes, and endless violence, there is also the heart-warming scenes, showing the emotions, and the vulnerable mental state of the main character: Creasy (Denzel Washington). <br/><br/>The camera shots, are mainly close ups, to show the emotion on the actors faces, and make the audience feel a connection with them, and to sympathise with them, due to the situation they are in. Many of the close ups on Lupita (Dakota Fanning), the girl who Creasy is guarding, show her intense frustration at Creasy's impenetrable exterior, and confusion of why they can't be friends. They also show how naïve young children are, and how easy it is to hurt their feelings. <br/><br/>I think that the key moment in this film, is when Creasy goes to watch Pita swim. They then have a mutual topic to talk to each other about, and he helps her to get over her fear of the gun shot. ""You are a prisoner on this block until that sound sets you free"". This is the beginning of the friendship between Creasy and Lupita. <br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays sullen, moody, Creasy who is loosing himself, until he is appointed the position of Lupita's bodyguard, and she shows his that his life is once more worth living. Charming Pita, played by Dakota Fanning, brings meaning back to Creasy's life, and helps him to re-claim his faith, and brings out his protective, fatherly side, until she is kidnapped. With only a car license plate missing the last letter, he sets out to find Lupita and bring her home. <br/><br/>In the scene where Creasy is in his room, drinking Jack Daniels and reloading his pistol, he tries to shoot himself, but the bullet fails. The camera during this scene is close to Creasy's face, showing the sweat fall down his face, and his hand close unsuccessfully to catch the bullet when it is ejected. The camera is close and we can see into his eyes, see the self hatred, due to his violent past, and how his reactions have slowed due to the drink that he is consuming. The music is not music as such, but a complex mixture of loud sounds, like gunshots and high pitched, screech type noises. This shows his anger and frustration with himself. When he tries to kill himself, and it fails the music turns to a piano to symbolise his relief and shock at why the bullet failed. <br/><br/>When Lupita is taken, she is coming out of Piano practice with one of the top pianist instructors in New Mexico, when Creasy spots a car that was following them the other day; The scene is close up and long distance shots. The close ups to show the expression on the faces of the kidnappers, Creasy and Lupita. The horror on the little girls face, as Creasy is shot is unimaginable. It is not a scene that anyone, let alone a 9 year old girl should see, she is scared, and her tear streaked face says it all, as she screams Creasy's name. The long shots show just how small and young she is, she feels alone, and doesn't want to leave Creasy. The sounds we hear during this scene are suspenseful, and dramatic: The screaming and crying of Lupita, the shattering of window screens, and the roar of gunshots. <br/><br/>Man on fire, is a thriller / drama film, set in Mexico City, directed by Tony Scott. It was released in October 2004, and is rated 7.7 out of 10. Other films like Man on fire, are Taken directed by Pierre Morel. Taken, however, is like many of the cliché films I mentioned before, it is more about the action than the emotions of the characters. Liam Neeson who plays Brian Mills, father of the kidnapped girl Kim, never shows any fear or hesitation, and is unconvincingly right all the time. He doesn't have to do much to get the people involved to fess up, whereas Creasy has to torture them to the point of intense pain to get any answers out of them. <br/><br/>Tony Scott uses a lot of slow motion in Man on fire to increase the tension, and suspense, and make everything a bit more serious. We can see more of the characters reactions from this, and how they respond. Using slow motion as he does, is really effective, as it makes the audience's hearts' stop beating, we feel as if we are in that situation, and too find ourself panicking. <br/><br/>I think that man on fire, is a really good film, and would defiantly recommend it to a friend. The thrill we get from watching it, and the emotions that it makes us feel, are far from fake. We feel the same as what the characters do, and can't help but let the film effect us. The acting from all of the characters has no flaws, and although the camera is a bit shaky, and fast changing at times, I don't think that the film would work without it. The violence in this film, is a reflection of Creasy's past life, and his love for Pita, and makes the audience wonder about his past. This film is easy to follow, unlike many action films, and the uniqueness of this film is what makes it so amazing. 10/10."

"KineticSeoul","7","0","1","16 October 2010"," Tad bit tedious at times and lacks a bit of substance, still gritty good
","This movie is basically about a man with nothing to lose, trying to save a girl that got kidnapped for ransom. Sure it does have some over the top sequences, but overall it was a pretty realistic movie. Denzel Washington is very charismatic in this movie, like his other past movies and is pretty much a badass that will do whatever it takes to save a little girl's life. The plot starts off pretty well and the violence that is done upon the bad guys in this is more than satisfying. But I couldn't help but get bored a few times, cause it feels like body count after body count with the main character Creasy(Denzel Washington) tracking down up bad guy, gets information and moves on to the next bad guy. Which I wouldn't really complain about if it didn't come off as a tad bit boring and dull. It also feels formulaic sometimes as well, but I did like the gritty and realistic aspect of the film. Especially enjoyed Creasy getting his hands dirty to reach his goal of finding the little girl. Overall the movie had plenty of potential and could have been a amazing movie about revenge/redemption/kidnapping, but felt it lacked substance and story for a film that is over 140 min. Despite some flaws there is also many positive aspects in this film as well.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"poolandrews","5","0","3","22 May 2010"," Reasonable thriller but far, far, far, far, far, far, far too long.
","Man on Fire starts as troubled ex-special forces agent John Creasey (Denzel Washington) is hired by Lisa (Radha Mitchell) & Samuel (Marc Anthony) as a bodyguard to protect their young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico city. While out with Pita an armed team of gangsters kidnap Pita & seriously injure Creasey, while in hospital recovering from his life threatening wounds the ransom drop goes horribly wrong & a corrupt police official steals the $10 million ransom & the kidnappers nephew is shot dead in the process. Everyone is unhappy & the kidnappers kill Pita in retribution, Lisa & Samuel are distraught while Creasey when he finds out swears revenge on those who arranged the kidnapping or profited from it. Creasey tools himself up with some serious firepower & sets his sights on the kidnappers, people will die...<br/><br/>This American British co-production was produced & directed by Tony Scott with both Michael Bay & Antoine Fuqua turning it down, as straight ahead action revenge thriller Man on Fire is alright but there are one or two glaring problems that prevent it from an unreserved recommendation. The biggest problem for me is the just shy of two & a half hour running time, to be honest it's a fairly simple story & somehow the makers have stretched to breaking point. If you examine the film not that much happens, man meets girl, girl is all cute & stops him from committing suicide & binge drinking, girl gets kidnapped, man loses it & wants revenge, there are one or two minor twists about double crosses but basically that's it & it takes up to the fiftieth minute before Pita is kidnapped. Now while the build-up is alright & obviously a lot of time is spent on the ever growing relationship between Creasey & Pita it does get a little tiring & at times they seem like an old married couple with the young Pita coming across like a seasoned psychologist at times, to me the friendship was getting a little weird at times. Man on Fire is slow, very slow. I also hated the ending, the twist that Pita is still alive sort of dilutes everything that has gone before, all the emotion & blood spilt is sort of tainted with the revelation & in an otherwise gritty & uncompromising film seems like an attempt at some sort of happy ending where the cute little kid survived. It felt wrong. Having said that it's a solid enough thriller, the whole revenge plot is a solid base, the character's are good & the running time means they are fleshed out to sometimes unnecessary lengths & there are one or two fairly brutal moments.<br/><br/>I hated the way man on Fire was shot, the quick editing, the bleached mess out with colours, the shaky hand held look, the twitchy camera & generally the style of Man on Fire is everything that I hate about modern action films all rolled into one. This is an eyesore as far as I am concerned & it becomes frustrating to watch. Although not that graphic there's a fair bit of violence including shoot-outs & a couple of torture scenes. There's a couple of exploding cars, a crashed car & an exploding nightclub but little in the way of spectacular set-pieces as it goes for a more low key gritty more realistic if you will feel. This is actually a remake of the Italian French co-produced film Man on Fire (1987) with both film being based on the novel by A.J. Quinnell.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $70,000,000 this has good production values the Mexican locations are used quite nicely but the look of the film is just horrible but that's down to editing & film-making techniques. The acting is good, Denzel is good as usual in a role originally offered to the likes of Robert De Niro, Will Smith, Tom Cruise & Bruce Willis who all turned it down. Marlon Brando was the original choice to play Rayburn but Christopher Walken is always a safe bet although he is rather wasted in a bit part role.<br/><br/>Man on Fire is a decent enough action thriller that simply goes on for too long & a cop out ending where the kid lives doesn't help either. Overall if you have two & a half hours to waste then Man on Fire is violent enough & is alright but it does have flaws."
"screenman","6","0","2","22 April 2010"," A Waste of Washington
","There have been so many action thrillers made in the last 20 years or so that it must be getting increasingly hard to come up with something original. 'Man On Fire' is a case in point.<br/><br/>Basically, this movie is a montage of all the familiar elements meshed together, presumably in the hope that collectively they cannot fail. I have encountered this phenomenon in other movies, and they induce a strange sense of de-ja-vu whilst watching.<br/><br/>So let's see; we have the burnt-out expert (Washington) who's taken to the bottle, but is coaxed out of retirement for that 'special' job. That's a Bruce Willis speciality. Then there's the 'wiseman' (Walken), the goodbuddy who understands all of his problems but sticks by him, and also supplies his professional needs (read weapons) whilst opening any official doors. Then there's the inevitable sleazeball, here played so oleaginously by Mickey Rourke, that I expect to see a slime trail when he walks. There's the innocents - this time a mummy (Rada) and oh-so-saccharine-sweet young daughter (Fanning). And of course; there's the expendables - about a dozen unpleasant dead-men-walking.<br/><br/>Does it work? not a jot.<br/><br/>Washington - of whom I'm a great fan - is positively wasted in this pedestrian predictable role. He's an ex-government assassin offered a supposedly sleeper job of bodyguarding a young girl from risk of ransom kidnap in Latin America. Inevitably, she is kidnapped, but he goes down fighting, only surviving multiple gunshots by a hair's breadth. There's a cock-up in the ransom pay-off whilst he is convalescing, and the bad guys murder the girl. Or so we believe.<br/><br/>Time for some payback.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie entails a rather Spielberg-sweet relationship evolving between the girl and her bodyguard during which he and she are frequently unchaperoned in each other's bedrooms, and also at the swimming-pool where she is in swimsuit. Some scenes almost seem to hint at paedoplilia. I can't imagine any responsible mother allowing such intimacy between her daughter and a complete stranger, the only thing known about his character being that he is a ruthlessly violent state murderer. He becomes her de-facto uncle and so her 'death' is personal (yawn).<br/><br/>The second half of the movie entails Washington unravelling the conspiracy and bumping-off all concerned.<br/><br/>You can see 'Rambo'; you can see 'Death Wish'; you can see 'Bodyguard' and probably several others. At one point, the mother - played by Rada Mitchell - throws a tantrum on hearing that her daughter is lost, and orders all the security bods out of her house. The line and its delivery is lifted neat and clean straight out of 'Pitch Black' in which she also co-starred, ordering the other survivors away when she realises her skipper is doomed. Check it out if you don't believe me.<br/><br/>Looking at the cast list - Washington, Mitchell, Rourke, Walken, Fanning et al; you might be persuaded that this is really going to drive. Don't be fooled. It's tack. What's worse, the whole movie is riddled with silly little flashbacks and split-second asides, making all the more irritating than entertaining.<br/><br/>Daftest of all; the kid isn't dead. Despite the fact that the villains have claimed she is. Despite the fact that they've stopped negotiating; she's still alive all along. Not only that, her own father is involved in the kidnapping plot!.<br/><br/>I'll stop there. It's nowhere near as daft as 'Flightplan', but it's daft enough. Washington demonstrates that you can have a great deal of smoke without so much as a spark.<br/><br/>Go for 'The Pelican Brief'."
"Bob_the_Hobo","10","0","1","4 April 2010"," Amazing Revenge film, one of the best I've ever seen
","I saw Taken not too long ago, with a friend of mine who suggested Man On Fire, which had a similar plot. Loved both, but Man On Fire was definitely better.<br/><br/>John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is an alcoholic with the type of past he doesn't want to think about anymore. (as is evidenced when he keeps hearing/saying ""No more killing"") Creasy is given a bodyguard job from his friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken). The job details looking after a girl named Pita (Dakota Fanning). Her parents (Marc Anthony & Rahda Mitchell) are afraid of the recent amounts of kidnappings in their home in Mexico City.<br/><br/>Of course the inevitable happens, and Creasy goes after Pita's kidnappers with an incredible rage. ""I'm gonna kill them all"" he says, and as he does, we feel for this washed up old mercenary.<br/><br/>I haven't liked any of Tony Scott's films as much as I liked Man On Fire. The entirety is a relentless look at the character of Creasy, who we never like the way we like Liam Neeson's character from Taken. Creasy is beat up and always inches from breaking point. But when we see Creasy's breaking point and the power he unleashes with it, we have to applaud, and maybe laugh. (i.e. the anus & bomb scene) <br/><br/>I would've given Denzel an Oscar for his role. Everyone else is outstanding, Dakota Fanning gave a haunting scream that keeps playing over in Creasy's mind. Walken is outstanding (he always is), and Mickey Rourke's three and a half scenes were great. <br/><br/>It's a powerful story about revenge, and it's one of the best movies I've ever seen."
"Hitchcoc","6","0","2","25 March 2010"," Garden Variety Bloodbath!
","About half the movies I see these days start with a great premise and manage to get us involved, then they can't seem to add anything. This is, of course, the story of another man with more baggage than Samsonite who begins to turn his life around when he meets a cute young girl played by Dakota Fanning, for whom he becomes the father she's never really had. Obviously, she is going to be kidnapped and he's going to have to seek revenge (it's all on the disk packaging). I have to agree with the critics when it come to the downfall of this movie. It's one act of violence after another. Of course, these are the sleaziest people on the face of the earth. We can comfortably say they deserve what they get. But it is a calculated bloodbath with creative ways to make people suffer that puts in the realm of sadism. No matter if the child may have been brutally murdered, Denzel Washington's character can't be embraced because he is almost inhuman. Anyway, it is no more than I expected. Washington does what he can with the script and the direction, but as a human being he is really a sorry case."

","The story is like (Beauty and The Beast) meets (The Count of Monte Cristo) with a third act that carries a twist which could stand for a different concept about revenge. Although the rage and insistence that the revenge creates put this man on fire, even burned him, but it managed eventually to secure a fire escape for this beast (Creasy / Cristo), and, surprisingly this time, his Beauty as well, to represent a reprisal, or a revival, more than just another - so customary - retortion. And by that, it discovers a new catchy talent in the revenge's value where it can bring who or what we avenge for back to life.<br/><br/>Tony Scott did it fine. Maybe too fine as he never did before. It's surely one climax for him as a director. His video clip style reaches a new sky this time. The thing is that his crazy technique clicked. And unlike movies like (Domino - 2005), it was so perfect to tell this story in specific, pulling off expressing it whether sensitively or violently. He could put simple yet genius touches here and there, taking his style, rather This style, to the next level. For instance, seeing the dead girl as a miserable ghost to comment on how she was a victim of everybody's greed and treachery, recalling some memories while some events related only by the lead's inner pain, seeing the lead bleeding in the swimming pool / dying out of sadness, or putting a shot from the end in the beginning; where Washington, in a second, is about to die in a car while the scene of entering the city in another car; as the forewords indicate the aftermaths. All of these moments consolidated the special character of the movie, invested the video clip for embodying stream of consciousness, and exalted this genre commercial movie to be something to explore and enjoy like a good book.<br/><br/>The soundtrack wasn't less interesting. There are some effective music tracks to complete this impassioned ocean of images. From classic music and Operas (Chopin, Debussy's Clair de Lune, or Nessun Dorma from ""Turandot"") that touch the lead's noble and sublime side through his relationship with the child, even during his revenge. To Latino tracks that mirror the atmosphere. Ending with loud stuff to embody the lead's crazy beastly condition while his crusade of a rage. And to top it all, Carlos Varela's, with no music, version of ""Una Palabra"" while handing over the kid which I bet it won the viewers' hearts. Then Harry Gregson-Williams & Lisa Gerrard's ""Creasy Dies"" as the highest end this movie could get. By the way, after one year, the Indian remake (Ek Ajnabee) would make something I thought the original missed; putting an especially written-for-the-movie song to distinguish the man and the kid's relationship.<br/><br/>However, while being wonderful, sometimes great, it's still nothing but nonsense. The awful plot holes, the many unanswered questions, and the big unreal action scenes depreciate the movie considerably. And as thoughtless mistakes, it was an insult to a movie that speaks visually to your thinking. For instance, the movie said nothing about how the dad was involved in the kidnapping. It was the insurance money, but after 2 viewings I knew it from a friend's guesswork! His suicide looked absurd. Keeping the girl alive makes no sense at all, ""I'm a businessman"" isn't an enough justification, and since the kidnapper is that businessman, why he didn't negotiate earlier?! How to execute so easily a known governmental official naked with a big bomb under a capital's bridge among many crowded streets, and in the daylight, let alone GETTING AWAY WITH IT?? That's too-unbelievable-it's-dumb! And why they didn't kill the lead right after handing over the child?? Well, the answer for all of that and more is one: it is nonsense. Namely another mindless and unrealistic revenge movie. Entertaining, yes, but not as high as what its expressive language reached sometimes.<br/><br/>As always, I hated the violence, the foul language, and Dakota Fanning! She's supposed to be a cute child, but what I saw was a thirty-something Julia Roberts! She's supposed to be spontaneously infantile, but Fanning is always acting as a woman, annoying woman! And finally we're supposed to love her, be in mourning for her, though I was so unhappy that she was alive at last. Look at her talking to Washington in their last scene; this is absolutely NO 8-year-old child!<br/><br/>Mexico City looked like a very evil, poor, and rotten place. Scott drew it with live colors and dirt. It was just streets of corrupted policemen, politicians, even rich people, and shanty town that swarms with drugs, weapons and dirty money. In a word: a hell of crime. So he had to write at the end ""Thanks to it, it is a special place"". It reminded me with (Mr. Magoo - 1997) when they apologized for the blind people after its end. This ""blind"" vision is natural part of any nonsense. Where everything is used for the bigger purpose, which's here making the lead find his purgation with the lowest persons, by the lowest ways, in the lowest places. Despite how low that may sound for some!<br/><br/>Still the best about this movie is the way its story was told. (Man on Fire) is a memorably proficient sonic and visual experience. It's another revenge story, but in not another rampant video clip for Tony Scott. Here what Oliver Stone does with serious issues had been done with droll stuff to uplift it. Maybe, just maybe, Michael Bay would be watching and learn himself a lesson!"

","Not that I've seen every revenge film of all time, I don't think. But this film is SO good, I still feel that this sweeping statement is true. It's an amazing film - Tony Scott knows how to make good looking stylish beautifully shot cinema. <br/><br/>Washington, has many a time, really annoyed me in his movies. He seems to do the same thing every time, he doesn't have much range. This script had his name written all over it, though, and no one could have portrayed the damaged, depressed alcoholic as well as he did in this film. His calm persona is brilliant, the dead behind the eyes look that he had in all of those awful dramas he's done in the past now make sense. It seems to me, he was destined to play this part - it is him, he is it. He's brilliant. I doubt he'll ever match this performance.<br/><br/>The story is excellent. Predictable and a bit disappointing when they reveal the twist, but to mark this film down for that would be a shame. It's not about twists and turns and all that over complicated rubbish, this is a story of sacrifice, revenge and love. <br/><br/>It's awesome - watch it and enjoy."
"Quinoa1984","7","0","1","12 June 2009"," Scott goes to town - and it works
","In April or 2004 there were three big revenge films out in theaters: this film, Man on Fire, Kill Bill: Volume 2, and the Punisher. Out of those three, Tony Scott's film, a remake of a small 80s thriller, rested right in the middle. It might have been as ambitious as Tarantino's film, but thankfully was nowhere near as atrocious as that ""other"" movie. In this Denzel Washington is a bad dude, but one with principles that stretch to the point of no return as he goes to town to find those bastards that took away the girl he was protecting (Dakota Fanning). It's a visual stroke of, well, almost genius perhaps: Scott is into shooting stuff in such a way that we're in a daze a good deal of the time, and he flips the screw on us in such a way that we only know what to expect in some of the characterizations. <br/><br/>But this is Washington digging into a character perhaps just as irredeemable than his character in Training Day- certainly not with too much more range- and yet we end up identifying with this troubled, brutal man because of something Washington puts in Creasy: quiet (or not son quiet) resolve, perhaps? Certainly Scott's approach is daring enough to keep interest, and indeed Man on Fire has become one of those movies that I have seen several times on television. I recognize it's not exceptional or even too great of a revenge picture. Yet I also recognize a craftsmanship to it that doesn't just go for broke but breaks the bank into a bunch of pieces. It's a glorious but decadent excess of style, like with those flagrant subtitles popping up or those fades and dissolves that do backflips on one another. <br/><br/>It's a gritty film shot like on a mescaline trip. It's also got some heavy-duty backup (Giancarlo Giannini, Christopher Walken, Marc Anthony- yes, Marc Anthony), and some really grisly action scenes that reveal as much about the lengths to which Creasy will go as much as the director and writer themselves. It's not something I'd say is at the top of any list, or that I'd immediately rush out to buy. But it's got a magnetic quality for all of its ugly bits and pieces. It's about something, which can be said more than other Tony Scott freak-outs major (Domino) and more whimper style (Taking of Pelham 123)."

Denzel W. is great, Dakota Fanning is great, and the ending is something no one in his right mind will ever forget. This may be Tony Scott's greatest work and is a must-see.

","This movie had only 1 ""cringe"" moment, and that is when Lisa (the wife) says to Samuel (the husband) she founds out has been involved ""I love you! Tell me the truth!"" That ""I love you!"" is so out of place it is unbelievable. Whoever I watched the movie with (and I watched it 3 times in different company) ALL cringed about that.<br/><br/>About the end - Creasy feels that he is dying from his wounds (current and unhealed previous ones) so that is probably why he agrees to give himself up (also maybe to die in an act of redemption). The only thing that he could have done is plant a bomb on himself in the same way he executed Fuentes, and take a few of the bad guys with him (now that would be likely for his mentality IMHO).<br/><br/>All things considered, this movie is pretty great - I gave it a 9/10 overall. It is hard to escape the conclusion that Creasy's way of handling the ""proffesional"" criminals is the only efficient way to do it.<br/><br/>""He will deliver more justice in 1 weekend than your courts in 10 years."""
"dead47548","9","0","3","8 January 2008"," Surprisingly phenomenal.
","This is indeed a film that is expertly split into two parts. The first half does a flawless job of developing the relationship between Creasy and Pita and making us feel for these characters. We enjoy watching them interact together, are so excited to see them developing such a strong father/daughter-esquire bond that it completely tears us apart when Pita is taken away. Scott and Denzel do a brilliant job of making us feel Creasy's pain when she gets taken away. It's one of the most emotional scenes of all time, as we see Pita in tears but desperately want her to run before she is taken.<br/><br/>This drives the substantial second half, which is a film of emotionless revenge. Creasy's need for vengeance is made completely understandable and we want nothing but for him to succeed in the brutal murders of every person who was involved. It drives some of the best and most stylized action of all time, in a journey that is more than just. We want him to succeed so much it hurts. What I found most interesting about the film was Creasy's transformation from beginning to end. He starts off as a man who doesn't care about anything in the world. He's completely indifferent and doesn't care whether he lives or dies. But it's this little girl who completely brightens up his life and teaches him how to love again, and that's what makes it so arduous for the audience when she is taken away. Pita's kidnapping not only stole her physical body, but it took back Creasy's ability to love. He once again becomes a creature of sheer pain and relentless furiosity in one of the most amazing quests ever put on film.<br/><br/>The ending is one of the most bittersweet of all time. On one hand we rejoice in Pita's life and her safe return to her mother. But on the other hand we are in sheer pain as we know what Creasy must do, and that their beautiful reunion will be very short lived. The performances are simply excellent. Denzel is on top form, as always and this is the film that showed me that Dakota Fanning really is a great and underrated actress. Watching her cry is one of the most painful experiences of a film for me."

","Big name celebrities, and one cute little girl. What do you get when you mix some of the movie business' big names (Giancarlo Gianni, Chris Walken, and Denzel) in a movie with an up-and-coming star whose acting is that of an experienced veteran of Hollywood? One of the most electrifying movie experiences ever.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the line, Man on Fire made me want to kill the people who captured Pita not because they made me angry, but because Denzel Washington delivers a brutal performance that would make Kevin Costner cry until he made his OWN water-world. In this film, young Pita Ramos is kidnapped by members of a gang only known as ""La Hermandad"" or ""The Brotherhood"", and John Creasy is the only man who can stop them and get the little girl back, and he intends to rip Mexico City apart to do so.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays John W. Creasy, a washed-up FBI agent who's soul purpose in life is to drink himself to death. His friend Rayburn, played by Christopher Walken, manages to get Creasy a job as a bodyguard for the Ramos family in Mexico City, Mexico. He is ordered to protect Pita Ramos, the daughter of Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) who is played by Dakota Fanning. Creasy begins to form a bond he long tried to avoid with Pita. Soon, they become almost best friends. One day, Creasy takes Pita to her piano lessons and a firefight between off-duty police officers and the kidnappers ensues, leaving Creasy mortally wounded. Pita, who attempts to revive Creasy from his unconscious state, is then kidnapped by La Hermandad. Creasy is taken to a hospital some time later by police, where he is automatically charged with murder of the off-duty policemen.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Samuel Ramos and Lisa Ramos (played by Radha Mitchell) speak with the kidnappers and set up a ransom pickup. At the drop, a nephew of the kidnapper is killed during an ambush by unknown assailants, leaving the man only known as The Voice, no choice but to kill Pita as promised if Samuel's agreement to him was voided. Creasy is told by Rayburn that Pita has been killed by The Voice, and his crusade begins.<br/><br/>All in all, great movie. The photography artists went a little over the top with some of the effects but it adds to the gritty, kind of dying feel to the movie. It's almost as if Creasy's feelings are projecting onto the film. The action is indeed the best part of the film, it made me cheer when he ""questioned"" his victims of La Hermandad. The end was very touching, it made ME cry and I don't cry that easy. If you don't have it, get it. PERIOD."

","Man on Fire is the most griping films I have ever seen, I am erged to buy all of A.J Quinnels books because of this one. The pure emotion is what kept me reading, you can't keep your eyes from the page. I often found my self reading pages over to make sure that i absorbed every last piece of information. The character Creasy was portrayed perfectly in the film, probably due to the astonishing acting by Denzel Washington.<br/><br/>*Start spoiler warning* The story follows Creasy (Denzel Washington), a worn out mercenary bored of life. His best friend Guido (Rayburn) (Christopher Walken) who he had spent his army and merc days with, saw this and got him a job. Creasy spoke to him about him getting the job for him and knew that only reason he got him it was to stop him from blowing his head off.<br/><br/>The job was Being a body guard to a young girl, Pinta (Peta) (Dakota Fanning). Creasy and Pinta had gotten off on to a rocky start, Creasy believing that Pinta thought that he was her new toy. They grew to love each other, and Pinta showed Creasy that it was alright to live again. But when she got kidnapped Creasys hard training and furious anger flamed out to kill any one who took part anyone who profited and looks at him.<br/><br/>This is the point where the book and the film differ to a huge extent. In the book Creasy goes to Gozo to train and a get fit enough to take on the powerful people who kidnapped, raped and killed Pinta. This continues to show the relationships between Creay and the people of Gozo, Creasy even falls in love with a woman whose first intent was to use Creasy as a way of getting pregnant. But in the film he gets out of a hospital bed heavily wounded from the shots he took during the kidnapping (the gunshots happen in the book too but Creasy stays and fights for his life) to get a vast amount guns and kill everyone.<br/><br/>In the book Pinta was raped and killed, But in the film that did not happen and she survived unharmed, as a girl dead was worth nothing to the kidnapper. In both Creasy dies but under completely different circumstances. He is taken by the kidnapper in the film and dies in the car taking him to probably be tortured, this is a heart wrenching ending where most people would have to fight back the tears. The same goes for the book, Creasy had just killed the man who raped and killed Pinta, but was shot in the shoulder hitting a major artery, He died in the hands of his best friend Guido. The funeral had many people there, and there were many morning in the hills of Gozo.<br/><br/>*End Spoiler warning* One of the best book I have read, I prefer the book to the film, but the film is still AMAZING. Its a must see.<br/><br/>Elis"

","As many of us learn during our journey, friends often help us find not what we think we want, but indeed what we need. So it is for ""John Creasy""(Denzel Washington) who is helped by his life long friend, ""Ray""(Christopher Walken), to find his path to redemption, when Ray encourages Creasy to stick around and take a job as a bodyguard for ""Pita Ramos""(Dakota Fanning). Dakota Fanning is excellent and on equal par with Washington and Walken. The personal portrayal that Washington gives, is so down to earth realistic, that it sent chills up and down my spine. Those without the personal experiences to relate to the Creasy character will most likely miss the point of his journey and just assume it is all about revenge. There is nothing that can be done for them, as the truth is too far from their reach. For the rest of us, we have the path to redemption of John ""Creasy bear"" Creasy."

I would have to disagree with this, because I thought Denzel's character had a lot of depth. I would also like to add that Man on Fire really never gets boring, and you will never find yourself falling asleep. This movie blends action and plot line well.<br/><br/>I would also like to talk about a poor point of this movie. The editing was interesting for the first hour, and then got annoying.

The storyline, although used from an older movie, is absolutely amazing. Denzel Washington plays his part in such a remarkable way. A scene that always gets to me because it is so moving is where Marc Anthony, Samuel, tells his wife,Lisa, that he was involved in the kidnapping of his own daughter. That part is acted out so well by all three characters, including Denzel. When Lisa tells Creasy to kill him or she will, all her pain is felt by the audience. I really believed each characters emotions in this movie. The twist at the end makes it an even more moving film.

This movie digs deep into the serious problem they have with human trafficking in Mexico.

","To begin with, this is an incredible movie! We have come to expect extremely high standards of Denzel Washington and once again he delivers all that and more. His amazing performance is coupled with that of Dakota. The film has employed unusual cinematography with flashbacks and memories which conveys Creasy's emotions very well. I especially enjoyed the ending with the image of the mountain as this is echoed first very early in the film. I think the viewer is drawn to Creasy because of his vigilantism and ultimately his sacrifice. We have to admire his pure determination at the retrieval of Dakota by any means possible. <br/><br/>It is amazing how people prefer to follow a hero with a major weakness or flaw. In this case Creasy's drinking is his vice and this is somewhat relevant to many people. We enjoy watching how he overcomes his weakness and perhaps imagine us doing the same. The 'fallen hero' theme is among the most popular in film-making and this film is a perfect example. To those who have yet to see this movie, it comes very highly recommended! <br/><br/>""He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals."" - Rayburn"

I don't know if that is a real figure, or one made up for the movie's story. <br/><br/>Creasy's friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken) convinces him to take a job as bodyguard of 9 year old Pita (Dakota Fanning), hoping it will help Creasy find some meaning in life.

Creasy and Pita are ambushed with the help of crooked off-duty cops, Creasy is shot and almost dead, Pita is kidnapped.

Creasy had in fact warmed up to Pita, and became a ""man on fire"" with revenge for her death, systematically searching down and killing those in the network. But he finds out Pita is in fact alive, and that her own dad was behind her kidnapping, along with his lawyer, as a way to collect on the kidnapping insurance and pay off debts.

","When I first heard of this film, I thought it was going to be one of those pointless action movies. The plot outlines made it seem like that also, but i was wrong. In my opinion, this is Denzel Washington's best performance. He plays John W. Creasy, a former CIA Agent who is now a drunk. He is a bodyguard for a young girl who shows him that it is alright to live again. She is kidnapped and Creasy is left for dead. After this, we see a different side to Creasy. He is savage, cruel, and he kills without mercy. Dakota Fanning plays Lupita Martin Ramos, the victim of the kidnapping. This is by far Dakota's best performance, better than War of the Worlds and Hide and Seek. The ending is a bit sad, but I liked it.

"shanfloyd","7","0","1","26 March 2006"," Well acted and written, but overtly stylish in cinematography.
","Depending upon the story, screenplay and most of all, acting, I could easily give this film 9 out of 10. Released more or less at the same time with a horde of good 'revenge' movies, ""Man on Fire"" shines bright with its linear but bold basic plot, turned into a smart screenplay with measured amounts of action and emotion and with some catchy dialogues as well. Denzel Washington again delivers a powerful performance right from the beginning. Dakota Fanning is indeed a promising starlet, and she developed a unexpectedly nice chemistry with Washington. The supporting cast are also worth mentioning, especially Radha Mitchell whose character changed with a sharp contrast during the course of the film. I personally think the talent of Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke are basically wasted in this film.<br/><br/>But the film's technically superior visual style is quite annoyingly overdone, one must say that. I don't mind the use of color filters and high contrast (I even think they're used better than in 'Traffic' too) but what annoyed me is the random use of shaky visionaries and montage-influenced editing which got tiresome after a while. I think Tony Scott is eager to develop his own trademark by using that style but here he could easily avoid its overuse."

He is as talented and charismatic as they come. I would like to see it get no less than an 8 on the IMDb ratings. It certainly deserves it. <br/><br/>Mickey Rourke played the ""rat lawyer"" effortlessly. Walken was solid support role providing a tether to Creasy's turbulent and apparently regretful past. Mark Anthony surprised me with a fairly good performance opposite a presence like Denzel's, albeit he had little camera time.<br/><br/>I remember when it was released in theaters, and it didn't get much publicity in the Northeast at least.

"The_Void","7","0","3","12 January 2006"," Above the usual Denzel Washington vehicle
","There's no denying it, Man on Fire clearly thinks that it's a better film than it is. Tony Scott has obviously tried to make this film appeal to both sets of audiences; namely, those who want to be entertained, and those who want to see 'greatness'. It's safe to say that he hasn't exactly succeeded with this; although it's also safe to say that the movie isn't a complete failure. The film works by presenting two very different halves. We start off with a Leon-esquire plot involving a bodyguard hired to protect a young girl, which then bursts into revenge thriller mode after she is kidnapped. The first half of the movie will appeal more to the 'Oscar' crowd, while the second half is more bent on providing entertainment. I wouldn't say either half is better; the first half is interesting, although it lacks emotion, and the second half is thrilling; but goes out of it's way to show flashy images and Denzel Washington being as nasty as possible. Still, the first half of the film does an excellent job of setting up the second; and considering this is a blockbuster, it's more emotional than you would expect.<br/><br/>I've never been a big fan of Denzel Washington, and it's seems more and more lately that all of his movies are merely vehicles for the 'Oscar winner'. Still, he usually puts in a performance worth watching, and he certainly does that here. Washington's starring role also has the added advantage of the fact that he looks the part he is playing, making the film more believable. Man on Fire has implemented a different way of using subtitles than most films, with the words flashing up all over the screen. I don't usually like gimmicky things like this, but it actually works rather well in this film. Tony Scott is a director that I have come to expect nothing from, as his films are usually made purely for entertainment value, and sometimes don't even deliver that; but Man on Fire is one of his better films over the last few years (although he still hasn't topped 1993's True Romance). The ending of the film is particularly good, and surprisingly emotional as well. I'm not the sort of guy that cries at movies; but I could understand if other people did. On the whole; this isn't a great movie, but it's decent enough and definitely worth viewing. It could have done with being a little shorter, though."

"JCBar","9","0","1","18 August 2005"," Denzel/Dakota are standouts
","'Man on Fire' is a wonderfully crafted movie, with brilliant performances, exciting set pieces, crowd-pleasing scenes, and even some Christian symbolism. Denzel plays a close-to-washed-up 'agent' of some sort who is hired as a bodyguard to Dakota Fanning (in yet another brilliant performance in her short career). Once acquainted with her, they form a bond that is quite affecting.<br/><br/>The movie deals with the kidnapping prevalent in Mexico in recent days, and the actions that well-to-do families must take to ensure the safety of their children. Denzel forms a relationship with Dakota, and when the dreaded occurrence happens (as anyone who's seen the ads knows), he goes on a rampage, oblivious to any consequences.<br/><br/>The acting by the two is flawless. Although I'm not Spanish speaking, I'm told by those who are that Dakota sounded exactly like one who had been raised there, and that Denzel spoke just like a gringo who just might make a mistake or two as he spoke it; regardless, to me they both seemed authentic speaking the language. And they both turned out excellent and believable performances in either language.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was one of the best I had seen that year, and rated it an 'A' initially (in my own little rating system). On reflection, there were however some incongruities. For one, Denzel's wardrobe supply was baffling  for a small suitcase, he seemed to have a lot of changes; the violence Denzel engages in is over the top  killing one person even after he has gotten the information he needs, and of course the explosive he plants in another; the ease in which he goes from place to place in Mexico City; and of course the somewhat puzzling subtitles of a word here and there. It's also almost amusing to see how this washed up former agent returns to being a 'super soldier' when forced to hunt down these criminals. But overall, the movie was very entertaining if you can get past some of the graphic violence. For all that, I would still rate it a 9 here simply for entertainment value and for the way in which Tony Scott directed."

Washington, who is always watchable, sometimes astonishing is in pretty good form here. His character Creasy is a tortured soul with a standard-issue shady special-ops past. At the start of the movie Creasy is at booze-soaked rock-bottom, with nothing to live for. His old comrade Rayburn (Christopher Walkern in a nicely understated performance) sets Creasy up with a body guard gig, which has him protecting pre-teen Pita, played by Dakota Fanning, who has the same effortless qualities that Jodie Foster and Natalie Portman displayed in their early days. I can see Dakota following these ladies out into adult movie roles - you really get a sense of a major star in the making. <br/><br/>The first third of the movie plays out their burgeoning relationship, Creasy rediscovers his humanity, and a reason to go on living, but watching these early scenes, you know that we are on borrowed time, sooner or later Creasy will have the carpet pulled from under him and the rest of the movie will be about how he deals with it.<br/><br/>I'm not spoiling anything by telling you that Pita is kidnapped, though this kidnapping movie has a few unusual twists - writer Brian Helgeland's plot building skills are as evident here as they were in Mystic River, L.A. Confidential and Conspiracy Theory. While films similar in subject like ""Proof of Life"" and the 1990 ""Revenge"" are patchy works at best, Helgeland's script is a fine lesson in pacing, placement and palaver, it never falters.<br/><br/>The final third of the movie takes you on a trail of bloody revenge that never flinches or compromises on its own brutal remorseless promises. The revenge movie seems to have finally earned its parole, having been out of favour in Hollywood for most of the last fifteen years. The good news is that time inside (or restricted to the shelves of video libraries and late night TV) seems to have mellowed the genre a little, because while ""Kill Bill"" and ""Man on Fire"" have a great old time reaping sheaves of bad guys, they both manage to bring you to a quiet place where your suddenly forced to reflect on the passing mayhem.<br/><br/>""Man on Fire"" didn't set the box office alight - but here is a movie that is highly recommended both as a good old fashion revenge flick, and as a fine dramatic work."

","This is my first review on IMDb.com. I'm not a professional reviewer and my English may lack a bit, but I will, as a humble guy from all the way up in Norway, give my honest opinion about this movie.<br/><br/>When I saw the label 'Man on fire' in my home video store, the first thought that came to my mind was that ""this is just yet another cheap action movie with flames, gunshots, and massive car wrecking, ONLY. But I can promise you that I got massively surprised when I started watching it, and I didn't regret renting the DVD -- not at all!<br/><br/>First of all I just have to give compliments to Dakota Fanning, which is a really talented child actress with great personality. She does this incredible good acting and must really have loads of skills and talent running in her blood! To be that young, and that talented in acting, is awesome to watch!<br/><br/>This move really plays on the viewers' feelings, but those are warm feelings that we should feel more of in this cold world. The subject of this movie also makes it more acceptable to overdo these feelings a bit -- not to mention the revenge-factor... that actually feels nice to watch, considering the subject.<br/><br/>The subject is very important and is really an eye-opener! Suddenly you think of your own children and family, and can someway identify your self with the horrible feeling of someone you love getting kidnapped for ransom.<br/><br/>This isn't just an action movie, but it is a high quality action movie, in my point of view. It has great cast, music, filming, +++. It grabs you from the minute ONE and all the way to the end. It got this fine transfer from drama to action and back to drama again. A little master piece of an action movie that even your girlfriend may appreciate!<br/><br/>All in all, a very great movie! Definitely worth checking out! I'll buy one for my DVD-collection! This movie, I can see over and over again, and I look forward to see it again!<br/><br/>Happy viewing!"

","What will a man do when he has nothing left? What will a man do when he has been given up on himself, and then the one true thing that lifts him up is taken away, leaving him grasping for that moment of hope, seeking salvation? What will a man do? That is the question Tony Scott asks in this brilliant movie starring Denzel Washington as John Creasy (J.C.), a CIA/undercover agent whose past is too terrible, too grisly, too monstrous that only his friend and colleague Rayburn (a standard Christopher Walken role) can describe. Rayburn says ""A man can be an artist...in anything, food, whatever. It depends on how good he is at it. Creasey's art is death. He's about to paint his masterpiece."" Creasy leaves for Mexico to serve as the bodyguard for Samuel and Lisa (Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell) and their young daughter Pia (a fantastic Dakota Fanning). As Creasy attempts to deal with his demons, Pita takes a liking to the tortured man, and Creasy begins to open up and bond with the young girl.<br/><br/>But kidnappings in Mexico are a regular occurrence among the wealthy and Pita is the perfect target. Kidnappers take Pita on a calm sunny day, leaving Creasy to die on the streets. If only he had because they leave him in a state where he had hope, in the form of a little girl, and they've stolen something from him he hadn't had in many many years: compassion.<br/><br/>The last half of the movie, in gruesome details, follows Creasy as he enacts revenge in a symbol of redemption and salvation, and in the final scene, sacrifice."

","This movie was brilliant. Every now and then, a really great director, a great cast, a great screenwriter come together and make some real movie magic. It doesn't happen at this level very often. I thought this film was almost flawless. I suppose like with everything, you could put it under a microscope and chop it to bits. I think that is the sign of a very poor film ""critic"". Films need to be judged on their own merit, and like in literature ""suspension of disbelief"" is critical. I usually find Tony Scott's flicks way over the top (and I love over the top). This really succeeded, not over the top, right at it. I thought it was great, both technically (the editing I found disorienting the first time that I watched it, but it's positively sublime) and emotionally. WOW!!! Not Academy material, but very much Academy Award worthy.<br/><br/>Now I'm going to make some people really angry. I think it is almost as good as DePalma's Scarface. Not as shocking, and Creasy doesn't swear. But a very honest and violent film made by a very passionate director, written by a genius, and starring a powerful leading man giving an unbelievable performance. The chemistry between Washington and Fanning is amazing. When she gives the St. Jude medallion to him..."

"mhajs","8","0","1","4 May 2005"," A nice idea from Tony Scott.
","***1/2 out of **** <br/><br/>Man On Fire is a movie about kidnapping. Even when the movie begins, we see the titles on screen about how kidnapping takes place in South America. In the beginning of the movie, we meet the character of Denzel Washington, Creasy, a man who served the army and now is looking for a new job. We also meet Ray, character of Chirstopher Walken. Both Walken and Washington are really interesting in the movie. However, we already know these two actors are good and can do a pretty nice job. We must pay attention to the real star of the movie, at least in my opinion, which is, of course, Dakota Fanning. After watching Uptown Girls (2003), I must say Fanning improved a lot. I, now, have four more words for her: great performance, great role! She's not artificial as she is in Uptown anymore, this time she's a child who just wants to be friends with her new bodyguard Creasy. The beginning of the movie is focused entirely on the relationship between Creasy and Pita. She's sweet, pretty, smiles a lot and, as a matter of fact, it's her turn now to make someone smile, as she does with Creasy when they're studying history together and not someone make her smile. She studying to play the piano, but her real passion is to swim. And to improve her skills in order to win in the first place. She tells Creasy she can't win, because she's slow. Creasy says she's not slow, and she answers that she can't make even to the third position, so Creasy tells her that maybe she really is slow. If it was for Uptown, she'd probably order Creasy to shut up and to respect her because he's working for her. But instead of that she does exactly what she was supposed to do in Uptown to make her character nice: smile. So Creasy and Pita train together so she can win at the swimming pool event. So begins their friendship.<br/><br/>But as said before, Man On Fire is a movie about kidnapping. Something wrong happens in the street and Pita is taken away by a Mexican organization and Creasy, shot almost to death laying on the ground is unable to protect her. The group proposes a rescue by asking in return the quantity of 10 million dollars. Something goes wrong again and it is believed now Pita's dead. As we see Creasy restore himself in order to hunt the bad guys, at first, we get a little upset. It gives us the impression that this movie is just another of those old Steven Seagal movies about revenge, about a guy who must kill everyone just because he's moved by anger. It is actually fun to see Washington wasting the bad guys and asking them questions about further details of the organization. But even when that happens, it still feels just as a revenge movie. But something told me Pita was still alive because I can't believe Tony Scott, a great director, just killed the very big star of the movie. And when we find out that's actually true, we see that Man On Fire is worth watching. Because it's not just a revenge movie, but a movie where a man has an objective: save the girl. And he does that very heroic.<br/><br/>I've watched also, another movie of Tony Scott, Spy Game (2001), which I still need to write the review. By watching these two movies, we must agree that the brother of Ridley Scott is a very talented professional. In his movies, he shows us violence, most of the time, crime situations, in a way we understand better how things turn out to be in such countries. In Spy Game we see how the CIA really works and we see also a lot of countries. This time, Man On Fire is entirely focused just in Mexico, but still we see how things happens in there. I haven't watched the other Tony Scott movies, but these two, for me, had the same objectives: show us how crime works in different ways in different places. And that is a very nice idea, so, congratulations, Mr. Scott!<br/><br/>Harry Gregson-Williams is one more time back to give the movie a great score. He also works on the Konami's Metal Gear trilogy video game for the PlayStation, and in both Spy Game and Man On Fire and in the Metal Gear trilogy, he delivers a very good piece of music. With nice soundtrack, a great director, the infinite improvement of a very good actress like Fanning and the presence of two great actors like Washington and Walken, you really got to watch this movie."

He is cool as ice, delivers line perfectly and he was lucky to get to play such a brilliant character as John Creesy. This is an amazing film and I would rate it as a 'must see' for anyone who is not averse to a little blood and action in a film.<br/><br/>This is not a mindless action romp, it is a moving emotional film that explores themes of anger, loss, vengeance and redemption.<br/><br/>It is simply superb in every way.<br/><br/>Please enjoy it soon."

","I thought at times that Tony Scott was trying a little to hard to put ""art"" in his movie,(unnecessary subtitles, MTV-esquire cutscenes,etc.)however that is really a small thing to complain about in the overall film. I loved the time that was spent developing the relationship between the bodyguard and the child. It didn't just jump into rocket launchers and torture. Also the character of the bodyguard was mysterious, yet developed enough to see a seriously dark side of him, which you're just dying to see come out in furious revenge, and you do, and it's totally worth it. I think that Denzel's portrayal of the bodyguard is definitely one of the best ""tough guy's"" ever. It seems to be some sort of secret or something, but this movie is a remake of a 1987 movie starring Scott Glenn as the bodyguard. Christopher Walken was good, but I'm starting to wonder what planet he's from and why he gets weirder and weirder with age."

","And it does...for too long it seems that films have been tainted and ruined by the nice guy syndrome, and do the right thing appeal. This film was a refreshing experience, and registers as one of my favourite films of all time, although that is of no concern to anyone wanting a review. I was impressed by Washingtons display in Training Day, but I personally feel this is his best performance to date, add Walken and his delightful touches and the film already oozes class. Creasy (Washington) is damaged goods,washed up ex military with a drinking habit that makes Oliver Reed look clean. South America seems to have a kidnapping problem, and Creasy needs a job..well what happens next isn't hard to figure out! The story really takes off here however, as we see Creasy develop a strange but loving relationship with his assignment, add the inevitable kidnap, and whala, the film begins. But Creasey isn't your average lay down and die bodyguard...upon proceedings Creasey opens a large can of whoop ass on some pretty bad people...but in a way that is pretty awful, but still leaves you thinking 'yeh they deserved that' Basically if your after one of the best action thrillers this century, id look no further than here, the only thing that annoys me about the whole film is how underrated it is...!!!!

"ablueblueblue777","8","0","1","17 March 2005"," Denzel Washington strikes again.
","This movie is ultimately, in my possibly not so humble opinion, about love. While I suppose the film could be seen as a sinister thing, I think to focus only on the destruction this film mounts would be a mistake: to the contrary, it is the darkness which makes the brightness so much more blinding, a study in the differences between destruction and construction. <br/><br/>I saw the film as a portrait - and a touching one at that. While there was no small measure of violence here, I found the violence not at all gratuitous. I was interested that another viewer saw the film as a throwback to an era when vengeance was cool: It was my impression that the director, or script, or actors, or whatever combination of these conspired to make the film what it was, invite the audience to draw its own conclusions about the place of vengeance in the world, rather than painting it in either strictly glorious or strictly ugly shades: it approached the complexity of life and the essence of love, it painted them in gentle hues on the screen, and then walked away to let them be."
"bartverberne16","7","0","1","13 March 2005"," Depressed macho saves the film
","Man on fire is an okay movie about the sweet revenge of a seriously angry bodyguard.<br/><br/>A positive point of the film is Tony Scotts obvious touch to the style. He managed to give the film more character by using a creepy, modern style. It is as if the viewer is brought closer to the scene of action. In this respect, Scott has done a good job. Also, a clear positive point is the great casting and performance of Denzel Washington. I am not a Denzel fan, but in silent, image driven characters I think he is one of the best. Training Day is a good example. In Man on Fire, Washington manages to attain a certain deprived attitude, as if he has gone through a history of violence. He is silent yet revealing. It are these elements of the movie that kept my attention to the somewhat simple story.<br/><br/>Negative points of the film are easily recognized also. For instance the length. 146 min is a long time, especially if you realize that in the first half hour one can make predictions about the coming two. The length also tends the viewer to become annoyed by Scotts style, which is totally unnecessary. I gave the film a good 7 out of 10 since it is just not special enough to report an 8."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","0","1","13 March 2005"," He's on fire alright!
","The story is your average revenge action story. Any moment you would expect Steven Seagal or Chuck Norris to walk on screen. But ""Man on Fire"" is made with so much profession that it takes the movie to an incredibly high level. Tony Scott's directing and Denzel Washingtons performance make this movie one of the best action movies of the past couple of years and perhaps the most underrated movie of 2004.<br/><br/>I never really have been a big fan of Tony Scott. Sure he made the masterpiece and most underrated movie in movie history (in my opinion) ""True Romance"" but his much praised other movies like ""Top Gun"", ""The Last Boy Scout"", ""Crimson Tide"" and ""Enemy of the State"" always left me quite cold. ""Spy Game"" already was a better movie but also wasn't 'quite it'. It now seems that ""Spy Game"" was just a dress rehearsal for ""Man on Fire"". Everything that was still missing in ""Spy Game"" to make it a great movie is present in ""Man on Fire"".<br/><br/>Denzel Washington truly is on fire. He is perfectly cast and he is not afraid to show that he has gotten older. It honestly is an Oscar worthy performance. Christopher Walken of course always is phenomenal and his role in this movie is truly good.<br/><br/>The action in the movie is shocking and very straight forward. There is no mercy for anyone and all the bad guys die but not before they have all suffered in a terrible way. This movie is not suitable for just everyone! Also you must be able to stand the typically Christian Wagner movie editing.<br/><br/>Because of the very high level of professionalism you're tend to forgive the tiny flaws that are in the movie. I'm even willing to forgive the 'Hollywood' ending this time because of it.<br/><br/>""Man on Fire"" is a real tough movie with hard action and violence. Therefor it is not suitable to everyone but fans of the genre will most certainly not be disappointed. An underrated 2004 movie and a must see but like I said before, it's not a movie for everyone.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"MLDinTN","7","0","2","8 March 2005"," The last hour was good and had some suspense...
","the problem was not much happens in the first hour. This is definitely a movie that is too long and needed to be edited to 105 minutes. The first hour basically shows Creasy who at first is cold toward Pita learn to care for her and be her friend. He takes over a parenting role when her parents are absent. This should have only taken 30 minutes to show. Finally, we get some action when Pita is kidnapped. Although, I still don't buy the fact that Creasy still lives after being shot in the chest a couple of times.<br/><br/>After recovering, Creasy is on a mission to kill all who was involved in Pita's kidnapping and death. He uses a license tag number to begin the hunt and gets help from a reporter who also wants to expose the corruptness of the police. He tracks down those who were involved and torchers and kills them. Some of the torcher scenes, while not shown, still make you cringe because it looks like it would really hurt.<br/><br/>Then the twist, which I guessed before hand, is that Pita's father arranged the kidnapping in order to steal some of the ransom money. Creasy figures this out and the father does what he must since he thinks he killed his daughter. After tracking down the family of the Voice (the mastermind behind the kidnappings), Creasy learns that Pita is still alive and the Voice is willing to trade Pita for his brother and Creasy's life. And to make it seem not so sad and it was so Hollywood, Creasy is shot before hand and appears to be dying from blood loss. So, when he turns himself over to the kidnappers after they let Pita go, it makes it seem not so sad since the ""hero"" was going to die any way. I wonder if that is what really happened in real life.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Once the action started, it got interesting. Dezel was good as usual, so if you like him or if a movie about kidnapping interests you, then I recommend it."

Congratulations to Tony Scott which succeeded this time in creating a fast paced dramatic and emotional story that was perhaps a little too long. The soundtrack was good and at the end I had even some tears. I don't tell you more about but just see it. I was shocked when I read that every hour a child is kidnapped in Mexico and 70% from them are murdered. This must stop and I hope this film helps opening the eyes in this country and in the rest of the world! If you want to see Dakota in another kidnapping thriller don't miss TRAPPED.

","Denzel Washington plays Creasy, an alcoholic bodyguard in ""Man on Fire"", who is hired to protect a wealthy family's young daughter Pita, played by Dakota Fanning. The family lives in Mexico, where we are told that a kidnapping occurs every 80 minutes; frequently.<br/><br/>Creasy is stone cold and straight to the point. we learn that he has in a sense lost some humanity while performing his line of work. While driving Pita to her destinations, she eventually befriends him. Pita's kindness gives Creasy some light at the end of the tunnel and makes him feel more humane.<br/><br/>However, Pita disappears from creasy's life when they are ambushed and Pita is kidnapped. Creasy heals, but swears vengeance on those who have kidnapped her.<br/><br/>All in all, Man On Fire was a bit disappointing from what i expected, but the film is still very good. Denzel puts in a convincing performance, but half the pleasure of the movie is in watching him and Dakota Fanning interact during the first act of the movie. She is so adorable, and their dialog is so real that it leaves you wishing that the eventual kidnapping never happens.<br/><br/>When it does happen, though, you become instantly depressed that Pita is dead and that Creasy's life is ripped up all over again. When Denzel sets out to avenge her, you aren't on the edge of your seat rooting for him, surprisingly. You definitely want to see what he does, but the fact is that you know you liked the first half much more.<br/><br/>Something else that is interesting is that the Police are on to Creasy, but they are merely piggy backing him because they're glad he's giving the kidnapping network proper justice. Remember, a kidnapping in Mexico City occurs every 80 minutes, which means that these cops have had to deal with a lot of broken hearted families and the fact that there's nothing they could do about it.<br/><br/>This movie would probably earn 4 stars from me had it not been for the terrible film making style and bad use of sub titles. The colors flicker, the scenes warp, and unusual sounds and unusually loud sounds rip onto the track. Tony Scott, the director, was probably just trying to make it look interesting and life like, but it was just annoying and distracting.<br/><br/>The subtitles were oddball as well. the people speaking Mexican and other languages get subtitles, thank you. But at certain points in the film some of the English was subtitled as well. it seemed subtly insulting because you got the impression that they didn't think you were paying attention.<br/><br/>in the end, i'll give it ** 1/2 out of 4. Not bad."

After an initial aloofness and ""don't want to know you"" period, he warms to her and coaches her at swimming, showing her how to overcome her faults. She obviously likes him and somehow has given him a reason for living.<br/><br/>The 2nd half though where he undertakes a psychopathic vendetta to avenge her apparent death after she is kidnapped, ultimately sacrificing himself in exchange for her when she is found alive, was a turn off for me even though given his background and state-of-mind, what he does is just credible.<br/><br/>A reasonable thriller, but not if you like seeing graphic depictions of people having their fingers cut off/burned, torture etc."

","Man on fire is the story of Creasy (Washington), an alcoholic ex-agency man living with the demons of his violent working past and trying to find solitude at the bottom of a bottle. He is offered work by a friend and ex-college(Walken)to be a Bodyguard for a family in Mexico city and reluctantly agrees. The first act of the movie is a slow burning story of the relationship between Creasy and Pita, the young daughter of the family he protects. This part of the movie was always going to risk being cheesy as Creasy forms a warm bond with Pita and starts lowering some of the barriers he has to the outside world. The movie, however, deals with the relationship without being cheesy, mainly due to a superb performance by Washington. The first act ends with Pita being Kidnapped and Creasy left shot & injured. From here on, the movie keeps it simple and goes into revenge mode. Creasy hunts down everyone linked to the kidnapping and this ultimately leads to the major plot twist at the end of the second act. The second act, like the first, is excellent and prevents itself from slipping into boring routine because of the performance by Washington. The problem, however, arises in the final act where a typically Hollywood plot point prevents this Urban-noir movie from having the ending it deserves."

","Revenge is a dish best served cold.<br/><br/>Well, in the case of Man on Fire, revenge is a dish that needs some explaining. The movie is more a collection of impressive special f/x explosions than a story about a man seeking revenge. There is a vague feeling in the background about a girl who was kidnapped but the story (or what there is of one) neglects this and simply continues to create more people to be killed even when you're sure that everyone who could possibly have even heard of the kidnapping is already dead.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington leads a wonderful cast and crew. He heads a film that should have had some level of decency based solely on the people who contributed to it. Washington stares as Creasy, a man with a violent past in the marines who takes on a job as a bodyguard for the daughter of a business-obsessed man living in Mexico. He tries to maintain a professional distance form the girl, named Pita (Dakota Fanning) but finds that he can't help being friends with her. Thus begins the first hour of Man On Fire, which looks like an explanation for the forthcoming crime. It is shot entirely at a distance and each portion is full of the expected. But in comparison with its sister half, the third act, the first hour comes off without a hitch.<br/><br/>When Pita is kidnapped in a flurry of gunshots and confusing swirls of the camera, the plot less, disaster movie starts and the audience that came for something with a brain can now get up and leave for the movie next door. At this time, the audience that just came from the sneak peak of _________ (insert name of big-budget, brainless action movie. Bonus points if it is a sequel) can now enter the theater. From this point on we are introduced to a range of characters from the Mexican reporter who agrees to help Washington get all the information he wants so she can write an article on him, to the numerous Mexican hit men who could have been played by one man for how interchangeable they are. Each aids in getting a shooting or being shot while telling where the next man is. The man behind this brilliant mess of a screenplay is Brian Helgeland, who has Mystic River and L.A. Confidential to his name. And the director who gets to take all the blame is Tony Scott (Top Gun). This is proof that sometimes the big budget can go to the head instead of to good use.<br/><br/>There are probably more gunshots, explosions and dead bodies in Man on Fire than dialogue. But half the dialogue there is should have been canned. Even the unpromted killings are more deserved than the ending that is concocted. We have to be thankful for its presence because it does end the movie, but we can't help but wish anything else had been put in its place. There isn't much more predictable than the conclusion that exists. Denzel Washington, Tony Scott and Christopher Walken fail to live up to their names and Brian Helgeland and Dakota Fanning take a step backwards in establishing theirs. This movie is a sad waste of talent that takes itself way too seriously for the joke that it is. **/*****"

","First, you have to be ready to experience the revenge theme genre. I would not have watched the film cast with Bruce Willis (oh, maybe) or Stallone or Van Deisel or Van Damme or the California Governor. Denzel Washington can carry the hopelessness and despair of Creasy much better than those others. Also, the absence of a back story did not plague me. It seemed enough to know something of his history to understand the depths of his suicidal despair. Was it trite?...I suppose..the down and out pure professional....""First Blood"" carries this idea of the authorities taking on much more than they are prepared for.....and Denzel would have done better in that film, too...Plot techniques (the unexpended cartridge; the patron of lost souls medal; Creasy bear, the firing of the starter pistol, etc.) all worked well. These did not feel too contrived. And when the revenge came it was swift...much of the investigative detritus was swept away.....yes, it was violent....revenge films often are I think...yes it was extreme...and the story demanded it....OK, would the father have calmly taken the bullet and put it through his temple...possibly...but most important...just what the professional critics deplored, the jump cuts, the transition from slow motion to regular speed, the carousel with the camera during the kidnapping...this all made me feel (even on a small screen) as though I were being twirled around by events and I liked that...the sound score was great as well....good revenge flick.

","Having not really seen any other Tony Scott films than Enemy of the State, I didn't entirely know what to expect from his new revenge/vigilante action-drama, but the trailers looked so darn promising, so I thought, ""what the heck... can't be all bad..."" Believe me, I've learned my lesson; never judge a film by its trailer. The film is decent at best, overlong and it jerks the audience's sympathies around, without delivering any actual action. The plot is pretty good, but why does it take so ridiculously long to take off? My gosh, I was halfway through the film and almost falling asleep before something happened that wasn't just character development for Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning's characters. When the revenge actually took place, I sat there, in the theater, attentively, and really expecting something awesome to happen. But it didn't. I waited through the rest of the film, and nothing remarkable happened. There are ""action"" scenes(if you can call a bunch of large explosions 'action'), but they aren't actually impressive, as they appear in the trailers. The acting is pretty good. The characters are somewhat well-written. The pacing is dreadful. The film seems to never actually take shape and be anything... first it's a character driven drama, then an action piece, then a character driven drama again... and it keeps jerking our sympathies around, until the audience don't care about anything but when the film ends. The cinematography is pretty good, but it keeps cutting and skipping and it winds up giving you a headache. Once the revenge starts, Scott overstylizes the crap out of every moment, presumably because he didn't get to do his thing before that point in the film. The ending was probably the worst piece of typical Hollywood crap I've seen for a while. What kind of supposed feel-good crap... how are we supposed to believe that? If you see this movie, you'll know exactly what I mean. In conclusion, Tony can direct action decently, but he should stay far away from character driven pieces for a while. After seeing the film, leaving the theater, thinking more and more about it, I realize that I sympathize more with the kidnappers than the main characters. That's not as much the fault of Tony Scott the director as Tony Scott the human being, though. He expects us to care about this family just because they're the main characters, while the villains in the film have it much worse than they do. Bad idea, Mr. Scott. All in all, a decent film, but not one I care to see again, and not one I would classify as 'action'. Not even partly. I recommend this only to big fans of the actors and director Tony Scott. Everyone else, smell the smoke and realize that this is a dud. 5/10"

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br/><br/>Creasy (Denzel Washington) is a former marine and recovering alcoholic who wearily agrees to take on an assignment arranged for him by his close pal Rayburn (Christopher Walken) to act as a bodyguard for a young girl named Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City,where there is a kidnapping every 60 minutes and only 30% of the victims survive.Initially,he maintains a dismissive,strictly professional attitude around her but gradually lets her into his heart until he's rebuilding his life around her.So,when an unspeakable act is committed against her and her family,he sets out on a one man search-and-destroy mission against the perpetrators,leaving a bloody trail in his wake.<br/><br/>There were a number of positive factors that attracted me to this film.One,Denzel Washington in the lead role.Two,I'd already seen and enjoyed the 1987,low-budget original starring Scott Glenn and was eager to see what a big budget Hollywood makeover would do for it.The fact that it was directed by Hollywood action-meister Tony Scott made it look good too.But,that's the thing.It's an action movie and it's a Tony Scott action movie.So where's the action?For the most part,this just drearily drones along,running well over it's time limit and resulting in an overlong plomb.Last year,the movie Bad Boys 2 ran for a similar time frame.I hope this isn't the start of a new trend from Hollywood of action movies with minimalist plots that run for roughly two and a half hours,'cos if it is,it's not very encouraging.But that is exactly what we have here:a minimalist plot.A very tired and creaky one of a strong-and-silent hero type who ends up forming a bond with a little kid.And when stretched to said time frame,it becomes one hell of an endurance tester.<br/><br/>Somehow,you can hold your attention through to the end.But it can't be ignored that this is uninvolving,unengaging stuff.It's a shame.Spell-binding actor though Denzel is,he was in another action film that wasn't received very well some years ago by the name of Virtuosity.In a way,you can't help wondering why he didn't learn his lesson.**"

","Man On Fire was captivating, action filled, and a mite confusing. Denzel Washington has always been a guy to trust when it came to great movies. He's fiery and easy to watch, chooses incredible, powerful scripts but sadly if his head gets any bigger they will have to double the size of the theatre for his next film. Man On Fire is the story of a washed up, depressed former agent of some sorts. One of the interesting things about this film is that it gives no back story on Washington's character Creasy. Tony Scott who has directed some killer success films went a little out of his way to be original with this film I think. Washington's character is mysterious and unknown and we as the viewer are literally dropped into his life without any previous explanation leaving us to try and piece together the little hints dropped about his past. The story is that Creasy is hired by a seemingly wealthy Mexican business man played quite impressively by Mr. Jennifer Lopez...Mennifer? to protect his daughter played (needless to say BRILLIANTLY) by Dakota Fanning...shouldn't this girl get an Oscar for everything she acts in? Living in Mexico city where the kidnap/ransom rate is through the roof, Creasy appears to be incompetent and irresponsible for the job but his former partner or boss or friend or fellow agent Rayburn played by Christopher Walken recommends him. Fanning's character slowly begins to open Creasy's up making him feel for someone again and making him clean up his act in order to fully protect her. Unfortunately it's not in time for kidnappers, with the help of crooked Mexico cops/organized criminals to kidnap and ""kill her."" In anger Creasy exacts revenge on everyone who benefited, was involved in, or had a hand in the kidnapping. He's cold blooded and deadly serious and at the same time unravels the criminal chain involved in numerous kidnapping. The story has enough action and intense scenes to keep you riveted to your seat. Scott attempts a unique style in his direction with seemingly music video editing which is often annoying and used too frequently. I understand his reasoning but it's overused. The cast is terrific but Washington just seems so blatantly egotistical in all his roles lately. It's like he's doing a terrific job and his eyes are saying...look at me act, I am the best. Dakota Fanning is the most brilliant child actor I have ever seen as always. This film is definitely worth seeing, it's a nail biter and a good time in general. See it!! 7/10"

","(But then, aren't pretty much ALL his flicks pretty decent?). Anyway, this is your basic action film, and it has a goodly bit of it. I thought the beginning was a bit too long. I realize the importance of creating a bond between the the bodyguard (Denzel Washington) and the subject being guarded (Dakota Fanning). However, I thought they took just a few minutes too long to establish that relationship. I don't know how they could have cut it down and still made it work, but basically, I believe the film starts a bit too slowly. The plot has been hashed over several times, so there are no spoilers here. Once the kidnap plot against the girl (Fanning) actually occurs, the action picks up nicely. There is gratuitous violence, torture, death and, of course, lots of shooting. The film doesn't drag once the action starts, and can definitely keep the viewer interested. I enjoyed the film overall, especially after getting through the slower and overlong beginning. Denzel puts in his usual excellent performance. Look for good work also from Rutger Hauer and Dakota Fanning. Overall worth a watch but very violent. Not for the kiddies."

","Director Tony Scott has taken a script by Brian Helgeland from a novel by A. J. Quinnell and created a masterpiece of action, suspense and love that surpasses any genre movie I have seen in the last year.<br/><br/>I want to applaud the extraordinary work done by the editor, Christian Wagner. He creates for Man on Fire an entirely new form of film editing. Aside from his overall brilliant work, there are vignettes throughout that are heart-pounding, gut-wrenching quick-cut micro-films that themselves are worth watching over and over.<br/><br/>Helgeland's script is flawless. He takes the formula of the redemption of a broken man whose reason to live is snatched from him, triggering a staggering pursuit of bloody revenge of more gore and power than you would imagine you were in for at the beginning of the ride, and lifts it from the genre into a great film. The bloody revenge onslaught feels right, you want him to demolish his victims, and you want it in the worst way. And the nobility of the ending is written so sparingly that when the film fades to black, you don't want it to ever end.<br/><br/>Bonnie Timmerman's casting brings together a superb central team:<br/><br/>What can you say about Denzel Washington? He is superb; in top form. Dakota Fanning is brilliant as the young kidnapping victim. Add Christopher Walken, Giancarlo Giannini, both also delivering their usual fabulous craft. This foursome, the script, and Tony Scott's vision make this a must see.<br/><br/>Other cast members are either miscast, not up to the level of the film, or both. This is ultimately a serious flaw. Marc Anthony, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin, and others don't cut it.<br/><br/>I don't believe in telling the story of the movie--I've said enough--but I do want to say that the plot is intricate, and the script leaves nothing, as far as I can tell, at loose ends.<br/><br/>In the end, I haven't been this riveted by an action thriller in a long time. This is another jewel in the crown of Denzel's body of work. When you sit down to watch this one, make sure you've got all your snacks handy. You won't want to hit the pause button, I promise you, and you'll give the scan back button a workout to see scenes again."

Unlike other movies, the cast did not have any elements of chemistry- and this acted towards it's negativity, because it made a person feel that the casting was not done right. Denzil Washington's performance was just not my favorite - though he does have the looks of a villain, his acting just was not right. Marc Anthony gave a tolerable performance, and unlike other singer turned actors or actresses who tend to have lot of hype around the movie they are in, such that it is used as the main promotional tool. However Marc Anthony's performance flows naturally like a professional. Dakota Fanning as usual gave an outstanding performance that it now looks quite significant that that an Oscar is not too far way. In fact Dakota gives the best performance in this movie. The second half of the movie is just unbearable to an extent that any person who minds violence in movies would leave the theatre. I was very disappointed, I was expecting much more for a Denzil Washington movie. It just made Denzil look like a freak with a gun. This movie was released in tie with '13 going on 30' , but this made it to no. 1, making Jennifer Garner's movie at no 2 with a margin of 1 million  however this movie didn't deserved all the hype and status that it got- it just makes me conclude that Mexico is a country which cannot have kids playing freely."

I had my doubts in the first 30 minutes, I felt the travel scenes, were a little choppy, and it was easy to become distracted. That soon subsided. Denzel's character was extremely complex, and it quickly reversed into one of those films that you have to pay very close attention to, or you end up lost. I commend the producers/directors for the limited use of subtitles, and even more so for using the casts words as a bridge between what the viewer sees and thinks. I thought the film would be very predictable, but I was wrong. There were plenty of moments where I thought "" Oh, no, this cannot be happening!"" And of course, it was happening. I thought the summation and conclusion of the movie were perfect, most of the film evoked feelings of revenge, and then in the end, you are brought to tears. Two thumbs up!!"

But it's when things turn nasty. There's little action and we have seen this all before in movies like Payback (fingers instead of toes) Eye of the tiger (explosives where the sun does not shine). The jerky camera annoys rather than entertains. And there's a lack of humour, which makes things grim and to be honest rather dull.

First of all, I found the directing in this movie to be totally annoying. The editing of the film made me feel like I was watching a 2 ½ hour music video. It sure is great that there are now digital effects available so that a director can now infuse an intolerable amount of 'really cool effects' into their movies by utilizing some sort of video software allowing easy modifications to digitized images. These 'really cool effects' go from sharp edits, where a hand moving does not move in one motion but in several motions (wow) and where we get to see the 'round and round' effect given a conversation between two characters in a new and totally crisp, annoying fashion. This story took so long to build up to anything that I figured that last half had to be 'super super action' in order to wind up being 'super action' for the whole film since the beginning hour and a half had NO action. Denzel Washington just seemed pretty much asleep throughout the film. His character was very shallow and even though an attempt was made to have him 'have a heart' after hanging around with the kid, the attempt came up short. Then we get to the action. Well, I've seen better action in a non 'super action' film by far. Plus, the action was nasty, out of sorts with the rest of the movie. It's like the director was trying to make Denzel's character a really nasty dude, but even that was coming up short. <br/><br/>Save your money."

","This is my first ever reveiew for IMDb, I felt it was necessary, allow me to explain. When I came across the reviews for ""Man on Fire"" I was amazed by the sheer and unfiltered venom of some of the reviews that I was reading. Shocked even. The way the reviewers described the movie made it seem like the only thing worse would be to get gang raped by a tribe of HIV positive silver-backs. I mean Tony Scott is a good director, right? Denzel Washington is one of the finest actors of our generation, right? How could this movie be that bad? Well, I rented it from the local video store, sat down with an open mind and watched...those reviews were... well...full of crap, and that's the only way for me to put it without being forever banned from the web site. <br/><br/>""Man on Fire"" is the story of a former assassin who has fallen on hard times. John Creasy(Washington)takes on a job to be the bodyguard of a little girl, Lupita Ramos(Fanning). In the beginning the hardened Creasy rebuffs the childs attempts at friendship, but eventually softens up and they develop a sweet relationship. This was a little cliché for me but not totally unexpected in a movie like this. Eventually young Lupita is kidnapped and Creasy is gravely injured trying to protect her, some say the first half of the movie moves to slowly, but it's a tool used to build up the relationship of the main characters to the point when Creasy does go on the offensive, we, the audience can be on his side(he does some pretty sadistic stuff). The movie flows very well, it's around 2 hours 25 mins long but you barely notice the length. The movie is engrossing, action packed and has some great elements of suspense and intrigue that I wasn't really expecting. The actors were good, the direction was good, the location and sets were good, everything about the movie was good. To me that equals a good movie, not a great one, but a good one... a really good one.<br/><br/>So, If you haven't seen man on fire yet, and are surfing the web, trying to see what it's all about, and you come to IMDb I really hope you get a chance to read this review first, or at least it be one of the first, those other guys will lead you down a dark road full of silver-back gorillas griping a handful of condoms, just kidding, everyone has the right to their opinion. Trust me though ""Man on Fire"" is a movie worth seeing.<br/><br/>This was kind of fun, I hope to talk to everyone again soon."

","'Man On Fire' was absolutely riveting from beginning to end and I find it quite ridiculous to discount its brilliance by simply pointing at excessive violence. Sure if you don't enjoy violence in films then you won't enjoy this film, but even if the violence turns you off no-one could possibly say anything bad about the performances. Denzel Washington who I felt was quite average in 'Training Day', a film he won an Oscar for, was nothing short of phenomenal. His main co-star Dakota Fanning was equally special although obviously slightly off Washington's pace considering she's only ten years old! As for the editing, cinematography and the medium overall well done to Tony Scott for making a film that pushes the limits almost as much as 'Fight Club' did back in 1999. The style of all film would benefit from experimental styles such as the ones used in 'Man on Fire' and overrated directors like Tarantino could really learn a lot from a truly incredible artist like Scott. As for the subtitles all I can say is well done to the creators of this film for using them to their absolute best advantage instead of keeping with the old format. Basically what I am trying to say is do yourself a favour and go see this spectacular film. If you don't like it get used to it because the MTV generation are taking over film-making and movies like this are here to stay."

","This IS a great action movie of 2004!! This reminds me of the classic and cheesy action films of the eighties. While people prefer films with a moral or a spiritual message, this IS a classic revenge movie. Haters claim that this movie sucks. Maybe it does. But then you also claim KILL BILL sux as well. It has the same plot: REVENGE. <br/><br/>Denzel is great in this! This character can be considered the older brother of Alonzo from Training Day. What Alonzo wouldn't touch is blown up by Creasy. <br/><br/>Only thing that sucked was Marc Anthony's performance. His character seemed a little to predictable.

","I thought this was a terrific movie. I honestly feel that the criticism it's getting is based solely on comparing this movie to the stereotypical, kill-everyone action movie.<br/><br/>And would it occur to anyone that Mexico, being the USA's closest southern neighbour, might have a good deal of Americans living there? And that their children might actually be a prime target? ""Hmm wealthy gringo with no street-sense. Easy."" Hence the American wife, American child, and obviously Mexican (yet English-speaking... it's not totally unknown) father.<br/><br/>Some people are so focused on trying their hardest to point out flaws in a movie (even when they're not there) and find SOME way to link it to ""why America is bad"" that they forget what they're really looking for.<br/><br/>And what was WRONG with the camera work and editing?? At least it wasn't just straight-up, ""camera points here, camera goes there"" and had a little bit of animation to it.<br/><br/>Seriously people, don't just NOT see this movie simply because someone writes paragraphs of text bagging it and pointing out (non-existant) flaws. Go see it for yourselves and make up your own mind. You'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10"

","I happened to read the comments for Man on Fire today and felt that the world will never be free of good-for-nothing-big-mouth critics. Man on Fire is undoubtedly on the best movies in recent times. Denzel and Dakota's relationship in the movie has been told in an extra-ordinary manner. I have given this film a 10 out of 10. When movies on cartoon characters, aliens and teens can run packed houses, I wonder why people are so contemptuous about this movie. Dakota Fanning's performance is truly impressive.

I'm definitely gonna add this to my collection."
"She_Jedi","Null","0","2","8 August 2004"," A film that polarised its audience
","SPOILERS Having read a number of the comments about this film, and also scanned the message boards, one thing is clear: This is a film that has completely polarised its viewers. There doesn't appear to be an inbetween on this one, the audience either thought it was garbage, or thought it was the best film of 2004. I'm one of the latter. I spent the entire film on the edge of my seat, completely engrossed not only in the characters but in the desire for justice for that little girl. And I hate children. I didn't even realize how long the movie went for, I walked out of the theatre and was shocked to see how much later it was.<br/><br/>For those people who feel they picked holes in the plot, clearly you weren't paying attention.<br/><br/>Q: How could Denzel turn into this one man army?<br/><br/>A: There's your mistake right there. Confusing Creasy, 16 year veteran of US Army special forces, counter terrorist, assassin you name it, with a talented actor. If you can't see past the actor and into the character, then this movie is lost on you<br/><br/>Q: Why did the ""baddie"" keep the girl alive?<br/><br/>A: He answers this questions himself, when he offers her life for Creasy's, and Creasy doesn't believe him. ""She's worth nothing to me dead,"" implying that she's worth something to him alive. OK the ransom drop was screwed up, but a cute little blonde would be very valuable to the underground world that trades in cute little blondes. Child prostitution anyone?<br/><br/>Q: What was the point in Creasy dying at the end?<br/><br/>A: Because a happily ever after Hollywood ending really would have ruined this film. Creasy spends the first half of the film learning to live again, only to have the reason for his redemption stripped away. He spends the second half of the film quite determined to die, but to take the authors of Pita's kidnapping with him. The deal was ""Your life for hers."" He was quite prepared to die to save her life, the ultimate redemption, and having done that he quite peacefully slipped away, hence the bit with the St Jude medal in the car. His job was done. It was a 2004 version of Shane riding off into the sunset.<br/><br/>Q: The editing and MTV style of the camera work really annoyed me<br/><br/>A: I'm not going to speak for Tony Scott, but my interpretation of the film's style was to provide an insight into Creasy's state of mind (hence the surreality of the camera work) and also to cushion the audience from the violence. Same way Kill Bill was filmed in an almost cartoon-like fashion. Scott wanted this film to actually be released, and making the violence truly realistic would never have made it past the censors. <br/><br/>I think one of the reasons why this film annoyed so many people is that it cannot be pigeonholed into a Schwarzenegger/Stallone/Willis popcorn action flick. It requires the audience to become engaged, to go down the rabbit hole along with the camera. I suspect those people who hated it were the ones expecting a formulaic action flick, and were disappointed. An ""action"" flick with a brain, who would've thought?"

","Expecting much less, I absolutely enjoyed this movie. <br/><br/>Relating to a real problem, the setting in Mexico City is completely authentic and real. Dakota Fanning is a wonderful actress, not to mention Denzel Washington's expertise. The relationship between Pita Ramos and John Creasy is a very believable one of a innocent child and a man who seems to have given up on life. <br/><br/>Heart wrenching twists and action scenes kept me clinging to my seat. A wonderful movie for women (mothers, in general) because of the emotion that goes hand in hand nicely with all of the action scenes."
"already_gone","Null","0","1","7 August 2004"," Clever movie!
","I thought this was a really good movie, and the rating it was given was decent, if not a little modest.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington does really well in the emotional tough guy role, which is to be expected as it is the only kind of character he can play, or ever has played. The little girl is a little pretentious and over confident, which you could take as the character, but i was more inclined to take it as the personality of a spoiled little actress showing through.<br/><br/>The cinematography, the subtitles and the overall style of the movie was really clever and excellent; the rough colours, sketchy scenes and restless camera angles reflected the strange unreal-yet-real atmosphere created by the characters, all of whom have their own demons.<br/><br/>The great thing about this movie is that it does not designate any particular characters as bad guys or good guys, other than the innocent child. Everyone has some skeleton in their closet or another, while maintaining their loyalty for family or religion. <br/><br/>And if that wasn't enough, there is a scene in the movie in which Creasy kills a guy by detonating some C4 that he stuck up the guy's arse. (the actual placement of the explosives was emitted from the movie, and leaves you with the idea that obviously it is worth getting to know some fat bloke that well just so you can kill him in an amusing way). It reminds you of the days of sticking bungers inside mandarins, as well as one of those commercials where they say ""here's one I prepared earlier.""<br/><br/>An often intense, occasionally excessively violent movie, that questions the validity of conventional scruples in a world where everyone is ""just a professional""."

","I actually registered today just so I could put in something positive about this movie, as there seems to be to many people judging it as a potential 'movie of the century'. It's an action movie...<br/><br/>Yes the movie can be a little cheesy at times, and probably has a few to many action movie clichés and I have no idea what Christopher Walken is doing with his hair. But for what the movie was trying to be I thought it was great. Tony Scott was obviously trying to go for something different with the types of camera shots and the subtitles which I thought were very effective. Whilst Denzel played one of his greatest roles since Training Day, the other actors failed to deliver, but who cares? It's an awesome action movie, judging the acting would be similar to judging Stallones performance in the Rocky movies. It's not relevant. <br/><br/>The movie is extremely entertaining, and if you like a good action movie you'll love this. If you want to compare it with Schindlers list or Gone With the Wind, then go see something else."

"vertigo_14","6","0","2","11 July 2004"," Remake of an Italian 80s drama. (SPOILERS)
","The style of 'Man on Fire' is at times annoying. With consistent zooming, scanning, and bleaching, it is more like watching a music video and at times, like a series of movie previews. For a story like this, the attempt to be avante garde, seems wasted, and at times detracts from the story itself as you try to slow down your brain to catch up with what is going on. The film-making tries to be too cutting edge while the movie itself, the story and it's characters, are really nothing new, and not accommodating for these techniques. <br/><br/>It certainly doesn't do much to help establish mood. And what's worse, though this may be considered ""cutting edge"" techniques, it seems to be quite cliché.<br/><br/>'Man on Fire' is for me, among the better of recent releases, particularly because it recognizes the importance of relationship to it's characters. I have seen far too many action movies where characters fail to recognize the immediacy and the emergency of the situation, even though their adversaries promise swift death if they choose to interfere. <br/><br/>The story goes like this: Former counter-intelligence, Creasy (Denzel Washington) is an alcoholic drifter who is hired as a bodyguard for the daughter (Dakota Fanning who plays 'Pita') of a man (Marc Anthony) who's family fortune is depleting fast. (Unforunately, the opening sequence gives away too much about the impending story, including it's sabateurs).<br/><br/>Pita, played naturally by Fanning, gives Creasy a sense of purpose and eases his persistent loneliness, something that once influenced his alcoholism and suicide attempts. He no longer becomes just her bodyguard, but he becomes more like a surrogate father and a best friend. Her parents seem to be out of the picture in her life, or at least not willing to listen to her, most of the time. <br/><br/>The movie centers on a kidnapping. Pita informs Creasy earlier that there were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City last week (where the story takes place), 4 kidnappings a day. The swift opening credits of the movie probably place fear (at least in us impressionable American audiences) about traveling or living there if we have young children, as they inform you of the formidable statistics: 70% of those children kidnapped are usually not recovered. Yep, it gives you the air of Santa Carla (you know...""The Lost Boys""). <br/><br/>Soon enough, Pita, too is kidnapped. And Creasy, broken over his inability to prevent it--being terribly shot in the process--and over her death, which the kidnappers inform her parents of after the ransom drop goes foul.<br/><br/>Like a Samurai avenging the death of his master, Creasy, feeling such remorse for the loss of his best friend, an innocent nine year old girl, vows revenge upon all those involved. I suppose that makes this movie much more violent than a Quentin Tarentino production, considering the creative ways that Creasy kills the minions to get to the top. <br/><br/>And he's not dealing with a bunch of amateurs. Those behind the kidnapping are actually a heavily protected gang of corrupt cops who head the department that investigates kidnappings, of all things. With the help of a vigilante reporter (a rare breed of journalists, of course), a high level detective who suspects corruption, and a determined friend (Christopher ""I'm in at least one scene of every movie"" Walken), Creasy is going straight to the top to bring them all down.<br/><br/>There's a continuous role of religion in this movie, which I find to be quite annoying, but may be appropriate given that it is set in Catholic Mexico City. Creasy asks his friend, Rayburn (Christopher Walken) whether he thinks there is any place for God in the work that they do. Towards the end, while still in the process of revenge, Creasy says something like God can do with them what he wants, but he just delivers them to Him. It wouldn't matter what God thought, because any inclination of that might stop Creasy from proceeding and that to him, may be like giving up on Pita in the end, someone that he was so strongly committed to. <br/><br/>One viewer commented how there is not much action going on in this movie, which is pretty much true. After seeing it, I had thought it was a decent 'action' movie (for lack of a better word), but in retrospect, it does seem to be lacking the qualities that would make it much better, let alone just 'pretty good'. <br/><br/>That is, Denzel's character, Creasy, seems to just walk along and get his revenge with little or no resistance or pursuit from the kidnappers and their clan--though at the end, he does have to finally do some negotiating (number one rule of action movies: the last boss is always the hardest to defeat). Creasy in a sense, driven by his commitment to Pita, appears invincible. Number two rule of action movies: invincible characters do not make a very interesting story because it lacks all the competition that drives the suspense. And this is a necessary element, considering the entire second half of the movie is dependent upon it (the first half focuses on Creasy's development and his relationship with the young girl).<br/><br/>In the end, it seems pretty wasteful considering the potential of your cast--Denzel Washington, Christopher Walken, Dakota Fanning, and hell, even a good-looking Mickey Rourke. Perhaps, more attention should have been given to the story instead of trying to woo audiences with music video production techniques."
"tarsoniz","10","0","1","4 July 2004"," Best drama/action movie I've seen in years
","Although some of the plot twists are a little predictable, Man on Fire has plenty of them. If your jaw doesn't drop when Denzel turns action-hero and starts gutting the crime organization from the bottom up, you are probably not awake.<br/><br/>This movie gives us a good amount of time to become familiar with the characters and gain some insight into their lives and relationships. Cleasy is a very complex character who goes from loser to superman to crazy psycho avenger, and who finally discovers peace with a final selfless act.<br/><br/>Some people may not appreciate the visual experience that Man on Fire provides, but there are very good reasons for the strobe-like sequences and the extra subtitles. This movie uses accelerated flashes of images to emphasize a state of confusion or internal struggle within the characters' minds. No, it is not pleasant to look at, but that is the entire point--it shows that the characters are not just going through the motions and doing crazy things like it's just another day at the beach. It gives the audience a glimpse into the characters' (most notably Creasy's) minds as they try to deal with and make sense of chaotic thoughts and fragmented images.<br/><br/>Another effect used in this film is extra subtitling to emphasize key bits of information. Some of the dialogue is in Spanish, so of course there are subtitles for those of us who are not quite so fluent in that language. But during some key sequences the subtitles materialize briefly onto the screen to help us make the same mental notes that Creasy is making (either mentally or in his little notepad).<br/><br/>Of all the movies I have seen in the past couple of years, this is by far the best action movie; and it probably ranks withing the top 5 movies of any genre that I've seen in the past few years."

","After reading some of the comments made I truly wonder if we saw the same movie. For one Creasy was an expert in counter terrorism and an assassin to boot. The dilemma he has is the guilt of taking so many lives. He reads the bible seeking a freedom from the torment his soul is feeling from the killing he has done in the past. The relationship between Lupita and Creasy has to be explored because she is the reason for his redemption. Her love and spirit are a light for him and then she is brutally and almost mortally taken from him and her family. I can tell from the comments that none of you have served in any branch of the military nor know of the extensive training that SF members go through. One month from any action is like a day of off work for the civilian. You don't forget your training in a month, you would never have lasted in SF."

He was supposed to be out of action for a month and then proceeded to bound around knocking off mobsters and cops like there was no tomorrow. As a plus point, i found the bomb in the ass a very novel way to kill someone.<br/><br/>The action was on the whole disappointing and the film quibbled to an entirely unsatisfactory conclusion.

","While I don't consider myself to be a hardcore action junkie, I definitely found solace in ""Man On Fire."" Many times when watching action movies I'm bothered by the lack of conviction the characters whom are seeking revenge put forth. Far too many movies portray a character whose wife was raped, brother was killed, dog was maimed or what have you and when the time comes to rain down the proverbial fire and brimstone, they start crying or have a fit of irrationality. You'll find nothing of the sort in this flick. Denzel Washington, as usual, gives us a marvelously superb performance in this tale of despair, awakening, and finally bitter sweet revenge. If you have a weak stomach when it comes to the killing of many a criminal you may want to go ahead and skip this one. On the other hand, if you enjoy a strikingly vivid saga of of betrayal and retribution, this is your flick.

","Ever since actor Denzel Washington got into show business,and after all the movies he has made,there has never been a ""really bad"" Denzel Washington picture until now and this is the worst Denzel movie ever made,but let's face it since it is not all really Denzel's fault,but lets really put the blame on this piece of unadulterated garbage of bad taste cimema. The person responsible for this mayhem? Director Tony Scott(the younger brother of Oscar winning director Ridley Scott of Gladiator,Alien,Blade Runner,Hannibal,and above others to name a few)who is in the running for the title of ""Hollywood's most despicable director"",and in the running for ""The worst movie director in Hollywood"",second to another despicable director as well:Roland Emmerich,director of Independence Day,Godzilla,The Patriot,Day After Tomorrow,etc. <br/><br/>However,Tony Scott takes sleek-violence porn to a new low in this cynically sleazy account of an alcoholic bodyguard(Denzel Washington) who goes on a blood soaked rampage of unstoppable revenge after kidnappers apparently kill the cute little blond girl(Dakota Fanning) he was hired to protect. There is zero humanity to this whole enterprise;in fact,it serves itself as exhibit A in explaining why other parts of the world see the West as spiritually corrupted and irredeemably decadent. Scott's garishly overheated style of violence,which he tries to copycat Quentin Tarentino so wildly, that is looks like a compendium of Tv-ad cliches,since it makes its audience wonder why in the hell he holds himself in greater contempt,or is it with the audience,the material of the film,or basically over egoing over himself. As for Denzel Washington's performance in this film,apparently convinced by his 2001 Oscar for Best Actor in ""Training Day"",goes to show that Hollywood only awards portrayals of degenerate blacks that are negatively showed,and for an prime example of stereotyping African-Americans,see Halle Berry's 2001 Oscar for Best Actress in ""Monster's Ball"" as a oversee of Hollywood racism within the ranks."

Needless to say things go completely awry and Denzel takes matters into his own hands.<br/><br/>Seeing this film makes me realize how truly diverse Denzel is from a very internal performance seen here to his over-the-top (but still brilliant) performance in Training Day. Denzel keeps the audience's attention even though nothing really happens for about a half hour in the film. That is when you can tell someone is a great actor, when he makes the mundane interesting. <br/><br/>The great thing about his film is not only the script, acting, action, plot, music, build, but the fact that the subtitles, for when there is Spanish spoken in the film and even when it's not is turned into an art form.

","I went to this film not expected much, so I was surprised to find out how much I found myself enjoying it. I went to see it on the reccomendation of some of my closest friends, all of whom have completely different tastes. The movie is basically a revenge film, but unlike most others of its genre, focuses most intently on the psychology of the man doing the avenging. The film does an excellent job of showing the hero agonized and haunted by an unknown past, and developing a slow but meaningful relationship between him and his young client. To my surprise, almost half of the film takes place before the kidnapping, thereby increasing the emotional impact later on when the abduction takes place. Denzel Washington does an amazing and believable job, as does Dakota Fanning. Christopher Walken is, as usual, Christopher Walken. Although a bit under-used. The only downfall of this film is the editing, as the story goes on, it employs these strange cuts, flashbacks, grainy images, enhanced by strange music that sounds like someone spinning a radio dial. It gets worse, and at times it was downright annoying, like someone messing with your tv cable while you are watching it. It interrupted the flow of the movie. I suppose it's supposed to show the viewer the hero's state of mind, but it only served as an annoyance. Other than the editing, it's a great film, I give it 7 out of 10."

This blow- em-up action movie is just an early summer blockbuster with nothing to deliver but a lack of editing.

I'm not afraid to say it. I love you Parkside! It had had some extensive remodeling since the last time I visited. It used to be a run down theater. Now it's a half mainstream and half art movie theater. It's still kind of run down but therein lies its charm. They have chess boards in the lobby and sell beer at the concession stand.

I won't ruin the ending but let's just say Hollywood screws it up again. Someone thought a brutal revenge flick should have a semblance of a happy ending. My eyes were rolling and I was ready to smash my beer bottle against the screen.

","This film reminds me of Traffic, but with the look of True Romance and the feeling of Seven. It was very well done. The Characters were perfect, and the camera shots were original and fit well with the film. I loved this film. Denzel was powerful, and his performance was better than Training Day by far. Plus Micky Rourke is always a big presance on screen and in this film he is no different. Marc Anthony is great, his creepy but powerful persona he put in the character is just was this film needed.Dakota Manning is a Jewl, so sweet and perfect in the film like all her films. She is a great little actress and will be around for a long time in this business, especially with all the roles she is getting. This is a must see, for anyone who enjoys seeing bad guys get it! Plus Denzel is pretty easy on the eyes!"
"vaultkeeper2001","10","0","3","2 May 2004"," Okay it's flawed but still entertaining
","I went to go see this movie because I had nothing else to do on a Friday night. It didn't seem to appealing when I saw the trailer. When I finnally watched it,it was such a marvelous movie already on my short list of top movies I have seen in 2004 which includes Kill Bill vol 2 and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind. It is a little flawed I'll grant you that but the movie is so good you wont even notice. My thoughts on why people do not like it so much is because it may seem like it has been done before i.e. Traffic,Snatch,Three Kings and Once upon a time in Mexico and Desperodo basically any action movie that has come out in the last 5 years. So it is filmed like many other movies in the same genre that's not to say it isnt unoriginal. If you liked any of the movie I have listed above do yourself a favor and see this movie my over all rating:-A"
"DJAkin","Null","0","2","1 May 2004"," I sure do like Denzel
","Denzel is so good in this movie. He never reveals what He and Walken did. However, walken said that Denzel's charactor is a artist who's works in the art of death...and is about to PAINT HIS MASTERPIECE. I imagine that he and Denzel did some kind of covert activity in VIETNAM and shot a bunch of innocent civiliams or something. The way Denzel seeks his revenge is good. The rapport between he and South Dakota Fanning was really nice. It was so sad when that one SPOILER event surfaced at the end (toward the end actually). I heard that Mexico City is becoming so corrupt. It is so sad if that's Tue. I loved the scenes in this movie that were in the mountains. I was surprised that the main dude (The Voice) lived in such poverty. I guess it's cuz he wanted to keep a low cover. Tony Scott directed this. His brother is Riddle Scott - who also directed Hannibal. The pan who played PATSY in Hannibal played the Mexican FBI agent in this movie...a small bit of TRIVIA."
"ozzyrocks86","10","0","1","29 April 2004"," Good movie, though it would've worked better with a different director
","I watched this movie a couple days ago and it was good, although a little long for a revenge movie. Denzel Washington proves he is one of the best in the business today, but it was his scenes with the adorable Dakota Fanning that were the high points of the film. Christopher Walken is his usual self. If there was one thing that I didn't like, it was director Tony Scott's overindulgence in style. I'm not saying Scott is a bad director, I liked Enemy of the State and Spy Game, but his frenetic ultra-stylish directing doesn't suit a movie like this. The movie consists of a million jump cuts, freeze frames, color saturations, blurred images...you name it and all it accomplishes is giving you a headache. Ridley Scott, Tony's elder and more prolific brother, would've worked well with this movie. A more classical style of direction would have perfectly complemented the awesome plot and splendid performances from the cast. But in the end, this movie is still watchable and turned out to be a satisfying experience. 7/10."
"rjbat","10","0","2","27 April 2004"," Denzel has done it again!
","Once again, Denzel Washington has turned in an Oscar winning performance. This was a very gritty movie with wry, to the point dialogue. The scenes leading up to the where Denzel becomes the ""man on fire"" may have seemed a little long, but were necessary in order for the audience to understand Creasy's character and his relationship with Dakota Fanning's Pita. After we learn this, it easy to see why he goes on his killing spree. As for the supporting cast, Dakota Fanning is a great actor for one so young and Christopher Walken is ,as always, fun to watch. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the use of rapid-fire camera shots and blurred shots. Other than that , I believe this will be one of the years best movies."
"bartonfink-1","10","0","1","27 April 2004"," Man on Fire goes beyond the action thriller genre
","Tony Scott has made a quantum leap forward with Man on Fire.  This is a film of intense and riveting quality, that goes beyond the genre of action thriller.  Some critics have complained of the the long run-time, and especially the first half with its lack of action.  In my opinion every minute of that first hour was well crafted and a worthy investment into developing the bond between Creasy and Pita and set up items for the remainder of the plot.<br/><br/>There are a number of vengeance plots on the screen right now, but none pull it off as much style and more importantly depth as Man on Fire.  Possibly the finest revenge tale since Soderbergh's The Limey.  A very dark and violent film but one with a through appreciation for humanity nevertheless."

","It's a great action film with a lot of serious drama.  Denzel Washington did great as always.  But Dakota Fanning was EXCELLENT!!  I can not believe the talent of this little girl.  She blew me away with her ability to do such a serious character so convincingly.<br/><br/>I know she did great in ""I Am Sam"".  She did even better on ""Man on Fire"". I feel this should earn her an Oscar nomination.  She is an amazing little actress.<br/><br/>Marc Anthony also did a great job on this film.  I think he's got a lot of potential of being a great serious actor and also as well as comedies.<br/><br/>Great story line.  The ending was definetly a surprise.  Totally awesome movie.  I'm definitely adding this one to my DVD Collection."

","this was probably the best movie i have seen all year. the movie really keeps you hanging on the entire movie. I love how it goes from being a kind of love story to a revenge film. The concept is so original and Denzel Washington once again has manage to blow me away. Dakota Fanning not to be over shadowed deserves great recognition for her powerful role.  I never realized that these problems existed in Mexico and Latin America. It is my belief that the director captured this problem perfectly. The way you feel what the character is feeling is so overwhelming at times you don't think you can take it but you have to keep on watching. If this movie does not receive any nomination for an award this year a great injustice will have been committed. Thats why i say this movie is a must see for anyone with compassion and love of a good action/drama."

","Ok I gotta say this, working with the right kid is priceless and in this case, little Ms Fanning is amazing !!!  Mr. Washington is his always great in the part and does his best with a poorly worked ending.  You can tell he and Ms Fanning had a real on screen bond and that makes for the best parts of the film.<br/><br/>(Warning; Spoilers Below)<br/><br/>Summery; DW looses believability and painfully obvious, post ""test audience"" added final scene makes ending look dumber<br/><br/>Sadly, the film fails in the action and the decisions the DW's character makes.  After claiming to be ruthless in his pursuit of the kidnapper/murderers he is surprisingly lenient on the women he meets.  They are just as guilty as the men but his torture and killing is limited to only the men and the women get off with little more than a big cussing.<br/><br/>
In the end, his final act is also pitiful in regards to the action of the start.  It almost seemed to me the writers gave up on the story as DW's character just lets him self be captured with no struggle whatsoever.<br/><br/>And just before the credits role, there is a scene out of nowhere that just has to be an add on after the original ending tested very poorly.  In short, after DW dies riding in the back of a car, there is a BW fade of the big bad guy being shot in the head by a cop. Absolutely out of nowhere and looks to be an addition to give the file the little bit of closure it did not even have before."
"stervkidafii","10","0","1","24 April 2004"," Best movie experience in a while...
","I have to say, I have read many unfavorable reviews of the movie, including one from Ebert, and all of the reviews did the exact same thing: overcomplicated mundane details in the movie.  For example, where Chirs Walken went in the movie.  Well, If the movie starred Walken, I could see your point, but I obviously didn't notice.  Ebert said the movie switched to an ""unfortunate action formula"".  I thought there was a more than fair balance of action and depth.  I mean, those who saw the trailer knew there was action in the film, it was rated ""R"", so what did you expect.  I hate it when people overcomplicate movies, books, and anything else of this nature. And compared to some of the movies that have been coming out over the last few months, some just completely horrid (I'm looking at you Scooby Doo 2, a movie any child could walk out of and say, ""What the HELL!""), Man on Fire was a more than welcome change, and when I say change, I mean a good movie. I saw it yesterday and I still can't get it out of my mind.  People have also been ranting about the ending (SPOILER), which while shocking and sad. Trust me, If he would have done what MANY DIRECTORS WOULD HAVE HAD HIM DO, I would have felt cheated.  Many thanks to Tony Scott and Denzel and the rest of the cast, because so many movies over the last year haven't even come close to sparking at the interest level this one did. Kudos."
"filmfortheblind","6","0","1","25 April 2004"," Lost Under Avalanche of Bad Production
","Man on Fire is a good movie who's story is lost among bad lines, horrible camera work and some of the worst subtitling I have ever seen. Bad subtitling? Yeah you're laughing now. wait till you see the movie.<br/><br/>
First off the script leaves something to be desired. Despite being predictable, during a handful of key lines you can almost feel the actors asking themselves, `Seriously, would this person really be talking like this?' The good part is that the long drawn out dialog takes away from the horrible camera work.<br/><br/>The cinematography for this movie was simple. Buy a grainy film (probably EXR), zoom in really close and shake the camera like your sitting on a vibrating bed. Don't get me wrong the raw, gritty look can be cool if you do it right (Example: Amores Perros, 25th Hour, 21 Grams) but when you over do it, you start to have problems. And Man on Fire is way over done.<br/><br/>
To make matters worse, for some reason the maniacal editor (or whoever) found it necessary to go do hallucinogens while they were subtitling. Granted the movie takes place in Mexico City, so naturally there is subtitling for the Spanish. Then the subtitling gets a little bit fancier. words don't appear until they're said. Alright no harm done. Then for some reason they decided to start subtitling the English. Yes an English movie subtitled in English. I can only imagine a deaf person having to watch double the subtitles because the editor thought it would be artsy if half-way through the movie he started subtitling in his own language. Just when you think it can't get any worse, it does. the subtitles start changing font, sizes and start reacting to what the people on screen are saying. It hits a breaking point when Denzel's character, Creasy, starts shouting and the subtitles take up the whole screen. I go to movies to watch a movie not to read what I can already hear.<br/><br/>Other than that Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington were awesome. Marc Anthony out acts Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walkin plays himself... again.<br/><br/>Man on Fire 6/10"
"alfiefamily","6","0","1","26 April 2004"," Top notch cast can't save overlong, predictable film.
","This could have and should have been a much better movie than it was. <br/><br/>
Really fine performances from all involved.  It's no wonder why Denzel Washington is considered one of our finer actors. The arc of his performance is spectacular. Without giving the story away (although if you've seen the commercials, you know 90% of the total plot line), the viewer can feel his isolation, and the depth of his loss of self.  <br/><br/>Dakota Fanning is also wonderful as the little girl he is hired to protect. She is a good actress who manages to hold her own in her scenes with Washington.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken is marvelous in another controlled, understated performance. Giancarlo Giannini and even Mickey Rourke, (who I did not recognize at first) were very good.<br/><br/>However, all of these fine performances are betrayed by the director (Tony Scott) and screenwriter Brian Helgaland (Mystic River)(not to mention some annoying camera work by D/P Paul Cameran).  Since most of the story can be determined by the commercial, there are no surprises to this movie (none that are believable, anyway).<br/><br/>****Spoilers**** The premise behind the movie is very good.  Washington plays a down and out special forces expert, who becomes the bodyguard to a little girl, who is the daughter of an international business man (Marc Anthony).  He must protect her because the kidnapping rate in Mexico is so high.  After Washington is shot several times during the inevitable, and predictable kidnapping, and after he learns that the girl has been killed, he resolves to find the people involved, and kill them all.<br/><br/>And that he does.  The violence that is committed in this movie is handled well.  It is effective, without being overly gory.  While some of these scenes are interesting, some are just unbelievable (would he really walk through a crowded disco shooting a shotgun over his head into the air?).<br/><br/>The final conversation between Washington and ""The Voice"" is so disappointing and ridiculous it ruins the credibility of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Between the lousy script and the multitude of ""artistic"" camera shots that were annoying, this movie could have easily been trimmed by 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Rent the video and save some dough.<br/><br/>6 out of 10<br/><br/>But"
"johnnymonsarrat","7","0","1","26 April 2004"," Jon Monsarrat review: Good but a little melodramatic
","Man on Fire is a straightforward action flick that spends a little too much time setting the stage. There aren't really any twists, since the movie trailer gives away the main plot twist. Denzel Washington is great as usual, but I just didn't ""buy it"" what happens at the end, the motivations of various characters. They managed to avoid a Hollywood ending, though.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Action flick junkies<br/><br/>-- Drama lovers who see the occasional action flick, but only on a rainy day. See Training Day first.<br/><br/>I'll give Man on Fire a solid 7 out of 10."

","Ex-soldier Creasey (Washington), who has an unnamed violent and tragic past, takes a job bodyguarding Marc Anthony's little girl in Mexico City. The two bond, the girl is taken, and Washington goes on a rampage.<br/><br/>
Not-bad crack at a tough guy action flick. Director Tony Scott, a hack who generally panders to every sort of upbeat Hollywood cliche, is here admirably grim and gritty (at least by his standards), with some graphic violence that wouldn't have looked out of place in a Seventies era Bronson movie. There's a lot of quick cuts, MTV style montages, and Fincheresque playing around with the medium (the use of subtitles) that sometimes works, sometimes doesn't, but at least suggests Scott's motivated and interested this time out. Some absolutely beautiful location shooting in Mexico City, too.<br/><br/>The plot is crap, unfortunately, and that matters more here than it did in THE PUNISHER, say, since PUNISHER was a comic book movie with no pretensions to be anything else, while this is clearly trying to aim higher. Without spoiling anything, major entities have to act in bizarre ways, major characters have to behave pretty incredibly, and minor characters have important roles but unclear motivations (partly because the information is withheld from us -- I suspect editing's at fault). I did like, though, the fact that the nature of Washington's pain is never revealed, as well as the rather sad ending. Again, that's more bracing stuff than Tony Scott normally delivers.<br/><br/>Washington's always believable in tough guy roles, and he's good here, for the most part. Nobody does righteous rage like Washington. The movie takes it's time, mainly to set up the relationship between Washington and the girl so that the subsequent action has meaning. I understand the concept but fault the execution -- Washington does not relax very convincingly onscreen, and the bonding scenes seemed rather painful to me. The girl Dakota is sometimes okay and believable, sometimes preternaturally aware in the typical Hollywood tradition. Frankly I found her more evocative as a kind of ghost haunting Washington, than as a presence.<br/><br/>Not bad, but probably only worth renting, where you can skip past the slow stuff and concentrate on the good sections. With Christopher Walken (looking rather frail and old, I thought) and an almost-unrecognizable Mickey Rourke."
"redeyemick","10","0","1","24 April 2004"," Refreshing approach to movie making!
","I applaud Tony Scott for sticking his neck out and showing some artistic talent!!  The editing was awesome!  Without it the story would have lost it's meaning and effect.  Creasy was a tormented man, Tony Scott grasped the feeling of what it was like to be that character.<br/><br/>The story itself was put together very well.  Taking real life stories and mixing them up, worked well in this case.  It leaves the audience with the thought, ""Was this a true story?""<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone that is looking for something different that is not the same old shoot 'em up action movie with special effects. No, Keanu Reeves is not flying head over heals (Thank God!) instead, we are exposed to real talent in an artistic sense.  With so many movies being produced let's see more of this kind of work that sparks the imagination!!"

I predict that Man on Fire will be nominated in every major Oscar category and will when Best Picture as well as Best Actor for Denzel Washington. Denzel's performance is outstanding as is Mrs. Fanning. Further kudos must be given to the Direction of the film, great job Mr. Scott and the cinematography; there were many scenes that took the audience from a theater to Mexico City.

Scott's rapid fire and surrealistic directing was what made this film so likable to me and drawing personal comparisons to David Fincher (Fight Club) and Stephen Soderbergh's Traffic, but Denzel, as always, really pulls everything together with another Training Day-esc performance. Kudos to both for taking an overused melodrama and turning into very solid and original picture. I will strongly recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of unconvential direction and look forward to future projects from Tony Scott."

","Man On Fire is at least an improvement on the Scott Glenn movie that it's a remake of, but it could have been so much better than it is that thinking about the movie is ultimately very frustrating.  The script is solid (at least until the goofy illogical ending) and the film boasts an exceptionally gifted cast, but Tony Scott's jerky direction is obnoxious beyond belief. Scott can't keep his camera still for five seconds and all the jittery cutting and moving and tricks he plays with the speed of the film severely undercut the performances and storytelling.  I have never been a fan of Tony Scott and I never will, but this is easily his worst directed movie since The Hunger, his first feature and another one that was overdirected to the extreme detriment of the script.  Scott's style is at least bearable when he has weak material like Enemy of the State, but he doesn't alter his style based on the needs of the script he is directing.  Someone like Clint Eastwood with a more reserved classical style could have taken this exact same script and cast and made a shatteringly powerful thriller.  Instead Tony Scott made a two and a half hour head-ache."
