"JustCuriosity","9","57","70","15 March 2011"," A Charming film about Love, Family, and Wrestling
","Win Win is a charming delightful film about an ordinary family dealing with the struggles of everyday life. Writer/Director Tom McCarthy should be commended for his excellent work. Paul Giamatti – a true everyman actor – delivers a wonderful performance as a lawyer and wrestling coach struggling with the challenges of family and money in New Jersey. In the process of taking guardianship for an elderly client Giamatti's character, Mike Flaherty, becomes enmeshed in the old man's family when the old man's grandson shows up literally on his front doorstep. The teenager turns out to be an incredible wrestler, which is a great asset to Mike's awful wrestling team. And then things begin to get complicated. Giamatti specializes in bringing forth flawed characters that are delightfully human. This is a funny, sweet film that combines comedy and drama. Win Win also reminds us that family goes well beyond blood relatives; family is the constantly evolving circle of people that we love and care about. I literally walked out of theater just feeling much better than when I walked in. That has to be one of the best ways to judge any film."
"dfranzen70","8","77","98","4 March 2011"," Terrific sleeper
","Win Win is a terrific multigenre sleeper. It's funny, even hilarious; it has mystery and action; and it features brilliant performances by the always-reliable Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan. It's also not a movie that wallows in treacly messages, and it's not a movie that uses sports as a crutch for ""finding one's inner strength."" In short, it's a wonderful, top-notch movie.<br/><br/>Giamatti plays Mike Flaherty, a small-time lawyer who's running low on cash. He moonlights as coach of the local high-school team, which is, to put it bluntly, terrible. In a burst of fiscal sanity, Mike offers to become legal guardian for Leo, one of his clients (played by the crusty Burt Young), who's just been declared legally incapacitated. Why? Because as his guardian, Mike gets $1500 a month. But since he wants to avoid the extra hassle of actually taking care of Leo, he puts him in a nice home. Seriously, it's a nice home, with nice people and a big flat-screen TV.<br/><br/>At this point, the movie wants us on Mike's side – sort of. He needs the cash, and he doesn't really want to tell his wife Jackie (Ryan) that they're running low, not with two young daughters to care for as well. Plus he's coach of a terrible team and is just swimming in stress. Swimming in it. So much so that while jogging to work off the stress, he suffers a panic attack.<br/><br/>Just when Mike thinks some of his problems have been solved, teenage Kyle (Alex Shaffer) walks into his life. Kyle, it turns out, his Leo's grandson, and they've never met. Kyle's been sent by his mom to visit Leo. At first, this complicates things – especially when Kyle seems awfully reluctant to go back home to Ohio – but then Mike's remaining big problem is solved. It turns out the kid is a gifted wrestler. Who'd have thought that? He looks scrawny, but in practices Kyle shows he has the mettle. And thus things are riding well for Mike.<br/><br/>But this would be a truly dull (if inspirational) movie if things continued to ride well. One thing we learn early on is that Mike intentionally misled the judge in Leo's case, giving the impression that he would be actively taking care of Leo. But things really get going when Kyle's druggie mom (Melanie Lynskey) shows up to bring her boy back – and to take over as Leo's guardian.<br/><br/>Too often, Giamatti has played real sad-sack characters, guys who just can't seem to catch a break, guys who suffer at the hands of fickle fate. Not so here. Mike isn't exactly a conniving mastermind, but he's not an idiot, either, and he deals with each situation with logic and reason, even as they spiral further out of his control. It's a typically masterful Giamatti performance, and for once he's not a total loser who's in over his head. He's even a half-decent coach who simply has a lackluster team to work with.<br/><br/>Giamatti's not alone, though. I really got a kick out of Amy Ryan's performance as his somewhat-exasperated spouse Jackie, who's not terribly fond of suddenly having a teenage boy around at first. A few years back, Ryan turned in an Oscar-nominated performance as a native Bostonian in Gone Baby Gone. Ryan had a thick, believable Boston accent then. Here, she's playing a New Jersey native, but at no point does she go overboard with the Jersey Shore dialect. That's what good actresses can do – they can dial it back when they have to and show a little nuance.<br/><br/>Win Win is not a stand-up-and-cheer movie, although the audience at the screening I attended applauded when it was over. It's not a crime drama, and it doesn't really have a lot of twists to its plot. What makes it work are all of the truly sincere, dead-on performances: by Giamatti, Ryan, Shaffer, Lynskey, Bobby Cannavale, and even Jeffrey Tambor as one of Mike's wrestling assistant coaches. Not a sour note in the bunch, everyone at the top of his or her game.<br/><br/>This might have fared well, critically, if it were released during awards season. It sort of reminded me of last year's Greenburg, starring Ben Stiller, only funnier and sweeter. Win Win is a charming, quiet movie that reminds us that, as the Grateful Dead once told us, once in a while you can get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right."
"michael-mccann-858-974258","8","41","51","11 March 2011"," very sweet and very funny film
","Actor-turned-director Tom McCarthy has put together a fine third feature in Win Win. All of his films tend to have compact stories that are small in scope but feature a very focused lens on the lives of their characters.<br/><br/>One might say that Win Win is perhaps his most conventional dramedy, as it features a normal suburban family with normal suburban problems. Paul Giamatti is ""Mike Flaherty"" an attorney with a small practice who's also a high school wrestling coach. He's not perfect, but he's doing the best he can. He and his wife ""Jackie"" (the always wonderful Amy Ryan) are busy raising two kids and leading their quiet life. But when Mike gives into temptation to become the guardian of one his elderly clients (for the $1,500 a month commission) things get to be a little more complicated. The client's grandson, a troubled 16-year-old kid named ""Kyle"" (Alex Shaffer) comes to stay with his grandfather while his mother goes through her drug treatment. Since his grandfather is living in a retirement home, Kyle ends up staying with Mike and Jackie, who feel compelled to help the kid out.<br/><br/>The film is funny and sweet and paints a really true-to-life portrait of its characters. No one is purely good or purely bad, they're all just human. They make mistakes, whether large or small, and they try to make up for them. In that way, the film will strike a nice honest chord with most of its audience.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti is great in this, giving a much lower key performance than some of his previous works like American Splendor, Sideways, and even ""John Adams."" He falls into the suburban dad character very well and wears the character's skin rather nicely. Amy Ryan is always a joy to see on-screen, but I was a bit disappointed that her character was a little one-dimensional, depicting her primarily as a stay at home housewife and mother. Bobby Cannavale and Jeffrey Tambor are fun to watch as well, but serve generally to provide comedic relief (which they do in abundance) and their characters aren't nearly as well painted as Mike or Kyle.<br/><br/>Alex Shaffer, in his very first role, holds his own among some heavyweight actors. I thought some of the emotional scenes were a bit rough for him, but if he decides to continue his acting, more experience will only help to mature his instincts and abilities. Now, outside those heavily emotional scenes, Shaffer is great. His sort of deadpan, monotone delivery works very well for the character.<br/><br/>Kudos go out to Thomas McCarthy's directorial style and talent. He's put together three solid films, all of them equally enjoyable and smart. With Win Win, he's proved he can move past the ""loner"" archetype of his previous films and move into something more family oriented and encompassing of more characters (although when I think about it The Station Agent had that type of familial quality to it in the friends that Finbar meets). Either way, McCarthy is batting 1.000 in my book and has yet to have a misstep.<br/><br/>When the film releases on March 18th, I'd highly recommend people go and check it out. It's a very sweet and very funny film that deserves the large audience it hopefully will get."
"JimmyCollins","6","26","32","15 August 2011"," A nice film for a quiet afternoon.
","Paul Giamatti is awesome, simple as that. Such a talented actor, I have yet to see him in a film that I haven't enjoyed. So of course Win Win is the next on the list on his impressive resume, the story was surprisingly quite complex but not difficult to keep track of which is the work of a great director.<br/><br/>The character of Jack is very reminiscent of Giamatti's character from Storytelling, a guy somewhat down on his luck who just can't seem to get ahead or on top of things, of course these films are very different but the similarities are definitely there.<br/><br/>Amy Ryan impressed me a lot, I've never seen her in anything before but after seeing this I look forward to catching other films with her, she has a great presence in screen and her and Giamatti work excellently together... Also worth mentioning is the always fantastic Jeffrey Tambor, equally as cool as Giamatti.<br/><br/>The only thing I thought didn't work was Melanie Lynskey, that woman has one of the sweetest faces and personalities, and seeing her playing a gold digging, backstabbing selfish mother just didn't work. I still love her though.<br/><br/>A nice film that is not groundbreaking, but especially entertaining and pleasant to watch."
"napierslogs","8","34","44","24 April 2011"," Great characters looking for something in life and ""Win Win"" just might be that something
","As in Thomas McCarthy's first film, ""The Station Agent"", there is an  air of loneliness to the characters in ""Win Win"" but also with an  ability to be kind and with a whole lot of humour permeating  throughout. Mike (Paul Giamatti) is approaching a mid-life crisis; the  monotony of daily life and money troubles colliding. But this is a well  written film and it doesn't look or feel like a mid-life crisis.  Just as we get to know the characters exceedingly well (despite the  short air time for some - Bobby Cannavale's Terry), a plot is  introduced. Mike starts acting like a sleazy lawyer just to make some  easy money, even though he's anything but a sleazy lawyer. Because he's  a good guy, realities quickly catch up, and he starts taking  responsibility for a troubled kid. Mostly trying to assuage his guilt  of wrong-doing, but this kid happens to be a wrestling phenom and Mike  is a struggling high school wrestling coach. This film could easily  turn into an underdog sports story, but as I said before, this is a  well written film and it doesn't look or feel like an underdog sports  story.  I found ""Win Win"" to be a great mix of character study, a mid-life  crisis, and an underdog sports story all rolled into something that  isn't any of the above. It's a light, funny, enjoyable slice of life  that could provide a few lessons on morality but stops itself before it  becomes condescending."
"Jazzist-H-Crisp","8","18","23","8 June 2011"," Intriguing dilemmas and a splash of humour
","The story-line of Win Win brings difficult and realistic moral issues before us, which engage our interest and challenge our sympathies. But the film is not a ponderous work of moral theory, fortunately. Instead, it has many humorous moments which keep the tone quite light, even as the film raises some darker problems.<br/><br/>The first dilemma concerns the subterfuge that lawyer Mike Flaherty (Paul Giametti) employs to win the maintenance award for looking after his elderly client Leo who suffers from Alzheimers disease. The dilemma is not so much his (he needs the money too badly and he has a family to provide for), as ours - should we sympathise or not? Mike is a lawyer, yet he deceives the court and thus breaks the law. Yet, at the same time, Leo does not really lose out because the home that Mike puts him in is very comfortable. In a way, Mike's deceit is a win-win solution that solves Mike's financial problems and also provides proper care for Leo. But surely deceit cannot be condoned? Or can it? While we are still dealing with that issue, an entirely different one looms up and takes over the story. Leo's grand-son arrives, looking for his grand-father, Leo, who is now in the care home. Not only does this plot development add a lot of tension (because Mike's deceit is in danger of being exposed), it also adds further complications on the moral front. The first is, should Mike tell Kyle the truth, or is it better to try and help Kyle personally while leaving him in the dark? Should we really expect Mike to confess, when the result will be disastrous for so many people and achieve very little, apart from establishing the truth about Leo's transfer to the care home? Once again, we are just beginning to settle one problem when another arrives to add further complications, this time in the shape of Kyle's mother, Leo's daughter, who has never shown any interest in her father, but now shows a mercenary interest in his state of dependency.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. There is a lightness in the telling of the story, which makes the whole experience a pleasure, but it is a story with some difficult issues to set before us, issues such as the care of the elderly and the rights of birth-parents over foster-parents, which give us food for thought. Above all, however, the film is very well acted and the characters are brought to life very effectively, persuading us of the reality of the issues which it raises, but also coaxing us to temper our judgment of our fellow human beings. The film reminds us that life is rarely as clear-cut as our stern guilty-or-innocent judgments would require."
"jdesando","Null","25","34","7 April 2011"," A Winner
","I enjoy Royal Tenenbaums, Juno, and Little Miss Sunshine because they're about eccentric, witty people whose foibles are made less than tragic, their dialogue hypnotizes, and their personas seduce. Then comes Win Win, not as ingenious or innovative as those films but a winner in its own right because it embellishes little while it stays real and lovingly humane.<br/><br/>A little like my family and other interesting neighbors, Win Win has love to spare. Mike (Paul Giamatti) has a failing law practice, moonlights as a high school wrestling coach, and now becomes custodian of elderly Leo Poplar (Burt Young) because Mike needs the $1500 a month. Soon complication arrives with bleached blond Kyle (Alex Schaffer), Leo's grandson, who wants to live with Leo.<br/><br/>Mike is thus faced with more complications than he bargained for in the caretaker role, yet a bit of light shines through as he deals with the taciturn Kyle, who happens to be an excellent wrestler. Mike's relationship with his wife, Jackie (Amy Ryan), is rich with respect between both and patience on her part as she helps Mike through his ethical challenge and his guidance of Kyle.<br/><br/>Nothing comes easy in this dramedy, as it doesn't for most of us, but the beauty of this film is that it slowly works out all the kinks of life in a slowly distributed narrative with triumphs and setbacks that seem to come naturally. Because the central characters are loving and largely benign, the film has an easy, unforced quality.<br/><br/>Terry (Bobby Cannavale) is especially likable as Mike's old wrestling buddy, recently split from his wife, and full of energy to channel as assistant coach helping with their new wrestling star. Cannavale brings an easy charm to the film; he's an enjoyable foil for the schlubby, depressive Giammatti.<br/><br/>Although a few swear words, mostly ""f bombs,"" are dotted in the dialogue, it is essentially a family where the characters live to love."
"mandy-1","9","26","36","17 April 2011"," ""Win Win"" is a Winner!
","Like enduring friendships, ""Win Win"" grows and deepens as it unfolds. The characters become more dear, the laughs get louder and the plot thickens.<br/><br/>Writer, director Thomas McCarthy (who also wrote and directed one of my all time favorite movies, ""The Station Agent"") has created a group of characters as strange and wonderful as real people, but with better lines. Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan are perfect. New-comer Alex Shaffer as a troubled teen wrestler creates a whole new kind of cool. Bobby Cannavale (also from ""The Station Agent) sparkles in every scene.<br/><br/>If you want to see writing, directing and acting at it's best go see ""Win Win."" You'll win too."
"maria-m-larson","8","18","24","19 February 2011"," Win Win was not a lose lose
","I could say its a wrestling movie but that would be a very big oversight on my part and this movie deserves more then that. You wouldn't call The Fighter just a boxing movie would you. I am no professional movie reviewer but I tell it like I see it. When I say a movie is good to me that means it made me feel something and made me think. This movie did just that ... I laughed and I wouldn't call it a comedy ... I felt frustrated much like the main character Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti) who is an Attorney by day and by late afternoon he is a high school wrestling coach who's team is for a lack of a better word sucks. I didn't cry but I could say that I did get a warm happy feeling without all the sap. This Attorney, Father, Coach, and Husband (Mike) who is trying to keep it all together stumbles into another family very different from his own. An old man who is slowly losing his mind, his grandson who wrestles more then he talks, and his daughter who believes she is owed her inheritance. Mike is just trying to do right for his family and as a man. Life is not always simple and some times we need to make those hard decisions ... but if you make those decisions from the right intentions and you might find that in the end it all works its way out. Good movie that deals with real life situations of relatable characters. Well written, well directed, and well performed so over all a Win Win on my list."
"neil-476","7","9","11","27 May 2011"," Neither fish nor fowl, but engaging nonetheless
","I'm not too sure what to make of Win Win. Paul Giamatti is Mike. His law practice is going down the tubes, and the high school wrestling team he coaches is rubbish and loses every match it plays. When he gets involved in Leo (Burt Young)'s affairs - Leo is in the early stages of Alzheimer's and his daughter is absent with a drug habit - he sees an opportunity to put Leo in a home (Leo wants to stay in his house) and pocket the management fee paid by the State. It then turns out that Leo comes with a teenage grandson who happens to be a phenomenal wrestler. And then the daughter turns up.<br/><br/>This film doesn't conveniently fit into any category. It is sometimes amusing, but it's no comedy. There are elements of Karate Kid and Rocky in the wrestling matches. And, most of all, it is a morality play of sorts:Leo's actions put him in a difficult place, but he develops as a person as a result. In that respect I suppose the film is quite successful, and it benefits from believable performances from all the principal characters.<br/><br/>Where it falls down is in that there are a number of areas where it simply isn't believable. While I can understand Mike falling victim to temptation, surely he would then have gone on to arrange to rent out Leo's house? The sums didn't really add up here. And I found it difficult to believe he would have got off so lightly, notwithstanding the daughter's attitude. And the wrestling grandson was a major coincidence.<br/><br/>Having said that, I was quite happy to live with these reservations, and I found the movie quietly pleasing."
"rhrunge","4","7","10","16 September 2013"," TV Movie of the Week, at best
","Seemed to recall there was good critical buzz on this movie so I just gave it a shot the other day on cable. Yes, I can see how some might find a movie like this ""charming"" or ""refreshingly different"", but for me there wasn't enough movie here. At best, this was at the level of a TV movie of the week. Maybe it was just me but I personally felt like the movie kept insinuating that several of the characters had some deep, dark secrets yet to be revealed. But this actually never happened. Paul Giamatti's character: a decent, honest guy does something morally questionable. Why? A secret to be revealed? Nope, just a few bucks short on the mortgage payments. Meanwhile, spends a lot of time coaching but not a lot of time being a lawyer. The best friend(Bobby Canavale) comes across almost perversely infatuated with the blonde kid, but nope, no story there. We first see the blonde kid bruised and black-eyed? Victim of physical abuse? Yes? No? The mom, what secrets is she hiding? Well, nothing really."
"fordraff","Null","8","12","14 May 2011"," Made-for-TV Movie
","This film is nothing more than a Made-for-TV type movie. I went to see it because it played at the local art house; in fact, the movie seems to be playing mainly in art houses across the country. Does the presence of Paul Giamatti automatically result in a film's being shown in art houses? An art house release led me to expect something far superior to this.<br/><br/>At any event, within ten or fifteen minutes, you will know the entire plot because you have seen this film hundreds of times previously. Disturbed teenage boy finds a new life with his foster parents (so to speak) and his participation in sports to live happily ever after. Dad also learns a lesson. There is barely an iota of plausibility in this film. And the actors are all better qualified to handle the parts than the parts demand of them. A waste of talented actors. A waste of my time and admission fee."

","A small-town lawyer fallen on hard times sees a way to exploit a rich client and help his family out of a financial hole. The plan works well till the client's grandson turns up, and then begins a process of unravelling and recrimination. Paul Giamatti is perfectly cast as the well-intentioned lawyer, a good man in an indifferent universe trying to keep it all together. Alex Shaffer absolutely nails the taciturn teenage Kyle. The offspring of a drug-addicted single mother, he gives off that world weariness and flinty edge that emanates from a child that has seen too much too young. The script is full of finely observed little moments, touches of pathos and humour, dotted with those little reversals that life lobs at us like hand grenades. When Kyle's mother shows up suddenly with legal representation, you can feel the knots in your stomach beginning to form. Genuine in its intentions, and stripped of sentimentality, this is a rewarding, entertaining film with no discordant notes."

","This film is exactly the thing I rail most against in cinema. More so than crappy low-budget films, or bad genre films or obviously tinny dialog... it's this kind of thing. Where obviously capable, talented people pretend to be artistically ambitious by tackling very real lives and very human situations, then turn around and create the most fake, trite, saturated approximation of life you can imagine. This is what I call the Sundance Factor. Movies that claim to be about life but are really less true in their minutia than a ""Lord of the Rings"" movie. Every glance, every human interaction, every performance, every depiction of struggle, misunderstanding and realization, every character is acted up, tarted out, over cooked and absolutely full of crap. Which would be alright if it was funny. But it's not funny. Not at all, despite the terribly stereo-typical, shallow, cringe-inducing, comic-relief character played by Bobby Cannavale.<br/><br/>If you as a filmmaker are going to have this much of a disregard for the way people really act, speak and think then for god's sake, have someone in your film pull a gun out so at least I won't be bored.<br/><br/>Suck Suck."

And when it comes to money issues, family usually go hand in hand. Mike Flaherty decides to take guardianship of a old guy named Leo that suffers from dementia and in return will get paid $1500 a month.

And Kyle ends up spending a lot of time with Mike's family and gives Mike a motivation in life since he turns out to be a prodigy when it comes to wrestling. And Mike shows Kyle affection. So it's win win for both sides. The thing is the build up for this movie just seems so darn forced sometimes and doesn't come off natural. This movie slightly reminded me of ""The Blind Side"" but just didn't move the heartstrings as much. Cause almost everything about this movie just seem drastic. I however like how it didn't try to sugarcoat everything, which would have took away the main positive element going for this flick. If this movie had a more natural and touching build up it would have left an impact and would have been a real indie gem. It just has a slow dull beginning and only gets slightly emotional and entertaining later on but everything is just so darn predictable in almost every way.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Name the film: A well-to-do Southern family takes in a homeless  teenager. His talent in football and the love of a family lead him to a  better life in this heartwarming and uplifting crowd-pleaser. ( I hope  I didn't blindside you with the obviousness of my clues.)  Now, let's follow that same formula with a few changes in tow. Name  this film: A well-to-do ( middle class ) Southern ( New Jersey ) family  takes in a homeless teenager. His talent in football ( wrestling ) and  the love of a family lead him to a better life in this heartwarming and  uplifting crowd-pleaser.  The answer: Win Win, the latest independent film written and directed  by Thomas McCarthy ( The Visitor, The Station Agent ) follows the  Flaherty family, an average all-American family who are trying to eke  out a living in today's economy. Mike ( Paul Giamatti ) is a small town  lawyer and Jackie ( Amy Ryan ) is his loyal loving wife. Also part of  this slightly clichéd family unit are two cute little girls, but, alas,  no dog! Mike finds an aimless young boy at the doorstep of an elderly  client and gives him a place to stay. The boy, Kyle, is the silent  brooding type, a loner who has had a hard-knock life. Escaping his  drug-addicted mother ( Melanie Lynskey ), he begins to befriend this  family and build a more positive self-image through his wrestling  skills. Oh, yes, Mike is also the high school wrestling coach, hence  the title.  This low key film has a very slow start, introducing minor characters  as comic relief which does nothing to advance the storyline. It's not  until the character of Kyle enters the film that the plot begins to  cohere. That bond is due to the fine acting of newcomer Alex Shaffer  who is perfectly cast in that role and Giamatti as his adoptive father  figure. In fact, all of the acting has a genuine honest sincerity that  helps the film tremendously avoid the pitfalls of sentimentality and  mawkishness.   McCarthy wisely sidesteps those obvious moments with his well written  screenplay, giving the film's characters depth and nuance with his  artful way with conversational dialogue. Even though its familiar plot  structure follows the tried-and-true win-winning formula of other  feel-good films of this genre, Win Win is an entertaining enough film  that benefits from its talented cast and its interesting characters.  And when you tally it all up, that still makes it a win-win situation  for any moviegoer. GRADE: B-"

","Win Win is the third film from talented writer/director Thomas McCarthy, and like his past indie gems The Visitor & The Station Agent he finds a way to bring out an unexpected humor from the scenes in unique ways. Although his third film isn't necessarily a step up from his past endeavors, it's obvious McCarthy knows how to tell a good story.<br/><br/>Win Win is blessed with a talented cast, and although there isn't any major stretches or performances to be blown away by, it's a talented cast from top to bottom who are very comfortable bringing these characters to life. Paul Giamatti (Sideways, American Splendor) showcases his usual mastery of the lovable loser schlub that most real people can relate to. Amy Ryan, playing the Jersey wife and protective mother with a love of Jon Bon Jovi, continues to show off her acting range from her role as Michael Scott's soul mate Holly on The Office, to her tour de force Academy Award nominated role in 2007's Gone Baby Gone.<br/><br/>Newcomer Alex Shaffer displays a subtle maturity as a teenager hiding the pain from a neglectful childhood. Burt Young, best know for his role as Paulie in the Rocky movies, is terrific as Leo, an aging man dealing with the early stages of dementia. He says so much with just the smallest grin across his face.<br/><br/>Melanie Lynskey, probably best known as the crazy neighbor Rose on the popular sitcom Two and a Half Men, playing the greedy daughter and washed up, absentee mother continues to find ways to shine with the smallest of character parts. From her bit roles in Up in the Air, The Informant & Away We Goit's only a matter of time before she gets her shot at some starring roles.<br/><br/>Although Win Win isn't as deep as McCarthy's past films, and didn't leave a lasting impression and keep me thinking about the movie long after the credits rolled, it found a way to accomplish something most films don't. It tells an entertaining, realistic, believable storyand I'm okay with that.<br/><br/>For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com"

"avik-basu1889","8","2","3","4 September 2015"," A small, understated, heartwarming film !!!
","'Win Win' is the quintessential American Indie film. It has brilliant acting, believable characters and relateable themes, but unfortunately it isn't flashy enough to get the attention of either the box office or the Academy. But it did get a lot of critical acclaim. The story exposes us to Mike Flaherty played by Paul Giamatti a small time lawyer and his family and friends. He is a lawyer and also coaches a school wrestling team. Due to certain interesting events, Mike comes across a teenage boy named Kyle who is the grandson of Leo, one of Mike's clients. Kyle turns out to be a wrestler which ends up being a blessing for Mike's wrestling team. Kyle's introduction in Mike's life changes both of them and they realise a few things about themselves and decide to make some changes in their lives.<br/><br/>Mike and Kyle's relationship is symbiotic and mutually beneficial in nature. Mike clearly sees a lot of himself in Kyle and ends up learning a lot about himself and what he needs to do to sort his life out and how to be 'in control'. They both end up making significant life decisions after coming into contact with each other. Now a film like that where characters start to change each other for the better and start learning things can be cheesy and heavy-handed, but this one remained true and believable due to the witty writing and brilliant acting. Both these characters start a new life at the end of the movie by changing themselves and letting go of their obstinacy and their egos. The film ends on a very sweet and poignant note and gives us an hint that Mike has decided to take control of his life instead of wallowing in self pity and allowing life to get the better of him.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is top class all across the board. Paul Giamatti is a ridiculously talented actor. He is very versatile. You will find him in big budget films and then you will find him in these small indie films. His best performances are in these character driven films with him playing very average guys. His character in the film does a few questionable things, but due to Giamatti's likability and the gentle and humanistic way in which the script treats the character, the viewer will understand the circumstances that forced him to do what he did. Amy Ryan as Jackie, Mike's wife is also great. She brings a lot of heart and believability to a character which could have been easily reduced to a clichéd one. She like Giamatti is also very versatile. I have seen her before in 'Gone Baby Gone' and 'Birdman' and she is brilliant in those films too, but not many talk about her too much. Alex Shaffer as Kyle is also very solid. He might come across a bit one-note, but I think that is exactly what the character required. A brash, soft- spoken, introverted boy will be just like the way he portrayed Kyle. But having said that, there are some soft vulnerable moments, where Alex beautifully emotes in a nuanced way and it works. Bobby Cannavale, Jeffrey Tambor, Melanie Lynskey and Burt Young all have minor roles, but they all perform with merit.<br/><br/>This is the perfect example of a film where the importance is wholeheartedly given to the substance instead of the style. There is nothing remarkable going on with the way the film is shot. It's just Thomas McCarthy letting his story and screenplay flow organically without any extravagance. His characters are well rounded and realistic. They have merits and flaws and everything that make up a three dimensional human being. The subtexts and themes are dealt with in a subtle way without any preachy stuff. It's a film that blends American cinematic elements with the classic Italian neo- realism which is attempted by many of the new age American indie films. <br/><br/>The only flaw is that Kyle, the boy that Mike meets accidentally, conveniently turns out to be a brilliant wrestler which helps out Mike with his team. This co-incidence that you will have to accept does initially make the film look a bit clichéd and predictable, but once you accept it, the film progresses in a fluid manner and it is not without some subtle and unpredictable twists.<br/><br/>'Win Win' is a small, understated film about average people with real problems. The film is humanistic, funny, optimistic and has a great feel- good air about it. Big recommendation."

","Just watched this movie a second time and it's every bit as satisfying. Starts off like many other indie pics set in small town America but in no time it's springing surprises and developing extra dimensions. Everyone is great in it, and all their dilemmas and quandaries are ones we've been through - no-one's a hero and no-one's a zero, they're just doing the best they can to survive. Also a great study of a neglected child who works out his frustrations through wrestling and finds a loving home after escaping the inadequacy and selfishness of his junkie mum. Not for the first time, IMDb wants me to be more long-winded about this and extend my review to ten lines but I can't really find anything more to say - just check it out!"

","This film came to me as a total surprise. I wasn't acquainted with any of the actors or the director and I've obviously missed out on something wonderful. ""Win Win"" is a remarkably warm movie without being sentimental at all. It captures the age and personality of its teen-age protagonist perfectly and without prejudice - the young teen who doesn't talk much at all and the grown-ups who talk too much at times. This has some of the best and the most hilarious dialog I've heard in years, impeccably timed. I, for one, had no idea at all what was going to happen and found myself glued to the set throughout. This was a win/win for everyone involved."
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","3","20 March 2012"," Morally dubious but eminently watchable
","Paul Giamatti is a terrific actor with a deceptively naturalistic style and I really enjoyed his big screen work in movies like ""Sideways"" and his small screen performance in the series ""John Adams"". Here writer and director Tom McCarthy provides Giamatti with an appealing role as Mike Flaherty, a lawyer in a small New Jersey town who is facing a hard time financially and makes a wrong decision that nevertheless ultimately has some welcome consequences.<br/><br/>The decision and the consequences revolve around the aged Leo (Burt Young) who is in the early stages of dementia and his weird teenage grandson Kyle (Alex Shaffer). Along the way, Mike has to wrestle with his conscience, while Kyle wrestles with a high school team, with both coming out on top in a tale that is perhaps a little too neat and oddly amoral but often wryly amusing and eminently watchable."

","Despite the title 'Win Win' doesn't indeed feature much winning, but instead the consequences from actions and the ripples of repercussions that follow said incidents. Paul Giamatti stars as lawyer Mike Flaherty, a family man, down on his luck and trying his hardest to keep everything afloat. However after a chain of events he stumbles into temporary adoption of a teenager known as Kyle who may be the motivation that the lost character needs.<br/><br/>Billed as a comedy but coming across with more substance than anything you'd expect. A plot that builds itself up to comical instances but never does. It takes a more calmer and human approach often giving the characters more personality and a higher chance for the audience to connect. The film revolves around mistakes and how each player must find a way around them, which is probably a catalyst for the title. The characters gain personal victories but not through the traditional and heroic way that is usually portrayed. Mike takes advantage of one of his clients who is in late stages of dementia for his own personal win, Kyle is filled to the brim with a troubled past and various other characters are flawed, none are perfect.<br/><br/>The only problem with Win Win is that it's too neat. It spends a good portion making imperfect and damaged characters to only bring it to a traditional and clean conclusion. This is more than likely down to the uplifting vibe that the film slowly builds throughout, but it would have been refreshing to see a darker and more human ending. That said the film is fantastic in every other respect. The screenplay is phenomenal, written and directed by Thomas McCarthy who also worked on Disney's 'Up'. Every line feels nigh on perfectly written and is reminiscent of real world dialogue from real world people. It's a refreshing and uplifting comedy that brings a lot more to the table than you might expect."
"estebangonzalez10","9","2","3","2 March 2012"," You can't lose if you watch this film!
","¨I wanna go to Ohio and beat the crap out of his mom. ¨ Thomas McCarthy has once again directed a successful family drama (slash comedy, slash sport film) that will be remembered for its heartwarming characters. McCarthy has a tendency for writing and directing these kind of movies with memorable, yet ordinary characters who aren't perfect, but have something special about them in some way or another. He did it in his previous films with The Station Agent and The Visitors where we have very silent characters with flaws, but who discover something good about themselves through the new and unconventional relations they make. I would say that the heart of his films don't rely so much on the characters that he introduces, but in the interactions between them, and that is why the story and characters flourish in his stories. Win Win is no exception and perhaps this is an even improved film over its predecessors because we have much more different interactions between the characters, and you can even include the sport element that makes this movie all that more attractive. Of course McCarthy can't make a good film if he doesn't have a good cast because the heart of his films revolve around these characters and how they interact with each other. In Win Win he has just that: an excellent cast, beginning with a superb leading performance from Paul Giamatti, and a great supporting cast which include the always reliable Amy Ryan, Jeffrey Tambor, Bobby Cannavale, Melanie Lynskey, and Burt Young, plus a memorable performance from newcomer Alex Shaffer who is the heart and motor of the story. I really didn't get that much into the story until he showed up, and he really changes the pace and momentum of the movie once his character is introduced some fifteen minutes into the film. The mystery about his past and the way he interacts with Giamatti and Ryan are the soul of this drama, while Cannavale and Tambor's performance work more as the comedic relief.<br/><br/>Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti) is a lawyer and father of two young daughters living with his wife Jackie (Amy Ryan) in a New Jersey superb. Mike is trying to survive in his private practice, but has been experiencing some financial difficulties which have been putting him through some anxiety attacks. He also works as a High School wrestling coach during his free time since he once used to be a decent wrestler himself. He trains the kids along with his assistant Stephen (Jeffrey Tambor), who also shares an office with him in his practice. Due to his attacks the doctor has recommended Mike to run every morning so he does so alone or along his longtime high school buddy Terry (Bobby Cannavale). An opportunity presents itself for Mike to make easy money with a client of his named Leo (Burt Young). Leo is old and suffering from dementia, but since his daughter can't be reached he is on his own and the State is worried about his wellbeing. Leo has plenty of money, but doesn't have anyone to take care of him, so Mike decides to become his legal guardian. He does it for the money since the guardian will receive 1500 dollars a month, but sends him to a house care facility once he becomes the guardian. One day an unexpected visitor shows up at Leo's house: his grandson, Kyle (Alex Shaffer) and Mike takes him to visit his grandfather. Kyle is a quiet kid who has run away from his home. Mike and Jackie take the kid in for a few days and they discover he has a great talent: he is a wrestler, so Mike signs him up with his team and believes he has received a double blessing with this whole Leo situation. The problem ensues when Kyle's mother shows up in town and Mike's past begins to haunt him.<br/><br/>I warn you don't give up on this movie due to its very slow start because it's worth the wait. The movie really doesn't reach full gear until about twenty minutes into the film when Kyle shows up. McCarthy's films tend to suffer from this slow opening because it takes time to set up the characters in the way he does. These characters are all really well developed and not even the secondary characters are one dimensional so it does take some time to set up the characters and situations, but once that is dealt with and we begin seeing these characters interact with each other the movie does pay off and pick off in an extraordinary fashion. Who would've thought wrestling could be so interesting? McCarthy really makes it so, but does it by leaving it as a side plot and not focusing entirely on the sport. The relationship between Giamatti and Shaffer are essentially the heart of this story and winning or losing becomes something secondary like it is in real life. It's this inner conflict that Giamatti has to deal with and the way he relates and begins to identify with the boy that make this such a fascinating and heartwarming film. McCarthy never tries to play with our emotions, and every single scene feels authentic and real. We are dealing with real characters, who aren't perfect and perhaps may have done some stupid or unethical things, but they try to search for some sort of redemption in order to find forgiveness. This is truly one of McCarthy's best films to date and a wonderful small movie you will want to see.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

","Ever since Juno and Little Miss Sunshine splashed onto the screen and spotlighted big-word-of-mouth indie hits, every small group wants a piece of the pie. Win Win had that feel. Only, as good as it was, it wasn't great.<br/><br/>I missed seeing this in 2011, and though it wouldn't have cracked my top ten list, it was still a watchable release.<br/><br/>The ever-somewhat lovable, everyday man Paul Giamatti plays a down on his luck/clients attorney Mike who, in order to get some cash, pushes for the care of wealthy Leo (Burt ""anything but"" Young) only it comes with a price: a teen wrestler Kyle and his asinine mother, Cindy (Melanie Lynskey.)<br/><br/>It's one of those ""lying"" stories where you can pretty much guess when the ""lies"" start revealing themselves. Mike has to lie about his intentions to his wife and to Kyle, a runaway who has potential in pro-wrestling. And Mike has to grow, as predicted.<br/><br/>The movie, while good and contains some decent dialogue, humor and realism, is really justthere. Not bad, by most means, but not powerful. Overall, I liked watching the realistic journey of this man and his kooky counterparts. It's a watch-watch, but not watch-right-now kinda film.<br/><br/>3½/5 Stars."

","I originally saw Win Win at the local sort of art theater (which is currently playing The Guard, The Trip, The Help, and The Debt) on a scratchy print that had obviously been passed around a few times before.<br/><br/>The trailer put off this fun, quirky, life's looking up vibe – Paul Giamatti plays chubby lawyer Mike who's just trying work through his wacky problems when his life is interrupted by Rob Schneider! I mean the bleach-blond up and comer Alex Shaffer. Everything gets wicka-wacky fun when his drug-addict mom shows up to reclaim her son with some shady ulterior motives and Amy Ryan gets really sassy. Just goes to show the power of editing.<br/><br/>Back up a little. Win Win is mostly actor, sometimes writer/director Thomas McCarthy's third film. I watched his previous film The Visitor in anticipation of seeing Win Win. My micro review: REALLY wanted to like it. Richard Jenkins is fantastic, the premise promises to be kind of awkward but heartwarming, but it didn't ever do anything or go anywhere. I finished the movie, but only because I had nothing else to do at the time.<br/><br/>Back to the movie on hand. It did have some funny moments, as promised in the trailer. Bobby Cannavale (Terry) put on a great show as an over- enthusiastic side-kick for Mike delivering some great lines. While I'd never accuse Giamatti of phoning anything in, he seemed to be playing that character he plays – you know, just being Paul Giamatti. Not a bad choice – I really can't see anybody else filling the role, but I felt like I'd seen it all before. Story-wise, I won't spoil the details should you choose to watch (it is a little complicated), but the premise set forth had the same general concept as The Visitor. Mike makes some choices that are sure to come to a head near the end of the film, but like McCarthy's previous film, it really falls flat on resolution. Everything is just too convenient, easy, and really unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Perhaps my love of action movies squishes my enjoyment of subtle, quiet family drama, but I really wanted there to be bigger emotion, bigger conflict, and more satisfying characters. Mad Men is a favorite of mine because everyone is so ruthless and emotional, and the characters have some serious flaws. Win Win was a no go for going to any extreme and, as a result, didn't have much of a rise an fall in story for the duration."

","""Win Win"" is a movie very much like ""Easy A"" - in that it can't make up its mind what kind of movie it is going to be. A serious movie about the wonders and frustrations of being a father, mother, son, lawyer, wrestler or coach. and/or a movie that makes light of the many obstacles and difficulties of ordinary life. I thought that Alex Shaffer was outstanding as the teenager wrestler with immense talent and a troubled background. Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan were terrific as a couple trying to deal with each new challenge in their marriage, and in their family. Each of these two actors becomes the character and then builds upon their respective roles with powerful acting skills.<br/><br/>This film acted like one that was badly edited and/or one that richly deserved to go back into post-production so that it could be allowed a more well-developed ending.<br/><br/>I thought that the role of Bobby was more of a distraction than a help.<br/><br/>And yet there were moments of greatness in this film, very heart-warming scenes in which good story, good writing and good acting all dove-tailed.<br/><br/>I would truly like to watch the director's cut of this one.<br/><br/>Alex Shaffer will be heard from again.

","Many films (for better or worse) portray an idealized form of life/drama to combat the current economic malaise. ""Win Win"" is not that kind of film; instead choosing to revel in the struggles of day-to-day life and work through them.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Win Win"" sees Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti) struggling to make a living for himself and his family. His law practice is hemorrhaging funds, the bills are piling up at home, and his health is even failing due to the anxiety. After becoming personally involved with a client (Burt Young), Mike ""inherits"" a son (Alex Shaffer) who provides a spark for his high school wrestling team and lifts his spirits. That is, of course, until life intercedes once again.<br/><br/>In better times, this might be the kind of movie that people would stay away from due to the fact that is is so down-to-earth in its portrayal of life's struggles. In tough times, though, ""Win Win"" really resonates on a personal level. The struggles of life are not black-and-white, but full of shades of grey and ambiguity.<br/><br/>Also, while the film is well-acted as a general rule, Giamatti's performance is especially moving. Giammatti is one of the great character actors of our time and never fails to shine on the big screen. There's no one who can match his style of acting in terms of combining over-the-top physical/verbal acting with dramatic intensity.<br/><br/>About the only thing that prevents this movie from being a true classic is that the climax doesn't necessarily live up to the build-up. Don't worry, though, as the rich characters and believable circumstances are more than enough to provide compelling drama and entertainment."

We watched this with our teenager and she liked it too. I never liked wrestling to watch or to take part. This film has a very good spin on it.

The entire cast was fantastic here, really rich (and real) characters) working through an entertaining and very human feeling story.

He is free and clear until Leo's grandson Kyle comes to town to stay with his grandfather, but instead ends up living with the Flahertys. The entire family soon bonds with Kyle, and to Mike's surprise he is a wrestling sensation, but all secrets come out eventually.<br/><br/>'Win WIn' is charming in the sense that it deals with normal people and everyday life. In the movie Paul Giamatti's family has money problems that need a real solution. This issue, which cannot be solved in a three minute montage with 'Push it to the Limit' playing in the background forces Giamatti's character to make the wrong decision for the right reasons. That decision's weight on his conscience is inevitably what makes him take in Leo's grandson Kyle thus redeeming himself as a likable character. Writers Koe Tiboni and Thomas McCarthy do a wonderful job creating characters with real flaws the audience can relate to thus creating the feeling that characters on the screen are as human as themselves.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan both fit perfectly into their roles as suburban parents, and in his first performance Alex Shaffer manages to hold his own with the veteran actors. The somewhat unbelievable story is told in a manner that does not leave the viewer asking questions like ""can that really happen,"" or ""would they really do that?"" ""Win Win' is not a laugh out loud dramedy (drama/comedy), but it is darkly humorous. While you are rooting for the Flaherty family, you also secretly wish them some mild misfortune because whether it be a panic attack while jogging, or a teenager out wrestling an adult, sometimes it is just nice to laugh at the misfortune of others. Watching Mike Flaherty both deceive Leo and care for Kyle,'Win Win' truly shows us that what a person will do for their family is astounding, but what they will do for a total stranger, now that's beautiful."

","""Mommy, where is Daddy?""<br/><br/>""He's running.""<br/><br/>""From what?""<br/><br/>This dialog between mother and child sets the tone for the entire Win Win journey, which is a wondrous game of lose, win, win, win, lose, win. The movie should have been called Lose, Run, Win.<br/><br/>Our Mike Flaherty, played by Paul Giamatti, is running like a Hamster in a wheel, and we all know he ain't going' anywhere. But aren't we all stalled sometimes that way? Don't we all, at some point in our lives, find that we're not on the journey we planned because fabulous people turned up who made us take a detour from our path? The detour can either be a noose around our necks or something that makes the other dreams fade. Either way, it's not a simple as just taking a left turn at the corner stop sign. And Win Win nails that. It brings to life that which is lurking in a fog behind us all.<br/><br/>Win Win's strength is the wonderful relationships between each of the characters and the protagonist, Mike Flaherty, aka the fabulous Paul Giamatti. If Giamatti looked like Colin Firth, he would have been up for an Academy Award for this role.<br/><br/>Look at this cast? Could it get any better? Mike's relationship with his wife is subtle but remarkable. It shows the mixture of love and hate that has to exist in any marriage where both parties are in it to win it, rather than in it until they can't anymore. Amy Ryan (remember her from Gone Baby Gone?) is the perfect cross between nothing special and exceptional. She has her moments of stepping up, and then stepping down. It's a great lesson: you don't always have to have a big mouth—just when you really need to make your point. But she's also more than that. Her comments, facial expressions, and actions serve as our narrator and as a commentator on all the players. In a way, she's not really a part of any of the action going on; she is just the gel that keeps it all together. I would like to be her sometimes. She has a distance from the chaos and the drama that is quite comforting.<br/><br/>Alex Shaffer plays the grandson who shows up to reverse the spiral of destruction that is on the brink of permanent with his exceptional wrestling skills. He is straight-faced through the whole thing, and I love the way he puts everyone's name at the end of each sentence. This is Alex's first film. He was chosen because he really is a great wrestler, and while that may have gotten him the role, he's also a great actor. He has a lot of complicated feelings to display with very little dialog (all of which is spot-on). His relationship with his mother is also poignant. You have to love your mother, but loving her and joining her destructive journey are two very different things. His relationship with Mike's wife is the closest to intimate that he gets, and it's perfect. Believable. Poignant. Caring. And his relationship with his new friends on the team show the understanding he has that those who are flawed are forgivable.<br/><br/>Mike's relationship with his broken friend (played by Bobby Canavale, in his first big movie role) is really about two friends who are friends because of the longevity of their history, not the commonality of their evolved selves. We all have those. Come on, don't you?<br/><br/>Win Win is all about real-life relationships and staying with them. And Paul, my new favorite actor for a day, allows us to come along in his head and experience how his days turn into months that turn into years. Go see it. Go with your spouse. Your son. Your old friend. Or go by yourself and have a bite afterward and find the parallel relationships in your own life. It's a lot of fun, and it reminds you of why they are all worth it."
"nesfilmreviews","8","1","1","1 March 2013"," A small, effective picture with heart.
","We live in an era that produces films not by standards of quality, but quantity. We have endless sequels and unspeakable remakes year after year. My God-- a remake of ""Red Dawn""? Who was fighting for this to be remade? So when a subtle and delightful film like ""Win Win"" comes around, it gives you hope in Hollywood, and reminds you of the greatness of the film medium. <br/><br/>""Win Win"" isn't a straight-up sports movie--though it does offer a few vivid scenes of triumph and loss on the mat. It doesn't obey the conventional rhythms of the genre. Tom McCarthy's ""Win Win"" sees Paul Giamatti star as Mike Flaherty, a struggling lawyer and part-time high school wrestling coach. Only trying to make ends meet financially, Mike makes some ambiguous business deals that ultimately lands him a star-studded wrestler without parents. Being the considerate family they are, Mike and his wife Jackie Flaherty (Amy Ryan), take this confused teenager in. <br/><br/>One thing leads to the next as the addition of Kyle (Alex Shaffer), on this seemingly hopeless wrestling team, proves to be successful. The once tension-filled family gets put to rest with the transformation in personality of Kyle. Then one day, Kyle's mother shows up just fresh out of drug rehab. Kyle despises her and she has merely returned into his life to pick up a long awaited paycheck from his grandfather (plot logistics that reveal to much of the story for me to explain). She makes plenty of threats, which evidently puts everything created by the Flaherty's and Kyle, in jeopardy. <br/><br/>""Win Win"" is a small--though emotionally touching character study. It's grounded and rarely steps out of the director's comfort zone. McCarthy has a very precise and intricate directorial style that makes all of his character human beings who are easy to relate to. Still, none of the film's accolades could not be given without help from the slew of great performers in display here. Amy Ryan as the hard-nosed mother, Jeffrey Tambor and Terry Delfino as assistant wrestling coaches with two completely different styles, Burt Young as the grandfather who just wants to go home, and Melanie Lynskey as Kyle's mother who has returned purely for the money--these performers are very good. However, it's Paul Giamatti and first time actor Alex Shaffer who give the film its gravitas. Giamatti is quite simply one of the best working actors we have in the entertainment business. Yet, it could be Alex Shaffer who gives the most impressive performance. Having never acted on screen before, he manages to give Kyle some emotional empathy. Shaffer's performance appears to be given so effortlessly, and by the end of the movie, he is completely convincing in the role. <br/><br/>""Win Win"" gathers all the strands (the illegal trusteeship, the wrestling team, the hazardous rapts boiler, the wrestling, the rehabbing mother, Jackie finding out about her husband's misdeeds) and wraps everything up a little to neatly. Everything clicks into place--and life seldom has uncomplicated endings. In his short career (The Station Agent, The Visitor), McCarthy has established himself as a craftsman of conventionally quirky pictures that are entirely about ingratiating themselves with the audience. He wins this fight."

Part of the reason it went so slowly is that I had a very hard time relating to the leading character (played by Paul Giamatti)---and it's hard staying focused on such a jerky guy. But, it also was just very slow. The film managed to soften this guy a tad but more importantly it brought in other characters and situations that made you care--and want to see how it all works out by the end.<br/><br/>Giamatti plays a lawyer whose practice is on the rocks. To earn some extra money, he does something unethical--he gets the court to appoint him guardian for an elderly client with the promise that he would not have the old guy (Burt Young) committed to a nursing facility but keep him home. But, instead he quickly puts the guy in an old folks home and collects a monthly stipend for being the guardian. Nice guy, huh? On the side, Giamatti works as a wrestling coach for a high school team that is just terrible. However, out of the blue, Young's grandson shows up and has no place to live--so the Coach takes him home. He and his wife soon learn that this teen has no place to live because his mom is an addict. The coach also learns, to his surprise, that the boy is a marvel at wrestling--so good, he might be good enough to get a scholarship to college! Things are looking great despite Giamatti's deception...but when the boy's mother shows up looking for money, all that they are working for appears in jeopardy.<br/><br/>Overall, despite the spicy language (which is a #$&@! shame since it would be great for teens to see this film and some parents might balk at this), this was an excellent film. It also shows you can like a film even if the leading man is very difficult (at first) to like. It is because you really do care for the kid and his relationships (such as with Giamatti's wife and best friend) are touching. I also liked it because of my insights into some of the film--I wrestled for several years and was a social worker who worked with families just like the one in the film--and it felt honest. The filmmakers did their homework and portrayed both very, very well. Well worth your time."

","An appealing film that manages to be feel-good while still allowing its audience to respect itself in the morning.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti plays a down-on-his-luck lawyer who takes under his wing the grandson of a mentally incompetent man (Burt Young) for whom he's become legal guardian. The grandson happens to be a great wrestler, much to Giamatti's happiness, since he coaches a high-school wrestling team on the side. But after initially winning the boy's affection, Giamatti must own up to some unpleasant truths, like the fact that he took guardianship of the boy's grandfather for the financial stipend he would receive while ignoring the grandfather's wishes to live in his own home instead of the senior care facility in which Giamatti places him. He becomes yet one more adult in the boy's life (his mother, who comes calling to claim him after being absentee, being another) who have disappointed him and made adulthood seem like something he should be reluctant to achieve himself.<br/><br/>""Win Win"" ends more patly and tidily than a situation like the one portrayed actually would in real life, but it's easy to forgive, because I'm a sucker for any movie about a person manning up and doing what is right when it would be so much easier to do what is wrong. The movie is casual and laid back, and the performances, from Giamatti, but also from Bobby Cannavale as Giamatti's friend and especially Amy Ryan, a scene stealer as Giamatti's wife, relaxed and charming. Writer and director Tom McCarthy, who made the equally fine ""The Station Agent"" and ""The Visitor,"" adds another quality notch to his belt.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","In an effort to clear out our DVR in time for a gazillion hours of Summer Olympics coming up, my husband and I went on an Indie film bender and watched about 10 flicks that we had recorded. Out of all of them, only two really stood out -- Win Win and In a Better World, a small Danish film. I had resisted seeing Win Win in the theater, honestly, because it didn't look like something I'd like based on the trailer. I thought it was going to be one of those feel-good, high school sports movies with the troubled kid and the coach who turns everything around and everyone goes home happy. This had many more layers to it, as all of the other positive reviews posted here will attest to.<br/><br/>My big takeaway from this film is that I really trust Paul Giamatti's choices of roles, and until he proves otherwise, I will see him in anything he does. I am also amazed at the range of characters he can play, and his ability to make a huge difference in a film even if the part he plays doesn't seem that significant in terms of screen time. Win Win was truly a vehicle for him (as the film Barney's Version was a year or so ago), and he carries it with no problem. Great supporting performances here by Amy Ryan, Bobby Cannavale (who I currently love hating in Nurse Jackie), Jeffrey Tambor, and newcomer Alex Schaffer as the kid."
"fast1966","Null","3","6","4 September 2011"," could have been a good family movie but...
","I used to wrestle, now I coach and have my 8 and 12 year old kids in wrestling, so I was happy to see a wrestling movie out. My wife and I preview movies before we watch them as a family. VERY disappointed with this movie. I think the first word of the movie is S@#t spoken by a little girl. Cursing throughout the show.<br/><br/>Some may say that, well that's how people speak in the real world. True, but it wasn't always that way. I grew up knowing that if I cursed there would be trouble. I work in the oilfields of western Canada, and cursing is part of the day to day lingo, and yes, unfortunately I do it.<br/><br/>But when I get home with my family, I flip the switch and my language is g-rated. My wife and kids don't need to hear me talking the toilet language that goes on on the job and in 'the real world' when I am at home. Just because society is degenerating to a place where cussing and crass language is the norm does not mean I will raise my kids that way.<br/><br/>Sad that there aren't any movie studios that make family movies without the toilet language. The cursing in this movie didn't make the story or movie any better or any more real. In fact, having a child swear within the first few minutes of the show blew it for me. <br/><br/>This could have been, but is NOT a family movie."
"jgregg42","6","3","6","8 April 2011"," ""Win Win"" is a Draw.
","The average American is overweight. The average American is in credit card debt. The average American is struggling to pay their monthly mortgage. Paul Giamatti understands who the average American is and he understands how to portray the average American on film. He is probably one of the few famous actors who doesn't have to spend a lot of time at the gym preparing for a role. With his ""everyman"" look, he can deliver an average character in which most middle-aged audience members can relate.<br/><br/>""Win Win"" is the latest independent story from director Thomas McCarthy featuring Giamatti as Mike Flaherty, a local attorney in a small town in New Jersey (although, this small town could have been anywhere in the United States). McCarthy did a splendid job of setting the stage of this quaint town. After the first five minutes, I wanted to pull up a chair at the local Dunkin Donuts and have a coffee with the townspeople.<br/><br/>Mike is struggling to make ends meet, yet he has an overwhelming disgust of having to take a regular job to provide for his family. His marriage to Jackie (played by Amy Ryan) is fine but his law practice is struggling. He has a particular client, Leo Poplar (played by Burt Young), who is slipping into dementia and is in need of constant attention. Mike sees an opportunity here. Leo is going to be forced out of his home and into a nursing home. Leo also has quite a bit of money; in fact he pays out a large monthly commission to his caretaker. Mike sees an opportunity to take that monthly commission and put Leo in a nursing home. Mike is a good person with good intentions, but like the rest of the working class folks, he has the common desire to provide for his family.<br/><br/>After Mike puts Leo in his nursing home, we are introduced to Kyle (played by Alex Shaffer, in his only film role to date). Kyle is a runaway from his mother in Ohio. He shows up unannounced and starts taking the focus of the film. Kyle is a strong willed yet extremely quiet and pleasant young man. He also brings with him a mystery of why he left Ohio in the first place.<br/><br/>As part of Mike's contribution to the community he coaches high school wrestling. The wrestling team is lacking in the ""wins"" category. It turns out that Kyle is an exceptional wrestler. Just what Mike needs. Mike's family takes Kyle in and also starts understanding his story and why he is running away from his mom, who is in a drug rehab facility.<br/><br/>The story moves in the general direction that you would expect from a story like this. Kid runs away from home; mom follows to repair a broken relationship; kid finds out the man that he trusted is a liar; mom wants her dad's monthly commission; conflict arises and a solution is found. I hate to give a broad-brush stroke like that but it's a simple movie that doesn't offer too much excitement. Taking into consideration that it is a movie involving a high intensity contact sport such as wrestling I would expect a little more action and intensity from the pace of the film.<br/><br/>Should you see this movie? Maybe. It does deliver a story with solid acting and character development. I do see Shaffer moving up in his career using this film as a launching pad. During the movie, I kept thinking that he reminds me of a young Sean Penn, not a ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" Penn, but a ""Taps"" or ""Bad Boys"" Penn. Shaffer has a recognizable intensity and more importantly a believability to him. This isn't a story about wrestling or a story about deception or even a story about forgiveness. It's a story giving the audience a two-hour window viewing Americana in modern times."
"Turfseer","4","4","10","6 November 2011"," Characters with hearts of gold make 'Win Win', a losing proposition!
","Following in the footsteps of his earlier indie 'The Visitor', Writer/Director Thomas McCarthy now proffers up a new unlikely tale, set in the wilds of suburban New Jersey. Paul Giamatti plays another lovable loser by the name of Mike Flaherty, a down on his luck attorney who suffers anxiety attacks due a downtown in his business. He shares an office with an accountant, Vigman, and has a friend, Terry, who's bitter after his wife leaves him for a contractor who's been repairing his home. Despite the fact that he's breaking his back trying to get new clients, Mike still has time to work as a part-time wrestling coach at the local high school, along with Vigman, and later Terry, who still has an interest in the sport as he used to be a below average wrestler as a teenager.<br/><br/>The basic plot seems a bit confusing. I didn't understand why Mike agrees to assume the guardianship of part-dementia stricken Leo and then promptly puts him in a nursing home against his wishes. He could have kept his $1500 fee and simply allowed Leo to stay in his home with round-the-clock help (it's established that Leo is well off and can afford home care—in fact he already has help at the time Mike takes his case). Most of Mike's work as a guardian would have involved overseeing Leo's finances—not having to run over to the home all the time which is Mike's justification for putting him in the home in the first place. Leo did seem like an interesting character but Burt Young has little to do, playing a part that is clearly underwritten.<br/><br/>Apparently, Mike's secretary's investigatory skills aren't very polished, as she's unable to find out any information about Leo's family. Lo and behold, Leo's missing grandson, Kyle, suddenly shows up on his grandfather's doorstep one fine day and he's a champion high school wrestling student to boot! Part of the problem here is that McCarthy can't decide whether this is a comedy or drama. The result really is an uneven hybrid. A good part of the Act 2 shenanigans are just that: shenanigans! The big joke is that the student wrestlers are completely inept and we're supposed to laugh at them, even after Kyle comes on board and restores a modicum of dignity to the team. Aside from Kyle, the next best player is Stemler (Kyle's buddy), who wins a match, not by pinning his opponent, but escaping his clutches, so that the clock runs out! The three coaches also happen to be thoroughly obnoxious in their fanatic love of the game; exhorting the hapless students through the use of choice expletives (and in the case of Mike) slapping Kyle in the face (at the boy's behest), in order to motivate him to greater heights on the gym floor.<br/><br/>'Win, Win' becomes slightly more interesting at the midpoint, when Kyle's mother finally appears, lawyers up and demands to take Leo and Kyle back home with her as well as demanding Mike's $1500 guardianship commission. The way all this plays out is fairly predictable. Mike and his wife Jackie basically end up bonding with Kyle, despite the kid's chequered past which includes a juvenile rap for stealing a car. When Kyle finds out that Mike is ""just as bad as his mother"", after it's revealed that he put Leo in a nursing home against both the grandfather's and the court's wishes, Kyle disappears, resulting in a frantic search, initiated by Mike and Jackie. All's well that ends well when Kyle is found at Leo's place, a series of apologies are made by Mike and Jackie reassures the boy that he's loved by them. An even more sentimental (and hence happy ending) is effected when Kyle's drug addict mom changes her mind about allowing 'good kid' Kyle to remain with the Flahertys. The win-win proposition comes into play when Kyle's mom gets to keep the $1500 and Mike doesn't have to reveal to the court that he's guilty of fraud. Mike's only 'punishment' is that he's forced to work part-time as a bartender in order to make up for the money he's agreed to send to the drug addict mom.<br/><br/>Giamatti does well in the role of Mike despite the fact that he's not a very sympathetic character. Even less sympathetic is Terry who has a chip on his shoulder after his wife has an affair with that contractor. I'm not sure what Vigman is doing in the script and newcomer Alex Shaffer (a former successful high school wrestler) feels like he needed quite a bit of coaching (for the acting part—not the wrestling) to play the part of Kyle. Only Amy Ryan really succeeds amongst the supporting players as she does well in depicting the skepticism (and later the acceptance) of the young interloper in her household.<br/><br/>Like in his previous indie, 'The Visitor', McCarthy's characters tend to veer toward the melodramatic. There is a need for a slightly flawed hero but the antagonist is decidedly evil. In the end, Win Win, is pretty much a losing proposition, as it sacrifices verisimilitude for the easy happy ending, with characters who can't rise above their hearts of gold."
"JasonTheCritic","7","4","11","3 March 2011"," ""Worth a watch but don't expect it to be anything memorable.""
","Win Win is a moderately heartwarming and quiet comedy (I'm not going to call it a dramedy - I hate that word) that is oddly difficult to synthesize into a few sentences; I will crudely try my best. Mike (Paul Giamatti) is a poor man's lawyer and high school wrestling coach who struggles with money issues. One day he makes an immoral decision and becomes the guardian of a wealthy elderly man primarily to collect the $1,500 monthly check he is rewarded. The next day the grandson of the wealthy elderly mans shows up and Mike and his wife (Amy Ryan) are forced to take care of the kid, Kyle (Alex Shaffer). Kyle, who ran away from his druggie mother, turns out to be a wrestling champion - a perfect fit for Mike's high school team. Kyle also has no idea that Mike is using the guardianship of his grandpa to get paid. Can we see an obvious future conflict? <br/><br/>Paul Giamatti is in almost every frame of this movie, which is a good thing because he excels at playing the convincingly (perhaps too convincingly) out of shape guy who is becoming increasingly frustrated with his income situation. And Amy Smart is good here as the strict yet good-hearted mother who is concerned for Kyle, which in another actresses hands could have easily become an annoying and overbearing character.<br/><br/>Vigman, Mike's assistant coach, is the supporting character who steals nearly every scene and generates most of the laughs. He is played by the hilariously serious Jeffrey Tambor. There is a scene at a wrestling match where Terry (Bobby Cannavale) shouts something inappropriate and Tambor closes his eyes in disbelief. It is the slightest of gestures yet the entire theater (including myself) nearly died laughing - it takes a skillful actor to do that.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Bobby Cannavale's Terry is nowhere near as funny. It seems as if the script pushed all of its allegedly funny one-liners on Terry's character. The result is a few funny lines with double the amount of unfunny lines. It also did not help that, at times, Cannavele appeared to be trying to hard with his line delivery. There is nothing worse than when somebody tries to be funny.<br/><br/>That last tidbit about the acting in this movie goes to Alex Shaffer. This is his first movie and it shows in some scenes. While he satisfies at playing the silent and troubled teenager (aptly referenced to in this movie as the makings of a young Eminem), he is not at all convincing when he is required to yell. His ""yelling"" just sounds like the volume on his voice has increased - with no hint of actual anger.<br/><br/>If the acting in this movie ranges from very good to decent, the overall movie ends up somewhere in between. Win Win is a small movie and it knows it; it never tries to do anything surprising. The moment Giamatti's character makes the immoral decision there is a general formula applied to the movie that is never shaken off. Another possible flaw in the movie is that Mike and Terry are childhood best friends, and Terry is apparently rich; the question kept nagging at the back of my head: ""Why doesn't Terry just help Mike out?"".<br/><br/>There must have been some reason; probably because it may have taken away some of the drama from this dramatic comedy. Though even then, Win Win is not very dramatic nor does it have enough laughs to be a considered a comedy. If you are especially a fan of Paul Giamatti, Amy Ryan, and/or Jeffrey Tambor then you may really enjoy this. If not, it is still worth a watch but don't expect it to be anything memorable.<br/><br/>You can read ALL my reviews at JasonTheCritic.com"
"Seraphion","6","2","4","6 August 2014"," A rare drama comedy that's more focused on the drama side
","Seeing Paul Giamatti who's famous of his comedic performances and dialogs, even in action movies, I expected a lot of goofy laughs in this movie. Well, what I got is a bit the contrary where the drama side about the themes of family issues, trusts issues and motivation and achievement issues is more focused and prevalent. But I won't say that I was disappointed because there are some enjoyable laughs in the one-liner dialogs and awkward settings. It's nice that the drama side is still prevalent even at the comedic moments. Aside from Giamatti, and maybe Cannivale, I didn't see any other special performances. Their performances are just enough to cover the crucial aspects of this movie. Bobby Cannivale did quite well on the sport scenes, although he should really work on his use of facial expressions."
"alexcomputerkid","Null","2","4","20 September 2013"," A forgotten classic
","Even though you maybe could question it, I think being a teenager is one of the toughest parts of a person's life. It's the end of childhood and many things need to be done as you transition to being a grown up. We have seen many films throughout the years on this subject; some good and some bad. Win Win tackles this subject with excellent results.<br/><br/>Here Kyle (Alex Shaffer) is a troubled teenager and is put into an alternative family billet home of Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti) after running away to New Jersey to his grandfather Leo (Burt Young). Flaherty is a wrestling coach so there is a wrestling theme to the story as well as stolen money and a teen trying to find himself. <br/><br/>Initially you go into this expecting a sports story but it's not really what this movie is all about. There are many genres and subjects in this movie. There is a drama involving a troubled teen. There is a sports story. There is a story involving economic problems from work. This all comes back to the story of a kid just trying to be himself in the toughest time of your life. All of these aspects are covered very well with just the right amount of attention to each. Usually a type of mish- mash of things like this in a movie is not good but here it works.<br/><br/>Similar to Hailee Steinfeld who was an unknown teenager casted in the 2010 movie True Grit, Win Win puts Alex Shaffer in the lead role as the troubled teen. Shaffer is someone known for being a wrestler and had never been in front of the camera before. In spite of that, he delivers an outstanding performance that you can't not love and I can't say enough about him. The rest of the cast which includes Paul Giamatti, Amy Ryan, Bobby Cannavale and Burt Young is solid and works in every way.<br/><br/>Many films stood out in 2011, but I think Win Win bettered all of them. It's a great film with a huge heart but it just didn't seem to find its' audience. I consider this a forgotten classic."

","This film is a moving, hilarious real portrayal of addiction, small town life, adolescence, adult friendships, the practice of law and American family values. I was moved to tears and uproarious laughter several times. Giamatti is an excellent actor but everything in this film rose to his level. The premise, the script, the cinematography, staging, direction even costumes, everything was A-1 and moved me. I cannot believe this film did not get more media attention and/or awards. I will be watching for anything written by Thomas McCarthy.<br/><br/>This film portrays events which occur in America all of the time but do not make the media. The realities of a solo law practice and the pressures of raising a family in modern America are realistically shown with virtually no exaggeration. The tension between trying to do the right thing and meeting obligations of basic needs for one's family was palpable and expressed in the plot and script with such realism that I felt it in my gut. <br/><br/>Everyone should see this film."
"ferguson-6","8","2","4","28 March 2011"," WTFIT (Whatever it Takes)
","Greetings again from the darkness. Thomas McCarthy's first two directorial outings were excellent: The Station Agent, The Visitor. This is his third and it seems clear the first two were not flukes. This is a filmmaker who knows what he is doing and who is attracted to real people in real life situations. All three films feature the reactions and adaptations when strangers collide and a family-like atmosphere is created.<br/><br/>In this film, Paul Giamatti plays a struggling lawyer who also coaches the local high school wrestling team. Times are tough for Giamatti's practice and when he stumbles on a chance for some ""easy"" money, his wrestling match with his conscience doesn't last too long ... even though it is not in the best interest of his client. By taking the easy way out, his elderly client is moved out of his home and into a long-term care facility. Giamatti knows his decision isn't right, so he hides it from his wife, the talented Amy Ryan. Their home life seems very typical until the Giamatti decision leads to further complications ... the client's long-lost grandson shows up.<br/><br/>The kid turns out to be quite perceptive and fits right into the Giamatti/Ryan family ... especially when it is discovered that he is a top notch high school wrestler. Newcomer Alex Shaffer was cast because of his wrestling skills, but shines in the film due to his ability to come across as a real kid in real world conflicts. There are times his actions and decisions are more adult than the adults.<br/><br/>The grandfather client is played by Burt Young, who was Paulie in the Rocky movies. Giamatti's best friend is played by Bobby Cannavale, whose character is going through marital hell, and whose lively spirit and outspoken tendencies provide many of the laughs in the film. Cannavale shines in this film, much as he did as the slightly desperate vendor in The Station Agent.<br/><br/>Things are going along pretty well for the new ""family"" until Shaffer's mother (Melanie Lynskey) is released from the drug clinic and she shows up to re-claim her son and her share of grandpa's wealth. She and her attorney (another nice role for Margo Martindale) expose Giamatti's earlier unethical decision and force his hand. The strength of the family is severely tested.<br/><br/>What I really like about this and the two previous McCarthy films are that no real Hollywood tricks are used. He hits situations head-on with realistic levels of comedy and uncomfortable people who are just trying to get along in life. In Win Win, the stellar cast brings life to these characters and draw us right in to their attempts at conflict resolution. Even though the theme is not too far removed from that of The Blind Side, Mr. McCarthy provides us with characters who could be from our own lives or even our own families. That makes all the difference."

","** Contains midpoint plot synopsis**<br/><br/>The movie lures you into a false sense of security as it shows a normal middle class New Jersey family all while playing an acoustical ""indy"" guitar. Paul Giamatti plays a lawyer who isn't doing too well financially (apparently he doesn't handle bankruptcies). He has an aged rich client Leo Poplar, (Burt Young, Pauly from Rocky) who is in the early stages of dementia. Unable to contact Leo's daughter in Ohio (we later find out she was in rehab) he goes to court and gets appointed as his legal guardian/caretaker. The state was going to place Leo in a care facility, however Giamatti convinces the judge Leo would be better at home and agrees to take care of Leo at home...for the $1500 a month fee. As it turns out Giamatti was dishonest (not a lawyer!) and puts Leo in a home anyway, telling him it was the judge's orders.<br/><br/>As fate would have it, Kyle, Leo's 16 year old grandson from Ohio is sitting on his doorstop as Paul drives by. He takes Kyle in temporarily. Paul also coaches the HS wrestling team which doesn't win matches. As it turns out Kyle is a ringer. When Kyle's hated mother shows up, she throws a wrench into the works as Paul's deception has become uncovered.<br/><br/>The characters in the story are realistic, they all have flaws that must be dealt with. When they have an opportunity to redeem themselves, like a good Disney flick they all take it. As a family film, I have to question some things. The movie drops the F bomb in stages. Kyle runs away from home in Ohio and takes the bus. Kyle at one point pushes his mother down on a bed and holds her down in anger.<br/><br/>The acting was great. Alex Schaffer did a good job as Kyle. Heart warming and funny at times. Highly recommend."

There's at least a couple of coincidences in its plot and it doesn't have the courtesy to really give the viewer what they want as it takes some predictable routes only to kind of end with its middle finger in our faces but it isn't half bad.<br/><br/>A laconic youth manages to make something of himself through sport. So yes it's a sports movie which like any adequate sports movie isn't really about sport but what Stallone calls ""the journey"". It's nice enough to not climax with a fight but the distinctly less interesting plot line of the lawyer doing something necessary but apparently unscrupulous. The problem is that it's crucial to the plot that what this guy does is apparently so heinous but you kind of empathize.<br/><br/>There's a cute child actor who is frankly a bit wasted but the talent all round is pretty admirable in handling a rather dry story with pathos and personality.<br/><br/>The movie never tries to be a comedy like I said but even then isn't as funny as it thinks it is.

Fortunately the plot takes hold, shortly before the indelible Shaffer appears on screen. And each ""bit"" beforehand does prove itself integral to the drama as a whole in the end. To avoid spoilers, one tangential question must be posed: why is a 16-year-old homeless ex- wrestler flush with cash? The film never explains why, although Shaffer's tattoos and cigarette- smoking allude to his being a rebel, and probably a competent prostitute prior to his arrival on Goamatti's doorstep, as far as backstory; he certainly has the body and demeanor to profit as a hustler. But this in inconsequential. Overall, the small variegated threads of this script do congeal into a fascinating movie about truth and compassion. Each character slyly evolves from an unlikable caricature to an immensely human character with believable attributes and a solidly placed heart. Yet the film somehow avoids being cliché or predictable. Absolutely a must-see, even if you feel indifferent about teen boy wrestling; the only drawback is emphasis on storyline and characterization rather than emphasis on the game (there are only about 10 minutes of actual mat-footage, and however exciting these minutes may be, the craving for more game-time may disrupt the avid sportsman's enjoyment of this film's other assets). With a handful of Oscar- nominated actors and numerous awards, ""Win Win"" is likely to win you over."

","Win-Win Win-Win belongs to the garbage bin! I just saw the movie called win-win and it was boring because the movie was long and had no action in it. The movie is about a kid that gave up on life and had a chance to get his life back – Mike played Paul Giamatti, as a lawyer and a wrestling coach, takes in Kyle (the kid) and makes him wrestle again the movie takes place in new jersey. Amy Ryan, did a good job because her character is an example of a good mother . Kyle mother played by Melanie lynskey did not do a good job, but she was believable as a crappy mother to Kyle and daughter to Leo (Burt Young) This movie teaches young kids to keep doing sports and stay motivated also to never quit. Young adults would like this movie (18 and older). I would not recommend this movie to people who do not like sports. I have no favourite scene because I thought the movie was boring. The only scene that was funny was when he fights the weak opponent. I would rate this movie 4 on 10."

","Win Win Genre: drama Movie length: 106 minutes The stars: Paul Giamatti, Amy Ryan, Bobby Tonnale, and Jeffery Tambor Plot: the movie as about a boy with a talent in wrestling but his past comes back to haunt him. My Favorite characters are: Mike, the lawyer, a family man, and a coach and his personality changed through the movie because he had an interesting character development. He changed for the better and the worst throughout the movie. The best movie bit is when the kid (Kyle) showed a talent for wrestling. It got me interested to see what would happen with his talent. The weak bit of the movie is when the mother of the kid showed up, then for me it got boring after that. From the movie, I learnt to do whatever it takes to achieve your goals and dreams. This movie would be good for athletes because it fits their theme, which is never give up. I would not recommend this movie to a friend because it gets repetitive and does a good at putting people to sleep. This movie should be rated R because of vulgar language. Final verdict: I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars because this movie was terrible for me. It was almost torture to watch. I would stay away from this movie at all costs!!!

","OK, so you may not fall asleep with this movie, but let me tell you, you won't be jumping around either. What exactly is the story about? A kid who's mother is absent and seems to be a wrestling phenomenon. A granddad who leaves in a retirement home and a few conflicts of interests between adults that seem to all be connected with this lost teenager. So what? honestly, I think a movie should present a problem in the first few minutes, and you should spend the rest of the movie thinking what the outcome will be. But, in this case, it's kind of unclear. OK, it gets easier as the movie progresses with the introduction of the mother figure, but she comes so late in the movie, that it does not feel like she is the reason why of this movie. Unsurprisingly for me, this movie did not do too well... and will quickly be forgotten. Next."

","Based on the recommendations of this site for watching ""Safety Not Guaranteed,"" I was curious what this movie was. Being an indie film probably made on the fly to fulfill a few contracts, this movie feels like ""The Karate Kid"" filled to the brim with overused tropes used in various movies every month. (The biggest and most obvious one is the ""misunderstood kid who is a genius/Olympic athlete"" trope.) Although parts of the film felt overdone, it was still a solid story with good characters, a decent cast, and a hopeful spirit for a great end.<br/><br/>I personally disliked the ending. SPOILER*: By the end of the film, I felt the title of the movie should be changed to ""Lose Lose Lose"" because of the outcome to Paul Giamatti's character's original dilemma. He's a dad and a public defending judge who is running out of money. By the end, he takes on more responsibilities and still doesn't have the money he needs, even picking up another job by the end (making 3 jobs he goes to). The title merely refers to his thought-process in scheming this old man out of some money while he helps him every once in awhile.<br/><br/>Most of the movie feels forgettable, but it's sweet and offers the audience some escaped by gaining insight into this inconvenient time in this family's life. I probably might rate this lower if I keep thinking about the movie, but the actors in this are pretty awesome and should get some recognition."

","""Win Win"" is a fairly good drama written and directed by Thomas McCarthy (""The Visitor"", ""The Station Agent""). Low-key but well acted, the film stars Paul Giamatti as a small town attorney who moonlights as a wrestling coach to keep himself out of bankruptcy. In this vein Giamatti persuades a local judge to appoint him guardian of a young, wayward kid, an act for which he will receive a fee of $1,500 per month. Giamatti thinks his actions will benefit everyone – he absorbs a little guilt and suffering so that others may be happy – but of course things come crashing down around him.<br/><br/>The film perhaps overloads on sentimentality towards its end, and McCarthy is perhaps too desperate to portray his characters ""growing"" and ""learning important values"", but as such low-key drama is increasingly rare, we let these failings slide.<br/><br/>8/10 – Worth one viewing."
"rawiri42","7","0","0","20 September 2012"," Refreshingly ""nice"" tale.
","Win Win is both emotional and light - which is pretty hard to do when you think about it - and, for that, director Tom McCarthy is to be congratulated. I think that there wouldn't be too many viewers who couldn't relate to one or more of the characters in this story. Mike (Paul Giamatti) is a struggling lawyer with bills piling up (mind you, I never personally met a struggling lawyer - maybe he lives in the most law-abiding town on the planet where no one needs legal representation or even conveyancing because no one wants to leave such a great environment! I kinda doubt that though so one has to wonder why he's struggling - given the hourly rate lawyers charge.<br/><br/>Anyway, in spite of somewhat mercenary motivation, Mike clearly does have a heart and makes every effort to locate his client Leo, an elderly slightly demented old man's daughter without success. She is a drug- addict who hasn't seen her dad in years and, it would seem, wants it to stay that way. However, unbeknown to Leo, he also has a grandson, Kyle, who shows up out of the blue and, since Mike has put Leo into a retirement facility - although he told the court that he would take care of Leo in his own home - Kyle has nowhere to stay. <br/><br/>Mike is also the local high school wrestling coach with a pretty mediocre team and when it turns out that Kyle is a very good wrestler, Mike persuades him to stay with him and his family and go to school and, of course, join the wrestling team. The insertion of Kyle into the team not only provides some wins at last but also motivates the rest of the boys to the point where they win their first big tournament. Kyle fits in well with Mike's family and the school and, perhaps, most importantly, with himself because when he arrived, he had a huge chip on his shoulder from having a lousy relationship with his (very young) mother Cindy (played by Kiwi actress, Melanie Lynskey - crazy Rose of Two-and-a-half men fame). <br/><br/>Everything is going well for a while. Leo, whilst not totally happy at the retirement home is contented enough. Mike's financial situation is relieved by the support payments he is getting for being Leo's guardian. Kyle is fitting in well with Mike's family and his new schoolmates and wrestling team friends. And then Cindy shows up. She SAYS she wants to look after her dad and take him back to Ohio with her where she wants to look after him - although it is obvious that all she really wants is, firstly, the $1500-a-month support payments and, ultimately, Leo's personal savings. Her arrival with a layer totally disrupts everything. Kyle wants nothing to do with her and Leo definitely doesn't want to leave his beloved home and go to Ohio and, of course, Mike stands to lose his ""extra"" income as well as his star wrestler (because Kyle completely flips out when his mother goes to his biggest match yet and gets disqualified.<br/><br/>If the ages of Melanie Lynskey and Alex Shaffer (who plays Kyle) are the ages of their characters, Cindy would have only been 15 or 16 when she gave birth and yet her father didn't even know he had a grandson.<br/><br/>When it seems that everything is going to fall apart, Mike's better nature takes over and he takes Leo back to his own house and agrees to monitor him there and, to get her off his and her father and son's back, agrees to pay Cindy the whole of the $1500 a month just to stay away. To make ends meet Mike takes an evening job as a bartender - which, as I say, seems a bit weird for a qualified lawyer. Whilst we aren't told so, I like to think that, after he finished school, Kyle might have gone to live with his grandpa and become a world champion wrestler with Mike as his manager. Then the title ""Win Win"" would certainly have come true."

","Actor-turned-director Thomas McCarthy came off as a natural in his first two features as a director: 2003's ""The Station Agent"" and 2007's ""The Visitor."" That put a fat old earmark on latest effort ""Win Win.""<br/><br/>All three films demonstrate an understanding of human motivation and how more often than not, things do not turn out as we plan. The conflicts in his films are extraordinary in the most down-to-earth sense of the word: unusual people and unusual circumstance can enter our lives at a moment's notice and through handling that hardship we become better people.<br/><br/>""Win Win"" encompasses all of these notions and into a tighter, even more Hollywood-like package than McCarthy's previous films. Paul Giamatti stars as Mike Flaherty, an attorney whose practice is struggling, so he spends late afternoons coaching a high school wrestling team. When he learns of a way he can earn money by claiming guardianship of one of his clients with dementia and placing him in an assisted living facility, he pulls the trigger despite knowing the old man (Burt Young) would prefer to live on his own.<br/><br/>The decision proves a real win-win — until teenager Kyle (Alex Shaffer) enters the picture. Kyle hitched a ride from Columbus to New Jersey to stay with the old man, his grandfather, after his mother (Melanie Lynskey) checked into drug rehab. Mike and his wife, Jackie (Amy Ryan), take Kyle in because seeing as he can't live at the assisted living facility or alone in his grandfather's house. Kyle, as it turns out, was also a top wrestler in the state of Ohio, and he joins the team.<br/><br/>Mike finds a way to make it so that once again, everyone wins, but then Kyle's mom shows up and throws it all into turmoil, putting Mike in a bind and bringing out Kyle's angry side.<br/><br/>Giamatti does some of his best work as Mike. Giamatti is most often drawn to playing unlikable characters or ones with glaring flaws and while Mike fits that bill, it's much more understated. Mike bends the rules in one instance, an instance upon which everything that happens next is built. Of course after it all piles up, McCarthy pulls the plug and Mike's true character is tested.<br/><br/>So ""Win Win"" doesn't offer any surprises or truly unique insights into morality. Instead, it plays out one of the many kinds of universal human dilemmas that people face every day. Then it reminds us how we should treat others and rectify situations in which we've done wrong. McCarthy is just being honest with us, and the drama and the acting reflect that.<br/><br/>In terms of the wrestling element, one could see it as metaphor for perseverance, but its primary function in the film is to give characters Mike and Kyle an outlet. It helps Mike deal with stress and it allows Kyle to channel his hardships in a healthy way. It didn't have to be wrestling, but wrestling was really the perfect choice.<br/><br/>""Win Win"" feels like a film true to its title. It can get a bit slow, but it would be unfair to refer to its pseudo-remarkable nature as ""being too realistic."" It strikes a nice balance of conflict, enough to stay engaging yet certainly nothing over the top or melodramatic. Considering the number of films that tip the scales one way or another in that regard, ""Win Win"" deserves acclaim simply for being neutral.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site! moviemusereviews.com"

","The plot of the movie doesn't really want to make you rush out and see this but Thomas McCarthy gathers an ensemble cast and weaves a story that will touch and inspire you. This is only the director's 3rd movie but each one is worth seeing at least twice.<br/><br/>There is no weak link here, Giamati, Ryan, Carnevale are all perfectly cast and the small town backdrop works perfectly here as well. Carnevale gets a special mention as he provided a comic element to the movie, i'm not sure if he plays his role tongue in cheek or he is intentionally this amusing but he plays a great foil to Giamatti's serious guy role.<br/><br/>A great first role for Alex shaffer as well, it'll be interesting to see how his career goes after such a bright start,."

","I saw the movie Win Win the other night and it made me cry. Not too many things can do that. Just like a soldier that has feelings that well up and return when he thinks of or remembers battle, we all experience a sort of post trauma from the witnessing of traumatic experiences similar to our own.<br/><br/>What I liked... and hated about the movie was that it was about a screwed up kid from a screwed up family. I identified with the teenager. But the movie is about hope. But as is the case hope can only be fulfilled, if someone shows kindness. In this case not because they wanted to but because their own negative actions forced them into deciding; 'what is the right thing t do?"" I also like the subtle suggestion that the family that helps is Christian. This is done in a way that is not, 'in your face' and again even though they are the heroes in this situation they definitely do not come without faults of their own. I've read that some reviewers didn't like the ending, well the ending is more about reality than Hollywood usually portrays and especially in these times we need a good dose of reality. By the way this is a movie about our times in many ways. This is a Charles Dickens story of our times.<br/><br/>The acting is EXCELLENT. Paul Giamatti shows once again that he can do much more than comedy, Bobby Cannavale who plays ""Uncle Terry"" is very convincing in his role of a friend with his own problems. Jeffry Tambor has a very humble role ands shows he can play just about any role. But Amy Ryan steels the show with her portrayal of the mom we all wish we had and some of us knew. Even little Clare Foley, who plays the daughter says just the right thing at just the right time she helps you forget that your actually watching a movie and not a fly on the wall in someone's family daily lives. I thought the casting of Melanie Lynskie as the messed up mother was a bit out of place because Melanie has one of those faces that well you just want to like her. But it works to soften the critique of the person she plays after all, messed up people are... just people. Finally first timer Alex Shaffer, who plays Kyle the troubled teen, does a very convincing job of a kid, who just needs a chance at having a normal life. Apparently Alex was hired because he is a true wrestling champ in real life so his wrestling does not need to act when he's on the mat. However the casters must have seen that they had a win win with him because he does an excellent job acting the kid we both don't want hanging around in our neighborhood, but once we get to know him are charmed by the person he is.<br/><br/>This movie has something for almost everyone; enough family drama and feelings for a chick flick, but enough testosterone and sports for the guys. Not a movie for kids, lots of bad language, but it only appears when appropriate; again this is a movie about real life. And if you know kids that are headed this way well it could be depressing for them or their family. But we all know someone like this, so anyone can identify with it and if nothing else it will help us look differently at that troubled teen and think to ourselves, ""what is it we should do?"" I loved this movie; I highly recommend it to anyone who is around teenagers or someday will be I am going to watch it again."

The team isn't very good, they never won a match, sometimes even struggle to get a point. <br/><br/>Amy Ryan is his wife Jackie Flaherty.<br/><br/>Mike is a sincere guy, but business is slow, and we also get the feeling he isn't such a high-powered lawyer.

His mom is a mess, in and out of abuse clinics, and he wants a better life. As luck would have it, Kyle also happens to be a star wrestler, and is eager to join the high school team.<br/><br/>(In real life, Shaffer really is a star wrestler and won the NJ state high school title in his weight class.

","Released in the spring of 2011, Win Win was a movie that I had never even heard of, but because pig vomit (Paul Giamatti) was in it I decided to give it a shot. Giamatti has turned into one of my favorite actors in Hollywood for a few reasons and one of them is his range of roles from Kenny in Private Parts to John Adams he gives passionate and believable performances; Win Win is no different. Director Thomas McCarthy (The Visitor) put together a great cast and uses that cast to develop fantastic characters. This is not a comedy, but it has some comedy in it. At no point did I look at it and think to myself that there is too much of this or too much wrestling either; it is a complicated family dynamic movie. The movie has a lot of wrestling in it, but that isn't the message; however the wrestling isn't as hooky as it is in Vision Quest.<br/><br/>Giamatti's character, as with all in this movie, is real. Not as in nonfiction, but as is not a model citizen done in the Disney mold. He wants to do well for his kids and family, and will do what it takes to provide for his family. Looking at him you could easily say to yourself that you know someone just like him. The same could be said for Amy Ryan's part. She doesn't do anything spectacular except be a solid stay at home mom who cares about her family. This movie has a very real feel to it in a lot of ways and that is what makes it funny and relevant. There are a lot of recognizable faces and actors in Win Win, such as another one of my favorite straight faced comedians Jeffrey Tambor. He also performs in the film exactly as you would expect. Additionally, there are some shocking faces; such as Burt Young, who will always be Pauly from Rocky, and Melanie Lynskey who will always be Rose to me from Two and Half Men. Lynskey however is not the comedic level in this movie as she normally plays but the mother of Kyle (Alex Shaffer). Shaffer, a new comer to the screen, does a nice job of playing the troubled teen and the focal point of the movie's plot.<br/><br/>Win Win is not a crude dude movie but would be enjoyable to all adults.

","So many films have been lost in the shuffle this year, and have gone on to be unrecognized and already forgotten gems. The Art of Getting By and Cedar Rapids just to name a few. Win Win was a sleeper hit, even with its great supporting cast, electrifying script, and some of the most surreal filmmaking for a drama in recent memory.<br/><br/>Win Win almost reminds me of a possible HBO miniseries condensed into a film. This seems like it could make a decent Television show for a premium cable network. It tells the story of lawyer and part-time wrestling coach named Mike (Giamatti) who is put in charge of caring for an elderly man named Leo (Young). So he doesn't have to do much work at all, Mike puts Leo in a nursing home, but continues to collect the $1,500 check every month for doing work he doesn't do.<br/><br/>Mike's wrestling team is pitiful, until he starts caring for Leo's nephew named Kyle (Shaffer), a troubled teen who finds his niche when he begins wrestling for Mike's team. Kyle's homelife is found later to be dreadful, and begins to shake up Mike's simple life as he tries to manage him while care for his loving wife and two kids.<br/><br/>The supporting cast of Win Win is pitch-perfect packed with character actors like Bobby Cannavale and Jeffrey Tambor. Every character is played in a non-perfect manor, because the screenplay gives them believable flaws they can't work around. Instead of making them all good human beings, the film gives them baggage that they must work with. It shows the realism behind life, and not the sugarcoated film look we've been getting for quite sometime.<br/><br/>There are flaws, sadly. For one, we never know why Mike steals the check every month because we don't know his financial situation. If that could've been elaborated, it would've spawned a whole new breed of conflicts for the film to work on rather than just make Mike look cold-hearted and scummy. Not to mention, some things in the film are symbolic, like the boiler room, that are never mentioned again and are just the subject of creative screen writing. It doesn't really transfer to film well, and it's never referred back to for future reference.<br/><br/>Alex Schaffer reminds me of the real Lucas Cruinkshank, who is famous for the ""FRED"" character on Youtube. He resembles Cruinkshank, and even speaks like him without the pitch effect on his voice. From what I've heard, his hair was bleached for the film to make him look even more troubled and a stand-out. Shaffer is perfect in the film, and probably the strongest point. He wrestles better than he acts, but at least we have a multi-talented child-actor who has developed skills early on. Being this is his first film, and he's already very talented for his age, it can only get better - hopefully.<br/><br/>Win Win is seldom, much like Director Thomas McCarthy's previous works. He has a sort of art with the camera, as well as with a pen and paper. He creates real characters, and none of a cliché breed. There are no major twists and turns in the plot, but some caught me off guard surprisingly. Win Win isn't perfect, but it's above-average, which I'll take over cliché and fair any day.<br/><br/>Starring: Paul Giamatti, Alex Schaffer, Bobby Cannavale, Jeffrey Tambor, Burt Young, and Amy Ryan. Directed by: Thomas McCarthy."

","I'd heard this was a good effort but I was a little skeptical, Giamatti makes odd little movies that you have to be in the mood for, I think. But this one anyone would be proud to be behind. And Giamatti is excellent.<br/><br/>Giamatti is on screen almost continuously and it's a blessing but he's hardly alone. There's his wife, played by Amy Ryan, who is so dead on I laughed my head off at her portrayal. Then there's Bobby Cannavale who plays Giamatti's best friend who also supplies comic relief when needed. And Kyle's mother played by Melanie Lynskey is another well crafted performance where an actor is handed the ball and no one's let down. And there's even more noteworthy in terms of acting. <br/><br/>Another thing I repeatedly shook my head over was the writing which I found more than impressive, I found it near miraculous with the kind of dialog and story I'm sure most actors would murder to get their hands on. There's no doubt in my mind this is easily the best writing I've encountered all year.<br/><br/>But for me the key to the whole thing is Kyle played by Alex Shaffer. A skilled actor could, on a good day, perhaps match Giamatti for pure humanity and pathos, but Kyle's role is a little too unique to easily recast. This Kyle is the engine that moves most of the movie, in my opinion. I'm thinking that his role works as a kind of psychological pivot which allows the rest of the cast to do its job. But that's not to take anything away from Mr Shaffer who gives one of the most memorable performances I've ever seen by someone his age. For me this kid deserves high praise and I can only hope I'm not alone."

","The ordinary every day life of the almost or sometimes middle class people with no extraordinary or special event affecting others should not be a theme that garnishes the ratings and high praise this movie has. It's not an action movie, not really a comedy or an all out drama either; it has to fall in the latter genre only because it fits nowhere else. Indeed the high ratings of most of my usual sources are well deserved when it comes to this unpretentious film. The reviews by critics and others, mostly movie lovers like myself, have many good things to say; I've read more insightful reasons than I thought I could come up with.<br/><br/>Why is it such a good movie? It has tried and true masters of their craft in Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan leading other experienced actors like Jeffrey Tambor, Burt Young, Margo Martindale and Melanie Lynskey, while first time actor Alex Shaffer impresses as well. The script by writer/director Thomas McCarthy was his best so far and the developing talent is obvious. In my view, ordinary life alone has enough drama, is funnier than make believe comedy and it teaches us more than books and classes often have; that's why the likes of this movie and other gems like it (take ""Finding Forester"" for example) fare so well with audiences despite the non commercial traits of the scripts.<br/><br/>I loved it and it's one I'll probably watch again. Paul Giamatti has picked well as he often does and that is why he is so well respected in the acting community. I also look forward to the next Thomas McCarthy project; I've seen and liked, just not as much, his previous written/directed works. You may take a chance and watch those for artistic edification; it's as good a reason as any."

","I agree with the reviewers who found this movie contrived and phony.<br/><br/>To praise it, you first have to accept that Paul Giamatti's lawyer character, with whom we are supposed to sympathize, would commit the most execrable kind of legal malpractice and elder abuse. So far as the fraud goes, you have to wonder why the lawyer doesn't simply arrange to keep his wealthy elderly client in his own home, per his wishes, since he is well to do and could afford a full time live in caregiver.

To contrive what very little dramatic tension there is in this feeble tale. <br/><br/>Then, you also must believe that the evil absentee drug abuser gold-digger daughter of the elderly man can somehow turn out to be a fresh-faced cutie pie who's about ten years too young to play the degenerate mother of the 17 year old son.

","This film is a heartwarming, honest look at what it takes to win in everyday life, when sometimes that makes for unethical choices with consequences, and the winning actually comes from unexpected places. The excellent performances from the entire cast are spot on, and help to portray each flawed character in a way in which you can understand and sympathize with their perspective. It's a complex film, more of a drama than a comedy, but still one that compels you to keep watching and you leave the theater completely satisfied.

","Pretty much your standard indie film, with all of the conflicts and resolutions you expect. The film has a pretty silly setup; Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti) is a lawyer who, through a series of far-fetched events, ends up taking care of Kyle (Alex Shaffer), the grandson of one of his clients. The entire premise was absurd and this gave me a bit of trouble really getting into the film. Also giving me trouble was the fact that we're supposed to root for Mike when almost right after we meet him he does something so immoral that it made it almost impossible for me to do so. The actors all do a solid job which makes it kind of worthwhile, but there's still just so many clichés and the film does absolutely nothing new.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti is his usual Giamatti self, very solid but he doesn't do anything new. Amy Ryan is her usual Ryan self, very solid but she doesn't do anything new. Melanie Lynskey does what she can with an incredibly thin, despicable character that is only brought around so the film can have some sort of conflict. Bobby Cannavale is stuck in the god awful idiot comic relief role. Alex Shaffer is honestly the only thing in the film that I really liked. For a first time actor he was excellent, taking a character that could have easily been quite annoying and unlikable and making him someone that I really felt for and wanted to see as much as possible. He instantly made me like him and I was attached to him the whole time. Aside from Shaffer though, the film is just one standard indie move after another."

II). Win Win is every bit as delightfully oddball as Sideways, but places family rather than fraternity at its heart. Young Alex Shaffner's performance is wonderfully low key and makes the film, but it's well played all round and Giamatti is front and centre, and we root for him despite some questionable decisions because we know his heart is in the right place.

","I'd been quite excited about Win Win for a little while. It looked like an enjoyable indie film in the vein of Lars and the Real Girl and I always love Paul Giamatti. Unfortunately, it's frustratingly boring. There's very little themes, character development, use of metaphors or anything meaningful. It just seems like a bunch of bland stuff thrown together and called a film. Most of the jokes are cheap shots and the drama would've only worked if it actually meant something. Sometimes the acting is good and sometimes I quite liked the photography but the lack of insight into the characters and into the wrestling itself just meant I didn't buy any of it. Such wasted potential. At least it's a little lesson in what not to do for a film as I can see as a writer I used to just chuck stuff in that didn't mean anything like in Win Win.

"nickmesafilms","8","1","2","24 May 2012"," Win Win (2011) - Paul Giamatti, Where Have You Been in a Long Time?
","Released at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, ""Win Win"" was highly praised as one of the best underrated movies of 2011, and for good reason, since ""Win Win"" is a fresh and enjoyable motion picture. Paul Giamatti stars as a family man, who has bounced from place to place, job after job, from being a attorney to a wrestling coach. But when deciding to appoint as guardian to one of his court-appointed clients, played by Burt Young, he then meets his client's troubled teen grandson, played by Alex Shaffer, who ends up living with him, after being abandoned by an alcoholic mother. After later discovering that the kid's a talented wrestler, Giamatti places him on the team, hoping to encourage his losing team to play better. Although advertised as a sports movie, ""Win Win"" is anything but. ""Win Win"" is more of a realistic family drama that will affect the heart and the senses. Paul Giamatti and Alex Shaffer probably deliver some of the best performances in the entire 106 minute run-time. But besides that, Amy Ryan, Jeffrey Tambor, Melanie Lynskey, Burt Young, and the hilarious Bobby Cannavale provide some interesting performances to the overall brilliant cast. This movie delivers some incredibly sharp writing that quite improves the most in this low-budget underrated movie, and the acting helps support the movie's momentum. I honestly enjoyed the movie throughout, without any mishaps. But there were just some moments that I felt needed more to support the story, and to give it the more strength that it needs. But, ""Win Win"" is a crisp, off-beat, unusual, and unique little gem. An expertly written, remarkably acted, and strongly paced motion picture is indeed the type of movie I'd see. ""Win Win"" is probably one of the most interesting and surprising movies of the previous year. ""Win Win"", in my review, ""charming and remarkable, a unique treat""."
"meeza","9","1","2","11 May 2012"," McCarthyism continues to be a winning turn!
","Writer-Director Thomas McCarthy's ""Win Win"" was such a winning movie that I never wanted it to ""fin fin"". This clever flick stars the always great Paul Giamatti as Mike Flaherty, a middle-aged father of two who has a small law practice which he is struggling to keep afloat. Flaherty moonlights as a coach of a high school wrestling team who is not doing any better than his law practice. In order to wrestle with his economic troubles, Flaherty decides to declare himself a guardian to Leo Poplar, a senior citizen client of his that is going through early stages of dementia. Mike gets a nice chunk of change per month for his guardian duties in ""The Poplar Express"". Unexpectedly, Poplar's teenage grandson Kyle appears on Leo's doorstep but Leo does not live there anymore since Mike put Leo in a senior citizen residential center. Mike then takes in Kyle, and quickly discovers that Kyle is a young wrestling whiz with a troubled past and a despondent mother. You will be gone with the ""Win Win"" if I provide you more details on the film's narrative developments. But I must state that this movie is outstanding! Writer-Director Thomas McCarthy has done it again, his first two movies ""The Station Agent"" and ""The Visitor"" were brilliant, and he delivers the same authentic character development and storyline as those films into the ""Win Win"". Giamatti was spectacular as the conflicted Flaherty, but when is Giamatti not good; he is a literal lock for a ""win win"" performance in any movie. No one perfects a character of a gabby dude looking for male- bonding companionship better than Bobby Cannavale; he mastered it as the Cuban-American Ice Cream Truck vendor Joe Aramas in ""The Station Agent"", and also crowns it here in ""Win Win"" as Mike's best friend and novice assistant wrestling coach Terry Delfino. Jeffrey Tambor was no bore with his comical work as Stephen Vigman, who is Mike's coaching wingman in the wrestling team. Amy Ryan was very sharp and very middle-age hip as Mike's supporting wife Jackie. And newcomer Alex Shaffer pinned in his acting debut nicely with his work as Kyle. It was great to see veteran actor Burt Young back on the top of his game with his very good performance as Leo. McCarthy's superb screenplay deserved a ""win win"" or at least a ""nom nom"" in the Best Original Screenplay Academy Award category. ""Win Win"" is one of my favorite movies of 2011, and its winning formula makes it a viable ""win win"" situation for all to see. *****Excellent"
"bob_meg","6","1","2","5 September 2011"," Actually more of a compromise
","Slice of life drama-dies like Win Win are some of the hardest films to pull off. You're not giving the audience anything wham-bam like a murder, significant traumatic experience, etc. to hang off of. You have to take your time with the set-up and just trust that the inherent humanity and chops of the actors will get you through.<br/><br/>Win Win has a lot of both of these qualities. The casting couldn't be more spot on with regards to the leads. I mean, is there anyone more adept at portraying tragically flawed heroes than Paul Giamatti? Add Amy Ryan's frank unvarnished honesty and newcomer Alex Shaffer's impressive, emotionally bruised performance and you can't possibly go wrong, right?<br/><br/>Well, as much as I eventually liked Win Win, it was a long haul into involvementville for me, and it took me a while to figure out why I took one step back for every two steps forward. <br/><br/>Giamatti is a nearly bankrupt lawyer who takes on guardianship of a dementia-destined senior (a fine Burt Young) with a lot of cash, mainly to get his hands on some of it to save his family and practice. With the bargain, he inadvertently gains custody of the man's grandson, Kyle (Shaffer), who's estranged from his mess of a mother (the always superb Melanie Lynsky). The real bonus, though, comes in the form of Kyle's wrestling prowess, which serves as a catalyst for Giamatti (who also moonlights conveniently as a wrestling coach) to turn his life around, at any cost.<br/><br/>This is inspiring stuff, but unfortunately I found it to be laden down with what I call ""ringers"" --- standard studio plot devices we've seen a million times before that should be amusing and funny, but which only feel tired. The most obvious is the side detour for about ten minutes where Shaffer's character encourages another less athletic student, played by David Thompson, to go for it in a match. This is played out in a very absent, predictable manner that winds up looking frivolous at best and ridiculous at worst.<br/><br/>But the really big blunder is the continuing chapter in what I think is The Bobby Cannavale Problem. Since about the time of The Station Agent, where Cannavale played a somewhat substantial character, he seems destined for the part of the Daffy Sidekick. He literally seems to show up in dozens of movies with next to nothing to do, and almost no character to play. It's like he's the free soda with our movie happy meal, and almost as needed or memorable. Tom McCarthy's script has given him what can only be termed a tour de force in this type of McRole...there is almost no real explanation for his being present in almost any scene...but he's always there, mugging, pitching for camera time. It's got to be one of the most annoying supporting performances in recent memory. Almost by cruel coincidence, Jeffrey Tambor occupies a similar role, but the difference is....Tambor is an expert at comic timing.<br/><br/>I suspect McCarthy's script was ""doctored"" or at least advised to undergo some changes to make it more commercially appealing. It reeks of Hollywood's ""idea"" of What the People Want...the sugar to make the cough syrup go down faster.<br/><br/>That's too bad, because there's a lot of good work here. I would definitely recommend this film, but look for it on the human level, not the canned-laugh drive-thru."

","I snuck into this film after hearing some hype about it over twitter. I didn't expect much from an indie drama that I thought was going to be about high school wrestling. But after the first act, I realized that this flick was definitely more then what I could have imagined it's potential to be. Paul Giamatti plays a lawyer who is having some troubles financially and having some stress related issues, so he becomes a guardian of one of his wealthy clients who has dementia so he can make some extra money on the side. But this leads to him taking care of his clients nephew. As the movie carries on, the family starts to bond with the nephew, who happens to be a talented wrestler, and he has some serious mother issues. But after awhile, his mother comes looking for him, mostly because she wants the money she could earn by being the guardian of her father who she hasn't seen in 20 years. So Paul Giamatti's character gets caught in a mess when he has to reveal to his wife and this newly found ""Family member"" that he has been lieing to them.<br/><br/>This story is really touching because it deals with such real sculpted characters. Each one of them goes through some sort of change throughout the film, and you can understand thoroughly why they went through the change and you can probably relate to their issues and habits. One of the things that did bother me about this film was some of the editing. some scenes where filmed perfectly, with great shot selection and amazing dialogue and acting. but then some seemed really off and over acted, or really badly paced. Some scenes also ended on the same line, which added a nice touch to the realism of the film, but ultimately caused repetition in the dialogue. But this is a double edged sword for me, since most of those scenes could be viewed in those slow pacing/repetitious dialogue sense. but they also portrayed the characters reactions to different things at significant points in the story, so it could be more of a kudos to the director for making that impact... But I'd have to judge that perspective on a second view, which I'd definitely recommend."
"DavidCowden","10","1","2","5 April 2011"," True to its title.
","Win Win is surprisingly fresh. Although much of the plot encompasses high school wrestling, Win Win is far more than a sports film. What really drives the film is the lens it offers into viewing the modern family – a topic seemingly more popular in recent films. In depicting the eligibility of a critic's response to any film, published critic John Simon states that it ""may be entertaining only for those who, by a native endowment of intelligence and sensitivity, or by education, training and experience, possess the wherewithal for being entertained by it."" With Win Win, it's the viewer's exposure to the complexities of modern family life that makes the film not only entertaining, but entirely engaging and refreshing as well.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti plays Mike Flaherty, a family man balancing a struggling career as a small- practice attorney and his role as the local high school wrestling coach. An impressive first performance is brought to the screen by Alex Shaffer playing the character of Kyle. He is a runaway minor seeking his Grandfather Leo, an elder whose estate is under dishonest guardianship of Mike. Kyle turns out to be Mike's answer to his winless wrestling team, as he is an accomplished wrestler from back home in Ohio. Ironically enough, two weeks after being casted, Shaffer dominated New Jersey's state-championship wrestling tournament. His bleach-blonde hair and subdued too-cool-for-school persona works well in the film, which favorably juxtaposes the cliché wrestling image of shaved-heads and varsity jacket jocks. Posing as both an athletic solution and a legal risk to well-intentioned Mike and his corrupt practices, Kyle's newfound home is threatened and conflict ensues.<br/><br/>Thriving on thematic elements of moral behavior, individual control, and self-preservation, Win Win dissects modern parenthood with topics of the role model father, contrasting images of two differing mother figures, and also an observation of parental/estate inheritance. The film screams 'New Jersey', but not in the embarrassing newfound 'Gym, Tan, Laundry' manner, but authentically in its tone, appearance, and most importantly, its use of Jon Bon Jovi. Often hilarious and indefinitely emotive, Win Win is an experience worth stumbling upon of which is true to its title."
"bdub640","8","1","2","10 March 2011"," Win-Win Review by Brian
","I was so privileged to go to an early screening of Win, Win directed by Thomas McCarthy and starring the wonderful Paul Giamatti alongside a fabulous supporting cast. Giamatti offers a much more content character in his role as Mike Flaherty, a down on his luck lawyer/coach of a sub-par high-school wrestling team/family man who would do anything to keep his family comfortable and content.<br/><br/>The plot is as follows:<br/><br/>""Disheartened attorney Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti), who moonlights as a high school wrestling coach, stumbles across a star athlete (Alex Shaffer) through some questionable business dealings while trying to support his family. Just as it looks like he will get a double payday, the boy's mother (Melanie Lynskey) shows up fresh from rehab and flat broke, threatening to derail everything.""<br/><br/>The director would openly admit in the post-screening Q&A that his focus in film is never focusing on a plot but rather letting one occur ""organically"" as his characters develop. While maybe not driven by the most riveting or original story, the message is one that is rarely seen in Hollywood. Sometimes things work out, sometimes things don't work out like you expected. <br/><br/>Giamatti does a wonderful conveying a man who while generally content with his beautiful family, feels a little disheartened that his will to do better for them isn't always enough. The director spoke of Giamatti's (who usually takes on darker roles) challenge to play this family man McCarthy joked during the Q&A that he had called Giamatti after sending him the script and the first thing Giamatti had to say was, ""He seems fuc%$# happy."" If it was a challenge, the viewer could not tell. His work was wonderful and very human. <br/><br/>The ladies of this movie also did a fantastic job. First there was Amy Ryan, best known for her role in The Office, playing Flaherty's wife Jackie. Ryan brought light to the New Jersey house wife that is much more compelling then anything Bravo has ever offered. She is a Jon Bon Jovi loving, head strong, but still incredibly loving woman. Another woman who plays a much smaller role is Margo Martindale. While her character delivers at most 10 lines, she comes on screen with a character already so developed that the lines are not merely filler but rather steal scenes They are not back ground noise, but rather plot devices. I left my favorite lady for last, Melanie Lynskey (The Informant, Up In the Air). Lynskey plays Giamatti's nemesis throughout the movie and even sharing the screen with a veteran of Giamatti's caliber she holds her own. For her character I applaud director/co-writer McMarthy for creating a believable though cliché drunk/drug addled mother character without divulging too much of her dirty past – the cause of her son's angst.<br/><br/>This brings us of course to Mr. Alex Shaffer, never heard of him? Well that makes sense as this is his first role ever. He plays the estranged teenager whom Giammatti brings into his heart and home. The director divulged that in order for this movie to be believable he had to find an actual high school wrestler first, actor second. Not only is he the state champion in his weight class in New Jersey high-school wrestling, he also champions the screen. In a role that is very reminiscent of Paul Dano's Dwayne in Little Miss Sunshine, he brings the quiet but tortured teen brilliantly to life.<br/><br/>All in all, while not necessarily incredibly unique in theme this movie was stunning. No one in the cast fell short, not even the Flaherty's younger daughters. I left this movie with a smile and a reminder that sometimes life get's in the way of other plans. I absolutely think this is a movie that everyone out there can relate to and will enjoy.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 8.5 out of 10, an A-,<br/><br/>definitely worth seeing in theaters and even better for a dreary day next fall when you feel down on your luck and could use a laugh and a reminder that it always gets better —- and if not better —- then at least not worse.<br/><br/>As always thank you for reading and enjoy the movies!"
"Hellmant","8","1","3","3 May 2011"," 'WIN WIN' is definitely a win for writer/director Thomas McCarthy!
","'WIN WIN': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Another sweet hearted character study from actor turned writer/director Thomas McCarthy (who also performed the same duties on the popular indie films 'THE STATION AGENT' and 'THE VISITOR'). This film focuses on a down on his luck attorney/high school wrestling coach who finds new hope when a promising young wrestler shows up in town. Paul Giamatti stars as the attorney / coach and ex high school wrestler Alex Shaffer makes his film debut as the hopeful talent. The film co-stars Amy Ryan, Bobby Cannavale, Jeffrey Tambor, Burt Young and Melanie Lynskey. It's a very humorous and sincere drama that succeeds on almost every level.<br/><br/>Giamatti plays Mike Flaherty who's recently been suffering panic attacks due to very slow business at his independent New Jersey law firm. He's been severely struggling to make enough money to provide for his wife Jackie (Ryan) and two young daughters even though he holds a second job coaching wrestling at the New Providence High School, who are also on a losing streak. He sees an opportunity to make some easy extra money when a client suffering from dementia named Leo (Young) finds himself in need of a caretaker. He takes on the extra task in a somewhat morally questionable way. Then when Leo's grandson Kyle shows up at Leo's door, on the run from his drug addicted mother (Lynskey) and her abusive boyfriend, he sees an inspiring new addition to his wrestling team, due to Kyle's former championship experience at his old school.<br/><br/>The film is very funny at times but it never seems forced, it feels like real humor coming from real people. It's also very touching and emotionally involving but never overly sappy, as with the comedy, the drama of the film just feels very natural as well. This is probably largely due to McCarthy's simplistic but fitting directing and wonderful screenplay, which is adapted from a story co-written by McCarthy and Joe Tiboni (a first time film writer). The acting is all more than adequate as well, especially Giamatti (who can basically do no wrong) and newcomer Shaffer. The film is an all around satisfying and entertaining comedy-drama that just seems to hit all the right notes.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr4LOQxrmg"

","We all saw The Kids are All Right. Many of us enjoyed it and helped it to become a success. What we all haven't seen is Win Win, which is truly unfortunate because it is a more honest though not necessarily better family dramedy than The Kids are All Right. Thomas McCarthy, the writer-director of Win Win, shows one of the best recent examples of realism with his oddly charming screenplay and rich characters. Often enough, quiet movies like this one go unnoticed. I strongly urge people to go see this and not let that happen.<br/><br/>Win Win's plot sounds too complicated for a light comedy. Mike Flaherty (played with tenderness by Paul Giamatti) is happily married to his wife (Amy Ryan) and has two children. This all sounds nice, but his New Jersey law practice is failing. On the verge of losing everything, Mike decides to take a $1,500 monthly commission by becoming the guardian of a client that was recently put into a senior citizen home. As Mike is moving his client's belongings to the home, he meets Kyle (Alex Shaffer in his debut performance), his client's grandson. Kyle has run away from his mother, a drug addict living in Ohio. Mike takes Kyle in and finds that he has a talent for wrestling. As Kyle becomes a bigger part of the family, the Flahertys come closer together and find that they love Kyle.<br/><br/>Win Win boasts a great cast full of well-known Oscar nominees, semi-well-known actors, and complete unknowns. Paul Giamatti is, as usual, a treat to watch as he completely transforms himself into his part. But the real standouts are Amy Ryan, Alex Shaffer, and most importantly Bobby Cannavale. Ryan's supporting performance feels honest and endearing. Shaffer's performance sometimes feel forced, however this is all in character. Shaffer is an actor to watch; we'll see more of him. It is Bobby Cannavale who steals the show as Terry, Mike's divorced and klutzy friend. Cannavale's role demands an actor who can give a fun and sad performance all at once--Cannavale nails it.<br/><br/>Thomas McCarthy as director has done a satisfactory job. Where the great in this film really lies is his extraordinarily ordinary screenplay. In terms of other realistic dramas, we need look no further than Breathless to see what McCarthy has done so right. Jean Luc-Godard immortalized the naive beauty of a regular couple living during the 60's in France. McCarthy has so beautifully humanized an extremely normal family living in America during the recession. Win Win is not particularly well made per se, but does it really need to be when there's such a great screenplay?<br/><br/>Win Win is an actor's film above all else. And yet its story is somehow uplifting and compelling at the same time. The same film could not have come out of another cast or writer. It's a shame this was released in March because it is sure to be overlooked by the Oscars in 2012. Win Win is not a memorable film, but for now, it is a wonderful, small, and quiet film that deserves praise and love from everyone."

As being Burt's Guardian would provide a monthly income, Paul proposes HIMSELF for that position. But, Paul wants to keep the ""source"" of the money SECRET from AMY.<br/><br/>One day, when Paul visit's Burt's house, there's a boy sitting in front of it. When Paul asks the kid who he is & why he's there, he's told his name is Kyle Timmons (ALEX SHAFFER) & he's Burt's GRANDSON!<br/><br/>Paul takes Alex to visit Burt, who says he doesn't HAVE any grandson. Alex reveals that he's 16 years old & the son of his daughter back in Ohio who Burt hasn't seen in decades & who's in a hospital, which is why he's come to stay with Burt. <br/><br/>Burt is quite friendly to not-very-talkative Alex, & says he'd prefer being IN his own house where Alex came to stay, but he's not allowed to be there. Without revealing everything to wife Amy, Paul proposes that Alex stay with THEM for a week or so while he tries to reach Burt's daughter.<br/><br/>Paul has trouble TRACKING DOWN Alex's mom Cindy (MELANIE LYNSKEY), & is distressed to learn she's in a DRUG-rehab program with an indefinite ""recovery"" date.<br/><br/>Amy's not ""thrilled"" at the idea of caring for someone they barely know. But, since Alex has shown himself to be polite and thoughtful (including in the way he plays with their little girls), she ACCEPTS his continued presence there for the time being.<br/><br/>In some ways, Alex might seem a bit ""strange""-- but he's mainly just a ""QUIET"" teenager, who keeps things to ""himself"" unless he gets in the ""mood"" to talk about some certain subjects (such as his own past life). <br/><br/>He's also clearly CONSIDERATE (such as regularly visiting Burt in the Home) & also helpful, wanting to assist Amy in getting groceries-- & even asks to get a favorite cereal that Burt particularly likes.<br/><br/>At one point, Alex asks if he can ""watch"" as Paul ""volunteers"" as a coach of the town's high school WRESTLING team, the ""Pioneers"". The team has a long ""history""-- for consistently LOSING their matches, although Paul & his assistant coach Vigman (JEFFREY TAMBOR) do the best they can with the 12 or so kids on the team.<br/><br/>To Alex's asking if he might participate in some of the work-outs, Paul feels that'd be OK-- especially since Alex says yes, he's DONE ""some"" wrestling in the past. When he works out, Paul sees Alex is VERY GOOD at the sport.<br/><br/>Paul's best friend, Terry Delfino (BOBBY CANNAVALE), needs something to keep him ""busy"", since he's very upset over his recent divorce. When he watches Alex practice, he also is amazed at how talented he is-- & ""looks him up"" on the INTERNET, learning that Alex had once been an award-winning athlete back in Ohio.<br/><br/>Bobby becomes ""GUNG-HO"" in having Alex join the TEAM (after Paul works to get him enrolled in the high school) Alex has an unusually good WORK-ethic, taking it upon himself to do things to help his Training.<br/><br/>Rather than make fun of any of the other under-achieving team members, Alex quietly works to encourage & help THEM in the sport. He becomes a good friend to their least-talented team member, Stemler (DAVID W. THOMPSON) -- a tall, uncoordinated kid who he sincerely likes as a person, partly because of their mutual interest in playing VIDEO games <br/><br/>Thanks to Alex's presence, all the team members start to IMPROVE in their wrestling, to the point that they get along GREAT with each other & start doing really WELL in their meets. Paul & Amy grow increasingly FOND of Alex, & enjoy having him around (even if he never does initiate much in the way of verbal communications most of the time). <br/><br/>Alex & the wrestlers continue to gain an increasing amount of NOTORIETY in the town, especially as the team has a chance of going ""ALL THE WAY"" championship-wise in the area. Into that unusually ""comfortable"" mix, a walking ""WRENCH"" arrives-- in the form of the unexpected appearance of Alex's mom MELANIE (whom Alex has long been on the ""OUTS"" with). And, we soon learn that she's gotten in contact with a woman lawyer named Shelley (MARGO MARTINDALE).<br/><br/>Will Melanie's arrival turn out to HELP Alex in his wrestling, or hurt him?... Is Melanie in town to try to ""GET"" something from Burt or Paul?... Will Amy find out about Paul's ""SECRETS"" from her?... How will things ""END-UP"" for all the major characters?<br/><br/>This is an UNUSUAL movie-- both in the way Paul has a basically ""CONTENTED"" family life, & how you have a satisfying sports-related film WITHOUT the usual ""PAT"" type endings to the various plot lines.<br/><br/>The acting is both ""controlled"" & CREDIBLE, by the old & ""new"" actors, the story is a fine one (showing how people can move forward even without moral ""perfection"" inherent), & it ended with my hoping there'd be a ""CONTINUATION"" of the story.

However deep you want to dig into the case at hand in 'Win Win' and from whichever angle you may try to look at it, Mike comes out being a smart and kind man who should have known and judged better than to try to pull a 'stunt' like this... even if the government would have done the very exact same thing with Leo (as I understand it). But then invincible, precocious Kyle comes into the picture, with that, ahem, magical chant: ''Whatever the f*** it takes!''.

","I have to admit that I tend to give easy grades to films that can make me laugh and shed a few tears, if the performances are good and the story is somewhat believable, and have a beginning, middle, and end. This one had all that for me, and I found it to be one of the best movies of 2011, along with ""The Descendants"" and ""The Help"".<br/><br/>There are some parallels to ""The Blind Side"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine"", so if you found those too sugary, you may not like this one either. Paul Giamatti plays a not too successful lawyer, who asks to become the guardian to an aging Burt Young, who has some dementia, but wants to remain in his home. But Giamatti is only doing this so he can get a monthly $1500 check from the state, and quickly deposits Young in a local assisted living facility. (A flaw might be that I didn't see who would cover the cost there, since the court thinks he would remain in his home). But things change when a 16 year old grandson who has not been in his grandfather's life shows up at the granddads porch, a runaway from his drug-addicted mom. Giamatti earns extra money as a high school wrestling coach, and the grandson (Alex Schaffer) was an outstanding wrestler at his home school in Ohio. <br/><br/>This is where the story emerges, and the film really comes alive. The teen moves in with Giamatti and his family, and enrolls in school there, joining the wrestling team. Later, his Mom also re-enters the scene, complicating matters. The story may be predictable to some, but I found the twists and turns somewhat original, and while there is some sentimentality, it is not saccharine, or dwelled on, making it more genuine.<br/><br/>While this may not have been a perfect film, and as another reviewer mentioned, Cannales role seemed unnecessary. I wondered why they would remain close friends, as they had little in common. He was probably just for comic relief.<br/><br/>So why did I give this a 10 instead of an 8 or so? Because I had a wonderful time watching it (I have seen it 3 times now), and had lots of laughs, chuckles, and a few tears. I'll take that anytime over some cold movie like ""No Country For Old Men"", or ""There Will Be Blood"". I like films with heart and deep emotional content, and this definitely had both."

","This inspiring indie film is director Thomas McCarthy's third feature, whose first two films THE STATION AGENT (2003) and THE VISITOR (2007) have been touchstones for newbie Hollywood indie filmmakers and this time, WIN WIN underpins this theory and is on its way to gain Mr. McCarthy a broader audience and a more auspicious future as a director instead of an actor, I still recall Thomas' ill-fated role in 2012 (2009). <br/><br/>The film is everything one can expect from a sincere dramedy, a solid cast, an entangled plot which merely touches the verge of skepticism (anyone is willing to challenge why our protagonist is still able to earn his monthly commission while put the old man in a sanatorium? who the hack pay for the posh nursing home?), all the dramatic emotion surge is being perfectly balanced and manipulated along with the witty quips and farcical slap-sticks. <br/><br/>Continuing director's trademark of surrogate family, in WIN WIN, the story looks like an upgraded version of THE BLIND SIDE (2009) and the situation becomes more tangled when the kindhearted premise is based on a selfish profit, then the quick-fire struggles are much more convincing. The wrestle game is another high-light in the film, quirky but really funny (I do prefer wrestle to football).<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti is never being better and Amy Ryan is wholeheartedly lovable to be cast against her stereotyped tough roles, Bobby Cannavale and the novice Alex Shaffer are amazing as well, plus a typically underrated Melanie Lynskey whose capacity is no less than her co-star in HEAVENLY CREATURES, Kate Winslet. her enactment of a heartless and mercenary mother is able to hold water. <br/><br/>The warmth is pervasive in the film even when it plunges into its darkest hour, WIN WIN is an exquisitely small film harbors a grand ambition to give everyone a feel-good experience to encourage oneself to being a better person, which is a genuine win-win for both filmmakers and its audience."

","Win Win is the third and most accessible of McCarthy's humanistic films, and like his previous films, it focuses on a conflicted central character who is forced to mesh with other equally troubled characters and despite differences manage to create makeshift families all for the sake of human connection.<br/><br/>In this case, the central character is played by Paul Giamatti, a lawyer who also volunteers as the local high school wrestling coach. Giamatti's only client Leo played by Burt Young, is a senile old man who wants to stay in his house but has become a burden on the State. Pressed for cash, Giamatti tells the judge he is willing to be a guardian so Leo can stay in his house and is given a stipend for home upkeep and his troubles. Giamatti then pockets the cash and forces Leo into an old folks home reasoning he would be better off.<br/><br/>This of course is done without his family's knowledge. Things however get complicated when Kyle, Leo's street-wise grandson runs away from home and shows up on Leo's doorstep. Giamatti and kin are then forced to bring him into their family.<br/><br/>Like all of McCarthy's films, the story is told with great care and sensitivity. It's not rushed like so many of today's films and unfolds with great affection for the characters. Unlike his other films however, this one has Paul Giamatti. Giamatti has a presence and flair that Peter Dinklage and Richard Jenkins just didn't have. His character might be a bit of a opportunistic schlub as further evidenced by his zeal to add Kyle to his wrestling team roster, but his intentions are pure even when his actions are despicable.<br/><br/>Win Win tends to be a tad bit funnier than The Station Agent and The Visitor but the jokes still come from the characters. McCarthy favorite Bobby Cannavale shines as a family friend going through divorce and Jeffrey Tambor does a great job as assistant coach who is demoted to assistant, assistant coach. Also making the best of their parts are Amy Ryan as Giamatti's watchful wife and Melanie Lynskey as Kyle's drug-addled mom.<br/><br/>My only real criticism is the film tends to be predictable. Right when you see Paul Giamatti's character offers his services as a guardian you just know he'll get his comeuppance by the time the credits role. Likewise Kyle's induction to the wrestling team gives the film a feel-good sports movie vibe that can annoy jaded viewers.<br/><br/>Still its hard not to like this film for its great, well developed, three-dimensional characters and its sober humanism.

","Having been impressed by his last directorial effort, 2007's ""The Visitor"" (which netted lead actor Richard Jenkins a well-deserved Oscar nomination), actor-turned-director/screenwriter Thomas McCarthy shows the same idiosyncratic attention to character in this quiet 2011 dramedy. It has the same ramshackle, off-kilter quality, this time focusing on middle-class New Jersey suburbia and the struggles of conscience that occur during economically challenging times. The protagonist is Mike Flaherty, a small-town attorney whose practice is sinking under the weight of mounting bills. He's also a family man with a wife and two daughters, who also moonlights as a high school wrestling coach on a losing streak. While representing Leo Poplar, a man suffering from dementia, he comes up with an unethical plan that has him taking over Leo's guardianship and pocketing $1,500 a month while keeping his client in a nursing home.<br/><br/>His plan is not without a certain remorse, and an unexpected turn occurs when Leo's surly 16-year-old grandson Kyle shows up from Ohio to live with his grandfather. Not being a bad guy, Mike takes Kyle into his home where he starts to fit in quite well, especially when it turns out he is a gifted wrestler whose success buoys the spirit of the team. Complicating matters, however, is Kyle's negligent, drug-addicted mother who suddenly shows up to reclaim Kyle and her father. Through it all, McCarthy shows a genuine gift for believable dialogue that unfolds the story without resorting to clichés or big moments that take his actors out of character for the sake of the story. In response, the cast he has assembled is superb. In his best big-screen role since ""Sideways"", Paul Giamatti portrays Mike with a fierce passivity that somehow elicits empathy to his character's sketchy behavior. Amy Ryan is his match as his tough-minded wife Jackie lending a moral certitude that Mike clearly lacks. Together they make one of the most credible married couples I have seen in any recent film.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Tambor lends his innate weariness to Mike's office mate who also happens to coach the wrestling team, and Bobby Cannavale, who worked with McCarthy on his first film, 2003's ""The Station Agent"", provides his particular motor-mouthed energy to Mike's oblivious best friend Terry, a hedge fund manager still manically obsessed with his ex-wife. Burt Young, still best known as Paulie in all the ""Rocky"" films, plays Leo in his familiar mumbling manner. Newcomer Alex Shaffer affectingly plays Kyle like a stone-faced version of Sean Penn's Spicoli in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" until his character gradually warms to the Flahertys. As his estranged mom Cindy, Melanie Lynskey is touching as a woman whose sense of uncertainty informs her every move. David W. Thompson provides welcome comic relief as Kyle's hopeless insecure teammate Stemler, and Claire Foley is remarkably assured as the Flahertys' eldest daughter Abby. All the plot threads are so deftly handled by McCarthy and his cast that the larger themes of culpability and responsibility resonate on a very human scale."

","Director Tom McCarthy said in an interview that he can't stand sports movies in which the actors can't play the sport, which is why he chose Alex Shaffer, a state champion wrestler, to play the part of Kyle. Win Win is definitely what you would call a character-driven movie, not that it is lacking in story, but without the performances of the principal actors it wouldn't have amounted to much of a film. Fine acting and some precision dialogue lift this movie well above the formulaic mediocrity filling most of the theaters at the mall mega-cineplex.<br/><br/>At first Kyle seems like a typical maladjusted, teenage misfit but we quickly see that there is a lot more depth to him than his rough exterior of monosyllabic speech, dyed hair and cigarettes. ""He's probably on drugs,"" one character remarks. Before we see that Kyle is some sort of prodigy on the wrestling mat we see that he is basically a fine boy: polite, sweet, honest, very hard-working, etc.<br/><br/>The movie is billed as a comedy and it is, but what drew me in was that it's also incredibly sweet. Kyle is just such a great kid. He's is what you would want your kids to be like. He's who I wish that I could have been more like in high school, a better version of myself, a better version of most people. This is all apart from the fact that the kid happens to be a bad-ass grappler. Although not really a sports movie, there are enough scenes of wrestling to probably qualify it for the genre, and there are certainly a lot of laughs to file it under comedy, Win Win is more sweet than anything. Add that to its other qualities and you have a pretty good little movie in my book."

","Tom McCarthy is a young gifted artist - actor, writer, director - who has gifted us in the past with such memorable small films as writer/director of 'The Visitor', 'The Station Agent', and as writer for 'Up'. He deals with simple people encountering complex problems and shows us how cooperative relationships make life OK. McCarthy both wrote (with Joe Tiboni) and directed WIN WIN and if there were two words that would best describe this film the title supplies them. It is real, touching without becoming saccharine, and populated by a cast of some very fine actors who deliver a very human story. <br/><br/>Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti) is a sown on his luck lawyer in poor economic times who deals with elderly people as clients. His loyal wife Jackie (Amy Ryan) keeps their small house in Providence, New Jersey (McCarthy's home town, by the way) in order, managing their two daughters, the funky Abby (Clare Foley) and Stella (Penelope Kindred), in tow. One of Mike's clients Leo Poplar (Burt Young) is entering early senility and the court wants him placed in a home. Discovering that Leo pays good money for a guardian Mike accepts guardianship but moves Leo into a rest home, keeping his house locked up. Mike discovers a young 16 year old kid on Leo's doorstep and learns that the lad is Kyle (Alex Schaffer), Leo's grandson form Ohio who has run away from home because his mother (Melanie Lynskey) is in rehab and Kyle has escaped the abuse of her boyfriend. Kyle is taken in to the Flaherty family (tough Jackie melts and insists they support him). What Mike discovers is that Kyle is a Wrestling Champion and Mike happens to coach the high school wrestling team with his law partner Stephen Vigman (Jeffrey Tambor) and Mike's buddy Terry Delfino (Bobby Cannavale). Kyle's presence eventually leads the losing team to a winning position: Kyle is sensitive to the nerdy loser Stemler (David Thompson) and boosts the entire team's spirit. Problems arise: Cindy comes to town to claim Leo (and get his money) and hires lawyer Eleanor (Margo Martindale) to meet her aims. Mike's finagling of Leo's money backfires, Kyle loses faith in his new family, Leo only wants to go to his home, and all things seem to fall apart until unexpected changes occur in each of the characters. <br/><br/>Some viewers will see this as yet another 'Blind Side' type movie - and that is a Positive! Too few films deal with the sanctity of the family and the manner in which true family relationships can improve society at large. Tom McCarthy has managed to create a tender, humorous, realistic, and deeply touching film. Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan once again prove they are among our finest actors, but it the surprise debut of Alex Schaffer, a 17 year old lad who has been a wrestler but has no prior acting credits, that makes this film glow. The cameos by Burt Young, Jeffrey Tambor, Bobby Cannavale, Melanie Lynskey, and Margo Martindale along with all the other minor characters are superb. This is a film to restore faith in human kindness - a film that would benefit time together with youngsters and adults to observe how the world can tick. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

He's been separated from his mother and wants to visit his grandfather. Mike lets Kyle stay in his own home and he turns out to be an incredibly relaxed individual. He even helps train with a high school wrestling team, where Mike and his friend Stephen (Jeffrey Tambor) are coaching a group of kids who can't win a game. <br/><br/>Paul Giamatti is excellent in this small but surprisingly complex parable. As a comedy-drama the film asks whether good deeds are fuelled by any form of self-interest. When looking at Mike's relationship with Leo the answer is simple. But Giamatti makes this a much more interesting and sympathetic character. There are few actors in Hollywood who can carry the hangdog baggage that he can. He brings a convincingly understated sense of guilt to Mike to enrich his usual loner character. In a clever opening scene, we see Mike, his wife and his daughter all curse the same swear word in different rooms of the house. This foreshadows a lot of Mike's anxieties about his daughters growing up and struggling to support themselves like their parents are now. On a more subconscious level is his relationship with Kyle. It's revealed that Mike and his friends used to be underachieving wrestlers themselves when they were kids. And seeing their determination for their team to win a game, especially when Kyle is throw into the mix, suggests they are looking for some resolve in themselves. There's a poignant moment after a match where Mike and Kyle are walking out together and he asks the kids how he stays so calm all the time, as though he'd look to discover that in himself. <br/><br/>In a smart and funny screenplay, littered with details like this, it's an incredibly subtle moment that works because of the delicacy of the performances and the direction Thomas McCarthy shows over his actors. This is essential an actors' film and the supporting cast are terrific too. Amy Ryan, in what could have been a superfluous role, gives Jackie some steely paternal and protective instincts. One of her best scenes is where she and Mike argue over a lock on the basement door, when she declares that she's not taking any chances with 'Eminem' in the house. And bringing some big laughs are Jeffrey Tambor and Bobby Cannavale as Mike's friends, especially when they start fighting over the coaching roles. Dramatically, the film has only a few hitting moments, shared between Kyle and his mother, as this is a low key film. But at least the ending is a realistic and honest one that values hard work and honesty. And with so much instant gratification in the world at the moment, that's a pretty big deal."
"DICK STEEL","10","0","2","1 August 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Win Win
","Thomas McCarthy is fast becoming one of my favourite filmmakers, having wrote and directed The Visitor which I had enjoyed, and following that up with another powerful gem of a film here in Win Win, complete with wonderfully crafted characters, great performances all round, and a story that deals with how we deal with challenges placed in front of us, whether we lapse and opt for the short cut out, or in some cases, stick to our guns and do what's morally correct, keeping our integrity and reputation intact.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti stars as Mike Flaherty, a decent family man and a community lawyer whose business isn't thriving, and is soon running into debt if the lack of meaningful work continues. And if life on the professional front isn't rosy enough, he's also a volunteer wrestling coach at the New Providence High School, but so far having no luck in coaching championship material from his boys, and have a hard time trying to buckle their losing trend in the season thus far. Perhaps only his family in wife Jackie (Amy Ryan) and kids keep him fairly sane, and of course best friend Terry (Bobby Cannavale) and assistant coach Stephen (Jeffrey Tambor).<br/><br/>But with work on the professional front heading nowhere, he signs up as guardian for his client Leo Poplar, a well to do senior citizen who's about to descent further into the stages of dementia, and as his attorney, decided to take up guardianship for an extra 1500 dollars per month as personal revenue, but snooking the judge in having to ultimately dump Leo into an elder care home. You can scream conflict of interest, and the lack of integrity now, because simply put, this is probably what Thomas McCarthy had in mind for us to think about when we bend the rules for personal benefit, which may seem like a good idea now, will come back to haunt us with deeper impact later on in life.<br/><br/>And everything seemed to work out pretty well too, especially when Leo's grandson Kyle (newcomer Alex Shaffer) enters the Flaherty's lives much to the objection of Jackie, but having to listen to his plight and see that this delinquent actually has a stout heart, and for Mike not to mention a one time wrestling MVP in his hands now, the cards are finally all coming into play now, if not for Kyle's mom and Leo's daughter Cindy (Melanie Lynskey) to suddenly appear and become the perennial spanner in the works, threatening to break up something good that's happening to all the characters, and especially Mike now that he has everything to lose, especially his integrity when the truth gets unravelled.<br/><br/>Thomas McCarthy had weaved a narrative that simply worked wonders, with very powerful characters crafted to be fleshed out by his actors, who all did an amazing job balancing the dramatic moments laced with the occasional humour throughout. Paul Giamatti excels in his role as the average Joe being caught in extraordinary circumstances and having to deal with them as best as he can, juggling different aspects and having to spin half truths. It's been a while since we last saw him not in a chopsocky over-the-top role. Bobby Cannavale instead took over the over the topness with his role as the none too serious best friend and confidante, while Alex Shaffer turned out to be the revelation here with his troubled teenager role blessed with a talent that threatens to be wasted should he not get his personal act together, sharing great chemistry opposite Giamatti in a foster father-son relationship.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic story about how we tend to cover up and do the things that we don't mean to if not for self-preservation, and a reminder that honesty is always the best policy here. Sometimes we may lapse and be given a second chance to make things right again, and that's when we have to strive to achieve that win-win outcome. This film gets my clear vote of confidence in being one of the best this year has to offer, and with an excellent soundtrack to boot, what's there not to like about it? Highly recommended!"

","A beautifully observed piece of storytelling with Paul Giammati at the top of his game. Its lovely to be able to go to the cinema and watch a proper story with superb acting unfold with no rush by the director to move the story on......you get to feel for the characters and explore their emotions at their pace. brilliant We start with the very real problem of a lawyer who is just too nice who has a bit of a downturn in fortunes and goes completely against character and exploits an elderly client he doesn't bargain form the complications this may cause and the way Paul Giammati brings this across and the pain you feel for him just shows you what a great job he is doing. the way it all unravels is excellent but painful for the audience ultimately its a superior piece of storytelling which will leave you feeling very happy with the world"
"glazed_doughnut","Null","0","1","18 May 2011"," A fine movie - in context
","After reading the reviews of this movie, it struck me that most reviewers tend not to contextualize their criticism or praise and that is left in the hands of the reader to sort out, if possible. This could be true of almost any movie, but the reason I am writing this here is because I think ""Win Win"" is a very good movie if taken in context, but can easily prove to be a disappointment if viewed with the wrong expectations.<br/><br/>Win Win is a slice-of-life movie that wavers between a family-oriented Disney drama and a light-hearted adult time-filler. I went to see this movie with my 12-year old daughter with the expectation of the former and despite some rather rough language and story concepts a bit beyond a 12-year old's comprehension, it pretty much hit the mark. It was not the best movie even of its genre, but if looking for something beyond Pixar or Hannah Montana for depth, Win Win is well-worth the admission price. There are few surprises here, but the acting and strong characters more than compensate for any script shortcomings or challenging story lines.<br/><br/>If your expectation is to be dazzled or have your heart-strings played, well, you probably will be disappointed, but if you are looking for a decent movie to share with teenage kids, this will work quite well."
"RealtorMatthew","9","0","1","8 May 2011"," The Most Underrated Movie of 2011 So Far
","""They don't know who you are"" is a line delivered in WIN WIN by Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti) directed by Thomas McCarthy to his star high school wrestler Kyle (Alex Shaffer). A very apropos line because audiences across America don't know who Alex is yet, but I'm guessing we'll hear more about him in the years to come.<br/><br/>WIN WIN is an ironic comedy in that what you don't expect to be funny, is. And you've got lots of tender heart-warming moments accompanying the complications.<br/><br/>Mike is an attorney falling on hard times in his business. He moonlights on the side coaching high school wrestling in his small town in New Jersey. Mike's situation is one most of us can identify with: trying to provide for his family but taking a step in desperation that could result in disastrous consequences.<br/><br/>Mike is married to Jackie (Amy Ryan) who is a strong minded, don't-take-any-crap kind of a mom. She is also a nurturer, fiesty, and definitely has an edge to her personality. We see her as the backbone and moral compass for her family, as well as the movie.<br/><br/>The plot goes like this: Mike's client Leo Poplar (Burt Young) has been ordered before a judge to determine if he needs to become a ward of the state and moved into a senior care facility. Upon discovering that a guardian is compensated for the care of Leo and with his family nowhere to be found, Mike decides to capitalize on this opportunity to add some extra income to his family's budget. In accordance with Leo's desires to live at home, the judge declares him under the care of Mike, who directly disobeys the order and moves Leo into a facility. No heavy lifting, right? What throws a wrench into Mike's plans is Leo's grandson Kyle (Alex Shaffer), who has run away from home and come to live with his previously unknown grandfather. Of course, as this is not possible with Leo no longer living there, Mike reluctantly puts Kyle up in his home.<br/><br/>Kyle is the lone-wolf type, who is quiet and aloof, and as the movie progresses we watch him make better decisions. Particularly of note is the relationship he develops with team member Stemler (David W. Thompson), who is quirky and generates some good laughs of his own.<br/><br/>We discover that Kyle was a star wrestler at his former high school and Mike discovers a way to get his Bad-News-Bears wrestling team out of a major losing streak. This is where I believe the first allusion to the movie's title WIN WIN comes in - it is Mike going for the double win of the wrestling team and extra money for his family.<br/><br/>The two assistant coaches provide their own humor. Terry Delfino (Bobby Cannavale) is Mike's best friend, who's wife has just left him and is trying to distract himself. He is overt and a little oblivious at times, and coins the term ""manstrength"" when referring to the physical power Kyle has. Stephen Vigman (Jeffrey Tambor) is the other coach, who is not exactly welcoming Terry as his new competition.<br/><br/>Enter Kyle's mom Cindy (Melanie Lynskey) - a down-on-her luck, vulnerable woman who has come to the realization that upon being abandoned by her boyfriend, wants her son back and potentially derails Mike's plans. Upon discovering the reason Mike took the guardianship of her father, she brings in counsel to move Leo with her back to Ohio, where she believes he and Kyle belong. Mike proposes she receive the stipend, and leave the boy to finish the school year and wrestling season- our second WIN WIN scenario. Will her motives and ultimate choice between these be the best for herself, Mike, Kyle, or everyone? The ending no doubt will receive conflicting opinions from movie watchers. I believe what ends up happened is the best possible outcome, at least in that moment.<br/><br/>A good portion of the movie's humor comes from the reactions of characters to lines given, one specifically is when Kyle asks Mike to slap him in the head to get him psyched up for his wrestling match. This is followed by a look of ""what are you doing?"" from Jackie, and the Mike's returning smile telling her ""it's all good"" The subtleties and expressions are priceless, as could be expected with a cast of this caliber.<br/><br/>The bond formed between Kyle and Jackie is strong and believable, as we begin to identify with Jackie's character really taking Kyle on as her son. At one point when Kyle is particularly upset she says ""We love you. I just want you to know that"" I enjoyed watching Mike & Jackie as they carried on like a typical married couple, with one person trying to get away with something by downplaying it and the other calling them right out. Classic.<br/><br/>We come to care about all of the characters in the movie, as we see that they are all just trying to do their best with their current circumstances, even though feelings get hurt and tempers flare.<br/><br/>The theme of the movie seems to be that no matter how bad things may be, there are always other options, remembering your actions have repercussions reaching farther that you could ever imagine.<br/><br/>When considering your next cinema choice, please remember this movie review of WIN WIN 9/10 stars"

","WIN WIN (2011) **** Paul Giamatti, Amy Ryan, Bobby Cannivale, Jeffrey Tambor, Melanie Lynskey, Alex Shaffer, Margo Martindale, Burt Young. Winning dramedy with Giamatti (gold!) as a small-town attorney/high school soccer coach trying to make ends meet when he assumes legal guardianship of his latest client (Young), deemed incapacitated by dementia and finds a secret weapon for his struggling athletic group in the old man's long-lost grandson (newcomer Shaffer, a real life athlete making a subtle debut). Actor-turned-filmmaker Tom McCarthy – who co-scripted the funny/witty/honest screenplay with Joe Tiboni - once again scores in this tailor-made for sad sack Giamatti (in one of his best roles) with a sweet ensemble (flinty yet loving Ryan as his wife, flighty yet well-meaning divorcée bud Cannivale and odd-duck assistant coach Tambor). A fine gem of an indie that hits all the right spots in entertaining fashion."

","""They don't know who you are"". Lawyer and part time wrestling coach Mike (Paul Giamatti) says this to his star young player, Kyle (Alex Shaffer). The same can be applied to the young new actor who plays the troubled, but gifted Alex.<br/><br/>Director and co-writer Thomas McCarthy, chose the real life all state champion, Shaffer, to portray a young man whose only escape from his hectic life is his love and talent for high school wrestling. How does the kid do? This reviewer thinks the kid has found a brand new career in Hollywood. More on that later.<br/><br/>Outside of the newcomer, how is the movie? It is one of the best films of the year. It is a movie full of tough choices, laughs, and amazing performances. McCarthy, who gave us 2008's 'The Visitor"", which I haven't seen, but was a critical and public success, has hit a home run. Giamatti's Mike, is a good guy, who has just had one negative thing thrown at him time and time again. He sees an opportunity to make some extra cash for his struggling law firm by illegally beating the system. He uses one of his clients, who is suffering from early signs of dementia. Even though he is stealing the money from the client, he in turn takes of the client. On top of supporting a family, he also coaches a wrestling team that is the laughing stock of all the local schools. It isn't until the client's grandson, Kyle, comes in that things start to turn around not only for Mike, but Kyle. Kyle, comes from a broken home where the mother is in and out of drug rehab centers. He wants some type of stable relationship and he finds it in Mike's family. Mike's wife, Jackie (Amy Ryan), and their two daughters take a liking to him. Just when things are looking up for Mike and his team, who Kyle helps turn into a winning team, the mother comes back and chaos ensues.<br/><br/>Even though at first glance the movie may seem about wrestling, that is only a plot device for a movie about human relationships. Shaffer, who is much better than half of the actors his age, shows as much confidence as an actor as he does on the mat. Jackie and Kyle's relationship is very touching at times. Jackie is the mother bird mending the broken wing that is Kyle's life. It is nothing too cheesy or overly dramatic, it is perfectly balanced.<br/><br/>Giamatti, how is he? What do you think? He has a much more restrained role in this film. Even though he doesn't have the looks of the a leading man, he has something better, something that won't fade...TALENT! McCarthy perfectly balances the comedy and drama here. It never gets too silly, but also never gets so mundane with the drama. The performances are the strong point here and they are working off a fantastic script."
"janetki-imdb","7","0","1","20 April 2011"," Warm Fuzzies
","Tom McCarthy's The Station Agent and The Visitor set me up for something spectacular. Was it spectacular? No, but it was entirely enjoyable and left me satisfied with a good concoction of humor and warm fuzzies. It's important to know that Win Win didn't abandon common sense in order to contrive its feel-good moments. It felt honest. Tom McCarthy has demonstrated the ability to write in enough complexity and flaws into his characters to create sincere connections amongst his characters that don't require cheap happy endings for warm fuzzies. Jackie (Amy Ryan) is the wife of Mike (Paul Giamatti) and mother of two girls. Rather than simply a sounding board to the central male protagonist, Jackie is a separate force of spunk and integrity. Leo (Burt Young) and Terry (Bobby Cannavale) are delightful side characters that offer lots of comic relief in the somber story of ordinary folk. Kyle (Alex Shaffer), a troubled teenage boy, falls into the hands of Mike, a struggling small town attorney and an even worse-off high school wrestling coach. As anticipated by the trailers, Kyle turns out to be a remarkable wrestler. As exciting as wrestling can be (I have no idea what that feels like), this movie isn't the one to showcase its awesomeness. It's not really about the sport, or the game. In other words, I wouldn't get your hopes up for a heroic showdown of squirming prepubescent boys. Overall, a pretty good film: http://fatkidslist.wordpress.com/2011/04/19/win-win/"

","If you liked Tom McCarthys other two movies - ""The Station Agent"" and ""The Visitor"" you'll like this as well. Of the three movies I liked this the best. It's not as quirky as The Station Agent and it doesn't have the serious turn that The Visitor has. What it does have is a comfortable ease: it just seems very real. The characters are written and acted well; there isn't a false note in the story. The only character that could have been fleshed out a little more was Kyle's mom Cindy.<br/><br/>I couldn't imagine a better actor for the roll of Mike than Paul Giamatti. You Know the downtrodden everyman characters he plays so well. Mike is just trying to do the best he knows how for his family and his life. Bobby Cannavale plays his good friend Terry with a quirky verve that fun to watch. Amy Ryan as Mike's wife Jackie is no nonsense solid support and quite funny as well. New guy Alex Shaffer as Kyle was a quiet revelation and a good wrestler too.<br/><br/>If you're looking to give your eyes a CGI rest, come down to earth and see Win Win."
"mr_wiseguy","10","0","2","3 April 2011"," Flawless indie gem
","Win Win is an amazing, near perfect indie sleeper. The whole movie can be summed up in one word: authentic. The characters were not overacted, the plot was fun and believable, and the whole thing felt so real. I know, as a wrestler, about being in cramped gyms, guys cracking jokes that aren't funny, and it was so relatable. It wasn't just relatable to me either. It would be perfect for so many people because it has everything a great movie needs, and it gives off a fun atmosphere from the start. What I was also impressed with were the characters. They were hilarious in simple, subtle ways. Also, Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan gave incredible, believable performances that you can't help but fall in love with. Also, Bobby Cannavale gave probably one of the funniest performances I've seen in years. And for Alex Shaffer to have never been on film before, he was great. Director/writer Tom McCarthy nailed it again. Win Win is a perfect example of what a family drama/comedy should be: fun, believable, and relatable. This movie was just terrific."
