","As one of the privileged few who saw the world premiere at SXSW (even badge holders were turned away), Hooligans is sure to be one of the most talked about films of the year.<br/><br/>Lexi Alexander, who, according to her Q&A answers at the premiere, grew up amongst the type of men depicted in Hooligans. The choice to use an American as a central character was deliberate, to quickly get into the story and see the lifestyle from an outsider's perspective.<br/><br/>As a wrongfully expelled Harvard student, Matt (Elijah Wood) decides to stay with his sister in England, and is reluctantly befriended by his brother in law's brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam). Wood deftly plays the passive introvert ripe for the seduction of group-bonding violence Hunnam's charismatically surly Pete, who introduces him to football (aka soccer) and the 'firms' who are known for their violence against rival teams' fans.<br/><br/>Without glorifying the violence, fully realized and likable characters explore how easily someone can be drawn into hooliganism. Instead of using broad strokes, Alexander demonstrates through Matt how even the most unlikely people get caught up in mob mentality and violence, through the bonds of friendship and belonging.<br/><br/>With an edgy soundtrack and strong performances, Hooligans leaves a lasting impression."

","5 Stars; A truly great film, with a powerful story. Beautifully photographed, in London, Wow! The audience was quickly involved, and laughed, started, and gave a standing ovation at the end. Truly a complete film, thank you for having a real ending to the film, which is so rare these days. Never apologize for this film, it is loving, stark, caring, hard, honest, violent, and beautiful. It touches the emotions, and the feeling of not belonging that exists within many of us, and that longing for love and brotherhood, that is not available without some dire costs. The characters were so clearly human, powerful and conflicted one was drawn to care for everything that happened to them and cheer at their triumphs and sit in horror at their losses.<br/><br/>I have recommended that everyone see this film during SXSW. My wife and I were expecting an audience award for the film, which it easily won, however the Jury Award was also won and we were give true appreciation for the jury system at SXSW.<br/><br/>Beautiful photographed, with outstanding music, this production hits all the marks out of the ballpark and should be studied for how powerful film today could be. This is the level of film making I aspire to achieve."
"pitz42","Null","212","306","10 March 2005"," HOOLIGANS is the best of this genre so far
","First of all there hasn't been a good film about English Football Hooliganism. Both ID in 1995 and last years FOOTBALL FACTORY either failed to convince or just went down the familiar exploitative road of glamorising the buzz and thrill of violence.<br/><br/>HOOLIGANS as the title suggests depicts what these aforementioned films centre upon with the added value of having a story and characters you care about. There's no avoiding the cliché's as the ranks of these organised gang members are portrayed as gangsters.<br/><br/>Similar to BBC's Gary Oldman drama THE FIRM broadcast in 1986 it also show the characters as normal members of society, family men with respectable jobs. FOOTBALL FACTORY took the extreme and unconvincing scenario that these weekend animals are florist's during the week which might be amusing but the subject matter of organised territorial football hooliganism needs to be given a serious look at.<br/><br/>Fortunately HOOLIGANS portrays this more realistically, sure there's the stereo types in designer clothes (The Chavs) as we call them now where loyalty, respect, revenge, dignity and pride are what they live for, not the enjoyment of the actual sport. This simply acts as the excuse to fight in a traditional gang warfare environment. The prospect of West Ham's cup tie with Millwall brings joy to the faces of both sets of fans.<br/><br/>Casting Elijah Wood is a bold move, he looks like a Choirboy but this adds to the films main storyline of innocence corrupted. The acting is better than average, despite letting his cockney accent slip on occasions, Gang leader Charlie Hunnam shows a genuine mix of anger, aggression and compassion which holds the film together.<br/><br/>This won't win awards but it's refreshing to see a film finally tackling the subject matter that unfortunately has been a shameful factor of Britain's attitude towards football as we are constantly under threat of being disqualified from International tournaments due to the bad behaviour of soccer hooligans."
"simon70","9","99","141","25 August 2005"," Excellent film about football hooligans
","I saw this at a mystery preview screening where I didn't know what film was going to be shown. Sometimes these previews turn out to be real turkeys but thankfully that wasn't the case this time.<br/><br/>Without revealing too much of the story, Elijah Wood's character gets kicked out of Harvard for a drug offence he didn't commit. He flies to London to visit his sister and quickly gets caught up in a small group of West Ham United supporting hooligans called the Green Street Elite.<br/><br/>The film does slightly glamorise the violence, but ends on a moralising note. An engaging storyline, good cinematography and decent cast performances make this a very enjoyable film.<br/><br/>Two minor demerits: 1) Charlie Hunnam's ""cor blimey guv'nor"" accent owes more to Dick van Dyke than London's East End.<br/><br/>2) To establish that Wood's character has landed in London, we hear this frankly ridiculous message over the airport's PA system - ""this is a security announcement at London Heathrow airport"". Presumably this was inserted for the hard of thinking.<br/><br/>To all the Americans who have commented that they'd avoid British football matches as a result of this film, I point out that this film is fiction - not a documentary. Hooligans are an absolutely tiny minority of the crowd at a football match and even then they invariably only fight among themselves rather than randomly attacking innocent members of the public (something the film accurately portrayed).<br/><br/>All in all, an excellent film, worth going to see."
"campbejt","Null","62","87","21 June 2006"," What a Great Movie!!!
","Let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved this movie. I've been waiting for it to come out in DVD in the United States for a very long time and I was amazed that the movie lived up to my high expectations.<br/><br/>Reading through the comments others have made about this movie, I was shocked that so many people hated it. It seems that many people, mostly Brits, hated the movie because they didn't think it was realistic enough, there were too many clichés, and because Charlie Hunnam's impression of a cockney accent wasn't very good.<br/><br/>I don't get it. First off, this is a fictional movie, not a documentary. I thought the plot of this movie was very compelling. Yes, you do have to suspend your disbelief a bit, but you have to do that for almost every movie made. Some folks simply could not accept Elijah Wood as a tough guy. I agree that it's difficult to picture Frodo as a tough guy, but I thought he did a very good job. I also thought Charlie Hunnam was OUTSTANDING. He has an incredible screen presence and I look forward to seeing him in future movies. Mark Warren was also great. In fact, the entire supporting cast was great in this film. Claire Forlani was great, Leo Gregory was fantastic, all of the guys that played Pete's friends were great (even the guy that played Tommy Hatcher was perfect). GREAT performances all around!!!<br/><br/>This is a great film. I've already ordered a copy for my DVD collection. I've seen it three times and I will watch it again when my copy arrives. It's that good! I give it an 8 out of 10."
"Adfraser","8","148","223","17 March 2005"," Authentic, Absorbing and Exciting
","This is the best new movie of any genre that I've seen in many months. <br/><br/>The film really drew me into its world of neighborhood pubs, football supporters, and the dirt-in-the-cracks reality of London. The violence is believable, realistic, graphic, and frightening. As are the consequences of that violence. This film does not glorify hooliganism, it portrays it honestly. <br/><br/>Hooligans doesn't preach about mob mentality, or strength in numbers, rather it gives credit to the strength in the individual that lives up to his commitment to his friends though he may suffer because of it. (That's the best way I could word it without including a spoiler.)"
"Edificio","Null","129","198","18 March 2005"," Very powerful and close to the mark.
","As an English ex-pat and a football fan, I went along to the Alamo Draft House hoping for the best but expecting the worst. I got the best. This film is simply brilliant and finally provides us with an accurate portrayal of life amongst the hooligans in a way The Football Factory or ID never did.<br/><br/>Central to this are the amazing fight scenes and the performances of the primary actors with Hunnam in particular doing an outstanding job. And if anyone believed that all Elijah Wood movies would forever be tainted with the image of Frodo Baggins, think again. Within about 10 seconds of screen time, any lingering thoughts of LOTR are gone.<br/><br/>Yet whilst the direction, actors and the stunts will attract all the plaudits, for me, the main reason why this film works so well is the very clever story and the amazing script. Yes, in many respects the subject has been 'Americanised' but it has been done in a way which is very subtle. I suspect that much of the credit for this goes to the writer Dougie Brimson because it is obvious very early on that there was a strong English influence on both the plot and the dialogue.<br/><br/>Given the level of violence, not to mention the subject matter, I'm not that sure mainstream America will respond that well to it but for me, the big test will come when it's shown in England but I suspect like me, the English audiences are going to love it."
"claudio_carvalho","7","8","9","24 May 2017"," Violence and Friendship
","The Harvard's journalism student Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood) is expelled from the university two months before his graduation for stashing drugs in his closet in his room. However the cocaine belongs and was hidden by his roommate Jeremy Van Holden (Terence Jay). But the insecure Matt does not accuse Van Holden since he is the son of a powerful politician. Matt travels to London to meet his estranged sister Shannon Dunham (Claire Forlani) that is married with a baby boy with the British Steve Dunham (Marc Warren). Matt explains what happened to her in Harvard and when Steve comes home, he asks Matt to go to the football game with his brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam) since he has planned to date Shannon that night. Pete refuses since he is the leader of the GSE (Green Street Elite), a gang of hooligan fans of the West Ham United that usually fight after the matches. However Matt befriends Pete and his friends and fights with them, becoming a confident young man. But soon he has a lesson where the violence of the hooligan gangs leads them.<br/><br/>""Hooligans"" is a surprisingly good film about violence and friendship. Elijah Wood performs an interesting character that changes his personality through his experience with a gang of hooligans. Pete is also intriguing since he is a history and physical education teacher for kids and the leader of a gang. It is good to see the loyalty of most of the characters to each other and how they change their personal lives addicted in fights after the football matches. The tragic conclusion fits well to the behavior of the characters. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Hooligans"""
"tikemyler","Null","57","88","6 September 2005"," A personal transformation through the culture of sport
","Hopefully this film will not be limited in its reception as a ""sport"" film, and more disparagingly in America as a ""soccer"" film. It is much more than either distinction, for it portrays the transformational awakening of a young man as he becomes proactive rather than reactive about life.<br/><br/>This transition occurs within the often misunderstood culture of ""football hooligans"", hordes of zealous football fans who display a jingoistic allegiance to their teams and the locale from which they hail. The insight provided into this world reveals more than gang triviality for these men do not compete for the sake of criminal enterprise or the carnal spoils of women. Their skirmishes, often times brutal, are for stake in a sense of pride that reminds us that athletes put glory in our sport, but for some fans, glory is the sport. That pride, as it is conveyed, does well to offset the characterization of drunken recklessness that could easily be assessed to ""hooliganism"".<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film --- it's not ""soccer"". It's awakening to self."
"tbirder1000","10","86","143","18 March 2005"," Great Movie
","I saw a screening of Hooligans at the SXSW and I was blown away! What a great film. The cast was excellent. The director was superb! Great action and still very profound! This was a great role for Elijah Wood. A very nice departure from his usual roles. Charlie Hunnum was excellent. And Leo Gregory as Bover was awesome. The action scenes were incredible. I couldn't believe this film was directed by a woman. She really portrayed the lifestyle of soccer hooligans realistically. Such a different view than the press gives. I can't wait to see more films by this director! When is this movie going to come out in theaters so I can recommend it to all of my friends?"
"cinema_jones","10","76","128","13 June 2005"," Excellent Film!
","Saw it at Tribeca and went to every showing! The acting is spot-on, the direction and cinematography are practically flawless. Elijah proves again what a unique talent he has always been. I hope this film is released on this side of the herring pond. It is thoroughly entertaining! I was a little worried about the probability of a clean-cut kid from Harvard being drawn so easily into the lifestyle of football hooliganism for any reason, but it works well. Even though I still think it would have been more convincing if Matt had a background that would indicate a slight interest violent sports, say if he was a kick boxer or push hand enthusiast, for example. Matt's motivation bothered me more than any of the violence depicted. Still, it is an excellent film."
"citycine","9","83","145","13 March 2005"," Saw it last night...
","I saw Hooligans last night at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema (downtown location) in Austin, Texas. This was a great feature length film debut for director Lexi Alexander. You have to like fight films though, because this was not sugar-coated (think Fight Club). Viewers never got much of a break from the violence. Lexi said in Q&A that this is based on some of the *firms/gangs* she was exposed to as a kid, and that it's not make believe--this stuff really goes on. I also learned that Lexi is a martial arts expert/champion (I think she's undefeated?).<br/><br/>Charlie Hunnan was absolutely amazing and I can't wait to see him appear in more films. I have to add that Lexi, Charlie, and the other cast members (including Elijah Wood) were extremely friendly in person. Charlie was polite to us and answered our questions about his career even though he was trying to grab a bite to eat...nice guy and a terrific actor!"
"StepneyIron","10","8","10","3 July 2008"," A Comment from a life long Hammer
","It has been interesting reading the comments here. It might be helpful to some, particularly our American and Canadian cousins, to have a little background information on the West Ham following over the years.<br/><br/>For some years (approx. 1967 - 1985) and before I realised the error of my ways and retired I was an active member of the West Ham mob, which was made up of several different firms from around the East End and parts of Essex. The main ones being the Mile End ('67 to around '74) and the TBF ('70's & '80's). The ICF got going around 1978 and carried through to the '90's. It was more of an umbrella name given to the combined firms who all came together for the away games. The West Ham mob consisted of between 300 to 400 individuals. The ranks would sometimes be swelled by several hundred regular supporters, so called scarfers (non violent). Often, particularly mid week matches up north, there could be significantly less. It would not be unusual to find oneself on a freezing cold terrace for a night game mid winter only 30-40 handed and outnumbered by a hostile opposition 20-1. It made for some hair raising experiences, particularly trying to navigate back to the railway station after the game through some pretty hostile unfamiliar back streets. West Ham always had a reputation for sticking together and never leaving anyone behind. There were some fearless individuals who held the line no matter the odds and the expectation was that everyone would stand with them. You earned respect by not bottling out, even if you were not much of a scrapper and had legs like jelly.<br/><br/>Our traditional rivals have always been Millwall. Correctly depicted in the film. This rivalry goes back at least to the 1920's and is steeped in the history of the London Docklands. West Ham also have a particular aversion to Manchester United and Chelsea for differing reasons.<br/><br/>Any West Ham supporter who was there will tell you that the most violent clash ever at a football match involving the club, and there have been many over the years, was actually a friendly. A mid week testimonial game against Millwall at the old Den (Millwall's old stadium) in 1972. Fortunately the two clubs play in different leagues and therefore do not play each other much, no doubt to the great relief of the Metropolitan Police.<br/><br/>Now to the film, I was expecting I would not enjoy Green Street as I had been disappointed by all the other Hooli films that had gone before. However, despite a questionable story line and some glaring inaccuracies, including the abysmal accent of the lead character played by Charlie Hunnam, I quite liked it. One has to make allowances for the fact that this was fictional and not a documentary. I thought the acting was generally pretty good and the camera work was of a high standard.<br/><br/>I am afraid that the Elijah Wood character would not have made it into our firm in my day. He would have been politely pointed in the direction of the scarfers and told to tag along with them, not because he was an American, if he genuinely supported West Ham this would have been good enough for us, no it would have been because he would have been considered a liability and we would have had to assign someone to keep an eye on him.<br/><br/>Finally in the real world the GSE would never have been the top firm down at Upton Park. The age range was too narrow and physically they were too light weight compared to some of the real life characters who graced the West Side, the South Bank and the Chicken Run.<br/><br/>Irons!!!"
"theantigaz","4","49","83","13 September 2005"," Doing for Football what Hitler did for Germans...
","Green Street, as it was called in the UK, or Hooligans is a bad film. The story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in England, has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately.<br/><br/>My first main gripe with Hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters. Don't get me wrong, I like Elijah Wood and have a great respect for his work, but despite his best efforts he struggled to pull off this role. The main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal, however he spends much of the film placid and cheery, only displaying his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film. This linked with his looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans. At no point during the film was I convinced that a) he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b) the 'firm' of thugs would accept such a person into their fold.<br/><br/>The other main character is played by Charlie Hunnam. Charlie looks the part, and is fairly convincing as a thug. Unfortunately, being a native of Newcastle Upon Tyne in the North of England, he demonstrates the worst East London accent since Dick Van Dyke tried to go cock-en-y in Marry Poppins. Details such as this probably will not bother an American audience who will be less attuned to regional dialect in the UK, but being from the UK it was a problem I couldn't ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me. The supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast, especially the role of Bover. The lad playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that Charlie played. With a film like this, you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible, unfortunately, the casting failed. Imagine if you made a film like The Godfather and had Sean Hayes (Jack) from Will and Grace playing Michael Corleone's part. You would not be convinced. The story in Hooligan is also full in implausibilities. I am no football Hooligan, but I am a fantatical football fan. I know how cliquey a group of 'regular' football supporters can be, as such it deem it impossible for a non-football fan, who is not a fan of the club in question, is not from the area in question and not even of English nationality to be embraced by a 'firm' who equate to a secret organisation in some severe cases. My final, and biggest, problem with this film, is the way it portrays football hooligans. I take objection to the film's idea that despite being very violent individuals, hooligans are excused as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other. This is complete rubbish. Football hooligans are complete scum. They take football, the national sport of England and use it as an excuse to terrorise, frighten and intimidate people. They only represent a tiny percentage of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation. They are not brave or loyal, they are cowardly and evil. If the 'GSE' in this film truly loved their club, West Ham, why would the devote their lives to being a stain on its name. Hooligans are an embarrassment to football and to English society. Football hooligans do for the reputation of football what Hitler did to the reputation of Germans. Although this film tries/intends to show the 'gritty' side of football violence. It does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme fans of the sport. It does not show the poor innocent by-standers at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing coins/lighters/glass into the crowd. It does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with graffiti and broken windows. It does not show the REAL fans of football clubs who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches or abroad to European games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone. If you want to see a good film about football violence, watch the BBC drama 'The Firm'."
"funk007","2","27","44","29 September 2005"," Nonsense.
","First some background; I am English and have lived in London all my life. I have been to many games at 'The Den' and most other London club grounds. I am familiar with the type of person who gets into hooliganism and I know just how they act and how they speak. Have to say this is a bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies I have ever seen. I spent most of the movie cringing with embarrassment. I felt I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point out a few things.<br/><br/>a) People just don't talk like that in London in real life; the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it sound stupid. Unfortunately hooligan types do exist, but those you see in Green Street are more like parodies. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately sounded about as 'English' or 'Cockney' as Osama Bin Laden. He's from up north in Newcastle and I'm just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him - how are we supposed to take him seriously. Why they didn't just get someone from East London to play that part is beyond me. I could have done 'a bang up job' myself, hehe. c) Mr Frodo. I mean how can I be expected to take seriously Elijah Wood kicking the ass of people twice his size and who are genuinely nasty hooligans. He'd be dead. Simple as that. Honestly (as a Brit) it was hard to watch this film. I'm pretty sure this film will bomb here in the UK. It may do a little better in the states because the Americans just wont know (or care) how inaccurate it is. <br/><br/>Please my American and foreign friends, don't believe a word of this nonsense. Yes these firms do exist but it's all extremely underground and hush hush, and on a vastly smaller scale. The movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed some of it in London. Usually they try to film these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something and expect us all not to notice."
"hywel-m-jones","1","61","109","31 January 2006"," Truly abysmal
","This is possibly the worst film I've ever seen. The fact that it has a flimsy storyline is bad enough, that they've hooked it around the subject of football violence makes it 100 times worse.<br/><br/>I had severe doubts about the premise of this film even before I started watching, but went into it open minded enough even to accept the way that the writers saw fit to introduce Elijah Wood's character Matt into the hooligan scene.<br/><br/>But the film throws up inaccuracy after inaccuracy, to the point that by the middle of the film each one makes you cringe harder than the time before.<br/><br/>Let's clear up a few things: Hooligans don't tend to virtually smash up their own pub before a run-of-the-mill league game; they don't set out to kill each other; they don't ONLY wear Stone Island (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not, do). They most certainly don't, when having taken exception to a new firm member, trot off to their rival firms territory for pie and mash. And I'd love to meet the hool who would go and grass on his firm's top boy to the rival firm. (Although you can scratch what I said about setting to out kill each other if one does exist).<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong,I'm yet to see a film on the subject that doesn't contain some fantasy whims, but this is on a par with The Firm for cluelessness.<br/><br/>I found it ironical that Wood's American nemesis is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user, when this is part and parcel of the British hooligan scene. The film chooses not to challenge Wood's morals and instead steers clear of any of the firm using coke.<br/><br/>I could go on, but I think I've made my point.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it's highly unimaginative, and I'm sure if I hadn't spent the entire film bemoaning the points, and more, made above then I would have guessed what was going on sooner than I did. And believe me, I was well in front.<br/><br/>I get the distinct impression this film is aimed at men, with the hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional issues that are raised.<br/><br/>If I'm right, then the makers have failed completely. It's too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene, and I can't believe the kind of female who looks for emotive films would give a damn about any of the characters given their violent tendencies.<br/><br/>Are there any good points? Maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but I'm rarely impressed by slow-mo action, certainly not when it's a fight as the point is a ruck is rousing enough anyway.<br/><br/>There are some funny, if unrealistic moments. Wood's trip to school did raise a smile for me. But a few mildly funny moments hardly make up for watching two hours of complete fabricated dross.<br/><br/>If you're British avoid like the plague, if only not to further develop misconceptions of the scene if you're not in the know. If you're American, you may enjoy it, as it's clearly tailored to the market. But no one can deny the plot is flimsy, predictable and ultimately over the top."
"nails_s_o_b","3","26","43","12 September 2005"," Poor and inaccurate. Real footy fans, stay clear!
","Where to start? OK, don't compare this film to fight club for a start - ridiculous. If it was even a patch on fight club, the violence, blood, gore etc would be much more evident and realistic. Secondly, this film is no football factory - which is so much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look like an embarrassment). Fair enough, the storyline is quite decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed - with a decent ending i might add. But the film on the whole is poor, seriously poor. As people have been mentioning the accents should not spoil a film - i disagree - either a simple casting error, or a lack of effort in coaching the voices caused the film to be irritating all the way through - it was obvious from scene one some American/Geordie was playing the role. Don't get me wrong, good looking guy, who looks great with a skin head - but no not a football hooligan. I could go on forever about how ridiculous the football scene was - the 'fake steward' situation. Also, when the GSE are going to play United up north, they go on the train expecting only 3 of them - doesn't make any sense - this a real organisation of gangsters and thugs, which is portrayed in the film to be some mickey mouse cult of about 5 people. In terms of accuracy - did West Ham and Milwall not play for the last couple of years they have been in the Championship together? Hmm, ten years OK. And I'm sure 'Bother' would be able to just waltz into a Milwall firm pub. Basically, a very poor film which people will like if they have little knowledge of real football, and hooliganism. If you do actually love football and are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism,, you will simply feel as though this film has insulted your intelligence. Ross George"
"bestbutter-1","1","25","42","15 September 2009"," Now please wash your hands
","Inaccurate, clichéd, bathetic, 'Green Street' is one of the most royally diabolical films I have ever seen. This dreadful exposition of poor writing, acting and direction pins ragged colours to a splintered mast within minutes, when wide-eyed Boston ex-college boy Matt (Elijah Wood) visits London and his sister Shannon (Claire Forlani) after being fitted-up by a coke-snorting rich-kid fellow student with influential relatives to embarrass. As Matt arrives, we learn that Shannon's wide-boy-made-good husband Steve (a cast-to-type Marc Warren) has quietly planned a romantic evening with the missus, evidenced by a pair of hard-to-come-by show tickets. Hubby grabs the opportunity to palm off his unexpected guest on brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam), a cocky jack-the-lad who, as we've already discovered from the opening sequence, is also an extremely mouthy football yob.<br/><br/>Although Steve's discomfort over Pete's potty-mouthed demeanour in front of both wife and house-guest is evident, such is the attraction of 'Chicago' (a gangland tale, chosen for reasons which soon become gratingly obvious) that he's quite happy to entrust the naive Matt to the care of his errant bro': an even rougher diamond than he whom he knows is certain to lead the young American astray.<br/><br/>Matt, despite his preppy disposition and the small voice of calm that would surely be bidding him ""run"" from a situation that looks iffy from the start, is strangely happy to spend quality time with this boorish and potentially dangerous character, his jetlag apparently having rendered him a sponge for every splenetic old anti-American cliché in the book (yes, even the ones about ""friendly fire"" and ""being late for both wars""). Soon the pair is all but arm-in-arm and joshing happily together in the pub, the initially suspicious crew of local hardboys (for Pete is the Main Man) quickly coming around to the thought that the Yank's a good'un after all, understands the concept of loyalty and will support his new mates no matter what sort of how's-yer-father's going down.<br/><br/>Apart from generally getting things very wrong about London, the film's foundation conceit, the premise upon which Matt becomes involved with West Ham's Green Street Elite in the first place, is fatally flawed from the beginning and heads rapidly south from there. We are drawn towards the GSE's loathsome characters only because the real 'bad guys' of the piece - wouldn't you know it, it's the MILLWALL firm - are so operatically unhinged that anyone else can only look like a choirboy, no matter how handy he might be with the coarser rhythms of East End slang, a taunting terrace chant and a set of brass knuckles. Ultimately the film overcooks to evaporation every hoary notion of the noble savage and his Cosa Nostra-style commitment to tribal loyalty and the closure of ranks. The allegiances are unlikely from the word go, the narrative has been seen before in any number of dramatic contexts (but done better and with greater complexity; for a football-specific example see 'ID') and the gang violence is graphically, gleefully choreographed to the point of voyeuristic pornography.<br/><br/>Every possible riff on London life is plundered short of shipping in a couple of pearly kings to do the Lambeth Walk with yer old mum outside the rub-a-dub. As might have been mentioned elsewhere, Hunnam delivers his lines in the most woeful cockernee accent this side of - yes, him again - Dick Van Dyke, and it came as a considerable surprise to learn that the actor is a Geordie and not an Irish-American ex-cop from Queens. Marc Warren goes through his barrow-boy chops and does what we've come to expect of him, whilst Wood is tolerable in a wretched role; the single observation that enthusiasts for this film have made with which I agree - that Matt needed from the start to have an air of the innocent abroad about him, only latterly discovering a steelier determination when forced to face life full-on - is fair enough, and few ought to be able to do this better than good old Frodo Baggins himself.<br/><br/>But this isn't nearly enough on which to hang the story. Steve, a hooligan reformed, would never have exposed Matt to what he knows the GSE is capable of in the first place; neither would a character like Matt have allowed himself to take up with such dubious companions out of choice. From the beginning, the incomer's not exactly falling on anybody's mercy for survival in cold London town. Matt's not short of cash; at the start of the film he takes a bullet for his feckless college room-mate and receives a handsome sweetener for his trouble. And his father's Fleet Street connections could easily land him a plum job in journalism; Matt's major at Harvard and the calling whose discovery by the respective Upton Park and Coldharbour Lane crews eventually leads to the film's ultimate big set-piece: a ludicrous final gang skirmish on a bleak post-industrial lot, complete with the inevitable slo'mo evocation of our virtuous warrior-princes doing honourable battle for a higher calling, like something out of 'Excalibur' with pylons.<br/><br/>Shannon pitches up to spoil the fun and Matt returns to Boston, an older, wiser man. Cut to a posh downtown restaurant, and here's our hero's Harvard nemesis enjoying a quiet toot in the mens' room (having left the cubicle door helpfully unlocked, as you do). And just as Matt prepares to punch the hapless cokehead's lights out, wouldn't you know? His hand is stayed. For all the murderous mayhem of his experiences over the sea and far away with the proud footballing Knights of Saint George, he's learned something precious and invaluable. Yes, like any Plaistow lad blooded in the school of hard knocks that is Upton Park, he's emerged a better person. Which is not a feeling I can share having seen this grubby film."

","I'm an American.. huge football fan.. and lived in London for some time. I was really excited to see this movie, but left somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>It was strong and compelling.. and the acting was great.. particularly Charlie Hunnam. The fight scenes, while clearly disturbing, did not bother me so much. I also thought it was very interesting to learn about the organization of ""the firms,"" etc. I had no idea such a thing existed. I always thought of Hooliganism as a bunch of young drunken idiots, who like to pick fights, etc. Boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>However, the one underlying thing that troubled me was.. Elijah Wood's character just didn't fit in. VERY MINOR SOILER ALERT - A kid who was afraid of his weasel roommate at preppy Harvard ... is all of the sudden mixing it up with hard core British Hooligans, huh? I felt like if the storyline was accurate, Matt would have split the money with Pete right off the bat.. and would have been at the nearest Starbucks six minutes later. End of movie. I kept going back to that in my mind.<br/><br/>Overall though, it certainly was a good movie.. worth seeing."
"e3hammer","3","18","29","8 March 2006"," Terrible!
","I'm a West Ham fan from East London and had to see the film because it was based on my football club, in my area and about West Ham's hooligan element. Of course I knew it was a fictional adaptation of the Intercity Firm (ICF) under the moniker of Green Street Elite, but can't see why.<br/><br/>*SPOILER* From start of the film and hearing Charlie Hunnan's Cockney accent I knew this film was going to be a massive disappointment. The first fight scene would have been more at home in a kung-fu film then a movie about football hooliganism. I'm all for watching Tottenham get smashed all over the gaff in any light, but not when it looks like it's been glazed over by the Hollywood treatment.<br/><br/>Looking at the inner-city area where the pub was did actually remind me of the Boleyn Pub which is on the corner of Green Street next to the ground as is home support only, even the authentic chants inside made me smile a little. The banter between the boys when the Yank got there isn't too far from how English boys are either, but that's where it all ends for me. No more smiles after that, just disappointment over and over. When they got to the game and made their way inside the game, we're led to believe that West Ham are at home to Birmingham City when it's clear as day that West Ham were playing Gillingham. Now that might seem insignificant to people who either don't follow football or have no idea about the English leagues/teams, but when you are in the know and someone who attends regular it comes across as all wrong and made predominantly for an American audience. Even the Birmingham fans were all wrong. The black fellas sounded like they were from Jamaica and the white fella who was with them is clearly a Scouser. (Liverpudlian) Now yet again, to an American audience that's insignificant, but to a British/English audience it's noticeable and annoying.<br/><br/>The trip to Manchester made me laugh because of how bad the scene was. First off, if you're about to have an off with Man United's firm, you're not gonna take 6 blokes and a 5ft nothing Yank who's never had a row. Second was the fact that about 30 Manc's are hanging outside the station waiting for the 'GSE' to come out. Now anyone who has the most minute idea about football violence would tell you that the Police would be bang on them and an escort waiting for the West Ham mob attending Old Trafford. In this day and age, you don't get the freedom to stand about outside stations waiting for a row. You're on film, Police are everywhere, especially for a fixture like Man United v West Ham and any mob that's worth it's grain would never in this day and age come out of the main station. It's like going to south Bermondsey on an away trip to Millwall, you just don't do it because Old Bill (Police) will be there to wrap you up and take you straight to the game.<br/><br/>Other things that made the film tacky were the fact that you never see contact made between firms prior to a meet. You also never see firms actively looking for each other, but instead standing around making themselves stand out like a sore thumb and that aggravating because you know that's not something that happens at football in this day and age.<br/><br/>The Millwall firm looked far more convincing then West Ham. They looked half decent, where as the West Ham lot looked liked a bunch of kids. The whole film ended up getting up my nose and made me cringe watching it with my mates who ain't West Ham. They could see how ridiculous it was and how apparent that it'd been Americanized. The film feels like it was thrown together to shock Americans and show the 'ugly side' of football in England. It might have done that, but for people living on this side of the Atlantic, it was diabolical.<br/><br/>One thing that got to me personally was the little research that went into the film and the location. If it wasn't for the West Ham fans in the 'Abby' there would be no way of foreigners knowing that West Ham are based in East London and Millwall football club is in south London, not Tower Hamlets which is a borough in East London. Millwall is in East London, but that's the place not the football club and it's not in the borough of Tower Hamlets either.<br/><br/>I could in all honesty pick this film apart all day because I feel it was that bad. I've nit picked on certain things, but when I watch a film, especially based on a subject that I have a lot of knowledge on, I want it to seem authentic as possible, which it didn't at any point.<br/><br/>You can call this more of a rant then a review."

","Rather a ridiculous film, this; Elijah Wood as a Harvard-dropout-turned-East-End-Football hooligan...? I saw the whole of ""Green Street"" in various fragments during my time working in a local cinema, and was not impressed. There were certain scenes I must have seen more than five times; with even viewing, they acquired an even greater absurdity. There were many mainstream films on at my time at the multiplex cinema I worked on that were simply dull; GS at least avoids that pitfall, but opens up another can of worms by its trying to be a crossover between British football cinema and the stylised Laddite tendencies of Guy Ritchie.<br/><br/>There is a veritable smörgåsbord of mockney hard-man posturing, and ultimately a myth-making glorification of what amounts to petty thuggery. It admittedly captures the way petty hoodlums can almost attain mythic stature amongst their followers in the absurdly built up characters like 'The Major!' and 'Tommy 'Atcher!' - but is endlessly indulgent to these characters and their foot-soldiers.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Green Street"" is very, very silly and certainly an amusing viewing experience as long as you don't go in with a serious mindset; the dialogue is so risible I was frequently in hysterics."

I had eagerly awaited it's release in the US and was pleased to be able to see it at one the several film festivals at which it won jury and/or audience awards.<br/><br/>This is a well put together film. The acting, directing, cinematography, script and score are all perfect to portray the movie's intent. Cast with experienced and truly capable actors, there was nothing lacking in the performances given.<br/><br/>The story is about a Harvard university journalist major (Matt, played by Elijah Wood) who is kicked out unfairly and flees to London to be with his sister. Shortly, he becomes engrossed in the world of hooliganism which American audiences learn about through Matt's experience and eyes. He is taken into the ""firm"" which are a bit like gangs, and experiences a brotherhood he obviously had been craving. One of the firm's members resent a ""Yank"" being in the group, but most of them take to him well.<br/><br/>The GSE firm, of which Matt has become a member, fights with an opposing firm, and much violence and heartache ensues, teaching us the lesson that even though the brotherhood is a magnet for the dispossessed, it is not to be entered into without dire consequences.<br/><br/>This is a movie with heart. In fact, I don't believe the violence should prevent anyone from seeing this movie, since it is overall one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, and is an emotionally engaging film. It is most likely not a good movie for children under 13 to see though.<br/><br/>This movie has just been picked up for limited distribution in the United States. My fondest hope is that American audiences will embrace it, and it will become the hit it deserves to be.<br/><br/>Thank you Odd Lot Releasing for taking this movie under your wing!

Besides having great fight scenes, this movie has an intriguing plot, and a devastating ending. Elijah Wood proves his versatility, although he seems too delicate to be a ""hooligan"". The filming is exquisite, and very Guy Ritchie-esquire. I can't say enough good things about this film. Extravagant. Charlie Hunnam is definitely the best part of this film - he plays the thug well, but not in a stupid stereotypically way - there's a human side to him as well. Watch the rest of the West Ham firm closely - there are TONS of hilarious lines and expressions in this film that are good BECAUSE they're so subtle. Bovver is also an amazing character, Jesus - just go see it for yourself; then see it at least once again.

He says to his sister, who he's meeting, ""What happened here"" and she replies ""Oh Tottenham were in town yesterday""!!! Tottenham are in town already.. they're part of the town, they don't have to go there! And if Tottenham fans wanted to fight other fans the last place on earth they'd do it is Bank station, where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world.<br/><br/>There are several other similar errors but the biggest failing for me is the actor who plays the lead hooligan. He clearly decided it wasn't worth trying to speak with an East End accent and instead opted for a Dick Van Dyke style mock-ney which made my ears bleed. It was accentuated by the fact the rest of his gang all spoke in the way you'd expect West Ham fans to speak. This error made him unbelievable in the role and really spoilt the film."

","After seeing this film at the Tribeca film festival, I have to say that Charles Hunnam and Elijah Wood gave outstanding performances in their roles. The movie's focus deals with what are the consequences that come from violence. It is a graphic movie whose message is non-violent. Charles Hunnam I believe gave an exceptional performance, one that will be remembered for a long time to come. Elijah Wood proved his versatility as a great actor , playing the role of a young academic turned street smart gang member whose loyalty goes beyond devotion to his mates. It's a raw movie about male companion ship mixed with trust and bravery all aimed in the wrong directions...I've seen this film only once and desire to see it again... the light hearted moments that were sprinkled in and then the very end's wonderful song ""I'm forever blowing bubbles... pretty bubbles in the air..' only adds to the poignant message one carries away with them after viewing this excellent movie.

The supposed London accents are terrible from some of the actors. Worse even than Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins! But the fight scenes are good - action packed and explosive. Elijah Wood puts in a good performance - he doesn't exactly convince as a rough and ready thug, and I have to be honest - I kept expecting him to start hunting for a ring! Its perhaps also a bit out of date.

Makes you despair at the state of casting directors actually because there are thousands of young guys out there, actual Londoners who could have played the role far more authentically. And a little it more research into football vernacular, rather than some kind of Wikipedia discovered hooligan facts, would have made it a lot better.

","The first thing I should say is that I can't stand the sport(with that said, the footage of it in this actually was exciting... that goes to show the immense talent involved in bringing this to the screen). Being Danish, I'm (seemingly) in the minority here in the country. I avoided this film like the plague for years. Days ago, I watched Punisher: War Zone. The next chance I got, I picked this up on sale. That was yesterday. I think that should give you an idea of how badly I wanted to see more stuff by Lexi Alexander. I was not disappointed. She has this ability to take us into a dangerous environment and somehow make the violence in it brutal, bloody and terrifying, without the audience checking out of the movie, and without entirely abandoning the hard, unpleasant reality that it lives in all of us, and it can be temporarily satisfying to give into it. She walks this balance flawlessly with both of these. The fight sequences are swiftly cut, like sharpened blades. They disturb and unsettle us with the sense that it will not end well, and yet we find ourselves strangely drawn to it. No two are alike, and nothing in this is gratuitous. This puts us in the hooligan subculture, and, through the lead, we find ourselves feeling at home there, comfortable, well-liked. The acting is excellent. Wood, Hunnam, and really, everyone in this delivers an impeccable performance, including the children. This keeps to a solid pace, with a lot of energy to any scene that requires it, and it never stands still. There is plenty of humor in this, and it should not be thought of as only a negative look at hooliganism. This understands it, and helps us to, as well. Note that there is British slang and accents in this(thank goodness for subtitles). The plot is engaging, well-told and smart. There are a few clichés, particularly in the last half, but it contains numerous surprises, as well, and there is a feeling that we can't be sure what to expect. This reiterates an age-old point(that remains vital), and does so without seeming tired or preachy: An eye for an eye leaves the world blind. The characters are well-written, memorable, credible, and well-developed, and, like everything else in this, psychologically accurate. All of the music is fitting and well-chosen. There is a ton of strong language in this, in addition to what I've already described. The DVD comes with trailers for six other pictures and this.

"johnnyboyz","6","2","2","15 February 2010"," Solid documentation of an outsider drifting towards aggression and masculinity, as a grotesque life in a football firm takes over.
","The comparisons to Nick Love's 2004 film The Football Factory are almost obligatory when talking of Green Street, but they are linked only by way of subject matter. The films are wildly different in their approaches and attitudes to football firm violence and gang life. Green Street tells the tale of an absolute outsider making his way into a football firm and gradually infiltrating the group as the ever volatile life of fighting and maiming takes a hold on them, seducing them into a stupor of all things crude and nasty. On the other hand, The Football Factory tells the story of a young man of about equal age to Green Street's lead, but instead documents a very gradual decline; focusing more on the way this lifestyle drags down his conscience and mental well-being as the match-day punch-ups take their toll. In short, I find The Football Factory to be one of the most frightening; most affecting and one of the more interesting British films of the last ten or so years whereas Green Street is a passable tale of a young man caught up in a reprehensible lifestyle and how this affects him for his longer run at life.<br/><br/>Green Street is more the processed film, in the sense it requires time to set up a lead and his 'current' lifestyle; introduce the characters they'll be spending the majority of their time with; have them enter this 'new' lifestyle; gradually build them up within that bubble before having it all implode and have everything linked to the demonisation of hooliganism play out – it is the quintessential Amercican fable of rising through the ranks. The Football Factory carried less of a preordained aura, it was a series of quite frightening scenes; situations; interactions and instances in which the lead, played by Danny Dyer, would very gradually reach a level of realisation, most of the time shrugging off these warning signs but unable to shake the question at the very core of that film: ""Was it worth it?"". Indeed, the intended audience is so far infused with Elijah Wood's lead here that football firms and hooliganism in general needs to be explained to him, in black and white, by someone more experienced with the lifestyle.<br/><br/>Green Street's Americanised sensibility is captured in its narrative structure; its more thorough attention to character arc and its somewhat flashy, glitzy aesthetic that it carries throughout, acting rather uncomplimentary with its disgusting subject matter. One is reminded of Alan Clarke's low-budgeted; grimy; scuzzy-looking 1988 effort The Firm which was, granted, made for television but gave the world in which it was set a downtrodden and frightening feel to it through its colour saturation and persistence on having the scenes play out in enclosed terrace streets complete with rock solid brick walls acting as the backdrop plus worn-out public houses in which large groups of men would be shot in close-up format instilling confrontation and claustrophobia.<br/><br/>It's said that German born female director Lexi Alexander is to have based the film on a number of real life instances with people of a similar ilk, but most of her characters are given some pretty unreal 'triggers' or prior tragedies to further both character and conflict; some of the characters having undergone specific transitions that render them specific archetypes that exist to aid the progression of the story. Examples include the psychotic firm leader whose son died many years ago as a result of some large scale fighting and the once feared 'general' whose lifestyle changed after he met a nice American woman and settled down. The use of these specific lifestyles and prior tragedies to emote both threat and the sense that something's at stake forces the film to feel a little fabricated, thus, pushing the film away a downtrodden sense that something like The Firm certainly had and The Football Factory effectively carried.<br/><br/>Indeed, it is Elijah Wood that plays American Matt Buckner, a guy who was expelled from Harvard university in America when his room-mate was busted for cocaine and he took the fall for it. After this, he consequently arrives in England, during which he meets all sorts of new and interesting people. Buckner's past low-point is established, as is the fact he is pushed around a little too easily in the drug charge and the early scuffle he has with friend and mentor to-be Pete Dunham (Hunnam), one item of which highlights how far he'll come in developing during his time in England with the other of which acting as the 'wrong' which exists to be 'righted'. Alexander captures the bond these men have, these big; well muscled men clutching a hold of each other as they sing and talk dirty in pubs, indeed Matt and Pete's relationship is taken to a point that sees a rival, Pete's former best friend, enter a public house as they share a drink and storm out again in a jealous rage when Matt and Pete's bonding is captured by way of his gaze.<br/><br/>I don't think the film enjoys the violence, nor does it invite us to enjoy it; more-so, it is the lead character that enjoys the rush of the violence while the scenes play out around him and this acceptance into a sub-culture occurs. Throughout, we know better than Wood's character; highlighted when Matt's father arrives in town and tells his son they can fight this drug charge together – but Matt isn't interested, and would rather stay in a reprehensible zone than continue a righteous life in higher education. The film's worth seeing; its supported by a number of decent performances, predominantly from Bell and Dunham while Wood does his usual 'caught in the headlights' act. Whilst more forced and fabricated than earlier hooligan studies, Green Street is a decent enough film that documents downfall of some degree and the eventual results of how violence and conflict is seen as something to look forward to."
"Quinoa1984","7","2","2","1 November 2009"," mostly a lean and tough action-drama with intense characters and melodrama
","Green Street Hooligans (or just Hooligans for short) is a feature that announces a new female director, Lexi Alexander. Like Kathryn Bigelow, she's not a director of romantic comedies or (I hate to use this term but I will) chick-flicks, but someone who understands how to get the same kind of grit and testosterone that any gifted male action director could get from his cast of actors. In this case Alexander's tough skin is fitting: her subject matter are 'soccer hooligans', or more specifically those who form in gangs in pubs and fight out in the streets with other gangs representing respective teams. It's a whole system that is far more aggressive (and 'pissed' aka drunk) than a typical group of sports fans like one would find in the States, but it's not quite as ruthless as a gang like crips and bloods either.<br/><br/>The Hooligans of the GSE fight and act like a gang for status, not for profit, and this is the way of things when Matt (Elijah Wood), a Harvard dropout, lands in England and somehow befriends his brother in law's brother Pete (Charles Hunnam). He's taken along to the pub, then to a football/soccer match, and then proves his worth the best way he can: he gets in his first real fight-cum-brawl in the streets with some other soccer hooligans. From then in the film becomes a story of friendship and eventual betrayal from a scorned member of the GSE, who doesn't like Mike from the start and feels taken aback by his best friend Pete's connection to a practical family member.<br/><br/>It's also about the way that the male brain works in such situations: Matt is a very smart guy, being from Harvard and all (and sort of hiding a secret as a journalist major - a big no-no in hooligan gangs, being a ""Journie"" as its called), but he can go into this violent state of being because it's part of a clique, and part of being part of a group where everyone looks out for everyone else - which he doesn't get from his sister (Forlani) or his absentee father. Alexander works best with her cast of characters and actors when they're in the pub and out on the streets, with the camaraderie so easy to just turn on a dime - the intensity is thick always, even in one of those big sing-alongs like with the GSE's ""theme song"" out in the streets. It also helps that Wood is better than usual and Brit character actors like Hunnam and Geoff Bell impress very much, very much in the mold of a gangster movie (a good one).<br/><br/>The only big drawbacks are some unneeded exposition with the narration popping up a few times. Once is too often really, as it doesn't add anything aside from the ""I learned this and blah blah"" material. And the final brawl, which shot well, is saddled with a cringe-worthy song that kills the energy and features so much melodrama (and an understandably tragic conclusion) that it's just too much. But in general, this is a fine and hard-knocking 'Cockney' flick- watch for that slang- and great if you've never heard of a soccer hooligan and want to take a look. 7.5/10"

"DICK STEEL","7","2","2","7 January 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Green Street Hooligans
","You've seen them on television, and you've read about them in the news. Europe is particularly aware of folks who travel for football games amongst neighboring countries, only to have them create trouble or duke it out with the locals or one another, if the results don't go their way.<br/><br/>While 2005 had a look at professional Premiership football with the movie Goal!, it's time the cameras took a look too at the supporters of the game. Not just any plain old armchair supporters, but really passionate ones, who live, breathe and eat football, and bond together to form Firms (i.e. gangs). Similar to mafias, triads, what-have-yous, Firms thrive on reputation. The bigger the stunt, or the fight, the bigger the reputation gets spread. And it's usually (as explained in the movie, though of course, in better light for West Ham United) the better teams having weaker Firms. I'd like that acknowledgment that Arsenal is the better footballing team, but having a terribly weak Firm, while Spurs are poor in both haha! We also learn what irks the Firms most, besides rival Firms.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood plays Matt Buckner, a Harvard journalism dropout for a misdemeanor he did not commit. He flies to London to meet up with his sister, and gets introduced to his brother-in-law's brother (duh) Pete Dunham. Pete's the head honcho of the Green Street Elite (GSE), the Firm of West Ham United, and I'd like the beginning of their budding relationship where Pete educates Matt on aspects of football (not soccer, mind you). The pot-shots at UK-US relations are hilarious, as we see Matt get introduced to the other core members of GSE. Of course him being a Yank doesn't endear him to GSE, but they're willing to overlook the point and give the rookie a chance to prove himself since he's brought in by Pete.<br/><br/>We only have one football match to watch (ala Goal!), as the rest of the movie focuses on Matt's transformation from wide-eyed newbie, to mean fighting machine. Elijah Wood didn't have much of a difficult job to do, as all he did was to continuously wear that scowl on his face for the second half of the movie. And it actually degenerates into some sort of UK-football version of Fight Club, where members of rival Firms whack the living daylights out of one another to prove their point. Perhaps co-star Charlie Hunnam did a better job as Pete, ringing home his performance as a leader, and a surrogate big brother.<br/><br/>The plot, to me, was engaging material, though it came with some predictable subplots like betrayals. It tries to make the point that violence begets violence, but doesn't offer any suggestions otherwise, because fanaticism in football is real and continuing issue that might seem to mar the sport. Some might deem this movie as romanticizing hooliganism, but it tried to balance those attempts by having a major character (pardon the pun) rationalize and play the devil's advocate.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why we had to rename this movie locally to ""Football Hooligans"". I know Green Street Hooligans might make some go Huh? But this is the internet age, where information is at the tip of your fingers, and all you have to do, is just to google it, or go visit IMDb.com (not as if I'm promoting it, but yeah, common sense). It's one thing having movies renamed worldwide (like Danny the Dog aka Unleashed), and another having a fiasco like ""The Spy Who Shioked Me"".<br/><br/>It's an interesting movie, with grand themes about not letting your buddies down, and for standing firm in what you believe in. Though the premise is controversial (brutal gang fights and all), it did seem like you're watching an updated, Caucasian remake of movies like A Better Tomorrow and Prison On Fire. Just remember to keep whatever inert tempers in check after leaving the theater.<br/><br/>*CLAP CLAP CLAP* UNITED!!"
"David_Frames","3","9","16","17 September 2005"," Your not singing anymore...on account of those head injuries
","No, not a biopic of Sidney Greenstreet but a film about football hooligans though having watched it you might find yourself a little bitter about the fact that the portly British actor doesn't feature.<br/><br/>Any discussion of Green Street has to centre on Elija Wood, the stunt cast lead, because his inclusion tells you two very important things about how the Film Industry works. First funding: Watching this thing hit you for 90 minutes like a Millwall Fan's bloody fist, you can imagine a conversation between the production company and the backers in which the not especially decent script was bolstered by the surprise attachment of Frodo Baggins. ""We've got the star of Lord of the Rings interested!"" they cried. From that moment the cash was in the bag but didn't someone stop to wonder whether or not the gentle, quasi-pubescent actor was the right choice for a film about English football violence? Someone almost certainly did but without Wood the script was buried so they kept those reservations to themselves. Secondly Star Vanity - Wood is probably the only person, bar the director who's a German Kick-boxing Champion (no, seriously) and thus only a fraction less aware of British football culture than old Elija, who can imagine himself as a Havard Student turned West Ham Supporting hardnut. ""I need to shed my little boy lost image"" he'll have told himself and so Green Street must have seemed like the perfect project to do it. The trouble is Wood is ludicrous as the American student, a near-graduate of the most prestigious University in the world, who decides that beating up Manchester United supporters with West Ham fans is the education he so badly needs. Several things strike you about this problem, one that undermines the entire story and pushes the whole thing toward low-comedy. Firstly Wood is a journalism student, albeit one with the poorest critical faculty in the world. Does he question the violent subculture into which he is thrust? Not at all - instead he's hooked after one chat in the pub with Pete, his mockney guide and thereafter loses any common sense he might have had, practically falling over himself to get stuck in to the latest beating. Even a hack working for the Sun, not journalists known for their brains, in fact some have barely got a G.C.S.E in English, would be brandishing this lot scum and calling for them to strung up. Wood however can't get enough of it which suggests that a career in the purview of analytical thought and the careful dissemination of facts may not be one to which he is well suited.<br/><br/>Believe it or not this is not the worst of Green Street's problems. Having paid scant attention to Wood's motives for joining the 'GSE' (its the lack of a Father figure... or something), it then goes on to unquestionably embrace the practise of making blood pies from people's faces as a perfectly legitimate form of camaraderie between men - blood brothers using the weekly scrap as the ultimate expression of their intractable bond. Now you and I might say, hang on a minute, they're beating people to death because these meat headed stroke merchants have a chemical imbalance in the brain, low intelligence and world view slightly less sophisticated than the Daily Mail editorial but for every scene that starts to criticise and then pulls back from doing so as if the director was afraid the film would turn on him and start beating his head against a table, there are many more in which the 'Blood Brothers' angle is promoted and repeated, the worst being the ridiculous climax in which a giant fight is set to a horrendous song, the lyrics of which talk about bonds and family; this all being edited to shots of men getting the living excrement beaten out of them. Claire Forlani improbably shows up in this scene, driving to the sight of a mini-riot with her baby to find Wood - a moment that perfectly captures the improbable nature of the entire enterprise. So that's Green Street kids - bloody nonsense but it would be rude to go without mentioning Pete, the leader of the West End ""firm"". Here's another bit of funny casting which has you scratching the head. The actor in question can't do a Cockney accent any more then I can and after you've heard him roll through the clichés ""Yaw 'aving a bubble mate"", ""I'm feelin' a bit Terrence Trent D'arby"" etc..., you have to ask yourself, were there no REAL cockney actors available? It was filmed in London for God's sake! Why hire a stage school boy from the Shires? In a movie where people can believe Wood was the inspiration for the Karate Kid despite the fact he'd have been about 3 months old when it came out, its par for the course. Everyone involved should be sent off...permanently."

The script reminds me of badly thought through BA Film Studies students shorts that I had to mark. The whole thing smacks of desperation and is awfully uncinematic with far too many shots taking place inside dimly lit pubs and grimy streets. The dialogue is appalling and there just isn't any redeeming quality to these people. Now I don't have an objection to dark and gritty films, what I have an objection to are films that fail to portray a single redeeming quality.

A very disappointing film."
"primula_gamgee","10","10","19","31 May 2005"," A Violent look at Football Hooliganism with a Message
","I'll admit that I had lingering doubts going into this film. I was worried that Elijah would let that slight British twang that Frodo seems to have left him with, reappear, and spoil his believability as a Yank! I was worried that the ending scene would work like an alternate ending to All I Want! I was worried the anti-violent message of the film would go awry in the final scene! <br/><br/>I needn't have worried! I absolutely loved this movie! Yes, it is violent and bloody, but in away that is quite realistic without glamorizing or sanitizing it in any way. This is a far cry from those old movies where a shirtless Kirk Douglas gave someone a pounding, and emerged no more than a bit dusty, and with a tiny, almost sexy trickle of blood at one corner of his mouth. The makeup artists managed to convey the damage a fist will really do to a face, or as least as close to it as I need to see! <br/><br/>As an American, I struggled a bit with the heavy British accents. When I finally get my hands on a DVD I plan to watch it with sub-titles once so that I can catch the bits of dialog I missed because of the accents, but I didn't have any trouble following what was going on despite my tin ear.<br/><br/>If this worries any of you as to the reception for the film by American audiences, you can relax! I spoke with a handful of other audience members, and we ended up listing all the movies we could think of that had made big splashes with American audiences despite thick British accents. None of them thought the strong accents were any reason for the film to be held back, and neither do I.<br/><br/>There was one scene where Pete explains to Matt about the firms which came off rather awkwardly, as exposition scenes are often want to do. Nevertheless, I think it provides all the explanation American audiences will need to enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>All of the actors were quite good I thought. Claire Forlani's emotional performance rang very true. Leo Gregory was excellent, managing to make me loathe him, and then breaking my heart all in one film! Charlie Hunnam was good, but in that naturalistic way that makes it look as though no actual acting is going on! And I thought Elijah was excellent as always. I particularly enjoyed the eyebrow acting during the scene in which Matt tries to call his father and gets an answering machine instead. I also loved his scenes with Claire, and there was one in particular where I felt he got to convey how much Matt had grown in the course of the film, indeed in the course of a few harrowing moments.<br/><br/>Some have said that they found the end scene in which Matt confronts Jeremy Van Holden to be gratuitous, but I did not. I liked Matt demonstrating the he was not to be messed with, while stopping short of physical harm, and it wrapped up the movie's theme nicely for me.<br/><br/>I had the privilege of seeing this film at a small film festival in Los Angeles. It has yet to net an American distribution deal, but I have high hopes that it soon will."

","The kind of film you'd cross the street to avoid, this absolutely dreadful waste of time is filled to the brim with all the standard clichés of the football hooligan film.<br/><br/>As an added bonus, this one has a cast of fake Cockneys putting on terrible accents. In fact, the second lead Charlie Van Dyke - I mean Hunnam's accent is so awful it was a shock to learn he's an Englishman! Coming across like an Australian actor struggling with a South African accent, it's honestly worse than the Cockney accents in Timothy Hines' worst film ever made The War of the Worlds. At one point I swear I saw him look at the camera and sing ""Maury Pappins, stip in tahm!"" If you're going to make a film about Cockney hooligans you'd better make damned sure your actors can convince with the accents, otherwise the audience will be left in hysterics as I was. To me it's as fatal a flaw as having Count Dracula wear a pretty pink dress and it's beyond me how such a performance was even considered suitable.<br/><br/>Aside from the accents the film adheres strictly to the tired old rules of the sub-genre, offering only an American in the way of something fresh - and that fails, obviously. The only thing about the film that isn't entirely predictable is the reprehensible way it seeks to glamorise these thugs - just watch Hunnam's final moments - apparently seeing organised violence at sporting events as some kind of noble warrior tradition."

","After a number of ""UK Football Hooligan"" movies - I.D, Football Factory to mention two and being a football fan and seeing scenes of violence between rival fans, I was hopeful that Green Street would be equally if not better at depicting the insular culture of a small group of society.<br/><br/>I think the first major flaw is the casting, no offence to Ejija but if he were to enter this culture he would be hospitalised before he could open his mouth. Not only is it the main man that is a flaw but the rest of his ""firm"" as they are called are all about 12. Although most firms do have younger members, these are normally the watch outs for the old bill, they would not be allowed to take part in the actually ""meets"" until at least 16 or 17.<br/><br/>The scenes of violence although quite well edited are on the whole unbelievable, there is no way the old bill would allow the fans to wait outside the train station as they did.<br/><br/>Football Factory is a much better depiction of the way the firms are run and what happens when opposition firms meet, this is almost a school boy version, and really not worth your time."

","this film was a hilariously and unacceptably overacted caricature of hooliganism, that too often required suspension of disbelief and resorted to stereotypical and unrealistic behaviour to deal with the conflicts and themes.<br/><br/>the actors and actresses in the film are solid and give off convincing airs until the final third when the waterworks and the screaming and the posturing went into overdrive in an orgasm of drama. despite the police presence throughout the film, they stay strangely absent when the abbey pub is burnt and smashed up and during the final fight with the millennium dome backdrop.<br/><br/>the underlying message is ultimately a double edged sword, a positive slant on the camaraderie and siege mentality of the rowing and the lawless rivalries, while trying to present the idea that this experience may have taught Matt the strength of character to stand up for himself, but also the ability to make the right choice and to reject the battle when more important things are at stake. also, honour, trust - the whole journalist suspicion thing and the guy returning at the end to fight after telling the Millwall lot about the journalism business etc.<br/><br/>two things about this are unfortunate. firstly, these messages are subjective in nature and have been presented in many films already, not to mention more subtly and/or effectively in many cases, and secondly, the film almost seems like an exercise in self parody at times, returning to the waterworks and the silly facials and squaring up and the rest of it. a constant supply of overacting backed by dramatic strings and stone roses and other appropriate music.<br/><br/>i joined the film a little late when it looked very promising, but the whole set up with the drug deal seemed a little flimsy, like it was a half hearted afterthought with regards to placing an American student in a hooligan situation. Matt - Elijah - also makes an emotional exit from Stephen and his sister's home to get stuck into the hammers lifestyle in a move which is made to seem as though it is forced and necessary, when Matt just could have been clever and, you know, not gone and lived with the hooligan. also, how the sister found the battleground at the end, and why she took HER BABY WITH HER boggled the mind. she is fit though, and i've seen her in other films where her acting cannot be faulted.<br/><br/>it must also be noted that the hatchet or whatever the Millwall firm leader was called walked into a chippy and lit up a spliff, and then smacked a guy's head into the table because his girlfriend didn't stop talking? that's overly, unnecessarily macho, in an almost Arnie kind of way that doesn't seem to fit in with the characters. and when Stephen's brother, the leader of the West Ham firm, Ben i think, dies at the end and they crowd around; it wouldn't have surprised me if one of them suddenly said in a mockingly retarded voice 'oh what a surprise that we got together for a grudge row and someone only went and died'.<br/><br/>the themes and the unfolding storyline with the journo sideline and the rivalry between Millwall and irons firms background were all dealt with over dramatically with crisp cinematography and a rousing score, and the cracks in the hastily flung together plot were papered over with over dramatic acting and tears and seemingly an expectancy that the violence would string it together neatly and reinforce it all.<br/><br/>to be fair the British cast paint a pretty accurate picture of a match-day for the firms and the banter is pretty accurate, until of course those histrionics i keep referring to kick in. it almost seems like a dumbed down, conveniently packaged Hollywood vision of the hooliganism issue. a character conveniently inserted into the situation in question, slices of realism to lend authenticity to the project, a load of explanations smugly delivered by the headstrong firm leader for the uninitiated viewer, and then the themes kick in, some convoluted twists thrown in over complicating things unrealistically as opposed to intelligently and interestingly due to a predictable main plot that requires such complications to prolong the viewer's interest - Stephen being the firm leader, Matt being spotted at the Times and the lads jumping to conclusions etc. - and a load of drama and full bodied dramatics from all, before a self indulgent eulogy to reinforce the tragedy and the moral, and a somewhat insipid ending - the bubbles song.<br/><br/>in conclusion, this is a poorly thought out project and it fails to inspire for the above reasons. go watch football factory which isn't perfect but paints a more authentic and indeed compelling picture of hooliganism. this film aims for the lowest common denominator and misses, and you should miss this one if you're after plausibility, an authentic portrayal of football hooliganism and intelligent film making. and if your a hammer chav, go watch that ICF film that's coming out, and do us all a favour and sign Barton up."

","I actually ended up liking this film more than I thought I would. However, it still misses the spot in a few areas, which will be picked up more by British audiences than the US market. <br/><br/>Firstly, Charlie Hunnam's London accent is appalling and extremely distracting. Also, some of the references made to football and hooliganism are not accurate. At the West Ham game, the team they are supposedly playing is Birmingham, who Bovver calls ""dirty Northern b*stards"". For the record, Birmingham is not in the North of England. <br/><br/>Also, the organisation of the GSE is not realistic. For a start, all the members are very young which simply would not be true of a firm for a club the size of West Ham. Second, hooliganism is much better organised than is depicted here. Everyone would know exactly who, where and what was likely to happen days before a game and would be prepared. A scenario of anybody ""rushing"" an opposing pub is very uncommon and almost impossible in the current era of stringent policing. <br/><br/>What is actually shown in this film is a group of lads who like a scrap and love football. Real hooligans are not particularly interested in football, simply the buzz of so many people and the thought of taking on rival firms. I would also say that Elijah Wood, although suitably timid and fresh-faced in his role, takes away from the credibility of the film. If a firm were ever to accept an outsider (particularly from the US) into a firm he would have to prove himself by more than simply landing a couple of lucky punches in a brawl. Wood simply does not show enough of the requisite toughness which would grant him respect. <br/><br/>On the whole, the film is well-paced and thoughtfully shot. But it doesn't really capture anything real about hooliganism - or anything we didn't know. I would recommend it as an alternative to the lighter-hearted 'Football Factory', but would not endorse its content to the British viewer."

I read somewhere the phrase 'Frodo goes loco' and that about sums it up. DREADFUL film -one of the worst I've ever seen."
"Theo Robertson","6","7","13","1 February 2010"," A Self Limiting Genre
","Films featuring football hooligans have been done to death . They usually follow a basic formula of an outsider becoming involved in a firm because it gives them a sense of identity . They're essentially straight forward violent dramas with pretensions of existentialist themes , comparable with Hollywood gangster movies . They are at the end of the day rather self limiting so what makes GREEN STREET different ? Nothing much story wise though it's obvious - perhaps too much so - that this movie is trying to get itself noticed in America . It stars Elijah Wood straight from his success as Frodo from LORD OF THE RINGS and has American settings bookending the start of finale of the film <br/><br/>It does seem strange trying to make a football hooligan film that'll sell in America and it's no surprise that the movie didn't get a wide release in the States "" Lanhdan "" accents would be impossible to understand to an Amerian audience along with Brit slang . The cause isn't helped much because the version I saw didn't have the greatest sound mix . The story is also held up as the characters have to explain to Wood's character , Matt Buckner , who the rival firms are <br/><br/>Where the film does succeed is to give some characters depth . For much of the film I thought I was watching Marc Warren in yet another wasted role but then it's revealed he's the mythical major which is a surprise that carries dramatic impact . Unfortunately this doesn't extend much to anyone else . It's difficult to believe Matt would put his hands up to something he didn't do and even harder to believe he'd turn down $10,000 . There's the very predictable climax of a fight shot in slow motion and cross cut editing that leads to the message violence begets violence and GREEN STREET doesn't bring anything new to the sub genre"

Being a South Londoner myself I couldn't believe the rubbish attempts to put on a London accent and also some of the rhyming slang that was used was pathetic , some of the slang that they used is only ever used by middle class kids who are trying to be something they are not. Anyone that knows football hooligans and seen the violence and been in their company know that these ""hooligans"" were too soft and some were too young.All that singing and standing on tables and throwing beer everywhere in their pub would never happen , not in their pub.Also when he said they hate journalists that could not be further from the truth as they love and crave the attention and headlines.

To describe this film as terrible would be an insult to every other film that's ever been described as terrible.

In Mary Poppins, DVD sounds like one of the Krays in comparison to Mr Hunnan.<br/><br/>I only chose the one star option, as I didn't want people to think the lack of stars meant that I was undecided or even actually rated the film. If there was a way I could give this film negative stars, then I'd give it minus 10 out of 10! The one positive of this film, is that the flashback scene involved some of the most hilarious make-up and acting I've ever seen. The mullets were a thing of beauty! If this film wasn't so hilariously, appalling, terribly, horrifically bad, then the ""I learnt more kicking the crap out of MIllwall fans than I ever could at Harvard"" storyline would be wholly offencive. As it is, I did actually enjoy this as one of the funniest films I've ever seen. But as a piece of cinema, it is a disgrace. Who paid for a German woman to write and direct a film about British football violence. Whoever it was, they are as guilty as Alexander for creating a movie that should be considered a stain on the stinking crotch of bad films.<br/><br/>Can't wait to see it again!"

Only two minutes in the country and he has achieved the impossible...he has got a ticket to a football game! The introduction to the family and the relationships was laughable. It was all so ""dumbed down"" for a simpler audience. This wasn't helped by the constant references to ""Cockney Slang"" which really did insult the intelligence. OK, so it is for a wider audience, but they must all think we are a right bunch of idiots over here.<br/><br/>Then we were introduced to the youngest gang of thugs ever.

Strangely enough though, you could hardly tell they had been drinking after it.<br/><br/>Their behaviour in their own local pub...who are you kidding with all that chucking around of beer and standing on tables. Sh*tting on your own doorstep comes to mind - It doesn't happen!!! But I suppose this is the artistic licence part eh.<br/><br/>I really didn't get the main plot of the film, which was probably because the ""moral of the story"" script was being shoved down my throat like I was a 2 year old. The script was simply awful. Good thing happens, followed by a bad thing and then something dramatic and then the revenge at the end.<br/><br/>The revenge at the end was a masterpiece of how not to end a film. it was 100% goosebumpingly cringeworthy. Very poorly thought out.<br/><br/>Rather than waffle on I will simply say it is a very poorly written film with some good actors struggling to pull off a performance.

The exchanges were dreadful as they were so clearly script written and not spontaneous. The lead character first speaks in this interchange and we hear a accent that tries to be cockney, but ends up sounding like a cross between Glaswegian, Geordie and bad Yank. Very bizarre.<br/><br/>Even more comical is the fact that one of these louts turns out to be an airline pilot. We see him attacking a group of rival supporters whilst wearing his uniform. I suppose this is to tell us that anyone can get involved in this type of violence but it is highly unbelievable. An educated man standing with a group of thugs and beating people to within an inch of their life for fun? Pull the other one! Basically, I wish I'd not bothered going. The acting was dreadful (particularly wooden Wood), the characters were thoroughly shallow, the dialogue must have been written by a panel as there's no consistency and according to this film Bank tube station services all of London, particularly Kensington, Leadenhall Street Market and the suburbs."

","Elijah Wood plays a ""Yank"" in London and gets sucked into a kind of friendship that you just do not walk into lightly. He plays the off centre role very well and is clearly a departure in character that begs Hollywood planning in not playing the nice guy after all that the public knows him for, namely Lord of the Rings. (Also seen in departure from this role in Sin City, where he shows his mettle). The cast is neatly assembled from well known, and not so well known, British actors and most give a five star performance despite a script that will draw a lot of criticism for being slightly right wing on the football hooliganism stakes. Yes, it does pro yob to a degree, yes there is a lot of violence, mostly out of shot and stylised into fast motion photography, but it works well in making you try to hide and, at the same time, face up to the supposed life of part of UK football society.

One thing that I totally agree with that Lexi had said at a Q & A, was that Elijah was so good at standing back and letting the story unfold around him, and not trying to take the spotlight. The cast was amazing, they all worked so well together, and really shaped this story. I hope to see more of them in film. <br/><br/>It was the best film I had seen at the SXSW festival. I highly recommend seeing this film if you have the chance, but like the comment before, if you are a little on edge about violence, you may want to reconsider, it can at time be a little rough to watch, but it really impacts the viewer.

","This passable thriller tackles the subject of football hooliganism in a way that's neither here nor there. It's watchable enough while it's on, but it's one of those films that it's easy to forget about soon after: run-of-the-mill, so to speak, without ever bringing much in the way of insight to its subject matter.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood is cynically cast – to interest the American market – as a failed student who finds himself inducted into the way of football fandom. Before long, he's falling foul of jealous types and rival fans, and the film soon deteriorates into a series of pitched battles between different 'firms'. Those at the highest echelons of football fandom are treated with the kind of glamour you see in gangster films, hanging out in watering holes surrounded by their supporters.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the reason this film is so forgettable is that it never tells us anything we don't know about the subject. We know the rivalries are deep-rooted. We know that fans meet up for pitched battles. The human story, involving Elijah Wood and his sister Claire Forlani, is dull and goes nowhere; in fact it gets in the way of the hooliganism stuff when it should be getting to grips with it.<br/><br/>The cast is varied, with Charlie Hunnam giving the most interesting performance as the charismatic football thug who takes Wood under his wing. But Marc Warren is totally miscast as an ex-gang leader and female writer/director Lexi Alexander never has the heart to really gets to grips with the subject matter.

","Green Street Hooligans is the story of Matt Buckner, a Harvard student played by Elijah Woods, who is expelled after the school finds his roommates cocaine in his closet. He then packs up and flies to England to visit his sister and her husband. While there he is befriended by his sister's brother in law, a boy by the name of Pete. Pete is the leader of the West Ham firm, the G.E.C. (Green Street Elite). A firm, as explained in the movie, is a group of fans that go to the games and fight the firms of other teams. He takes Matt to the pub and then to a soccer game. After the game things start to get a little out of the hand so Pete tells Matt to go home. On his way back he is followed by members of the teams firm. They begin to ruff him up and then the G.E.C. comes to his aid. The members of the other team flee and the G.E.C. chases them back to their reinforcements they had hiding around the corner. The altercation concludes with a brawl between the two firms. The G.E.C. arises victorious and Matt is accepted into the firm by its members. As the film continues it documents what the life of a firm member is like, both the good and the bad. <br/><br/>No matter what kind of movies you are interested in you will be able to find something appealing in this film. It has deep roots in the drama genre. However, it is jam packed with action and is littered with comedic elements as well. Green Street Hooligans is an emotionally enticing tale. The story is beautifully written, it grabs you at the beginning of the movie and refuses to let go until the very end. The writers did a very good job of choosing when to reveal things to the audience in order to keep the story line interesting and unpredictable. The story flows and develops when and the audience is left with a very satisfying ending to a terrific film. The story is set in England and the film does a very good job of showing the audience what life in a small English town is like. It also does a good job of convening what it is like to be a member of a soccer firm in England. It portrays the brotherhood and the trust that each member has for each other and the willingness that each member has to protect what is dear to them. The acting in the film is impeccable; the characters have been developed excellently. Elijah Woods, and the rest of the cast for that matter, take on the roles of their respective characters and make you believe that they are real live people. You can immediately pick out characters that relate to your personally. You begin to like them and become invested in the decisions they make and the consequences that follow. The movie is a put together in a very good length of time. It is not too short so that you feel like you've missed something, and it is not too long either. So you aren't sitting there praying for the end so you can finally get up and go to the bathroom. The film leaves the audience with a fantastic message that they can carry away with them and apply to their own lives. The message that you need to know when it's time to stand your ground and when it's time to walk away."
"gradyharp","8","3","5","12 August 2007"," A High Tension Tale Examining the Extent of Human Violence
","GREEN STREET HOOLIGANS is much easier on the psyche to watch in the home DVD version than in the theater release. It is a story so packed with violence that the underlying subplots get lost until the film is reduced to the size of a television screen. Lexi Alexander wrote (with Dougie Brimson and Joshua Shelov) and directed this tense story about the strange cults ('firms') of grown men who align with the various soccer/football teams in London, accompanying the games with intense fighting in the manner of 'hooliganism'. The story is well told by introducing a Yank into this atmosphere, allowing the viewer to see the origins and machinations of hooliganism from a fairly unbiased stance.<br/><br/>Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood) has just been expelled form Harvard in his last semester, taking the blame for his coke-snorting hotshot roommate whose family is too important for such blunderings. Somewhat without direction and not having his degree in journalism completed (Matt's father - Henry Goodman - is a high ranking international journalist whose time is spent in foreign ports since the death of Matt's mother) Matt flies to London to live with his sister Shannon (Claire Forlani) and her husband Steve (Marc Warren) and their young son. Steve's rowdy brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam) interrupts Matt's arrival with a demand for money from his older brother and reluctantly accepts the company of the new Yank Matt in order to gain cash from Steve. What ensues is Matt's introduction to the GSE (Green Street Elite), a firm of men who defend the honor and success of their chosen soccer team: there are many such firms of street violence gangs who vie for ranking within the city. Matt is plunged into this violent situation and learns form Pete the importance of gang stance: always protect your brothers and never flee a fight. The story grows increasingly complex and intense as we learn the backgrounds for hate and intolerance, one of these hates is for journalists and when it is discovered that Matt was a journalism major at Harvard the news nearly causes Matt's life. But Matt slowly identifies with the firm and grows into a sense of individuality that he has never had, giving him the ability to face the realities of his father's absence and to understand the precarious marriage of his sister whose husband is a 'reformed' hooligan. In the end there is a 'justification' for the violence witnessed, but the audience must be willing to view that justification from an altered stance.<br/><br/>The film is paced well and the cast is excellent, with special kudos to Elijah Wood, Claire Forlani, Marc Warren, Charley Hunnan, and to the fine supporting cast members including Leo Gregory as the unfortunate snitch, Terence Jay as the coke-addicted Harvard roommate, and a large cast of 'firm members' whose fighting techniques are well choreographed and captured by cinematographer Alexander Buono. Like THE FIGHT CLUB this film is not for all audiences, but the messages underneath all of the violence are well worth thought. Grady Harp"

It failed to explore the comedy, whit and cheek of this group in society in anyway, and caricatured many other aspects.<br/><br/>As for the music, what a disaster, this could have had one of the greatest movie sound tracks in years but no they decided to skim over the wealth of brit pop, indie, dance, drum & bass etc etc. The final climax used some god awful Irish folk song which made the whole saga laughable.<br/><br/>Then there's Elijah - what a hard man - lol - the end scene was hilarious.<br/><br/>This whole film competes very well with the likes of David Brent for cringe worthiness but instead of being good in Davids place is absolutely terrible in Green Streets place."

","Though arguably exaggerated for storytelling means, 'Green Street' captures the grimy, gritty and uncomfortable side to pre-match, post-game English football. Cinematography is deliberately shaky and unspectacular to emphasise this realistic approach; techniques which credibly make the film better and harder to look away as you delve into a violent underworld.<br/><br/>Following an American Harvard drop-out (wrongly expelled for something he didn't do), Elijah Wood's protagonist travels to the UK to finally visit his sister. It isn't long before events lead him to awkwardly navigate football hooliganism and ingratiate himself in an ugly atmosphere filled with coarse language and ultra-violence thanks to Charlie Hunnam's family tie. Gradually becoming assimilated in a gang that perpetually uses coarse language, crude slang, and derogatory verbal abuse, we, as the viewer, also find ourselves trespassing in a world we don't belong (or at least shouldn't). But its brutal, bare-knuckle street fights between rival football club supporters/gangs isn't the main attraction even if that is the headlining snare to lure in movie-goers searching for a lurid experience behind the scenes of a football game. The story becomes front and centre as the second act closes and the third begins, Elijah's Wood's journalist history threatens new-found friendships, high-stakes drama looms with the threat of reveals and bloody history between the central gangs, and the film shows us humanity deep within even the most despicable of people who initially warrant little of our time as they waste theirs revelling in others misery. <br/><br/>'Green Street' is well-cast, toughly written, and solidly acted to tempt anyone just curious of the football hooliganism scene, even when you realise this horrible side to life is not for you, but getting out isn't as easy as just walking away. 8/10."

Media representations, both factual and fictional, seem largely concerned with bad behavior by young (and not so young) males. (To be fair, male American football fans aren't a whole lot better, just less violent.} Elijah Wood portrays Matt, a young American student at Harvard who is falsely accused of drug-dealing and expelled. That plot gets lost early on, but it does get him to London, where he bunks with his sister (Claire Forlani, a Brit, herself playing an American), now married to a Brit. Her brother-in-law, Pete (Charlie Hunnam), a football hooligan, is also on the scene. He is delegated to help Matt adjust to life in London, an assignment Pete is initially not thrilled about. Events spiral downhill from there. Wood is well-cast as the straight arrow Harvard boy who (for whatever reason) takes the fall for his well-connected, politically ambitious, drug dealer roommate. He is thrust into the violent Hooligan culture of London and takes to it. Hunnam, who has been criticized for his accent, realizes that film is an international commodity, and English is the language of commercially successful films. Actors have to be understood everywhere, not just locally. Most of his mates don't get that, and it makes much of the dialogue problematic. Forlani is given little to do and does little with it. This could have been a brilliant film; Wood always has the potential to make his vehicles be so. But it does not achieve that goal, and British football is the culprit. It is hard to sympathize with anything which finds its inspiration in a sport typified by the unruly behavior of its advocates."
"quincybsq","2","2","3","29 January 2007"," Wow this is a morale tale
","Well to try and sum up how confused this piece of garbage is, we must first look at what may be the stupidest piece of casting in history. Elijah Wood as a football hooligan. For Lexi Alexanders next film i was wondering if he would mind casting Jean Claude Van Damme as a toddler. Elijahs character seems like it is trying to be portrayed as the more human side of hooliganism, the Thug with a heart if you will. But heres the thing, he seems just as stupid as the group he has joined. There is a few mentions that his mother died fairly recently so as to make us see that he is an emotional being, but it always seems to pop up and disappear so quickly that you have to seriously doubt whether Lexi wanted you to notice or sneeze. The amazing stereotyping of football hooligans (almost completely lifted from the style of the far superior recent hooligan film 'The football Factory') is hysterical, all cockney rhyming slang, nice confident swagger, bur berry etc etc is so overused its stupid, and that lack of acting talent by a few of the main players just makes it a joke. And here is the final moral tale of the film. Becoming a football hooligan will set you up for life. You will be able to take on more challenges and succeed. Your friends will die and your family will get hurt but that shouldn't matter cos morally you are set for life. And if a tw@t like Elijah can do it, anyone in the world too can learn to be a selfish Neanderthal prick. Boll@ks"

I can't stand that Geordie bloke trying to put on a cockney accent.Was there any real cockney actor in the film? This film is just far too serious, and does not represent our unique humour that one would find in the Bobby Moore stand. The songs are of course the same songs that we sang 3 times in a row at the Millennium Stadium, but its just plastic in this film.Nothing like one would find in the Boleyn or the amazing atmosphere that we all enjoyed at Cardiff Its just such a shame that I think this film has been geared towards the international/American market"

","I missed Green Street when it came out at the cinema in the UK and caught it today on DVD, and was definitely not disappointed with what I saw. Even if you take out the premise of the student being ejected from college after taking the rap for someone and that persons final redemption, you are still left with a potent and powerful film about peer-pressure, changes in attitudes, descent into violence, family loyalties, family destruction, betrayals, brotherhood, friendship, etc.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood's portrayal of Matt Buckner (the betrayed student), Charlie Hunnam's as Pete Dunham (a far cry from his days in the original UK version of ""Queer As Folk"") apart from the slightly Van Dyke-ish cockney accent, and Leo Gregory's as Bovver are first class. Definitely recommended.<br/><br/>If you enjoy this, try and catch ""ID"" (made in 1995, starring Reece Dinsdale and Warren Clarke) - very similar overtones.

It glorified football violence and I am surprised West Ham Utd. FC could get fooled into using the stadium. The Director of this film (by her comments on the DVD) obviously didn't do any proper research, or if she did, it was down the pub with some of the footy ""Morons"" she depicted in her movie. The Social implications of this movie are huge. With young ""thugs"" using this film as a gospel, a guidelines to act in society and at the footy games themselves. I had hoped that this sort of ""Propaganda"" was dead and buried with the horrible days of the 80's when footy violence was at it's peak. Lets be wary of these people but not give them a platform for there right wing views."

","I saw this film last night and I couldn't believe how bad it was. Green Street Hooligans is not very accurate and the acting is awful. The story line is pointless which makes the viewer not really care about any of the characters. The 'top boy' of West Ham's firm looks about 24 years old with a dodgy cockney accent that makes him sound American/Australian, who struts around ridiculously chanting random football (ish) chants at babies/nothing/anybody. Fights scenes are okay but this is not enough to even contemplate watching this film. Frodo Baggins' acting isn't bad, but it's just so unbelievable that a small American could stroll into a huge football firm at his first match. If you want to watch a film about football hooliganism, watch 'Football Factory', 'The Firm' or 'I.D.' as any of these films are more accurate."

Americans will lap it up because the don't have any concept of a real cockney accent but Charlie Hunnam is terrible. His accent is a cross between American and Australian. He walks with a stupid stereotypical swagger and clearly knows nothing of the cockney accent. He's almost as bad as Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. It absolutely glorifies football violence by making it seem like what they are fighting for is 'just' and 'true'. The character of Elijah Wood is totally UNBELIEVABLE. Think about it... No, no.. Think about it... Think about how this Harvard student just happens to fall into the GSE after seeing one football match. Knows nothing about football, has never hit anyone in his life just suddenly starts beating the sh*t out of people? His narrative sounds like hes asking his mum for a biscuit. PILE OF CRAP...

"jimbo-53-186511","8","1","1","11 June 2013"," A film about football hooliganism with real depth and emotion
","A friend of mine told me about Green Street a while ago when I told him that I'd watched Football Factory. He advised me to watch Green Street as it is a far superior film (and that I do agree with). Green Street is a much better film as it has much more depth and takes its subject matter much more seriously.<br/><br/>In Green Street, Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood) is a Harvard undergrad who ends up being expelled from university when his roommate's drugs are planted on him. As a result, Matt moves to London to stay with his sister Shannon Dunham (Claire Forlani) and her husband Steve (Marc Warren). Shannon questions him about the drugs when he gets to England to which Matt denies that they were his drugs, but she is dismayed when she discovers that he didn't tell anyone at Harvard that they weren't his drugs and that he didn't stand his ground and defend himself. This is partly because Matt is a bit weak willed and also because of 'who his roommate knows' at Harvard.<br/><br/>Once in England, Matt is quickly taken under the wing of Pete Dunham (with exceptional acting by Charlie Hunnam) who introduces him to his firm known as the GSE (Green Street Elite). We see initially that Matt is not popular amongst the firm, they immediately take a disliking to him as he is a Yank and an 'Outsider'. As the film progresses, the gang gain respect for Matt for having 'bottle' and not 'backing down' which are all essential traits within the GSE.<br/><br/>One of the film's strengths is in the characters and character development. Pete is the leader of the GSE and although he is a violent towards other football fans, he does have some likable qualities such as one scene where he stands up on a train to let a lady sit down, the way he looks out for Matt. He shows that he is human and it makes him sort of likable. The GSE's main rivals are the Millwall firm led by Tommy Hatcher (played by Geoff Bell). His character is a despicable individual with no likable qualities and he only knows how to get his message across by using violence (as seen in one shocking restaurant scene).<br/><br/>The film takes a turn when one of the members of the GSE thinks that Matt is an undercover reporter (he spots Matt standing in the entrance of 'The Times' building. The GSE's suspicions are further worsened when they discover a Journal on Matt's laptop describing the time he spent with the group and what he thought of each of them. This leads to a show down in the pub where Matt tries to convince Pete that he isn't an undercover reporter and this causes divided loyalty between Pete and fellow GSE member Bovver (Leo Gregory) as Pete chooses to believe Matt and Bovver doesn't believe him (makes sense as he made no secret of not liking Matt all through the film). Bovver tips off Tommy and his crew that the Major (former leader of the GSE) is in the GSE's hang out (which turns out to be Pete's brother Steve). Tommy ends up stabbing Steve in the neck as revenge for his boy getting killed during a fight when the 2 firms met about 10 years ago - it was for this reason that Steve turned his back on hooliganism, and although Steve didn't actually kill Tommy's boy, Tommy holds Steve responsible as he was the major at the time. As a result of the Millwall firm putting Steve (the major) in hospital, the GSE go after Tommy and his crew to seek revenge.<br/><br/>What's also great about the film is the ending. The film goes full circle and Matt ends up back in America and gets his revenge on his roommate (before he sees his roommate he says in his narrative that 'he has learnt a lot from Pete) and I believe that the lesson here is to always stand up for yourself which is what Matt does in the end. Matt doesn't use any violence against his roommate and merely restrains him when he tries to take his Dictaphone meaning that he has learnt to be more assertive than aggressive.<br/><br/>Although this film has a lot of violence, it certainly doesn't glorify it and it doesn't glorify football hooliganism (this message is thumped home several times throughout the film). This is a genuinely fine, emotional ride with terrific acting (particularly from Charlie Hunnam as previously mentioned).<br/><br/>Whilst I did enjoy Green Street, there were a couple of issues. Firstly, the camera work during some of the fights was quite nauseating which caused me to have to look away from the TV on a couple of occasions. Also I found Matt's transition from mild mannered Harvard student to street thug came a little too effortlessly, but these are only minor flaws in an otherwise excellent film."

","I won't pretend to know anything about football hooliganism because I don't although I likely know and am perhaps related to a few people that do, have been a hammers fan all my life and know bits and pieces about the icf, enough to know that it's not like this. The people involved are normally not very complicated people.. like fighting, are racist, have a passing interest in football and that's about it <br/><br/>I also have an extremely good ear for an authentic East London accent and Charlie Hunnan's accent is all over the map.. ending up somewhere in between London, Newcastle and New York, in the sea. A real pity because he is a central character in the movie and the role should've been cast better, it quickly eroded any interest I had in the movie. Some of the more minor characters do have good accents, eg. Leo Gregory and Ross McCall sound better <br/><br/>I didn't get the music choices either.. Stone Roses etc, there was nothing particularly London-oriented<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil it completely for international viewers because without knowing any of the above you will likely enjoy Green Street Hooligans and it might give you some insights, it was indeed recommended to me by a Canadian which is quite ironic :)"
"StevePulaski","8","1","1","2 May 2012"," Unlike ""Fight Club,"" it has one demand, not rule
","One of my favorite gang films of all time is Boyz N The Hood, mainly because its prime focus isn't the actual gang members but rather the people affected by the violence and unrest. The film followed three men, growing up with albatrosses and typical coming of age struggles, only magnified because of their presence in a poor neighborhood. The film was dark, poignant, and very, very upsetting, yet beautifully done, with every frame and character having paid close attention to detail and subtitles.<br/><br/>Along comes Green Street Hooligans many years later. It's no Boyz N The Hood, but it's still worth a look. The film centers around the London ""Green Street Elite"" (GSE) gang, comprised of brutal men with a die-hard obsession for the sport of football and an appetite for grave brutality. Their latest member is tourist Matt Buckner (Wood), who was kicked out of Harvard after being framed for drug use. He visits his sister and her husband out in London, and winds up becoming acquainted with her husband's brother Pete (Hunnam), the leader of the hooligan ""firm."" The transformation Matt undergoes from a decent, well-educated man to a thuggish, impulse-driven madman happens very quickly as he winds up favoring respect over modesty and violence over civil obedience.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood seems to be holding up nicely after The Lord of the Rings trilogy, building a solid and diverse filmography, but here, he seems a bit outgunned. This is one of the things about independent films I grow weary about; some of the them feel the need to softly ""American-ize"" their story by either adding a well-known actor or by hammering in homages from other common American films. Green Street Hooligans does both, but subtly enough so as not to be too distracting. While Wood feels out of place, he nonetheless does everything he can with his role, and the result is favorable. As for the slight homages, it seems the film has also had a little run-in with David Fincher's Fight Club in terms of some of the underground fight scenes.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are brisk, attractive, if a little too much of a fantasy, but the most important thing to notice is how the GSE look at other gangs. Throughout the film, numerous dirty looks are exchanged, facial expressions seem to scream over words, and some scenes involving Elijah Wood, who arguably has the most difficult role in the picture, capture the fear and regret just by the simple look into ones eyes.<br/><br/>Another thing to note is the impressive use of cinematography, which is superbly utilized in the scene where Matt is walking home alone through the cold streets of London. London's xenophobia is consuming, and so is the violence that one could find on the streets. The ominous, bleak texture of the city is wonderfully portrayed, and the film makes no attempt to try and gloss over the facts when it comes to street violence and how unapologetic it can become.<br/><br/>Director Lexi Alexander, a world champion in both kickboxing and karate, has stated in interviews that her older brother was a member of a football firm and that she got a lot of inspiration from the encounters she had with the gang while with him. Her work is definitely well done and acted properly, but something feels missing. Thinking back to mobster films like Goodfellas and gang films like Boyz N The Hood, what made them so good was that the characters were like time-bombs, with explosive personalities rather than explosive actions, and were developed with plenty of care and attention. Green Street Hooligans sort of focuses too much on Matt and Pete, and forgets there are other members of the gang worth describing. This is a fine film, shedding light on a band of people I'm sure not many in the United States are aware about, but the lasting effect isn't too long and the result is a tad too Hollywood.<br/><br/>Starring: Elijah Wood, Charlie Hunnam, Claire Forlani, and Leo Gregory. Directed by: Lexi Alexander."

","I didn't really know what to expect from this film, seen as the only other football based film I'd seen previous to this was Goal, though i realised while watching this film it's only loosely based on Football the story of this film is more about family and morals.<br/><br/>One of the things i loved about this film was how each character had a story of their own. Often in films characters pass by with no background story what so ever, but let me tell you now every character in this story has their own background and you hear about it, they all have their own detailed storys and it shows through their character, which goes to prove that there are some very talented actors in this film.<br/><br/>The quotes within this film, are some of my favourite quotes of all time, this film had me enthralled from the very first minute to the very last and just writing this is making me want to watch it again."

","Interesting, well made, if flawed exploration of the British culture of gang warfare based around football (soccer in the US) teams. <br/><br/>These aren't random crazies, but organized 'firms' as they call themselves that engage in frequent hand to hand combat for the sheer testosterone/adrenaline rush, and for the feeling of community, of belonging. It's a fascinating world and raises important question about the violence inherent in men.<br/><br/>When nerdy Elijah Wood comes to England over to visit his sister after being expelled from Harvard, he quickly falls in with a gang, and much to his shock and ours finds that he is turned on by participating in the violence. <br/><br/>The problems: first of all, it's hard to buy that Wood would survive long. Even with enthusiasm he's undersized and under muscled. His moments in the many (and well staged) fight scenes never feel as real as those around him.<br/><br/>The Harvard set up that gets Wood to England feels clumsy, hard to believe and over-the- top. <br/><br/>The third act has more than it's share of Hollywood-style plot turns for a film that sports a semi-documentary feel. <br/><br/>Last, I have a question the film's point of view about the violence, which seems to be 'it's OK if it doesn't go too far'. As one character says about another's death, without irony. 'It taught me there's a time to stand your ground and a time to walk away.' But is it ever time to stand your ground to kick the crap out of others and have them kick the crap out of you over a football team?"

","Green Street (AKA: Green Street Hooligans) is directed by Lexi Alexander and stars Elijah Wood, Charlie Hunnam and Claire Forlani. It's co-written by Alexander, Josh Shelov and former football hooligan turned author Dougie Brimson. Plot sees American college student Matt Buckner (Wood) expelled from Harvard after drugs are found in the room he shares with the popular son of the powerful Van Holden family. With time on his hands, Matt decides to visit his sister Shannon (Forlani) in England and falls in with her brother-in-law Peter (Hunnam); the leader of notorious football hooligan firm The Green Street Elite. Soon enough Matt finds himself running with the firm, finding an outlet for his frustrations whilst learning about trust and loyalty. But how far is he prepared to go? And what implications are around the corner for those involved, and those close to them?.<br/><br/>Ah, the football hooligan, a some what popular topic for translation to film and book on a yearly basis; in the UK. To America, tho, the concept of gangs beating the tar out of each other in the name of the football team you support: is most assuredly absurd. Enter Lexi Alexander and the team who sat around the table and said "" lets educate them darn Yanks on the subject, lets get Frodo Baggins involved and thrust him into the machismo fuelled world of football violence"", cue some stroking of beards and finally the green light for Green Street was well and truly lit. So a hot topic movie that's adding an interesting continental slant, then?.<br/><br/>The football hooligan film has had some decent enough productions over the years, film's like Nick Love's remake of The Firm and Philip Davis' excellent offering ID, have interesting observations on the subject at hand. Green Street, while following the clichÃ©s ad infinitum, offers up a bone crunching glimpse of a dangerous, yet wholly addictive underworld. Yet it has the same problem that many of the other similar themed film's has, namely it muddies the lines of being a rose tinted admiration or a damning indictment. Sure the outcome here is the same as the others, it always ends in tears and misery for someone, the overriding message is, hey guys, football hooliganism is really bad; not just for society, but for yourselves too. Yet the visceral violence (the fights are very well constructed by Alexander) has an exhilaration to it that borders on glamorisation, while the thread of Matt's transformation from meek college boy into spine growing ass kicker, is giving off what sort of moral message? Exactly.<br/><br/>So do we learn anything new from Green Street? No, and that's a shame because Alexander has done a good job of putting the viewer in the mix and she's at least tried something different with the American angle. She's also garnered some good performances from the cast. Wood has come in for some criticism for his performance, yet he's played it exactly as written. He's meant to be a guy who goes thru an unbelievable transformation, it's a known fact that many football hooligans have great professional jobs and that some were once mild mannered intelligent scholars. That his character doesn't sit right in the topic is not his fault, he plays the role perfectly. Of the others, Hunnam is charismatic and Leo Gregory is annoyingly memorable as right hand man Bovver, while Geoff Bell is outright scary as Millwall thug leader Tommy Hatcher. Rafe Spall (Hot Fuzz/Sean of the Dead) also turns in a notable piece of work. Forlani does well enough with what she has got, but considering she is the sole female axis in the plot her screen time is not enough, while Marc Warren as an important character (husband of Shannon, brother of Pete & ex leader of the firm) is sadly unbelievable.<br/><br/>Mixed messages unbound and sign posted from the off, Green Street is hardly one to recommend to those venturing into the source material for the first time. For those interested in a problem that refuses to go away, however? It's very much one to put on your to see list. 6.5/10"
"eastbergholt2002","8","1","1","23 January 2010"," Takes me back
","I really enjoyed Hooligans. Lexi Alexander, the director, made a fun and fast-paced action film. There are innumerable fight scenes with plenty of boozing and swearing and the acting is convincing, especially from Elijah Wood and Charlie Hunnam. The film does not judge harshly those that participate in hooliganism but it shows that the potential risks can outweigh the thrills. <br/><br/>It reminded me of life in England in the 1970s. The film depicted fairly accurately some aspects of the football world as it was then. I knew people who would travel around the country supposedly supporting their team who were mainly looking for a fight. I had a friend at college who eventually became an accountant who liked the excitement and the camaraderie. Most of the hooligans gave it up when they reached their early twenties. They grew up, found girl friends and realised that having a criminal record might damage their future career prospects. <br/><br/>In the 1970s hooliganism was in many ways tolerated by the authorities. The assumption was that young men liked to fight and as long as they just beat each other up hopefully they would get the violence out of their systems and become solid members of society. It was when English fans started to export the violence overseas that the authorities began to take notice and it became a national embarrassment. After the Heysel Disaster in 1985 when 39 Italian fans were killed in a stampede trying to escape from rampaging Liverpool supporters the British government carried out a major crackdown and it became less of a problem in the years that followed. There is still the occasional flare up, mostly involving England when they play overseas, but the police seem to have the situation under control. I now live in the US and have no idea whether the world shown in the film still exists.<br/><br/>The film is good fun and focuses on the fights and the male bonding. It does not try to explain why young men felt the need to behave this way."

","Violence for the sake of violence is probably one of the most unappealing things most people can think of. But other forms of violence are often just as suspect. To war over ones religious beliefs, cultural differences, or natural resources is just as insidious. So try to imagine fighting over ...nothing. Well, maybe not nothing. Perhaps your pride was at stake. Is that worth beating your fellow man over the head with a blunt object? This will be the toughest thing to understand when watching GREEN STREET HOOLIGANS.<br/><br/>Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood, LORD OF THE RINGS series) just got kicked out of Harvard. He was only two months shy of graduating with a degree in journalism when drugs were found in his university apartment. But Matt shared the place with another roommate who'd been hiding his drugs within Matt's closet. And this roommate belongs to a powerful family (the Van Holden's). His roommate promises to give Matt a job if he just holds out for a little while. So Matt, being a bit of a scrawny weakling, accepts his disgrace and leaves Harvard (it should also be noted that Matt had little chance of beating the wrap even if he notified the appropriate authorities because of how powerful the Van Holden's were).<br/><br/>Matt flees to his sister's house in England where he tries to hide his shame from his journalist father, too. And an accidental run-in with a football (don't call it soccer!) fanatic will alter Matt's life forever. Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam, NICHOLAS NICKLEBY) is this football fan who heads a group of hooligans on Green Street. They have what they call ""A Firm"" which, in reality, is nothing more than a gang of thugs parading around as local football devotees. When games are played at home or on another team's turf, the Green Street Hooligans are there, mocking the opposing team's ""Firm"", thus igniting bloody-fisted brawls. The winner of said brawls receives pride points as word of their successes spread from Firm to Firm. Matt becomes one of the Green Street gang and learns to strengthen his knuckles as well as his pride. As the blood spews (and there's crimson-o-plenty), Matt falls deeper and deeper under violence's spell.<br/><br/>It takes a bitter fight to free Matt from the Hooligans' clutches, and he heads back to America where he finally confronts his old Harvard roommate with the drug problem. But now Matt isn't afraid. His mind is sharp and his fists scarred. His hallelujah moment arrives just as expected.<br/><br/>Although predictable too, the ending is a righteous event. Elijah Wood pulls in an excellent performance as a completely believable wuss who eventually turns his life around via questionable tactics. This is what gives the film its positive rating, too.<br/><br/>The tough pill to swallow is the extreme violence that gushes across the screen and the all important ""why"". Why do they fight like this over seemingly nothing? Part of it is a sense of belonging. To anything. Even if that ""anything"" is beating on someone's face whom you know nothing about.<br/><br/>The reality is that there ARE things like this out there (just read the newspapers about football fans brawling in parking lots, or little league parents beating up umpires for bad calls), which is why you'll see positive reviews of Green Street Hooligans. But that doesn't make this any less a sad statement. But a statement isn't why we're here. We're here to see if the film was entertaining, and it most certainly was. But separating the message from the entertainment may be too difficult for some viewers."

","Let's just say I had to suspend my disbelief less for Spiderman than I did for Hooligans. That is, to say, I have less of a problem believing Toby McGuire can stick to buildings than I do Elija Wood throwing down with toughs in Manchester. I won't get into specifics, as I don't want to write a spoiler, but the idea of grown, professional, British men getting into near death scraps every weekend is, well... funny. And this film is not. The fighting, the idea of fighting, is taken far too seriously. The gravity of the pugilism, the reverence with which the subject matter is treated becomes irritating, as it neither establishes or resolves the conflict. It seems as though the plot, with holes big enough to drive a Guiness truck through, has been slapped together with a contrived ""fish out of water"" theme so that viewers can gaze into Woods teary eyes as he learns how to become a man ie. hitting other young men of opposing football tastes with blunt objects and then running away as fast as he can. The characters are cartoonish, especially the Americans at Harvard. The character development and story line are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the picture. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film doesn't reach its height until nearly the end, which by then you'll have spent nearly two hours of your life you are never getting back. Pick up ""The Football Factory"" or ""Fight Club"" instead of this corny, and disappointing dud. It doesn't waste time with empty melodrama, the tired old ""Yankee in King Aurthur's Court,"" or weepy, parables of coming of age bullsh*t. They're just pure, dark, and clever fun; the way violence is supposed to be."

Expect big things to come from this guy. A world of extreme violence with it's own rules and code of conduct. A world of madness that parallels our own. I doubt if such brotherhood exists outside of war.

","With his role in ""Green Street Hooligans"" coming to theaters, here is an interview we did with the films Star Charlie Hunnam during his promotion for ""Cold Mountain"". I have condensed the interview to include information on Charlie and the new film, rather than rehash the information from ""Cold Mountain"". I found Charlie to be a very down to earth, intelligent, and straight forward person, and he had a lot of enthusiasm for his craft and pending projects.<br/><br/>GVK: How did you get into acting? CH: I was in college studying to be a director and I was discovered in a shoe shop buying shoes and I was cast in three episodes of Biker Grove and that lead to an agent and a few weeks later ""Queer as Folk"".<br/><br/>GVK: You had passed up some leading roles for ""Cold Mountain"" any second thoughts? CH: Not really as I had a hard time deciding on parts like Nicholas Nicolby as it was a great cast but I could not do it justice and sit comfortable in those shoes. I decided to sit back and look at my offers and I am going to take time and try not to make the mistakes that many of my peers do as they just want to work. They do not really write for our age group and it is important to look for the good roles and not be so quick to jump on whatever comes along.<br/><br/>GVK: That is a great attitude. When I did my two small parts, I had so many people telling me to take whatever they give you, as you do not know when you will act again. Since I was not pursuing acting as my career, I did not have to worry but now that the studios are coming for you with roles, it must be hard to say no at times to offers.<br/><br/>CH: Yes, it is when some films do not pay as well and you have a mortgage to pay and you are on an economy drive eating eggs and beans. Then you are offered a million dollar role and you turn it down, as it is not right. I want to be doing this when I am 60 and getting the big paying roles then so I have to pick the parts that are right for the long term rather than take the money now.<br/><br/>GVK: That is a great attitude; it must have driven your agent crazy though? CH: He is actually been very good to me as I am his main client and he wants me to succeed and is willing to take it slow for long term success. Many people want the money and excitement but that is not always the best.<br/><br/>GVK: True, River Phoenix and others show that films can fade and if roles dry up, tragic outcomes may arise.<br/><br/>CH: I am doing a film on Soccer Hooligans and I play the leader of the West Ham and I am fascinated by what I learned in research. It is amazing how organized it is. Fights can and often are arranged before the matches nd there is a rigid code of conduct for members of the various clubs. There are rules for fighting such as not using weapons, not hitting a man once he has gone down, and so on. Also, it is amazing how well-organized the various clubs and supporters are. There is a scene in the film where rival firms meet in a train station and a member informs the other firm that they have made a serious mistake getting off at this stop.<br/><br/>There is some good comedy in it as well. Elijah Wood, Tommy Flannigan are in it as well. I will do Robert Towns new film after that as well with Collin Farrell and Selma Hayak <br/><br/>Gareth Von Kallenbach www.sknr.net"

How about the fact that the plot is so full of holes that by the end you're not even complaining, you're just sitting there numb and waiting for the nonsensical twist in this soulless, bloody pantomime? How about the fact that it couldn't glorify football violence any more without having all the lead characters waving flags saying, ""We Love Football Violence"" and offering £10 to the first member of the audience to bottle the person in front? Without giving too much away, there is a fight scene near the end that is set to a kind of sub-Brothers in Arms folk song and portrayed in slow motion.

Stupid film!"
"I_amindeed","10","3","6","11 September 2005"," A really exciting, captivating film
","This film clearly achieves what it sets out to do - it sets out to show the seductiveness of violence and it manages to do that in a fashion that really draws the audience into it. The reviews in the serious papers and magazines have recognised that quality - the quality that led it to receive both the jury and audience awards at the SXSW film festival, the only film that has succeeded in doing so. To criticise it for failing to examine hooliganism from different perspectives therefore is to miss the point. It succeeds so well in showing the way that violence can draw a non-violent person into it due to Elijah Wood's very sophisticated and extremely convincing performance as Matt.<br/><br/>He is an actor who is as versatile as he is both interesting and captivating; he makes it impossible to remain emotionally detached from the film. He shows in a subtle and effective fashion the stages that Matt goes through in getting drawn into the group of hooligans and embracing their behaviour, partly as a demonstration of loyalty to them but also for its own sake. The film indicates with subtle touches (which a few critics failed to pick up on - do they actually concentrate on the films they review?) just why he is so vulnerable to being drawn into the group: he is looking for an identity; he cannot identify with his family since his father is emotionally absent, while his mother is dead. Even his sister's husband seems to reject him. He cannot view himself as a journalist since he has been expelled from his journalism course. He is drawn into the hooligan group, the GSE, due to Pete's demonstrations of loyalty to him. So there is a universal message which is far from glorifying violence - that young men looking for identity may find it even in hooliganism. But there is also an interesting ambiguity in the message about violence revealed through Wood's performance - that it has visceral appeal. <br/><br/>The sillier UK papers played the whole ""hobbit to yobbit"" theme to death. But although I thought that Elijah Wood's performance as Frodo was probably the most moving thing I have ever seen on screen, and I've watched the trilogy too many times to count, I realised as I left the cinema that it had not crossed my mind once during the film. The plot is well-crafted and realised. In a packed cinema, we were on the edges of our seats the whole time.<br/><br/>Up-date: just to add - I enjoyed this film so much that I went back to see it the following night. Again the cinema was packed and the audience watched the film in enthralled silence - you can always tell when an audience is really engrossed. As one of my friends said afterwards, it was so much better than a typical Hollywood blockbuster - where you don't care about what happens to the characters, you just watch a parade of sterile special effects in a half-bored fashion. <br/><br/>My friends and I come from the North of England and so we have often seen groups of hooligans although we are not football fans ourselves; we all thought the hooligans, including Elijah's character, looked very realistic - it's so naive to think that all hooligans look like thugs. As Matt started to emulate their behaviour, he looked more and more part of their group. A couple of UK critics have said Elijah and Charlie Hunnam are too good-looking and non-thuggish in appearance to play hooligans. We were sitting in a very large audience in a cinema in a roughish area of Manchester that included at least 80 blokes of about 20ish, many of whom must have been football supporters. If this critic was right, you'd have expected a laugh from at least one of them when Charlie Hunnam appeared as the hooligan leader or when Elijah as Matt threw his first punch. Nothing - just fascinated silence. Tells us something about how out of touch some of the UK film critics now are (US ones are a bit more savvy). User reviews on IMDb and other Internet sites are becoming a better guide than press ones. You get a consensus about films like this and a freshness and enthusiasm in comments. A few of the more jaded film critic, faced with a film like this with its originality and emotional appeal, have merely dropped readily into their comfort zone - sneering at it rather than make the mental effort of trying to understand it. <br/><br/>I thought some more about Elijah's character's need for identity on seeing it the second time: he had been betrayed by his room-mate at Harvard so he was obviously desperate to find loyalty somewhere; Elijah's great performance tended to make us think quite deeply about what his character was going through. I also thought that anyone who thought that the film had a simplistic message about violence being the right way to deal with problems couldn't have watched it closely (I won't include a spoiler, but the more complex message is indicated in the exact way that the very last scene plays out - without punches being thrown). <br/><br/>Since the film was so dynamic and had so much ""heart"", as many reviews have said, it has appeal well outside the UK and far beyond its genre; it will play with audiences across Europe and in the US. The hit film of the year."

","""Green Street Hooligans"" would be a fantastic film were it a comedy. Unfortunately we're supposed to take this lame attempt at documenting the culture of football hooliganism seriously. This film is riddled with clichés. The cultured, well-heeled yank to the ""cockerneys"" from ""darn saaff"" giving it all ""apples and pears"", ""knees up Muvver Braaan!""... Quite why a cultured middle class American midget would be attracted to the bunch of neanderthal morons that make up the football firm is beyond comprehension, they're about as attractive as a particularly nasty dose of clap. The main sentiment of the movie seems to be ""Violence is OK as a means to an end"" and ""Journalism is the mother of all evils"". Ridiculous! The characters are so over the top it's more like a Carry-On version of football hooliganism than anything of true merit or worth. They're all here, the Cockerney wide-boy with a heart of gold who sacrifices himself at the movies climax to save his friend, the disillusioned firm member who betrays his mates and redeems himself before the final whistle, the rival firm ""Boss"" who is a complete psycho but is misunderstood because hey, you know, he lost his son in a previous fight.. like you do.. there's even room for the ""retired"" firm leader, who tries to steer our ""hero"" away from the meaningless violence but ultimately ends up ""carved up"" for his troubles. I spent about 95 percent of this garbage laughing, as will anyone with an ounce of intelligence. The funniest moment for me though was the scene where ""Bov"" or whatever his name is stands on a bench near Tower Bridge clutching a bottle of Smirnoff warbling ""I'm forever blowing bubbles"" into the night sky. All the film needed was Simon Cowell to appear and offer some sage advice on his delivery. And to top it all the final ""battle"" scene is played out to a MOR American rock ballad. No, seriously... This movie wasn't only badly written, directed and acted, it was out of step with time and reality. It would have made slightly more sense had it been set in the late 1970s or early 1980s. Sure, you'll always get morons fighting at football matches but the culture that this movie spews out died a long time ago, thank God. Awful. But the Yanks will probably love it.

","Could anyone else not stop thinking of Bill Hicks' hilarious bit mocking the hooligans as peter pan versions of L.A. gangs when watching this movie? Well, the thing is this flick portrays them just like that. The first half of ""Hooligans"" plays like ""Fight Club"" with Brits, the second one is ridiculously dramatic.<br/><br/>The whole thing is about as realistic as ""West Side Story"". The story is so predictable and the characters so clichéd, it's hard to take ""Hooligans"" seriously. From the ex-hooligan leader who can't finish with his old life, to his good-hearted brother, the Judas-character who switches from good to bad and back again, the brutal villain and the slippery snob... those characters could have jumped right out of a musical. Hell, ""The Warriors"" had more balls than this movie! And who the hell picked a song that sounds like ""Brothers In Arms II"" for the final fight sequence? Who chose puppy-faced Elijah Woods for the role of a guy who gets a vicious appetite for destruction? The worst part is the message ""Hooligans"" conveys, which is that hooligans are really just people full of honor, not afraid to stand up for themselves or their comrades. Sure, some of them are misguided now and then and the whole lifestyle really isn't all there should be to life (one needs to know when to walk away from it), but all in all they're really good guys. Er, yeah right... Does being a hooligan also mean that you don't need a job? Because none of the characters ever seems to work or have any money problems. One thing's for sure, though, they HATE journos! *ooooooooohhhh*<br/><br/>The fast pacing makes ""Hooligans"" watchable, but this piece definitely isn't a convincing depiction of violence in the UK, nor does it give any conclusive insight into that milieu. If Andrew Lloyd Webber had bothered to write some music for it, ""Hooligans"" would have made a damn good Broadway show."

","As a 57 year old woman I am hardly in the expected demographic for this film. However, I found it enjoyable and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Charlie Humman's accent, widely disparaged, did not bother me after the first few lines. The acting was uniformly strong and convincing, the plot no more implausible than that of hundreds of other films. The film conveyed excitement of a football match to one who, frankly, generally finds football boring. It demonstrated the attraction and elation of the fight while forcefully making the point that the price paid is too high and that the innocent also suffer. The other point it makes is that if support is not forthcoming within the family, young people will look for it from other, possibly less desirable, sources. By the end, Matt has learnt to stand up for himself but, by using his brain, gains a more effective revenge than any physical violence could have achieved.<br/><br/>I found it a powerful film and emerged decidedly shaken despite the slightly upbeat ending. I would like to see it again for two reasons; to view the first half of the film in a new light in knowledge of a revelation halfway through and to observe properly all the nuances of Elijah Wood's facial expressions."
"WBSlinger63","9","3","7","8 September 2005"," Hooligans
","Not many people in America are familiar with the nature of professional football. That is, World Cup football, or Professional Soccer. And yet no matter how little we know of it, ""Green Street Hooligans"" reveals that there are more similarities between the popular worldwide (other than the US) sport and many American sports are harshly recognized.<br/><br/>I had seen the film in its original title, ""Hooligans"", when it was released at the Tribeca Film Festival in April. Just before the film played, the audience was presented with a short presentation, with a warning by its director, Lexi Alexander (in her directorial debut), that the film portrayed the rivalries between clubs (Football team supporters) were made as realistic as possible, and very accurate. Right off the bat, in the first few minutes of the film, opposing football teams leave from a game, and face off in a bloody, painful fistfight that made me realize none of those involved would go out unscathed. The way the fight was portrayed, I could almost feel every blow to the face and every snap of bone. It was that real, and I honestly felt that Lexi had intended for every shot to be as shocking and as realistic as possible. In that level, she succeeded. <br/><br/>There are about six or seven fight scenes throughout the movie, and in all honesty, I must admit that I anticipated each one. Lexi has proved herself to be fearless, willing to show as much detail into the action as possible, no matter how graphic. The cinematography for the scenes was excellent, putting the audience right into the fray. <br/><br/>Now, as much as I can say about the fight scenes, the story itself was a little limited. The essential plot centers around Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood), a Journalism major (the details are a bit vague, mainly because I have not seen the film for 5 months) who was wrongfully kicked out for drug possession. He could fight back, defend himself and remain in school, but accepts his fate. He thus moves out to England, where his sister (Claire Forlani) dwells with her husband, Steve Dunham (Marc Warren). Steve has a brother named Pete (Charlie Hunnam), and it is he to whom Matt befriends and finds himself entering the very exciting and yet very violent world of football clubs. As expected, Matt begins to change in the course of the film, and he becomes far stronger than the way he was in the beginning of the film, his aggressions tapped and released fight after fight after fight. He gets more bruises, loses some teeth, and so far and so forth.<br/><br/>That is not to say I was bored. No no at all. I'm just saying that the story was not very impressive. It would not have pulled off without the effective performances of its lead actors. Woods has always been a strong performer, capable of holding lead roles ever since he was a child (The War), and of course in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. His portrayal of Matt, and the transformation of the character is strong and effective. We feel for Matt, and we also want him to succeed. Claire Forlani is also strong as Shannon, yet I could not help but notice her being pushed slightly aside throughout the film, her role diminished into nothing more as a minor character. <br/><br/>The actor that really pulls off one of the best performances I've seen this year would be no doubt Charlie Hunnam, who plays Pete Dunham. The man is rough, cruel, bloodthirsty, and yet positively likable, and it would not be without Charlie's charisma and effectiveness in portraying Charlie not as purely violent but (dare I say it) actually quite noble. I cannot see anyone else pulling off a better performance, and I hope to see more of Charlie in future lead roles. His performance was remarkable.<br/><br/>""Green Street Hooligans"" is a strong debut for Lexi Alexander, even with its shortcomings in terms of the story. Well, actually, that's not true. I did feel some sympathy for Matt, and I definitely cared for the relationships between the lead characters. Charlie and Steve's story is powerful, but the plot line involving Steve and an opposing club leader was brought in so late into the story that I could not help but wonder if the writers had added it in to deliberately add the final, and best, fight scene in the film.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is an excellent film, perhaps the best indirectly-sports-related film I've seen in a while. It's definitely one of the top movies I've seen all year so far."
"Rich B","6","3","7","27 August 2005"," Gritty, violent, stylish, poor lead accent and slightly weak opening performance from Wood
","Gritty, violent, stylish, but in no way does it glorify the lifestyle. The bad is shown to so heavily outweigh the good, and when people fight they get hurt. There's not that much good to be seen in the movie, but it is a very good movie, and I would think something which captures the feelings and beliefs of these groups of people very well.<br/><br/>The opening fight scene is pretty harsh, and I have to say the only ""enjoyable"" fight scene of the film. Now by enjoyable, I mean in a Hollywood entertainment sense, because the violence in this movie is so real, you don't want to think that it fits the standard Hollywood template of violence and glorify it in anyway, however this scene does slightly, and perhaps to grab the audience because hereafter you'll be shocked and uneasy.<br/><br/>The second fight scene of the movie deserves pointing out as well, because it combines some great filming effects and camera work to provide a different look to a scene shot so many times before. It's hand-held and close up, and these things are not my particular favourite in Hollywood fight scenes, because you miss so much you have to end up guessing what's happening, I wish they'd look more to Asian movie makers on how to do this right. However the style in this scene comes through with the use of a couple of effects which make the whole fight seem quite surreal, perhaps how the main character views it. It really gave some excitement and confusion to the scene, yet keeping the feeling of violence very real, and very nasty.<br/><br/>Now, onto perhaps two of the most controversial parts of the movie, and no, I've already talked about the fighting and that's not one of them. Firstly the casting of Elijah Wood as the American who discovers this world of Football Firms. Many people are saying that he just doesn't suit the movie, that he's totally out of place, well I agree but only to a point. Yes, for most of the film he's out of place, his laughing moments seem awkward, like those moments when you tell a joke and your foreign friend doesn't catch it but laughs anyway because everyone else does. You see, I think perhaps he is supposed to be looking totally out of place and awkward here, I mean he's come from Harvard and is a Journalist, why would that make him feel easy in amongst UK organised Football Hooligans? He has redemption though, in the final act of the film he faces a tough decision, and I really do believe it's from this point on that he comes into his element and gives a very good performance. Still, there is that stigma associated with his most famous role to date, and it's very prominent here. The ""fish out of water"" style and awkwardness is also easily taken as bad acting, that said I could be wrong and it could actually be bad acting! The second controversial part of the movie is something that perhaps only people in the UK will grab, Charlie Hunnam's accent. His cockney accent is pretty bad, there are moments when he settles into it, but there is a distinct feeling that he's over pronunciation much of what he's saying, particularly the Cockney inflections.<br/><br/>However, putting the accent to the side his performance is really good and very convincing, when you see him give an order, take control of a situation or in the midst of a fight, you believe who he is 100%. Without a doubt he appears strong and single minded, and a very violent character.<br/><br/>Yet for me, it's Leo Gregory that steals the screen. His performance as Bover is totally immersive and you're drawn to him on screen. If I remember Lexi Alexander, the Director and Writer, introduced him at the Q&A after the EIFF premiere as the UK's answer to Sean Penn, and you can see why. He has all those qualities that draw you to Penn. Let's hope he's recognised for it.<br/><br/>Both Marc Warren and Claire Forlani are just as convincing and give strong performances, I've always liked Warren as an actor and Forlani is a new find for me. These two have a good chemistry, although not all that you'd expect from a married couple, Forlani gives an emotional performance.<br/><br/>Geoff Bell as Hatcher, the leader of the Millwall Firm, is a true psycho. Totally broken and void of the understanding of morales, you can see he's consumed by complete hatred and anger. He just seemed such a real character and a truly scary man! The ideas of retribution, morales and karma are very strong throughout this movie. It's an example of how good the script is when you can understand the allure of the Firm for the character of Buckner, as well as see and understand the bonding between the members. It does a lot for the audience to help them understand the reasoning behind it all, and this is where I think the controversy for Hollywood lies. These are the parts that can be viewed as portraying a positive light on the Football Firms rather than the actual fighting, and it's not hard to see that. Yet I do think it's balanced by the retribution and karmic endings shown.<br/><br/>Overall a strong movie, although Wood's casting is very unusual and seems quite awkward during the first two acts of the film, coupled with the poor accent of the lead Englishman and there lie the negative aspects. The story, portrayal of the Firms and the violence itself all give for a strong and hard hitting movie, although perhaps more attractive to a British audience."

The PE teacher is a member of a football ""Firm"" called the GSE or Green Street Elite, named after the street on which Upton Park is situated, Upton Park being West Ham football club's home stadium.<br/><br/>Wood plays an American college student who visits his sister in London and soon becomes friends with a group of West Ham supporters who happen to be heavily involved in football violence. At first they don't accept this college-educated American outsider as one of their own, but once he convinces them that the Karate Kid movies are based on him, they treat him as one of their own.<br/><br/>Although he has never been in a fight before, Elijah beats the hell out of one guy from the Tottenham firm in his first ever fight. I found this pretty hard to believe. Not to mention other little things like the aftermath of a football riot outside Bank tube station. There are no football stadiums anywhere near Bank tube station, and on weekends this area is almost deserted because it's right in the middle of London's financial district.<br/><br/>The other thing I couldn't take seriously was the horrendous cockney accent of the other main character. It sounded like one of those South Park accents that are deliberately bad just for comic effect. Some people might think the accent isn't that important, but I think it is very important. No matter what he says he might as well be saying ""I'm not a cockney and I'm just reading a script"". It simply didn't work."

","i have seen all the films that have been made about the English football hooligan scene, they are all rubbish. The most realistic you can get to seeing how the 1980""s football gangs or firms dressed and went to the games is a 1 hour documentary called ""hooligan"",made in 1985 by Ian Studdard available from Amazon,on found on google. most of the lads had jobs,you needed money, spending £100,on a Saturday was no problem even 30 years ago. They were builders, electricians, ,waggon drivers, with the odd teacher,banker, a lot are self employed and earn big money; i know of a RAF fighter pilot who was arrested. At the beginning of the film when the 2 groups see each other on opposite sides of the train platform,in the film they stand shouting at each other,in reality they would have jumped onto the train lines and ran into each other fighting. when your at a home game you don't jump up and down on the tables in the pubs ,everyone is just talking,when away the jumping about happens usually because everyone is drunk .its not a planed thing..its probably the fight scenes that are filmed the worse,all the shouting and jumping, in reality if you are walking through a city on a away trip and you see a group of the home fans(only the lads wanting to fight not the ones with the scarves)the 2 groups would run straight at each other and start fighting,a few black eyes and sore legs from kicks.if you want to see the real 80""s you can probably see ""hooligan"" the documentary ,its about west ham,the same as this film, or look at you tube just type leeds v millwall ""fans"""
"son_of_cheese_messiah","2","2","4","14 April 2011"," RUCK! Hooliganism Hollywood-style
","Elijah Wood fails to convince as a potential hooligan by being far too effete and elfin. His presence reminds me somewhat of that Comic Strip parody of Hollywood's attempts at British issues, STRIKE! with Al Pacino playing Arthur Scargill.<br/><br/>(Actually the more I think about it the more this whole film resembles STRIKE! with a cartoon villain and an inspirational ending so perhaps the makers should have named this one RUCK! and have the queen turn up at the end to grant a general amnesty.)<br/><br/>The script is noticeably awkward. The attempt to make this appeal to American audiences makes it seem as if two different films have been stuck together; the American side of things focuses on Elijah's relationship with his sister and his briefly visiting father seeming to be shoe horned in simply to get Hollywood backing. The framing sequence, too, of a man unjustly expelled from Harvard who finds the courage to stand up for himself in the end, a story we've seen many times before, is likewise designed for American taste. <br/><br/>The other side is England in all its brutal glory. This is better but hardly well written. It does attempt to show hooligans as more than cardboard cut-outs, with their own brand of integrity and even as more intelligent than is sometimes given credit and it tries to explore the sense of exhilaration that a fight engenders and how addictive it is. But many details do not ring true, such as Elijah being allowed to play football with the kids (he would have to be police vetted these days to be allowed anywhere near them, unfortunately) or why they get off the train early (the emergency stop leaves them conveniently at another station) to avoid a gang only to travel to same place to fight them. The menacing Millwall thug with an axe to grind against ""the major"" is straight out of central casting. He implausibly beats up bystanders and burns a pub down without much reason. Worst of all is the dialogue, actually embarrassing in parts and the battle royale finale is very contrived a la Hollywood."

","First, let me say that I have never walked out of a movie theater because I hated the movie so much. Not even this one. This movie could be a masterpiece or a pile of feces depending on your point of view. Unfortunately, I seem to be one of those ignorant people who doesn't notice the nuances of gang violence cinematography, and I certainly don't think that hearing the F word 4 times a second is going to make this movie a hit. <br/><br/>Above all, the part that made this movie utterly laughable was the casting of Elijah Wood. Normally I like his movies, however, the idea that this scrawny little bitch of a college student is able to take on experienced, full grown, men in street fights is absolutely comical. I know the movie is about how even good clean college students can get roped into violence, but the only fight I would ever put money on Elijah wood winning is one against a preschooler...........a small one.<br/><br/>Finally let me say this. Soccer Hooliganism is not a good subject to make a movie about. I know that these kinds of things need to be brought to light, but that is what news stations and documentaries are for. The problem now is that since this movie wasn't a documentary, and it had famous actors, people that don't know the truth about Hooliganism think that every British soccer fan is in some sort of gang. I actually heard one of my American friends say ""You like to watch soccer?.... Why? Practically everyone who likes soccer is in a gang.""<br/><br/>I am an American, but have lived in Suffolk England for the past three years. I love soccer as much as anyone, the last thing we need to do is give America the impression that every soccer fan is a murderer.<br/><br/>If you don't agree with me, just look at the amount of money this crappy excuse for a movie made. It was on par with jumper! I think I'm going to make a machine that gives you a life refund because I want my 2 hours back."
"shockz9","2","2","4","20 November 2006"," Appears to be written for an American audience
","From the outset i was suspicious of this film; how exactly can Elijah Wood be expected to play a football thug? He has after all been typecast somewhat to the wimpish character of many of his recent films (Eternal Sunshine, LOTR). The opening scenes confirmed my suspicions. Without telling too much, there's violence and someone is head-butted into a phone box (a classic red one no less) which promptly falls over. Obviously realism was not of a worry for this film. From that point on the film only gets worse. Its not that the acting is terrible (though there are a few suspicious mockney accents in there), but the fact that a large degree of realism is required to broach a subject such as football violence and none is forthcoming. This film attempts to explain hooliganism with a need for comradeship and pride mixed in with the thrill of violence. This, as anyone who has real experience with hooliganism knows, is not the motivation for hooligans. There are no redeeming qualities to them and it is wrong to portray them as anything but violent criminals who obviously have issues. If you are looking to see a film about football violence that reflects real life and which you can take some degree of understanding of the people behind it then this is not a film for you. The Football Factory is a much more superior film and has the intelligence to not try to include a moral in the story, a mistake which was the yet another shortcoming in this film."

","I read the synopsis for Green Street and it wasn't immediately something that interested me, but I decided to check it out for the talent involved. Elijah Wood is great in the film, but I find it difficult seeing him as anything else other than Frodo Baggins. I am also a massive Charlie Hunnam fan ever since Sons of Anarchy, and he was my favourite part of Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen.<br/><br/>The characters in Green Street were all interesting, but my favourite was definitely Wood's character, Matt Buckner. He has the most defined arc in the film, transforming from an innocent University student to a hardcore gang member. The dialogue between Matt and Humman's character, Pete Dunham, was engaging.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the overall story isn't quite as strong as I would have liked it to be. This doesn't necessarily surprise me because it isn't the type of story I would usually gravitate towards, but I can see why some people would like it a lot more than I did. Thankfully, the characters were developed just enough that I didn't completely check out from the film.<br/><br/>I really liked the colour pallet, because many of the shots have a green tint to them. This really added to the grittiness, and made me have a more immersive experience.<br/><br/>Another negative towards the film is the direction. It's extremely poor, and this is especially noticeable in some of the action scenes and hand-to-hand combat. I couldn't see what was happening most of the time, and this was largely down to the abundance of shaky-cam.<br/><br/>Overall, Green Street isn't a great film and I wouldn't even quite call it a good film. However, the character interactions and the development of Matt meant that it didn't end up being a complete waste of my movie-watching time.<br/><br/>SCORE: 63%"

I was pleasantly surprised that someone finally got it right. None of us are hooligans. Football simply runs through our veins and the team we support is our life. You could never understand it unless you live it. Sometimes it's quite sad how much we take this sport so seriously, but other times, there is no feeling like it in the world. This film portrays the worst of the worst and some very sad truths.

","'Green Street Hooligans' is more than just a hilarious comedy movie, it's also a brilliant look at two very different cultures and ways of life. One being the violence driven world of football hooliganism, and the other the life of a middle class academic. It's a film that has just about everything - humour, violence, drama, romance, and much more. It is so much more than a comedy film and it pulls off everything it attempts.<br/><br/>While fights and violence account for a large portion of the film, it's the storyline and script that makes this film the classic that it is. Granted, a middle class American Harvard student finding himself in the English football hooliganism underworld is a pretty far-fetched scenario, but it does work and once you've got over the initial idea, 'Green Street Hooligans' is a hugely enjoyable film."

","This movie deserves a yellow card to anybody who watches it. Directed by Lexi Alexander, this movie really had potential to be, really good. However, the film leaves its audience with bitter taste in their mouth. The movie tells the story of an American journalism student, Matt Buckner (Elijah Woods), whom is framed for drug use by his far more socially powerful roommate and thus expelled from Harvard. Fleeing to England to be with his sister, Shannon Dunham (Claire Forlani) and her family. Matt finds himself involved with the local violent football AKA soccer firm when Shannon's husband's brother, Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) came for a visit. Matt quickly builds a reputation within the firm, to the point, that Matt's well-concealed past, started to be a big problem for them. Sooner than later, Matt's involvement within the firm, start to create grudges. Can the firm find a way to keep their reputation intact or will the violence within the firm, spill blood into the street? Watch the movie to find out, if you want to. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this is a nice introduction to the violent underground world of football hooliganism. You really get to learn, a lot about English sport culture with it. Still, the movie had to do, some artistic license when it came to the sport. A good example is the fact that hooliganism doesn't really happen, as much as it used to. While, football hooliganism has been a growing concern in some other European countries in recent years, British football fans now tend to have a better reputation abroad. The United Kingdom has really led a major crackdown on football-related violence. In the year in which, this movie was made, the outbreaks of violence involving fans was far rarer than they were 20 or 30 years ago. Some of the reasons why, is because the higher cost of watching a football game, and the more sophisticated policing. Things, this film rarely mention. Honestly, where in the hell, are the members of the firm, getting their money to watch nearly all these games in the film? The film never explains it. Another is, how in the hell, were these men, not getting caught? They were, clearly seem on security camera. The film makes great use of that, so how is that not possible? Anyways, the movie makes you, had to suspense your disbelief, even more, when some of the football teams, they played against, don't really played. A good example is that match between West Ham & Birmingham City. They weren't even in the same division. It would have been impossible for the two clubs to play league games against each other during that season. Plus, no football team in the world plays two games in two days. At first, the football club of West Ham welcome the film-makers, at their Upton Park ground; as they were under the impression that the film was celebrating the glorious game and its fanatical supporters, but once they realized the film's true take on the subject. The team disassociated themselves from the project. This is why, there weren't anymore, stadium footage, besides the first game. Another problem that the movie has, is how it was full of errors in geography. It really became jarring to see London's locations, being portray as Manchester's locations. I guess, the filmmakers of the film really didn't care, that people can tell the different. Another thing that didn't work was the film's message. The film tries to convey that you need to know when to stand your ground and when to run away. Perhaps it does, but the over glorious of stupid violence is a bit jarring to watch. After all, there were little to no strong reason, why these people should hate each other. It wasn't like, them, were fighting for some type of strong social cause. It was about, their moronic reputation. Honestly, I don't know, what's worse, people endangering themselves, over nothing or the fact, they endangering their own family over something really stupid. While, the action was cool, I really don't get, how that a 'stand your ground' moment. It's even more apparent, that violence is frequently an easy way to solve one's problems, rather than taking the gentleman's route in this film. It really questionable. While, I can never understand, their drive. I have to say, the majority of the characters, here, are somewhat likable, however, some more than others for me. At first, I love Elijah Woods as the naïve outsider, but toward the end, I just couldn't bare; seeing him on screen, when the majority of the problems throughout the film is cause by his own stupidity. I really didn't like the movie gave him, the only happy ending, and everybody else, tragic ones. It was not bittersweet at all. Another actor that seem to shine, was Charlie Hunnam as the enigmatic gang leader. I really do believe, that this role, allow Hunnam to gain the lead role in the critically acclaimed FX TV Series Sons of Anarchy, because how amazing, he was, here. However, some of the English men's highly questionable crockery accent, felt like a serious flaw. I really can't understand what they were saying, most of the time. This movie really needed subtitles at times. This film did received a sequel, but it has little to connection to the original film. In my opinion, it's not a good watch. Overall: While, this sport hooligan culture movie reach its goal in entertaining me. I was really disappointed, in how the movie ends and resulted in mixed messages. I do recommended watching, but if I had, my choice of watching this, over American football. I would had to choose, the latter."

A big shame as this takes a lot away from the film. Perhaps, for those not familiar with London accents, this may not be such an issue. (Since watching I've found that this has been a major point of criticism). <br/><br/>It's refreshing that the story is presented without over-moralising. There is a hint of twee-ness in places but I found it to be at a level that's acceptable - after all, its a work of fiction not a pseudo- documentary.

Nothing much different from other 'firm' flicks but the added plot of Yankee Wood who slowly fits in against his UK based sisters wishes and grows to enjoy the lifestyle.<br/><br/>No one really that well known in the film accept Wood who is TOTALLY out of place in this type of flick but I guess that's the idea right.

(This weekend, I saw all 3 Green Street movies back to back)<br/><br/>I liked that the fight scenes were not for a few seconds or they don;t go on for too long,<br/><br/>I liked the story of the plot, how some can be drawn into this world<br/><br/>A Long with that we. have father who wants revenge that goes to far also we have betrayal as well and some heartache added into the mix.<br/><br/>It kind of a bit moving at times and little sad at the end of the movie, some may even say it be tearjerker ending .<br/><br/>Great acting from the cast, some make up effect, which makes fight look real! 8 out of 10"
"henryhudson123","7","0","0","31 January 2014"," A decent watch but can't say its brilliant...
","Personally, I very much enjoyed watching this film although I must admit that it is not a superb piece. As mentioned many times, the accents were far from brilliant and some of the below-standard acting at points in the film prevented it from receiving a higher rating. I thought the idea of a naïve American joining a high-profile football firm was ludicrous for a film that is intended to be quite a sinister piece of cinema.<br/><br/>One particular highlight was the ending which I thought was excellent. If they had not got the ending right then this could have become a bit of a farcical film. I very much liked the fight scenes in the film.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to football fans that appreciate a good fight scene."

","One of my friends told me about the movie based on Hooligans. I was not sure what kind of movie it's gonna be but in a first 10 minute you will get to know what you are about to see. Little about the movie Elijah Wood's character gets kicked out of Harvard for a drug offence he didn't commit. He flies to London to visit his sister and quickly gets caught up in a small group of West Ham United supporting hooligans called the Green Street Elite. This is just a start and for the rest you have to see yourself. This movie deserve lot of audience i will recommend it to every football fan or every one who ever love any sports. Overall this movie is for everyone. It will show you the dark side of human nature and hard side of a football fans. All i can say this is the best under this genre.<br/><br/>Please go and watch this movie and when you come back i can bet u will be singing ""Forever Blowing Bubbles"" So better watch out this one as this movie has a lot of potential to entertain you."

","To be honest I didn't think i would enjoy this film at all because of all the violence, i figured it might be a bit like rise of the foot soldier which was way too violent for me but this film was amazing, obviously it had little flaws which have been pointed out in the 'goofs' section but it still worked, the characters were all likable, except 'bovver' who i really hated and you could see the passion they had for their team, i would definitely recommend this movie to football fans. It just proves that quote i remember hearing years ago 'Some people believe football is a matter of life and death, I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it is much, much more important than that'. Could not agree more with that quote."
"KineticSeoul","6","0","0","8 July 2012"," Toughening up and standing your ground
","Now after watching this movie I still think soccer or football hooligans are bogus and one of the most stupid groups of gangs. But this movie is still entertaining because of the gritty and realistic way they are portrayed and the street fight scenes are actually entertaining. This ain't no kung-fu choreographed style fighting either. Now when it comes to soccer/football hooligans they are just pointless and the less of the less in the gang world, at least some legit gangsters make profit although what they are doing is completely wrong. But even after watching this movie I don't see the motive in being a soccer/football hooligan except wanting to fit into a group. And act like bunch of tough guys, and that is what this movie is. Now the hooligans portrayed in this movie has balls, loyalty and companionship. But when it comes down to it, it's basically a big penis measuring competition but the direction it goes makes it entertaining although pointless. And some of the hooligans seem like losers and pointless, but also somewhat cool at the same time. Pete Dunham(Charlie Hunnam) comes to mind, Charlie Hunnam just gives off this badass vibe who is in a crappy group. He is a aggressive and rebellious character but he also has loyalty and morals. But he becomes a motorcycle gang member in ""Sons of Anarchy"" TV show with his future role. And he actually plays a cool pretty boy in a group of somewhat intimidating motorcycle gang that actually has some motives. Matt Buckner(Elijah Wood) is in this and the guy is a complete pushover and most of the plot is about him toughening up bit by bit after joining the hooligans through Pete. And he played his character in a believable manner, he was just perfect for this role. And I totally bought into him starting out as a weak pushover to something else. Anyways if you want to watch a group of youngsters acting like wannabe badass in a entertaining manner with some gritty fight scenes this one just might be for you. Despite it revolving around hooligans it's actually pretty entertaining flick.<br/><br/>6.8/10"

","I'm not going to do a literary critique here, I'm just going to say how realistic, poignant a compelling this was.<br/><br/>Fifteen year ago I was that boy, behind the West Ham goals, as they played Nottingham Forrest. Apparently it was a friendly match - not that I could tell.<br/><br/>I was taken there by a couple of lawyer friends who thought it would be a good wheeze to show an Australian what a real football match was. Trust me the film did not do it justice - how could they, its so full on as to be unbelievable.<br/><br/>Its not just shouting and singing, its whole crowd body movements and chanting. Needless to say after I had been clouted around the head a few times by those behind me for saying stupid things like ""WOW! that was an amazing goal"" (when the other team scored and everyone around me was in complete silence - and I was still shouting of course - such a dork). My friends kept telling everyone around us that ""It's alright he's an Australian!"". Everyone got friendly and kept trying to tell me how to behave.<br/><br/>The one thing that I missed in this film was the press on the train platforms and the access tunnels. My wife and I personally witnessed an old German man get beaten trying to protect his wife who had fallen over in the press. He was hysterical, and had lost the use of English before he disappeared under a flurry of fists. Not because anyone had anything against him, or indeed that anyone knew what was going on, but simply because he turned on the crowd in an attempt to prevent his wife from being crushed. There is really something animalistic with these matches.<br/><br/>I have also watched, at different times on different matches, the police, on mass, arrest people arriving to an away match in London, disappearing with their arrested charges and those commuters left behind finding that the platforms have gone from all but empty to so seriously crowded that those not moving with the crowd were in very real danger of falling onto the tracks.<br/><br/>Anyway, this film took me straight back to fifteen years ago. Its an amazing reproduction. I am not aware of such an accurate portrayal of the various ""firms"". Highly watchable, compelling and engaging."

","By first... I was kinda reluctant to watch this movie, don't ask, because I dunno know why. Then I've watched it. Well, at first it looks like Elijah Wood (don't remember the character name right now) is just a really pathetic ''yankee'', who seems to be overprotected in his past... and of course, as you see, is a good person to mess with. Then it comes the part of discrimination from England guys, this kinda ''football gangsters'', a ''really not much helping'' sister, her ''arrogant'' and ''over-reacting'' England husband (well... Claire Forlani - the sister - is in fact English, not American, weird), and a poor young baby of them. In this general flash of the very beginning, you can see a weird movie. Then suddenly becomes interesting, you can see how pathetic is nationalism and racism in every each and single way, and makes you understand what it really is: a way of control. England vs. Northamerica, gangsters vs. other football gangs, friends betrayed... a lot of violence. It's good the message it leaves: not to trust anyone and not to mess with that people. But... at least, they are back for each other and stand when there's a challenge or a fight or whatever... what our ''yankee'' guy (don't misunderstand me, I'm not being racist, hate that word, I'm only emphasizing this word because of the movie itself) understands and learns how to protect himself and what real friendship means (another could be... the best friend is not who shares his room with you, could be... is who never leaves you alone)... good movie after all... what I need to say, because I noted quickly (as a lot of people...) is the credits... Elijah Wood is the ''well-known'' there... but he's the last actor to appear in the list... so... you know, you can note there the ''english nationalism''... hehe, ironic world. Don't take this review as a way of racism please, just intended to be realistic. Liked the movie anyway, of course. Well done, good story-telling, believable characters, believable suffering..."

","Green Street is one of these films that is just good. The fight scenes are great, very raw and straight to it. The acting is surprisingly good, and the cinematography is actually quite good as well. As some others have said, you need to like fight films or you're probably not going to like this one. Think Fight Club and Boondock Saints. Some bloody stuff here and there but it ain't too bad mate, just be ready for it. Enjoyable movie start to finish, with a good performance by Wood. It was quite cool to get a glimpse of football life in the UK. The locations were good, with the pubs nice. Some nice twists in the movie, but not too much just stupid stuff. My recommendation: It's a definite see, even if just to say you have."
"josejtapia","8","0","0","18 December 2009"," Great because of originality, weird because of Elijah. Worth renting.
","Just finished watching the DVD, and after watching a bunch of stupid movies this one really exceeded my expectations. I don't think a mainstream(-ish) movie has been made about this subject, but I think it deserves praise because I otherwise wouldn't know anything about football/soccer in England. I don't know if the underground of London is really like this factually, but it seemed very believable.<br/><br/>As the movie starts out, the editing is a little weird, and it feels like it could have been technically finessed. This feeling carries out through the rest of the movie, with unnecessary cuts and changes in angles, but it certainly subsides in the 2nd and definitely last act. The first fight scene gave me the same cathartic emotions I should have experienced watching Fight Club, and for that, I love this movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography isn't anything to shake a stick at, but I still noticed watching on a DVD on my laptop that things were occasionally out of focus. But I won't complain about all the long lenses used, because it was a good look. And the fight scenes made me feel like I was fighting.<br/><br/>The script was pretty good with structure and plot I think, because the adrenaline scenes come out of nowhere, and are a crazy surprise that involves the viewer. It was awesome to say the least. Then there were a few awkward lines of dialogue, which could be excused, but Elijah just seems to get them wrong. The British actors are all great, and even Claire Forlani as Elijah's sister. But something didn't feel right about Elijah's character: he would be a tough guy one minute and your friend the next. I would say he should work on his delivery of the lines, or maybe they are just bad lines altogether which don't fit his character. Either way, this is a major flaw in the film, because I feel the director and Elijah could have kept track of his emotions and thoughts as the film progressed, instead of playing the character at face value. Or perhaps Elijah was just miscast.<br/><br/>All in all, the events in the film are very well executed, and you must lend large credit to the writers, the action choreographers, and the British actors, who are too much fun to watch. This film is very accessible to a wide audience, and won't disappoint anyone who is looking for a slightly profound film as well."
"RainDogJr","9","0","0","17 July 2009"," ""I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles""; Lexi Alexander's film is certainly not a masterpiece but surely a personal favourite
","After the Lord of the Rings trilogy Elijah Wood's first acting credit was in Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine but the first time I saw Elijah after that great trilogy was in Sin City, and the second time in Lexi Alexander's Hooligans (aka: Green Street Hooligans) back in December 2005 (in that year, 2005, Elijah participated in 3 films, having the main role in 2, and the 3, Sin City, Everything Is Illuminated and this one, are truly favourites of mine). I remember seeing parts of Hooligans at my former school and on TV but just yesterday I finally saw again in its entirely (got its R4 DVD last week for like $2, and as bonus material on that DVD there's only a 4 or so minutes interview with Elijah that ends with him sending greetings to his Mexican fans) and I say finally since back in 2005 I loved it, actually just as much as I did yesterday. <br/><br/>Elijah Wood was a good choice: he plays Matt Buckner, Harvard student, great Harvard student, former Harvard student at the beginning of the film actually. He was really close to finish the journalism career yet his roommate, his cocaine-addict roommate from a powerful family I guess I don't have to go on. So at the beginning of the film we have the Matt that didn't fought at all in order to try not to get expelled from Harvard few months before getting the diploma and at the end the one that decided to fight to get his ticket back to Harvard after he spend some time in London (yeah! He took the 10 grand of the cocaine- addict and practically will end with him). The title of the film says all certainly, Matt's sister (lovely Claire Forlani) lives in London and she is married to the brother (Marc Warren) of the current leader of the Green Street Elite (Charlie Hunnam is Pete Dunham), the firm of the East London club West Ham United <br/><br/>Words of Pete: ""West Ham United, mediocre football, topnotch firm. Arsenal, great football sh*t firm. Tottenham, sh*t football and sh*t firm"". Certainly there's some rejoice for football fans like myself, I mean the love for that great sport is certainly present. The film sure is typical not only because we have in Matt the outsider who likes baseball better than football, the ""Yank"" (""for f*** sake stop saying soccer!"") who will enter to the world of the firms and gain the respect of even the one that was always the hard member of the firm (Leo Gregory plays Bovver) but also because we have all the other typical elements, you know journalism is the thing that will put Matt in real problems with the members of the firm when he is already part of them (and that leads to the most dramatic part of the film), with the brother of Pete we have the character that once was part of the world of the firmsI guess I don't have to go on. Yet I'm OK this time with the typical elements (but I must say the music choice was not the best, especially that song in the fight of the GSE against the Millwall hooligans), Hooligans is simply a personal favourite, certainly not a masterpiece, it's just a terrific piece of entertainment with terrific acting (hey that actor that plays Matt's father sort of look at times like De Niro)... I'm forever blowing bubbles, pretty bubbles in the air!"

","I was in Amsterdam a few months ago. I was walking the streets and noticed the police searching young men as they entered a particular street. I asked a cop what was going on. He told me that it was football night. Excited, I continued down the street onto Rembrandtplein (Rembrandt Plaza) and found myself in the middle of about 150 enthusiastic football supporters. They were chanting, drinking lots of beer and having a great time, just like in the movie. I asked one guy what team I should be supporting so I won't get my ass kicked. He got in my face and yelled ""Ajax"" (which he pronounced ""Iyax"" due to his thick Dutch accent)! They were all jumping up and down and giving me the finger as I snapped pictures of the wild mob.<br/><br/>A couple of supporters approached me and asked, ""where are you from?"" (with a very think Dutch accent). I told them that I was from Texas.<br/><br/>""Texas - f*cking Texas?"" he replied, ""f*cking excellent! Later, I was told by a few guys to ""shoot at your own risk."" I told him that I was returning to my room to put my camera up. He then added, ""come back."" I had a few beers with the crowd and had one hell of a time. I don't know if these guys beat the hell out of opposing supporters like the British football supporters do or like the GSE in the movie, but all the pubs in Amsterdam Centrum closed early that night out of fear of a riot.<br/><br/>All in all, I really liked these guys because as I told the supporters that I met, ""you guys seem like the only real men who will fight if your backs were against the wall. I admire that."" AJAX - FOREVER!!!"

","I thought this film was an interesting take on the darker side of football. It did make me empathise with the characters, and was well shot and acted. My one criticism was that at the end of the film I wasn't convinced by the lesson it was trying to teach. I thought it deserved a 7 out of 10 however because it was a relatively original subject, for me at least, and I was convinced by the acting. I thought I would find Elijah Wood annoying in the lead role, but he actually did a great job - definitely a good attempt to get away from the Frodo image!<br/><br/>If you like football then I'd recommend watching this, and if you don't know anything about football do give it a go but please bear in mind that not all fans are like this!"

","Hands down one of the best British films in the last decade, right up there with the likes of Trainspotting and This Is England. Green Street Hooligans takes you to the old firms of English football clubs, and while the portrayal may not be 100% realistic, it is the story telling that counts, and female director Lexi Alexander does an amazing job. The fight scenes were beautifully shot, and the message conveyed was excellent.<br/><br/>It is not often where a movie is not only wonderfully directed, but also paired up with fantastic acting. This is one of those cases. Everyone in the movie was extremely convincing in their roles, especially the GSE (Green Street Elites), most notably Marc Warren (The Repairman from Wanted), Charlie Hunnam (as Pete, the GSE leader), and Geoff Bell (as Tommy Hatcher, leader of the Millwall firm). Geoff was only in a handful of scenes but his presence is amazing, he completely dominates on the screen. He is genuinely frightening. Throughout the movie there is a fair amount of banter (jokes) towards ""Yanks"", but one line truly stood out as the ultimate diss: Pete insists that they are not gangs, but firms (hooligans actually), they do not drive around with guns and shooting at 8 year old little girls.<br/><br/>The ending was a nice touch as well. Lexi Alexander has really outdone herself and hopefully she is involved with more projects in the future. Her directing style has a slight resemblance to Danny Boyle, both of them have a talent for showcasing stylish action scenes, and engrossing storytelling ability. Green Street Hooligans is a must watch for anyone interested in the footballing hooligan scene back in the 80s and 90s."
"xyzanduknome","10","0","0","18 February 2009"," Best movie ever!
","Definitely a favorite of mine. I first watched this movie with my sister and her then boyfriend. My thoughts were that it was going to be a stupid movie, because honestly it sounds stupid. A gang of soccer lovers who beat each other up and then an American who joins them. Honestly it sounds boring, but i was immediately drawn in from the very beginning, with the GSE fighting the Yids. Charlie Hunnam did an amazing job portraying the character Pete Dunham. It was almost like i was watching a reality show. I think that all of the acting was so real, and so great. The relationship between all of the guys in the GSE is supposed to be like they're brothers,and that is what was shown to the viewer. They looked like they had grown up together and it made those moments so much better. Green Street Hooligans is a great movie. It captures the viewers attention from the first lines, up until the last. There are very few movies that i could watch over and over again and not get sick of. Green Street is one of those movies. At first it took me a while to understand what the English people were saying, because i was not fully familiar with their accent, but now i have seen it so many times, i know most of the words. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone. Even if you aren't into fighting or soccer. I personally am not into either, but i love it. The language is another thing that people probably don't like about this movie. It is rated R for a reason, and I think that without the foul language, it wouldn't be as realistic, because honestly what kind of gang doesn't swear? In all, great movie, and i think everyone should watch it."

","What can a hooligan do for his football (soccer) team? You will know this after watching Green Street Hooligans. The film is quite engaging, you will be happy with London- vocabulary, so you will learn something from English language. The hooligan- culture is described identically: the ways to the matches, hierarchy, who is against whom. But a big minus in the movie is that after a fight of two enemy groups the fighters have only broken noses. Sometimes, you would say that they have to have broken skull. But you will not see this... I personally did not like the slowing- down and shaking camera (especially during fights), from which shots you do not see anything! The story is good except of the son- father plot.

","What an amazing movie. Charlie Hunnam and Elijah Wood were incredible in this film about friendship, honor, and knowing when to stand your ground, and when to walk away. One of my favorite aspects of the film was how most of it was focused on the violence of the Football Firms. It didn't butter it up for views. Instead they left the raw, in-your-face intensity that hooligans are known for, in the movie. It was really a focal point of how completely bashing another firm wasn't simply because they hated each other, but strictly from a respect point of view (with a few exceptions) The story of Matt Buckner really puts into a perspective about how a person in a new place, only knowing a few people, will do anything to be excepted.<br/><br/>Overall I would give this movie a 9/10 for a great story, a great theme, and some great one liners from Charlie Hunnam.

","Hooligans is a very good sports movie but considerably more than just a sports movie. Elijah Wood plays Matt, a retiring, actually cowardly, Harvard student who is expelled just weeks before he is set to graduate because he is blamed for the possession of drugs that his roommate has hidden in his closet. Even though his father is a world-famous journalist who would have surely been able to save his college career, Matt chooses to slink away with his tail between his legs. He goes to England where his older sister lives with her husband and new baby. Matt's brother-in-law has a brother - Pete, play by Charlie Hunnam - who is a brute of a man. Through circumstance, Matt is given over to Pete's ""care"" on his first evening in England.<br/><br/>Pete takes Matt to the local pub where his football firm meets before each game. It seems that a football firm is just another name for a gang, but instead of using guns and knives as gangs do in the United States, the firm uses fists and blunt objects to enforce their territorial rights. There is a point made in the film by the members of the firm that they disdain the violence of gangs in the United States because - by using guns and knives - their encounters are not ""honorable."" They, instead, inflict ""honorable"" injuries - broken bones, concussions, bruises, lacerations, etc. upon their rivals.<br/><br/>The amazing fact about the members of the firm is that they are all ""upright"" citizens holding down respectable jobs and nurturing families. Pete is depicted to be a caring teacher. But when it comes to football, these ""ordinary guys"" turn into unbelievable monsters.<br/><br/>Matt, who has spent his life thus far as a repressed academic, is totally bowled over and entranced by the excitement created by these men in the bar before and during the football game. After the game, Matt is attacked by members of another football firm. Pete and the rest of his firm show up and insist upon revenge. Matt, at first, just tries to get away, but then is drawn into the violence and comes to the realization that he is able to inflict punishment upon his rivals - a feeling totally new to him.<br/><br/>Matt becomes a true member of the firm - much to the chagrin of his sister and brother-in-law. All of this plays out to expose complex relationships between Matt, his relatives, and the members of his own and a rival football firm that lead to tragic events.<br/><br/>Hooligans might have been just your standard coming-of-age story had it not been immersed in the world of hooligans. A look at a fascinating, albeit scary, sub-culture, exciting sports scenes, excellent acting, and superior directing make this film much more that ""standard."""

He unintentionally gets involved with the Green Street Elite (GSE), a football firm led by Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunman). After a violent encounter with a rival firm at his first match, Matt is plunged into a world where violence is commonplace. Things take a turn for the worst when GSE member Bovver (Leo Gregory) discovers that Matt's father is a journalist, a profession that is hated by all football thugs, and Matt is presumed to be an undercover reporter. Disliking Pete's trust in Matt, Bovver alerts rival firm leader Tommy Hatcher (Geoff Bell) to the presence of his worst enemy, ex-GSE leader The Major (Marc Warren) at West Ham dominated pub The Abbey. A violent battle ensues in which The Major is stabbed in the neck with a bottle and Bovver is consumed with guilt. A fight is then organised to settle the West Ham/Milwall conflict forever. During the battle, Pete is brutally beaten to death by Hatcher and Matt leaves for America.<br/><br/>Despite the extreme violence and choice language, Green Street is a poignant journey into the ruthless world of football hooliganism.

It even went ways I would not have foreseen : there IS one death in the end, but not the one I had foreseen, and not in the way I had predicted. Also, though highly indifferent to anything soccer so I can't tell if it's true, I liked how they showed that those hooligans are in fact functional, hold jobs, but are addicted to violence and the men bonding that results. BUT (Possible spoilers) The ending left me wondering, as it seems to be gloryfying petty, ugly violence as a way of life. Do you really learn anything from hanging with a crowd of drunken louts fighting for the most stupid reason, if they need one ? Then going into ""Rumble Fish"" territory with an ex-member who comes back for more ? I understand the director  who did an excellent job  is a woman and an ex-fighter. As an ex-martial arts practicionner myself who hates violence (those who tried martial arts will understand that it's not contradictory), I'd think she'd know better. And the revenge angle in the last minutes felt more like a Hollywood convention. Yes, he did not beat the crap out of the other guy, but went out with aforementioned drunken louts' hymn, for Pete's sake ! Don't know. It's a good movie, with powerful performances and a few contrievance, but I guess I liked ""The football factory"" better. It showed how those louts don't even need football as an excuse, crass violence is all those hooligans losers need"

","For the purist there is plenty not to like about this film, such as the police always turning up late, the easy way in which an inter city train is stopped, and the way in which people recover so quickly from brawls and hangovers.<br/><br/>However, I have live in the area depicted for all of my life (over 50 years), and the film accurately portrays the way in which seemingly decent and well educated people can be pulled into gang warfare.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood's performance was a revelation for me, but the British supporting cast is excellent and I hope we see a lot more of Charlie Hunnam who is on form throughout.<br/><br/>The film is tightly directed and a must see for anyone interested in understanding one of Britain's less publicised sub cultures."

","Green street hooligans is a very powerful and true movie that portrays the life of being a football hooliganism and being in a firm (Mainly this film is based on football hooliganism as a West Ham fan). This film is brutal but is a very realistic view behind this scary world. It describes how being a football hooligan is like being in war and your that soldier fighting for you land or team. What makes this film better is the fact that there is drama in this film as well as brutal violence. Comparing this film to the football factory I would think that this film is better because football factory looks a the comedic side of being a football hooligan and there is no funny side at beating the living hell out of each other. I highly recommend you watch this film! ****/***** 9/10"

","At last a film about football related 'hooliganism' that does the subject matter justice and gets to the heart of the matter while remaining entertaining and thoroughly watchable.<br/><br/>For those who experienced the adrenalin filled years of the clashes of the seventies and eighties and who felt totally let down by the likes of ID and The Football Factory give this film a try. Its the closest thing yet.<br/><br/>Surely its time now for a period piece going back to those pre-segregation days when the truly tribal nature of the English game and the battles inside the grounds over pride and concrete terraced territory were at their height?"

","Lexi Alexander fails to create a good, strong, realistic film about the lifestyles of football hooligans in London's East Side. In America it might have worked well, but I doubt many British viewers, especially ones who have a half-decent knowledge of football hooliganism, would be impressed.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film is the fighting. Yes, sometimes it does look good, and can be brutal. But it's way too glitzy, too choreographed. You don't get a real sense of ferocity, or adrenaline, when watching this. Anyone who's seen a firm fight will know that these guys don't hit each other with clean, crisp punches, it's actually really scrappy. Also, I feel the ending of the big finale looked a bit stupid; not only did the members of GSE and Bushwhackers stop, but they even crowded round in a circle and bow their heads (Bit like the end of West Side Story. really).<br/><br/>I felt sorry for the two main actors. Elijah Wood was an... interesting decision, and he did try his best with what he was given. Unfortunately, no matter how hard he tried, he always looked like a rabbit caught in the headlights. Charlie Hunnam's entire performance (which is actually quite good) of the GSE's new head boy Pete is overshadowed by his dodgy, all-over- the-place accent. If the stories are true though, Alexander is to blame for that as she fired his dialect coach early into filming. On the upside on the acting front, Leo Gregory gives a great performance as the cynical, loose canon member of the GSE, Bovver. He definitely looks the part, and gives the character a real gritty depth.<br/><br/>Unlike many football hooligan films, this one attempts to inject a plot and some morality into it. Which is fine, but just doesn't work with this.<br/><br/>It's not a bad, BAD film, but it's nowhere near perfect, and the fact it fails to be realistic to the culture sadly makes it worse. If you want a more accurate, grittier, down-to-earth and realistic film, watch ""The Football Factory""."
"Cuddleworthy","5","0","0","2 August 2007"," What a waste of...something
","This movie did have a certain je ne sais quoi that appealed and made me want to see it again, but it's quite hard to put your finger on what seeing as how the leading actor is in nearly every scene yet he's not only horribly miscast but delivers a poor performance to say the least, and the story in itself, the ending in particular, makes you grasp for words beyond ridiculous. The violence is portrayed in an extremely brutal and stylistic manner, and there's camera work and settings to be proud of here. Charlie Hunnam does his supposedly best with what he's got, the rest of the cast sways between decent and unintentionally comic.<br/><br/>Green Street works purely as entertainment light, mostly glorifying firms and casual lifestyle in a manner a kid would, and would probably have been spared a bit of embarrassment should they have chosen to leave out the unnecessary narrating by Elijah Wood. He pulled off a decent job in the Lord of the Rings-trilogy, though I'd call it torture if his one expression, nervous stare, would have been featured a second more, but here he falls short simply because there's nothing believable about him. I'm sure the ludicrous script didn't help.<br/><br/>I do feel this movie could have worked on more levels, would the producers have cared to find a story worth telling and either left the lead acting to Charlie Hunnam or someone else more worthy.<br/><br/>Ít also works very well as a 109 minute long commercial for Stone Island-jackets and other casual brands, as I got loads of tip for what I'm filling my wardrobe with this autumn."

","I had a few hang-ups about this film before I'd actually seen it. Firstly, the casting of Elijah Wood as a violent football hooligan seemed a little strange, as well as a million miles away from middle earth. Secondly, I had an issue with the whole idea of giving so much attention to such a horrible facet of the sport.<br/><br/>However, having sat down to watch this film I was pleasantly surprised. Yes there are a few wooden moments, but overall I enjoyed the acting. The way in which the actors portrayed their characters as irresistible rogues was really top draw, and I was pleased that Lexi Alexander didn't try to sugar coat the whole world of the football firms. The fight scenes are certainly not for the screamish, with blood and gut a plenty, but I found the rawness of these scenes compelling.<br/><br/>As for Wood, I think he is helped by the excellent performance of Charlie Hunnam, but he still pitches in a sturdy performance. However, the sight of the Iowa born actor, downing pints of lager and belching football songs down at the local, was a bit odd to watch.<br/><br/>All in all, I would certainly recommend this movie to any fan of this growing genre, as films such as The Football Factory, fall massively such of this rugged depiction of life in the football firms."

","Although Elijah Woods is as likely a hooligan as Mother Teresa, it did manage to be a really great film!

It is more then worth a trip to the video store, and would have even been worth seeing in the theater. The 'buddy' films in the past were full of cheesy plots, but this is one that will offer a North American viewer, a good look at the English version of a tailgate party is done. I am not one to rewatch many movies, but I would sit and watch this again in a heart beat.

","First off, I don't mind if a movie does not have a ""message""---I don't think it needs to, and frequently very good movies don't.<br/><br/>That said, I cannot help feeling that this movie tried to convey a message, and that that message is complete and utter nonsense.<br/><br/>An innocent intellectual American kid gets involved with a bunch of British hooligans, and learns a number of character lessons, stuff about standing up for yourself and knowing when to walk away etc. So far so good.<br/><br/>But what about the biggest lesson in all of this, the big elephant in the room that does not seem to get a lot of attention from either the movie nor its main character---viz. that these people are hurting, maiming, and killing each other for no reason whatsoever, other than their misguided fanaticism for groups of entertainment millionaires, an adolescent sense of pride, and apparently an utter lack of anything actually worthwhile to do with their time and energy instead? As I said, I didn't necessarily expected the movie to go on moralizing about this, but seeing it glorify this total waste of time, energy, attention, and life was somewhat annoying. Senseless, idiotic violence perpetrated to the tune of fast-paced pop music? I am afraid this ain't no A Clockword Orange, and Lexi Alexander ain't no Kubrick, either.<br/><br/>The scene that to me sums up the intellectual failing of this movie is the following. One guy, who ""raised his son to be a pit bull"", who brought that teenage son to these fights with other gangs of hooligans, and whose son got killed in one of them, harbors this deep grudge against the leader of the gang they fought while his son got killed. I guess everyone here would see some suboptimal parenting skills as at least partially responsible for the young man's fate---had he not been born to this moronic thug whose main pastime was getting into fights with others like him etc.<br/><br/>At some point, another character points out to him that his son's death is his own fault. You think: ""Finally someone says it."" Unfortunately, he then follows it up with his personal analysis of the father thug's failing---he did not protect his son enough during the fight. Sigh.<br/><br/>Anyway, despite the somewhat inadequate central thesis that seems to underpin the movie, it's actually quite enjoyable. The acting is great all around, but to me Charlie Hunnam absolutely steals the show. Not only is he stunningly good-looking, he plays the role of the gang leader with incredible charm and complexity---if you had to be beaten up by a hooligan, it should be one like that. The film-making is more than adequate---screenwriter, photographer, and director do their best to make the actors shine, as is their job. From that perspective it's a decent movie, in spite of its other shortcomings."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Not sure how I missed this the first time around, but it was recommended by a friend and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The fight scenes seem very realistic, but this film is more about man's need to be apart of something ... even something that might not necessarily make sense if one were to step back and analyze.<br/><br/>The acting is surprisingly strong with Elijah Wood, Charlie Hunnam, Lee Gregory and Claire Forlani delivering performances usually only seen from the big boys. Much of the credit must go to director Lexi Alexander who shows a real flair for tension-filled scenes and getting the most out of an actor.<br/><br/>It is a bit of a coming of age story for wimpy Wood as Matt, a journalist major at Harvard who gets expelled when he won't fight the drug charges that his roommate sent him up with. The rest of the film is Wood's search for his backbone. Hunnam proves to be an exciting and dynamic leader of men, who actually does have a soul ... even if it is a bit misguided. Forlani flashes her most expressive eyes and does a great deal with her limited role here. I expect bigger things from her over the next 10 years.<br/><br/>Check this one out and spread the word on this hidden gem. The action is good, the dialogue is fast and fun and checking out the world of futbol firms is also very interesting."
"Jakethemuss","6","0","0","30 June 2007"," Alright ride...just leave realism at the door
","Reading through the comments, I'm noticing afew things worth mentioning. The majority of people slating this film are British and have a knowledge of football hooliganism, whilst the majority of those praising the film are American or European..therefor wouldn't't be expected to see the holes in the film the way someone from London may do.<br/><br/>Heres the story in a nutshell: Promising journalism student Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood)is expelled from Harvard for possession of drugs, only he wasn't to blame, the drugs were hid in his locker by his roommate, who is a member of high society, therefor lets Matt take the fall instead of shaming his family. He travels to London, UK, to stay with his somewhat estranged sister Shannon Dunham(Claire Forlani) and his baby nephew Ben. However, Shannon is married to Steve Dunham (Marc Warren), who happens to be the older brother of Pete (Charlie Hunham), the fearless leader of the well renowned GSE, or Green Street Elite. Matt is quickly taken under Pete's wing and given and inside look as to how football firm's operate. Unfortunately, things take a turn for the worst when Matt's journalism past is outed, and he is mistaken for an undercover ""journo""-the worst enemy in this film. This sets a spiral of events in motion that threaten to ruin everything.<br/><br/>Now for the lack of realism in this film that has so many people shaking their head.<br/><br/>The Green Street ""Elite"" seems to comprise of about 7 young lads in their 20's, none of whom come across as anything more than your average guy, in fact, there is doubt as to where they got their reputation from. Three of them hardly ever speak and add little to the story line, whilst one of them seems to just jump around swearing and cursing. Hardly an ""elite"" if you ask me.<br/><br/>As for the leader Pete, he is almost too overblown to be true, he is more like a Tyler Durden creation, just without the intellect or purpose. He is a stereotype of how the British ""lad"" is viewed by some people. He swaggers around using Cockney rhyming slang, in a confused accent that ranges from Australian, to posh, to somethings else then back again. Many people have mentioned Dick Van Dyke in Marry Poppins...good association!! He plays the role TOO tough, and says his often corny lines with such an effort that its sometimes unintentionally hilarious. He thinks by clenching his teeth, swearing like a toilet and swinging his arms about he can give off an alpha male image that is supposed to draw people in. <br/><br/>It does however draw little Matt Buckner in, as he holds Pete and the GSE with very high regards, following them round wherever they go. It is unrealistic how quickly he is taken in as ""one of the gang"" and how easy he finds his transition from student geek to lager drinking, foul mouthed brawler. Also unconvincing, as no matter what front he puts on..he is still childlike, and those big blue eyes are about as threatening as a lonely puppy.<br/><br/>Then for the actual fight scenes....well choreographed but VERY off target in terms of how these fight actually go down. 6 lads cannot walk into a tunnel and take on a crowd of brick/bottle throwing thugs only to escape with afew bloody noses. Elijah Wood would not be capable of dealing out that much damage in his first ever fight. Rugby tackling guys twice his size? knocking out thugs with one punch? please..this isn't The Matrix is it!<br/><br/>I wouldn't say this film glamorises football related violence, but it does make it out to be something more than it is. It injects it with a code of honour that shouldn't be there, giving an impression that its justified for the GSE to beat the crap out of rival firm members as it boosts their reputation. If it glamorised it completely, it wouldn't'd deal with the subject of families, and the negative effect this kind of life can have on them.<br/><br/>If your after a realistic insight into football hooliganism, walk right past this, as this is just make believe. If your after an overblown, pumped up, for the moment movie then you may have found something worth watching. The film is more a look at what happens when an impressionable young lad tastes a life he never had, and wants to bite off more, only to find the bite isn't so sweet the deeper you go. <br/><br/>A sensitive subject given a little too much Hollywood treatment if you ask me. Football Factory isn't as enjoyable, but a lot more can be said for the authenticity of it."

","Some good bits, and some people come out of this film with immense credit. What I am asking myself, though, is why the writers didn't think into their story a little further. We are unfortunately left with no credible reason why Elijah Wood would even give these prannies time of day - there is no reason at all for his cowardice. I don't want to critically savage this film, because that would be to hurt some very fine people, along with the people who should stick to spot-welding or internet poker or shark-taming. The brightest spin I can put on this film is, ""It raises a debate.""<br/><br/>Then, perhaps this film isn't for me. Perhaps I am not its ""target audience."" But then, sometimes it is quite a convincing comedy, and sometimes it tries ever so hard to be a morality play. There may be some merit in confusing the weak-minded, and if this film does social good, as it surely must, it deserves a plaudit. Sometimes, even, the dialogue seems excellent at giving over the self-delusions of the characters.<br/><br/>Isn't it true throughout the history of film, moreover, that sometimes the greatest innovations come couched in the most detestable rubbish? The violence in this film is astonishingly good in its execution. It'd be gratuitous of me to give it lower than a six, because words like piffle and baloney taint some very fine acting performances, and a director who just needs some good material to deal with.<br/><br/>Why, though, does it happen, that innovation often comes couched in mediocrity? Bandwagons, I'm afraid. ""Excitement"" clouds judgment, and emotion backs up excitement. That's when people start saying, ""No debate, we do it my way."" After that, a project is sunk sunk sunk. Eventually a film does have to get made, whatever quality it proves to be. Maybe I'm too nice: maybe it really doesn't have to get made like this, and, yes, I'd like to take several scenes and several performances out of this film and put them into a film that goes somewhere, does something, isn't hopelessly confused and doesn't embarrass its screenwriter quite so comprehensively. I note the director got three awards. She, EW, and a couple of the other actors should have got more awards for putting up with the unremitting tripe of this screenplay, - but there I go again - I *want* to like the way this film was made. Will someone please help me?<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Fernsy<br/><br/>Critical Breakdown: Violence 9/10 - not overdone, perhaps too much quick-fire camera-work, (overegged pudding, anyone?) but realistic. Camera-work - 7/10 - striving for effect too much. Soundtrack - 4/10 - Why do you need a soundtrack? If so, why do you need such a boring soundtrack? Where's the heavy metal? I doubt these people would give the Stone Roses time of day, to be honest. Acting - 9/10 - What they do with this script has to be seen to be believed, and the tragedy is, because the script (qv) is so appalling, they won't get recognition. Script - 2/10. Er... Story - i/10 (sic) - Who didn't finish their job, then??? <br/><br/>ps 'i' is a Mathematical concept. i * i = -1."

Hooliganism is depicted as intoxicating and the ""yankee"" transformation looks real, as well as the violence defense and its final condemnation.

"Falconeer","5","0","0","3 March 2007"," Fairly dumb & inaccurate, though entertaining drama
","It is interesting to note that the criticisms for ""Hooligans"" is pretty much split evenly down the middle, with most American audiences praising this over-dramatized world of football hooligans, while the Brits can see this as the clichéd, sappy melodrama that it really is. As an ex US citizen, (I now reside in Germany) I was a bit saddened at how clueless many Americans really are as to what things are really like across the Atlantic. The Brits must have had quite a laugh at this unlikely tale concerning a Harvard University ""yank"" named Matt, (played by Elijah Wood of all people) who gets kicked out of school and flies straight away to London, where he joins his boring sister and her boyfriend. It doesn't take him long to meet Pete, played effectively by the quite handsome Charlie Hunnam, (but sporting the fakest, most cringe-inducing Cockney accent I have ever heard), who introduces the small-in-stature Matt to the rough world of Hooligans. I am in no way a sexist, however this violent sub-culture is undeniably a ""guy thing"", and it is obvious at times that this drama was directed by a woman. Though technically well-made, it is sometimes sappy, overly dramatic, and sickly sentimental, as is so typical for American films. Using dramatic music the film attempts to manipulate our emotions, especially the unbelievably corny song that plays over the final battle. A lot of the power that this film might have had was deflated by some unwise choice of music. This same approach helped to destroy another film dealing with similar subject matter, that film being ""American History X"", another over-rated film. ""Hooligans"" comes across as insincere and contrived. The actors were mostly fine, however Charlie's accent; if I, as a non- English person found Hunnam's Cockney to be awful, imagine what it sounds like to a London-born native. I understand why Hunnam was cast; he has screen presence, and a certain charm, but he obviously is no Brit. Are they afraid to cast an authentic English actor in a major film? Not to mention, Hunnam's character was way too young to be believable as the leader of a 'firm.' It is supposed to be realistic, especially with a film dealing with a subject like this. A film about hooligans is supposed to be hard, and this film is too sentimental to be 'hard.' Female director Lexi Alexander seems to have a certain respect for the scene, but she seems to romanticize it somewhat, and seems a bit out of her element here. It seems that Alexander has a fascination with this hard, violent and male dominated world, but she doesn't really have a true understanding as to what it is all about. I would advise all with an interest in the world of Hooligans and football violence to check out a film called ""Football Factory"". It seems to be quite a bit closer to the real deal. I admit though, that ""Hooligans"" has it's moments. The close friendship that develops between Pete and Matt is nicely handled, and actually touching without being too corny. Their relationship is the best thing about the movie, although I thought it was lame when, at the films climactic rumble, when Pete gets his face beat in, that Matt didn't drop everything and run to his 'best mate'. That made me a little sick. Especially how it was presented in the end, that Pete had to lose his life, but it was worth it for the American guy to learn some stupid 'life lesson.'As a drama, ""Hooligans"" is not bad, but as an expose into the world of hooligans and football violence, this doesn't make it. Filmmakers need to stop making films about subjects that they don't fully understand."

","I cannot understand at all the accolades I see on this site for this movie. It was total sh*te as far as I am concerned, and I usually love this sort of thing. Dunnam's accent was so off base that nothing ever rang true in the film after his first scene. The American kid getting chucked out of Harvard for something that he never done, and never fighting it because the guy was a WASPy big shot, was as unbelievable as Pete's accent. And why did the sister show up at the fight - with the kid! - at the end! There was no feeling of authentic menace to this film at any time. It smacked of a kind of made-for-TV fantasy of English football hooligan life made by an American director who had never been within 10 miles of the East End. So many unbelievable scenes; the whole thing was ridiculous from start to finish. This needed to be directed by someone like Mike Leigh or Stephen Frears. There were some good performances by the real East End lads, but the director's tin ear for the proper language and tone of the scene she was trying to capture was an impediment that the movie could never overcome. See anything with Gary Oldman instead."

","This was an embarrassing movie. I wasn't even involved in the production in any way and I still fired my agent. This movie was not about hooligans, football or anything interesting of this world. 30 minutes into the film, you'll find yourself expecting a romantic struggle between Wood and any one of the many UK boys he's so starry-eyed with. There are far too many silly coincidences and convenient occurrences to even mention. The movie doesn't show nearly enough of the football culture in England. It glances over a few rivalries. It doesn't touch upon the policing of the hooligans or the consequences of the boys getting caught/arrested. It just seems like a fun sport with little or no risk. The film is extremely shallow and doesn't shed light on the political struggle that may be taking place. I mean, who cares about a journalist? Please explain how a beat writer could take down the reputation of a group of drunk football fans? This is laughable."

","The movie is engrossing. The sort of brotherhood portrayed here is appealing. People's passion for the football game, and love for hatred and violence, are well captured. Charlie Hunnan did a great job playing a lovable hooligan. Most other actors are only OK, though. Claire Forlani is yummy, but she was once in a while caught over-acting a bit in the movie. Elijah Wood... well, pretty much displaying the same sort of innocence we have come to get overly used to with him from Lord of the Rings... and his many other movies.<br/><br/>It's overall a decent movie. I always have a particular fondness for movies depicting the working-class life in Britain. The endless drinking in pub, the biting cynicism, the undying attitude to claim supremacy on every occasion, the unforgiving teasing of the losers, and the sheer compulsiveness to finish every sentence with the word ""mate."" All these fascinate me to no end. And I am glad that they are in good supply in the movie.<br/><br/>But what the movie does not offer is insights, not even those about hooliganism. Things are taken as given -- characters fight and verbally abuse one another for no other reason than that they are hooligans in the movie and that's what hooligans are supposed to do. To be fair, the movie never pretends that its purpose is to explore ""why."" But the frequency and audacity with which the movie asks us to also take things as given made me wince.<br/><br/>Who would expect an aspiring journalist (not least of all a son of a supposedly famous journalist) is so timid and afraid of power that he does not even try to fight a wrongful accusation? The head of a rival gang all of a sudden (after just a few instigating words) decided to take revenge for an accident that happened 10 years before? And after he almost killed a person, there's no police arrest and he's free to fight another day and kill another man? <br/><br/>But again, since the movie is never meant to provoke thoughts, we might as well enjoy watching it without doing much thinking."

","Matt is an American student that is expelled from Harvard being innocent. As he wants to change his way of live, he moves to London, where lives his sister. There he will meet his brother-in-law, a fanatic's football supporter. At first, he will feel frightened and confused, but he will discover a world of faith and loyalty, but also full of violence, danger and stubborn stupidness. When his new companions discover he was going to be a journalist, his problems will begin. This movie is quite original: the problem of English hooligans from a the American point of view. The movie is interesting, and the actors are quite well. Most of the things that happen are logical, but maybe a little exaggerated. The most disappointing part is the fact that the main characters seems to find positive being a hooligan and does not show any sign of changing his mind; despite the fact the movie shows us how dangerous and disgusting is fighting to other people only because they support another team (or only because they want to fight). The movie may contain too many topics, but results catching and entertains you about tow hours. A good one, there are better, but there are many, many worse films."

","As a huge fan of REAL FOOTBALL, I had a tremendous love of this movie. I didn't realize that these firms were so organized and most have a code of honor. I thought they just beat the living daylights out of anyone who isn't a supporter of their club. Although I HATE violence, I can see the fascination of being a member of your clubs' firm. This is a very enlightening movie, and I recommend it to any sports fan. Americans can really learn from Europeans and (south Americans to a much lesser extent)what it is like to support your team with TRUE passion, love, zeal, and art.

","Alright, I ought to first say this: I really enjoyed this movie, although there were some rather unbelievable and/or over-Hollywood-ed parts. For what it lacked in realism (e.g., Elijah Woods' character becoming an insider in a football firm -- highly bloody unlikely) Green Street's writer/director made up for the films shortcomings with classic Shakspearean theatricality (e.g. Bovver's betrayal/redemption and the entire climactic scene versus Milwall).<br/><br/>But there are some alarmingly close similarities between Green Street and The Football Factory that lead me to wonder how original Green Street, which was filmed later, really is.<br/><br/>Point 1 - In both films, the protagonist's firm fights -- and annihilates -- the Yid Army (the name of Tottenham's firm).<br/><br/>Point 2 - In both films, there is a trip to northern England for away games; in Green Street, the lads travel to Old Trafford to fight a Man U firm. In The Football Factory, the Chelsea firm goes to Liverpool.<br/><br/>Point 3 - In both films, there is a multi-split scene of the televised FA Cup draw. In both films, Millwall is the draw, and in both films there is exuberant celebration from the Millwall lads and the West Ham/Chelsea lads respectively.<br/><br/>Point 4 - In both films, the climactic ending involves a ruck with Millwall, and someone getting payback for an earlier wrong. In Green Street it is Tommy Hatcher going after Pete Denham; in The Football Factory, it's the entire Millwall crew going after Tommy Johnson.<br/><br/>Point 5 - All the above events occur in the same sequence in both films.<br/><br/>The biggest difference between the two (besides the accents being authentic in The Football Factory) is that we actually see a football (and a football match being attended as well!) in Green Street. The Football Factory is completely about violence.<br/><br/>I enjoyed both of these immensely. But I was curious whether or not anyone else who had seen both had noticed these items that I am comparing."

","Matt Buckner is a student of journalism at Harvard University. One day he lets his roommate talk him into dropping out of college just to help him protect the reputation of his family. Matt drops out just a couple of months before his degree and receives a nice amount of money for doing it, letting his wealthy pal get the easy way out. Therefor Matt decides to pay a visit to his sister and her husband in London whom he hasn't seen in three years.<br/><br/>It's here that he meets his brother-in-law's brother who lours him into hanging out with his friends who are all members of a 'firm' called The GSE. Matt feels pretty aimless because of the lack in having any real goals in life right now. So therefor we see a good case of slipping deeper and deeper into a truly restless crowd and joining their activities. <br/><br/>The film is rich with really good performances and uncompromising depiction of gang violence. There's hardly any holding back on that part. The whole thing about 'hooligans' looks even more realistic than most documentaries on the subject. But I couldn't get rid of the sense that the plot is a bit fetched if not ridiculous. That rings somewhere in the back of your head all the time.<br/><br/>I mean it's a little hard to believe that some student would get affiliated with a crowd like that so quickly. And the whole American-Brit relationship seemed a bit dated if not a little pathetic. But despite the shaky premise it succeeds wonderfully in making you see how pointless it is to keep getting involved in violence. In that point of view the film is easily comparable to genre gems such as American History X. Who knows, maybe one day this film will be shown across high schools to kids at sociology.<br/><br/>....... - 4/5 ......."

This film added another dimension to this genre for me because after watching The Football Factory, i was amazed, the film depicted the violence and made one understand the mindset of the individuals, this film in a more mainstream way achieved the same task, but even a bit better for me, although at times GSE is more exaggerating and far-fetched than The Football Factory, i thought it had some great themes, and issues dealt with which The Football Factory lacked.

"Movie_Reviewing_101","7","0","0","13 July 2006"," Bloddy Terrific
","From the start this film is both gripping and shocking. The opening sequence is of a bunch of football hooligans beating the living daylights out of each other in a very graphic fight.<br/><br/>The film is about Matt (Elijah Wood), who is wrongly kicked out of Harvard and goes to England to spend time with his sister. Once here he meets Pete (Charlie Hunnam), the leader of the ever so great 'GSE', the green street elite. Elijah is introduced to the rest of the gang and almost instantly his character changes from nice polite Harvard student, to violent, swearing, smoking, football hooligan. Which in itself makes for a gripping storyline The performances from all the cast not just Elijah and Charlie, is outstanding. There all believable and you could just imagine them actually being football hooligans. The director Lexi Alexander has done a great job portraying the reality behind hooliganism and it's truths. Unlike other hooligan films, this one portrays the characters as real people, with real jobs and real lives. And beating people up is just a common past-time.<br/><br/>This film definitely earns it's '18' certificate (R in USA). With very violent and graphic scenes and the word c**t used to hearts content. I think that this film will once and for all wipe the stereotypical view of englanders being tea drinking posh git's that the world thinks we are , and rather the violent uncontrollable rabble which we actually are. Which might be a bad thing.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this film to everyone but mostly people who are fans of 'The football factory'. But a word of warning to the 'Yanks'. This film contains a lot of cockney riming slang, so it may be a bit awkward to understand at times, especially with the strong cockney accents. Except for Elijah of course."

","This remarkable film is in its very strange way a very strange one, namely: I have never seen a movie so utterly devoid ov originality. Everything here in the story, the play, the direction is simply perfectly congruent with convention. Simultaneaously, the film has it all: not one motif, one role, one theme, not one cliché of Melodrama missing. And the product is just as flawless and as perfect as this very conformity.<br/><br/>This remarkable movie is 0% Art and 100% Craft; and, believe me, it IS a Masterpiece. I think 9/10 is the obvious evaluation here.<br/><br/>No plot line needed; its exactly a mean destillated out of zillions other similar stories. I'll restrict myself to a brief discussion of the ethical aspect, the aestethical criticism rendered lucidly enough above.<br/><br/>There's a peculiarly shameless quality about this film's wooing utterly primitive male and youthful instincts. Few words needed here. These thugs are heroes, no doubt about that. This is violence idealized and romanticised. It would be cheap to anathemize it from some standpoint t of ""humanism"" or... well, you know, conventional ideology stuff like that - but this I'm not gonna do.<br/><br/>The film is what it is; and life is what it is, reality is what it is, and people are what they are, wherever we like it or not. I prefer suspending the ethical perspective altogether. This is a great film.<br/><br/>BUT: don't let yourself be carried away by it. Keep distance, stay detached, see it, reflect on it in authentically personal integrity and autonomy, and evaluate it for what it really is; and you will have a great time of cinema and entertainment, and understanding as well, believe me, I can guarantee that."

","Seemingly being a Hollywood take on hooliganism, I really expected this movie to be appalling. Which it wasn't. I actually find it on nearly on par with I.D. and better than Football Factory, two British movies on the same subject.<br/><br/>Fighting, gangs, glorification of violence, black and white thinking, good vs. evil - not exactly typical US values. Well, at least not Eliah Wood's character's values. As he travels to England, he's introduced to West Ham United's hooligan firm, and guess what happens next.<br/><br/>One could wish for less ""cool"" action music and trendy visual effects, as excessive genuine supporter/hooligan atmosphere in itself proved more effective in the aforementioned movie I.D. Still, there are enough realistic hooligan scenes and chanting to give a rather realistic flavour of the environment.<br/><br/>Still, European viewers familiar with this culture will have to bear over with some scenes that rather obviously are meant for the American public. Also, I'm not sure if this movie really is representative for the firms as of today. In addition, the thugs seemed to be portrayed rather awkwardly at least in the beginning of the film, but the movie eventually sucked me in and made me forgive any shortcomings.

"gwailo247","8","0","0","3 March 2006"," Much much better than I expected
","I must say that I had my doubts about seeing Frodo enter the Football Factory, but I decided to check it out.<br/><br/>I had my doubts like everyone else about just how an American would be integrated into a firm, but having him be a cousin to the leader of the firm, very well played by Charlie Hunnam, made the story very plausible. Elijah Wood plays an expelled student who struggles to find himself, and his identity, delving into the realms explored by Fight Club, tapping into his more primal self.<br/><br/>Unlike Football Factory, this movie shows a much less glamorous side of violence. The absence of firearms in the UK, unlike with American gangs, lessens the death toll, but the cycle of revenge and retaliation does exist, especially when people take the fight to a more personal level. At the beginning its explained that its about the buzz of the fight and maintaining your reputation, but as the violence progresses we easily see how it can go beyond this, and get personal, often with tragic results.<br/><br/>I generally dislike movies in which an American protagonist comes in to save the natives, but this movie rarely treads into that territory, no doubt due to the casting choice of Wood. He serves as our guide into this realm, but he knows his place. He is a participant, but he's not the knight in shining armor. This movie has a message, but its not preachy, the meaning is very clear.<br/><br/>I did not expect to like this movie, and while the story is time tested and true, the setting is good, all the characters are well played and with depth to them, and the movie's pace is very exciting. I honestly enjoyed this movie, more and more as it went on. As the film ended, I found myself thinking back to the end of the Football Factory with Tommy asking himself ""Was it worth it?"" This movie answers this question as well.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely worth watching if you have an opportunity to do so."

","Elijah Wood must have needed the cash. I must admit, when I first heard he was making a film like this, I thought it was bad casting. I thought that on actually seeing the film, but I don't think it was a self-fulling prophecy. He just doesn't look right, feel right or seem right in the role.<br/><br/>The first thirty minutes move Wood's character into hooliganism too quickly and unrealistically. He's mentored by a thug who forces the cockney accent so much that it's a parody and at times he (the thug) falls into what can only be described as some sort of West country accent. It is quite unrealistic why Wood's character becomes so fiercely friendly with the thug.<br/><br/>Wood's first visit to a game, shows nothing in his apparent instant interest. Compare this to 'Fever Pitch' where the young boy enters the stadium for the first time and sees the crowd, hears the roar and sees the expanse of green pitch. Then we see his expression. It's obvious the boy has been turned to the sport. In Hooligans (Green Street in UK), there is a similar scene which is wasted for such an opportunity.<br/><br/>To be fair, the next part introduces some conflict in characters and a twist (of sorts), to make the film vaguely watchable."
"jamespcool_2k","7","0","0","19 January 2006"," Disappointing glorification of football hooliganism
","Elijah Wood's two-year honeymoon period after Lord of the Rings has finally worn off. The baby-faced and huge-eyed 24-year-old returns to a lead role in this gritty study of football-related violence and really couldn't have been less suited to the role if he'd tried. He plays Matt, a young journalism student who moves to London after being expelled from Harvard. With no Gandalf to keep him on the straight and narrow, Wood falls in with a bad crowd - hooligans with a nasty hobbit of getting into booze-fuelled, adrenaline-pumping brawls after West Ham matches. As Matt moves deeper and deeper into the violent Green Street Elite, the tension builds, as other members turn against their new American comrade-in-arms.<br/><br/>Ultimately however, despite it's potential, the film is a disappointment, a nil-nil draw. Charlie Hunman, who plays the gang's leader, has a cockney accent less convincing than Dick Van Dyke's in 'Mary Poppins' and Elijah Wood seems more suited to playing that practically perfect nanny than he is to being a blood thirsty thug. Like 'The Football Factory' before it, 'Green Street' seems to glorify, rather than condemn, mindless violence without any of the storyline or performances of Alan Clarke's 'The Firm', a much better take on working class football fanatics."

Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed nearly every moment of this film, however the concessions obviously made to an American audience really rob this film of its authenticity. As a crossover film for viewers in the US this will be as authentic as it is gonna get, yet it does lack the impact of something like 'ID' which was made 20 years previously.<br/><br/>Putting Elijah Wood as the lead makes good commercial sense at first glance, the theater audiences would need to recognise someone they are watching. He spends the whole film with his eyes wide open like a bunny rabbit in front of some car headlights! The cartoon inhabitants of Watership Down would be more convincing as casuals than he - the guy portrays no sense of menace whatsoever! It looks like the director pillaged the ranks of young 20/30 something character actors in the UK, they are all very photogenic and good looking with the slightest hint of menace about them. In short, more like the cast of 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' than any real convincing football thugs I have seen. The contrast that I enjoyed the most was the look of the top boys in the West Ham and Millwall firms. The Dunham boys are young GQ types whilst their nemeses are chubby old guys straight of the Square in Eastenders, what kind of message is being given there? The biggest howler is Charlie Hunham's cockney accent - it is just terrible. It comes out sounding like Dick van Dyke at times. At least he had an excuse in Mary Poppins... the old guy's from Missouri! Despite these shortcomings (and some plot holes so cavernous you could send a column of riot police through)this film is extremely entertaining. The rights of passage theme is played sympathetically and you develop an affinity with our hero and his buddies by the end. They do achieve a sense of redemption by the end of the film.

","I found this film unnervingly realistic. The acting was outstanding, I felt Elija Wood was very believable as the character who is easily led. I personally felt that this film had to be watched more than once to appreciate it properly. It was very disturbing to see the attitude of the characters in respect to the violence being of higher priority then the football itself. Considering I don't enjoy violent films I found that it was necessary in this movie and wasn't overdone. However, I did fell that football hooliganism as a subject was slightly romanticised. I would recommend this film to anyone who on occasions like to watch a dramatic movie. It was the kind of film that is in the back of your mind days after seeing it."

","Coming from a football background i thought this film would be the usual stereotyping bull that surrounds football fans. BUT, as a united fan, i feel the film captures the pride and excitement that fills every football fan on a match day. It also explores the firmness of friendship and the loyalty the GSE show for one another and what they stand for. The Language in the film is explicit, but i think the film needs it to strengthen the storyline and make it more valid. You can not write a football film with out the swearing, otherwise it wouldn't be football!! This film is a credit to British film makers and writers. It also has the double bonus of having Charlie Hunnam and Marc Warren who play the Dunham Brothers Pete and Steve, which to be honest, is what attracted me in the first place!!"

","There are a lot of good movies that are overlooked. Green Street Hooligans is really great and for some reason the reviewers from movie magazines didn't say some good things about it. Elijah Wood proves that he can act and breakout of his Hobbit image. He gives a strong performance. I don't think any former child star could have played such a demanding role than Wood. I don't think Macualay Culkin could do it. I was shocked to discover that the director of this film is a woman.

The clothing and fight styles are very lifelike and contain a lot of carnage. Even the swearing sounds realistic. Although, it was violent, it is now one of my favorite movies.

","Elijah Wood is fast becoming one of America's bravest actors. Many felt that after playing Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings trilogy that he may do a Mark Hamil and disappear. On the contrary though he has instead made eclectic choices ( a mute cannibal in the excellent Sin City and a football hooligan in this) as not to be typecast and next he will be seen in the Liev Scriebher directed Everything is Illuminated, another brave choice. And while Wood is excellent here his co-star Charlie Hunman steals the show as hard-hitting football hooligan Pete. His energy and naturalistic stile are superb. A real talent. The film as a whole is one of the best of the year. A gritty, very well written take on a controversial subject. First-time director Lexi Alexander dosen't tiptoe around the subject either not afraid to show while this is a disgraceful activity it does have plus points for the thugs involved and it shows how easy it could be for a normal person to get caught up in this violence.

","Football has never really had a good film made about it, not that I've seen anyway. I mean most people enjoy that Christmas favourite Escape to Victory, but despite having Pele, the football isn't really that good. Is Green Street any better? Football-wise, I'd have to say yes. But this film isn't really about football at all. It is about the West Ham firm, the GSE (Green Street Elite), and football fans' violence and how this all appears to an outsider.<br/><br/>That outsider is Matt, who we meet as he is being expelled from Harvard, of course for something he didn't do. Uncertain now of his future, he was studying journalism, he decides to go stay with his sister living in England. But when he arrives his brother-in-law(Steve) has a romantic night out planned, so Matt ends up heading down the pub with Steve's younger brother, and then out to a football match. And so he is introduced to the world of football, or soccer as he calls it. Pretty quickly he is swept away and becomes one of the lads, fighting along side them as they meet up with other footballing firms.<br/><br/>So expect plenty of violence and fighting.<br/><br/>But Pete Dunham and the GSE aren't really bad guys, at least not in this film. Pete is a teacher. He is a gentleman, giving up his seat to a woman on the tube. Isn't that nice of him.<br/><br/>Overall the film itself seems to have been swayed by the violence. We do get a bit of a message that violence creates problems and leaves lives wrecked, but in the end, certain violence is endorsed as proper and correct. Throughout the film as Matt grows more and more into a fighter he is portrayed as growing in confidence, and in appeal as we see him giving his number to girls.<br/><br/>Using innocent-faced Wood as Matt was a good choice. The rest of the cast also give good performances. Marc Warren I will be looking out for again, although hopefully he'll lose the overdone cockney slang and Mary Poppins-esquire accent (no, it wasn't that bad).<br/><br/>But all in all the film is quite predictable, and nothing to write home about. It also takes the side of the GSE, and so lessons their violence, turning their actions into more of an acceptable form of violence as it is only against other firms, and not the general public."

","I never actually saw any advertisements, trailers, screen shots nothing on this film and I'm not to fond on Elijah Wood. So when i see this is playing at my local cinema i really thought nothing of it. But then Saturday i get a call and I'm off to see the movies and in i walk not knowing what I'm going to see in the cinema. But i walk out amazed, amazed and astounded by this most powerful of movies.<br/><br/>At the start it is a tad tedious what with the whole international boundary and the fact that Matt being a yank knows little of life on good old England. You also see at first Matt being kind off watched over by Pete which doesn't sit to well with some in the GSE. Anyways Matt has never stood his ground or fought for what he believes in, and yet all of a sudden he finds himself becoming a punch bag and the whole story works perfectly. I mean the fights as well as being intense and brutal you can always see the not so good side to them. The whole film from start to finish had me gripped, and i mean gripped this film is unbelievably good Everyone acted their parts perfectly Hunnam plays Pete perfectly as the leader of an up and coming firm he really does have a presence on screen. Leo Gregory playing Bover, Petes most loyal friend his right hand man if you real and he really does show how jealous he is again he plays his part to absolute perfection. Not forgetting good old Elijah who like i said i am not really a fan of and again even in this film i think they could have found better but even so Elijah did play his part as the vulnerable Yank turned fanatical hooligan very well but it was always his voice it just seemed a tad childish. And Geoff bell i mean could you get any more intense he was excellent the kind off evil arch nemesis in the film and was flawless doing it.<br/><br/>But the actual power of the film is what really got to me, at the end of the film i found myself looking at my proud Newcastle strip on the wall ready for the Baggies trip and wondering in the back of my mind what is going on after the match in the pubs, back alleys and streets, and thats when this film really hits home, and it hits like a sledgehammer.<br/><br/>Whether or not you're a gunners fan, chelski supporter a red devil or a part of the toon army, hell if you hate football to the end this film is still one of the best films you can ever see.

","A lot of people have slammed this film but I'm not going to go down that route. So what if Elijah Wood was parachuted in as the token American star - the movie industry is about money and if the film needed Elijah Wood to make box-office cash than so be it. In general the film should be looked at as pure fantasy. If you can suspend belief than it is entertaining with a moral thread running through it. This film can easily rank alongside The Firm (Gary Oldman) and ID (Sean Pertwee) and it only a matter of time before ALL 3 will be available as a box set! My only gripe was that they didn't call the West Ham hooligans the ICF (Inter City Firm) - they opted to use the Green Street Elite (GSE) which sounded crap. The rivalry between the West Ham firm and the Millwall hooligans was over the top but violently entertaining. I loved the build-up to the character of The Major - truly mythological and it played out like some kind of Greek Tragedy. This film should be looked at as pure entertainment and not judged on a factual basis. It was made for the International market NOT soley the British market and I think people slamming the film are missing that point."

","As soon as the main character spoke in this film i couldn't help but squirm in my seat thinking ""is he really gonna be this bad throughout the whole movie?"" Things didn't get much better, in fact the accent seemed to get worse and worse as the film progressed. I thought the whole thing was devoid of any originality or style, the flashy jarring fight scenes annoyed me immensely. Casting was poor , except for the main thug from the rival firm , who i thought was pretty convincing.<br/><br/>The main storyline seemed to be comprised of the best bits of ID and The Football Factory (which to me is the most realistic portrayal of football hooliganism) and didn't have many surprises right up towards the very predictable ending. I didn't like the way the story went with the journalism and typical American / Harvard angle , quite frankly it was stupid. Elijah Wood wasn't terrible, i think he did the best he could with the material but he just didn't seem to fit the role for me. I know a lot of people find it hard to watch him in something drastically different from Lord of the Rings and i must admit in the middle of the chaotic fight scenes i did think at some point he was going to reach from around his neck, place the ring on his finger and disappear from sight! The main firm didn't look or act like they would be able to fend off every gang, in fact they would have had trouble beating up youngsters in a playgroup...just not convincing enough casting i repeat! <br/><br/>So to sum it up the lack of originality, annoying camera work, terrible casting and beyond belief predictability left a lot to be desired. Personally i cant imagine how people have been awarding this 10/10 it didn't move me in the slightest, i suggest The Football Factory or the Firm for a more realistic and enjoyable hooligan experience :)<br/><br/>3/10 for me...and thats only because some of the dialogue made me chuckle."

"davideo-2","7","0","0","26 September 2005"," Another of a recent crop of British films with a worryingly similar mind-set
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>Unjustly expelled from Harvard for having a stash of cocaine in his possession, Matt (Elijah Wood) moves up to London to live with his sister and her husband Steve (Marc Warren), whose chirpy, cock-sure younger brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam) he is quickly introduced to. Pete is at first reluctant to become friendly with Matt and allow him to tread around the capital city with him, because he may be viewed as an 'outsider', but after a heavy drinking session with his mates, he soon starts to change his opinion of him. On his way back from a football match, Matt is viciously accosted by a gang of Birmingham City thugs, until Pete and his friends come along and help him out. From here, Matt learns their true identity- they are football hooligans, operating the GSE (Green Street Elite) 'firm.' Initially fearful of the violence, Matt soon finds himself becoming as desensitized to it as his new found friends- but suspicion, shocking revelations and unsettled scores combine to devastating effect when it all climaxes in a free-for-all brawl between London's most heated football rivals-Millwall and Chelsea.<br/><br/>Exceedingly similar ground has been tread already, very recently too, with last year's The Football Factory. So that's two films in very quick succession of each other about football violence. And there's also been a fair few of what the British make best-gangster movies, with The Business and the recently released Revolver. All films aimed at the more criminal way of existence. And all British. It's not the actual films themselves, it's just the amount and consistency of them that I feel may be playing a part in glamorizing all the lawlessness that is present in modern day Britain.<br/><br/>As for the actual film itself, Green Street is, well, very similar to The Football Factory. It brings the world of the football hooligan to life, exploring the motivation behind it and the kinship that develops between those involved. Only it provides characters with more intelligence and humanity, and it could be said that ultimately there's just more depth there. But this, for me at least, was sort of a blessing and a curse. While I was watching it, I just couldn't help thinking of TFF and the more easier flowing, less thickly spread feel to it and just ending up finding this a bit over-whelming and force-fed. The most worrying thing about both these films is just how successfully they succeed in glamorizing the football violence culture and making an aggression in the viewer pop up that may not have been there before. I'm a very gentle person, but I'll admit that both of these films managed to pep me up and make me see an attraction to the idea of soccer violence.<br/><br/>On the performances front, as an American in the lead role, Wood continues to craft a notable career for himself and through-out you're never able not to notice his sweet, innocent, pretty-boy complexion and genuinely feel how out of place he looks amongst all these hooligans. In the main supporting role, Hunnam is certainly very compelling. His character is very well-written, high-lighting how some of the most prolific firm members can actually be rather articulate and hold down very respectable professions outside the firm (he is revealed through-out the film as a PE and History teacher at a primary school!) but his accent is a bit dodgy. His cockney geezer dialect is very shaky through-out. I've just learned he actually comes from Newcastle. There's no way he was really from London, but when his accent fails in bits of the film I thought he actually sounded vaguely American, like his co-star. Warren and the rest of the supporting cast are solid and are an essential driving force to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is certainly a very enjoyable, impressive film that is well worth seeing and, who knows, maybe if I'd seen it before TFF I'd have enjoyed it even more. I know that I should just stop trying to compare it to that film so much, but in light of that film, good though this is, I couldn't help but find it a bit harder to digest and get into the swing of as much. ***"
"landline","7","0","0","25 September 2005"," Very good, but could have been even better.
","On the one hand this is a good movie with a lot of realism and largely good performances. On the other it stops short of being a great movie for two reasons. The first is the casting of Charlie Hunnam as 'Pete'. Not that he does a particularly bad job of the role, but there are enough young British actors who can actually carry off an East End accent that could have played a more believable character. So poor is his dialect at times it's almost as wince-inducing as the token English guy in the Ocean's Eleven remake, who makes Dick Van Dyke sound like Peter Ustinov. But this film is aimed at the American audience so the grubby antics of the cast still have a quaintness about them that you just wouldn't find in or around Green Lane. For instance, the first reference to rhyming slang is bizarre ""you're having a bubble (and squeak)"" translates as either ""you're having an informant"" or, in it's more traditional use, ""you're having a Greek"". Very few Americans, I imagine, would notice these nuances so as an export product it succeeds. <br/><br/>Elijah Woods is very good in this too. It was a brave move to not play another fantasy character or go for a rom-com and despite my reservations before seeing the film, he has done himself a world of good by showing that he is a versatile and memorable presence. Stalwart of the 'nasty piece of work' role, Marc Warren, is as good as always and could have played Pete with ease.<br/><br/>The other slight problem I have with the film is in it's overall premise. Yes it's a refreshing change from British Police and/or gangster films. Yes, it's not a period piece and yes, thank the Lord God almighty, embarrassing plank Hugh Grant is not in it. Movies about the current working class are sadly few and far between so a portrayal of an Englishman who isn't a bumbling in-bred retard is most welcome. But, it niggles me slightly that at a time where football is growing faster than ever before in the States we send over a film that illustrates a small and hideous part of the game. That said, a movie about a happily married middle class footie supporter would be as boring as most of their lives usually are, and we have demonstrated before that movies about violence without guns are one of our strong points. 'ID' and Alan Clarke's 'The Firm' spring to mind. The comparisons with Football Factory will be all too common, but if that film had never been made I think this one still would have.<br/><br/>But anyway, I always tend to pick out the little gripes. All in all this is a very good piece. Not totally authentic, not completely gritty but shys away from the clichÃ©s, (even going as far as using one of the stars of Football Factory in a bit-part) and provides some edgy entertainment and on the spot adrenaline. Unlike the ode to eternal disappointment, weirdly adopted by West Ham Utd 'I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles', this is a very promising foray and hopefully will pave the way for other larger-budget 'alternative lifestyle' flicks. I'm not convinced it will be in many DVD collections in five years time but it's unbending enough to deserve respect even for that alone."
"noralee","7","0","0","24 September 2005"," An Involving Examination of Men Gone Wild, but Too Anthropological
","""Green Street Hooligans"" is a visually involving attempt at exploring the phenomenon of violent English football fans, but falls down through the story choice of approaching it through a cross-cultural and class perspective.<br/><br/>Perhaps with an eye on the American movie market, co-writer/director Lexi Alexander chose not to use the docudrama style of ""Bloody Sunday"" in trying to understand how a violent incident can explode, but instead almost anthropologically uses the viewpoint of a fish out of water participant observer. That distance is emphasized with an unnecessary and melodramatic voice-over, however, the angle of reporters seeking to go into this alternative universe is not unfounded paranoia as I remember reading a scandal some years ago about a ""journo"" who did successfully go undercover with such a group and how shocking his reports were.<br/><br/>We see middle class milquetoast, expelled Harvard student Elijah Wood as ""Matt Buckner"" arrive in England with a belly full of family and class reasons to have pent-up anger at the world. He is accidentally drawn into a completely different world by a plot contrivance that is a poignant fulcrum to the film and its most interesting invention, his rebellious older sister's marriage to a guy who in any other British movie (and just about every other TV show or movie Marc Warren, as the husband, has been in) would be called ""her bit of rough."" No wonder he keeps calling her his ""angel."" It's a boundary-challenging, transgressive relationship that we haven't seen much in the movies since ""A Street Car Named Desire"" and I would have liked to see more.<br/><br/>While Wood's Americanness provides the excuse for the necessary translations of slang, sports nomenclature and social descriptions that I presume the British audience will find redundant, an American audience is more used to the innumerable movies about gangs (from the metaphorical ""The Warriors"" or even alternative inner city groupings like in ""Rize"") where race or ethnicity is a crucial element in male bonding and where the violence is expressed through guns rather than these primitive fists and whatever is handy. With the probably not incidental perspective of a female director, it also implies that movies like ""Romper Stomper"" that assumed a political sheen to such activities misunderstand the pack instinct. With those factors removed, what you mostly have is testosterone on adrenaline reorganized around ""firms"" that use sports teams as an excuse for their existence, so it's like ""Fight Club"" crossed with ""Friday Night Lights"" and ""Rollerball."" The editing emphasizes the emotional process of violence over its results in order to get across the participants' euphoria.<br/><br/>This film may be about as authentic as ""Hustle & Flow"" is about rappers and pimps, but as a fable of men gone wild it is involving. I could understand the dialog so ipso facto that must mean that the actors weren't speaking with authentic class accents. It comes as a shock to casually see that the hooligans are all in fact gainfully employed. For guys who emphasize their heterosexuality, we only see one in an ongoing relationship with a female, though, like with ""Lords of Dogtown,"" we get a hint of admiring groupies. Charlie Hunnam's exaggeratedly swaggering alpha male is charismatic, if overly theatrical. The film is insightful at examining the sociology of the groups, showing how the beta male tries to prove himself to the alpha male by ratcheting up the action and distinguishing genuinely disturbed individuals that even the participants identify as ""an animal."" <br/><br/>The recurrences of issues of family ties, father to son, brother to brother, emphasizes that male tribalism crosses class lines, as queasily indicated in the ambiguous ending. It misses an opportunity to link these goings on to ""Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room"" by oddly and somewhat scarily transferring the hooligan behavior to middle class vengeance on the upper class.<br/><br/>Other than the chillingly recurring team cheers that recall ""A Clockwork Orange,"" the song selections are good but are very limited, with repeat selections by one band, I guess due to music clearance costs, with, oddly, no metal and only one hip hop number, over the closing credits.<br/><br/>This film almost makes a case for a mandatory draft of young men and limited wars to channel inevitable male aggression in groups."

","Yes Charlie Hunnam's accent really does distract so much that it ruins the film and the credibility of the character he plays.<br/><br/>//May be spoilers below// Instead of being engaged by his performance as 'Pete', leader of the GSE, I found myself laughing at how bad his accent was. This is supposed to be one of the central characters of the plot, why could they not cast a British actor who would be able to actually portray the character properly?<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with Charlie Hunnam's performance otherwise, apart from when he speaks, his attempt to speak like an east-Londoner is so bad it's jarring.<br/><br/>The film was an enjoyable one, it did'nt glamorise Hooliganism too much, but showed why it appealed to the members of these 'firms'.<br/><br/>All in all it gets 7/10 from me, it turned out much better than I thought it would be (was predicting another Football Factory)."

","I just saw this in a sneak preview.<br/><br/>Brief plot summary: American Matt (Elijah Wood) drops out of Harvard after being framed. He moves to the UK where his sister lives with her English husband. Matt gets involved in the a firm (gang) of a football team. He discovers a new side of himself.<br/><br/>This flick shares some themes with ""The Fight Club"" (about love for fighting) and ""Once Were Warriors"" (about present day proud Maori tribe members). Unfortunately, the level of these movies is never reached here. The main problems are directing with a lot of rough edges and wooden dialog every now and then. The ""firm"" part story feels authentic, but some other parts, such as the scenes at Harvard seem phony, made up.<br/><br/>The movie slightly uncovers motives why someone would want to be in a hard core supporter gang. It also gives you a unique inside look into this violent subculture. Elija Wood's performance of Matt as the central character works most of the time. Apart from him, there are not a whole lot of people to care for.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie did not leave me completely cold. There were some dramatic scenes that worked. But it's not a great must-see picture either. If you want to get a rare glimpse at the violent subculture of football hooliganism, it may be worth checking out. 6/10."

","I write this review reluctantly because I think this film deserves some credit as a powerful portrayal of football violence. I've seen all the other films that have attempted this and I have to say that this one fails to place. I was tempted to leave the cinema at one point.<br/><br/>You know what it's like when something can't fail to distract you? Like a beautiful baby...wearing an earing...something subtle but so incongruous that your brain fails to process? Well that's Charlie Hunnam's accent. I know that this film has been favourably reviewed by (mainly) Americans but I'm sure they have no idea how terribly a London accent can be mangled by a Geordie. Charlie's acting was strong, but the irony of this film is that his character would have been beaten to within an inch of his life as a probable imposter. How odd then that he's been cast in the role of the Firm's boss. This was a challenging role for Hunnam and he failed to carry it off - always looking like the actor and never the role. This contrasts strongly with Leo Gregory as Bovver who looked like a crack addled Sean Bean. Utterly amazing acting - I hope we'll see more of him. Maybe the next Tim Roth! - I'd also mention Claire Forlani as Elijah's sister Shannon - not only one of the most beautiful women on screen but a very powerful actress.<br/><br/>Finally - The Elijah Woods/Harvard plot was a bit of cackhanded way of cashing in on the emerging US interest in 'Soccer' and making an otherwise very niche film that much more marketable."
"pandabat","4","0","0","15 September 2005"," Worse than a nil-all draw
","There is nothing right in this movie. An American journalism student who has been kicked out of Harvard because he was framed by his roommate comes to London to visit his sister who is now married and has a child there. Very, very, very shortly after arriving he is sent away for the day to a soccer match with Sam, brother-in-law to the American's sister. Sam's patently a hardcore soccer fan who doesn't particularly want to bring a yank to the match with his mates. After a jokingly pathetic attempt to stand up to Sam and his yobbish behaviour (and attempted mugging), Sam suddenly finds a respect for the American. This quick turn was the beginning of the end. What follows is an even more unbelievable saga of bad London accents, shaky fight scenes scared of being too explicit, and pathetic, moronic and loutish behaviour (well I suppose it is a football-hooligan movie). The protagonist learns to fight with great ease against seasoned street fighters despite never having being in a fight in his life. Loyalties seem to flip at a moment's notice and characters behave in ways which make no sense at all, such as a mother who abhors violence and wishes to leave London because of it driving her infant child into practically the most violent gang fight that there could be, stopping the vehicle and getting out of it, with him still strapped inside! The audience are supposed to feel some sort of connection to the song ""I'm forever blowing bubbles"", the anthem of West Ham (the featured team) but it comes across as a drink inspired wail of oblivion, which is where this movie made me want to go. Avoid, avoid, avoid!!"

","What a shocking cockney accent from lead role Pete(Charlie Hunnam), it might convince the film's 'Yank' target audience but was the most negative aspect of an otherwise good film. All the fight scenes are spectacularly bloody especially involving Millwall's firm. The way Wood's character is embraced into the firm still seems unlikely but he gives a strong performance and could probably match Hunnam's cockney accent if he wanted! This film is well made, and exciting to watch. If you compare it to last year's Football Factory it is definitely a more polished and free flowing film but lacks the sometimes awkward (for Yank to understand) moronic dialogue, psychotic behaviour and general bad attitude associated with hooligans.

"ian_eadgbe","10","2","5","2 December 2006"," An excellent and (surprise) honest movie
","I'm no good at writing, so I'll keep this short. GSH is a great movie about English football (soccer, really) hooligans. Elijah Wood belies his pretty boy appearance by becoming an experienced fighter. Some great and very lifelike fighting scenes. That is a must for me. I hate old movies with bad fight choreography, because especially to me (or any other low class American kid) it looks amazingly fake. To the contrary, Green Street Hooligans' fight scenes could have been filmed live. That said, this movie is much more than a glorified boxing match. The ""message"" of this movie is far deeper than ""violence is inherent to men"", as one reviewer put it. Yes, it is, and yes, that's part of the movie. But the truth behind the glory is that, while violence can have amazing transformative powers, (Elijah Wood goes from being a shy, uncertain college kid to being a capable man), violence for it's own sake destroys everyone connected. We see the problems caused by both views of violence: that of suppressing it totally out of political correctness, and that of glorifying it out of pure barbarism. Elijah Wood doesn't even have the self confidence (or the mechanisms) to stand up for himself. He is part of the modern cultural machine, a reticent, nice guy, smart college boy. He caves when his roommate, part of the power structure, blames his own coke habit on Wood. Jeremy VanHolden (or Kennedy, same idea) controls his state through his daddy, a senator. On the other side, brawls between rival firms of hooligans kill a young boy and a grown man, tear apart families, and completely destroy a bar absolutely filled with foreign beer. Out of both extremes emerges Elijah Wood, not unscathed, but definitely stronger."
"adremeaux","2","2","5","6 August 2006"," ridiculous and morally bankrupt

The film is needlessly violent, horribly predictable, and dabbles in exaggerated, petty pseudo-gangs, that promote nothing but brotherhood, team patriotism, and, well, beating the sh*t out of each other just because. Elijah Wood is completely out of his element, and is not believable at all. Some big-name Harvard near-grad gives up and life and joins some senseless bloodthirsty gang after only just one day out with the boys? Yeah, my freaking' ass.

","This is a movie that you can relate with. if you ever felt mistreated or discriminated against this is your movie. there's a million of persons that think they don't belong, that they shouldn't be there or something, well this guys proves that maybe that's the best feeling ever. <br/><br/>Being part of a group of football hooligans must be no different from being a gang member but the point is not only the violence, its the feeling of fellowship, of friendship above all kind of things, the feeling of having someone looking over you. <br/><br/>Elijah Wood with all his innocent look was the perfect choice for Matt, you believe every simple thing, you can see the change on his eyes, in the end when he finds the Van Holden, you really want him to get his revenge, this Kid is made for bigger things. Charlie Hunnam's character its a contradiction itself, you don't know which side you'll choose, I've never laid eyes on him before but I'm sure we're gonna see him more often if he keeps this quality of acting. <br/><br/>I've noticed This guy in No Night is too long in another memorable part, so when I saw Marc Warren's character so perfectly portrayed I wasn't surprised, so soft, so calmed and smooth and in half second became so violent that even his brother is afraid of him, was great in every single scene, so was Claire Furlani, as the loving wife. Leo Gregory's Bovver was so pathetic, so sad, so guilty... so great. <br/><br/>There are parts of the plot that need to be discussed but its impossible without giving you huge spoilers that will ruin the experience of Green Street to you. In the end the main issue is not the violence it self but the violence and the impossibility of forgiveness and the impossibility to find out who blame for their own mistakes. <br/><br/>You can see that the whole thing would be solved if two adults could act like that and talk and put things clear. I'm kinda related to the games of pride and respect they play, there's nothing more cathartic than the feeling, the sound, of your fist in your rivals flesh, the feeling of power that a fight gives you. this movie made me remember my crazy teens and at the same time made me remember why I changed and that sometimes people need to move on. and points out that Violence is not an answer. <br/><br/>There's another lesson here, that you have to fight for your rights, no matter who you're fighting against You stand your ground and fight<br/><br/>this is one of the best movies I've seen during 2005."

","Green Street Hooligans is well on its way to becoming a cult classic. The film simply kicks ass to say the least . The great thing about it is that it views the subject of football hooligan's through the eyes of a complete stranger who is not well used to this kind of life. This film is one hell of a roller coaster ride that waste no time getting into the action . Being that it is the World Cup and being an England fan I had decided to check this out giving the reputation English football fans have although oddly enough they have been very well mannered during all of England's games ! The film actually explains what the structure and the violent nature of the firms that go these matches just to cause trouble . The material is nitty-gritty , no holds barred fun which at times one could say that hypes up violence. But the absolute brilliant thing is that is portrays hooligans as human beings rather complete mindless thugs . The acting is top notch , Elijah Wood shows a brilliant show of a mousy , geeky nerd who then transforms into one of the boys who will stop at nothing to show how loyal he is to the football hooligans code of honour , Charlie Huuman also kicked ass showing us a fearless gang leader he is and Danny boy from Hustle proved that he is a talented actor and Jake from Eastenders popped his head in . My only regret is that I did not check this movie out any sooner , however my piece of advice would be that you should not check this out as a football movie , just take the ride with Elijah Wood and you will see that you shall be able to relate to him . I mean at the end of the day have not we all wanted to be part of something ! to be accepted ! these groups are like a social out let for these guys .

And the ending will stay with you for a long time and will probably as leave you in tears.

The cast is also filled a few nobodies which works for the film. If it had been starring Vinnie Jones etc. it just would not work after all we're talking west ham not Hollywood.

","The problem with this film, from an Englishman's perspective, is that it is very badly cast.

The inclusion of Elijah Wood smacks of Hollywoodization and lends a further element of farce to the overall plot.<br/><br/>Essentially, English football hooliganism is a topic that is best left to people who know English culture well (and specifically English football culture) because otherwise you end up sacrificing authenticity.<br/><br/>I'm sure this film will appeal to testosterone-fueled young men, and particularly people who aren't aware of the severe factual errors that tend to crop up. If you are the sort of person who might notice these (e.g. anyone from the UK) then maybe it's best watched after a couple of beers so that you can enjoy it as one of those so-bad-that-it's-good films."

There's no way that that guy could jump up and down in front of opposing fans for the length of time he did. Also where the police man didn't chase after the drunk.

When West Ham rumble Manchester Utd they all swagger off celebrating to the music of The stone Roses (an iconic ""madchester"" band). I didn't care one bit about the characters in this movie. Wood joins the firm far to early in the story in my opinion thus throwing the film onto a predictable story path.

"edwpat","10","2","5","15 September 2005"," Greent Street Hooligans - A Grade A Elijah Wood Film
","Touted in the United States as the Film Hollywood doesn't want you to see, Green Street Hooligans crept into six theaters on September 9th and posted a weekend of gross of $48,000, that is about $7,000 per site, which Hollywood would not have believed, considering the top grosser of the previous week (on 3,000 screens), eked out a per site gross of $6,000. So, why is this new Elijah Wood film being released by its makers and promoted by Wood's fans. Maybe because the Hollywood machine has misunderstood the film, thinking it's a violent gang picture about the underground of a British sport starring a cute furry Hobbit. My, my-have they seen it? Have they bothered to attend a Film Festival where it garnered rave reviews and awards? Well, the cats out of the bag and this riveting, taut, well-performed film has made a mighty entrance, blasting to hell the finite obscurity of Hollywood moguls.<br/><br/>Simply premised, a Harvard drop-out (expelled) visits his sister in London has a chance encounter with an in-law who takes him under his wing and introduces him to organized British hooliganism, the Firms-in this case the Green Street Elite, wrapped around the fanaticism of Football (that sport we call in the states Society Football; or SOCCER). But the film is not about Football or the violence attached to the Firms. It's deeply entrenched in primal man-the tribal man of the village. Margaret Mead would be quite at home (rest her soul) observing the rival firms standing and riling each other, much like Neanderthals at a Mammoth hunt. The script wanders a bit on a thin plot, but allows the message to be clear. When you share a central bond with villagers and stand your ground, you have invested your soul in the collective reputation of the tribe. Outsiders, who lack this, are mere wimps.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood as the Yank, Matt Buckner is superb as he grows a pair of balls over the length of the film. If you don't mind seeing everyone's favorite Hobbit have the stuffing beat out of him, and scrapping like the Dickens and enjoying the violence incrementally, you'll be okay. The acting job is sterling and filled with the steel that overtakes the character. His mentor, Pete, played by Charlie Hunnam, rushes like a river through the work, giving it buoyancy. Hunnam's cockney cleverness and leadership keeps the film alive and crisp, never a boring moment. In fact, the violence, which is not gratuitous, but organic to the work, draws you in to take a good look. This is the real stuff and we want to see Elijah Wood slam and get slammed, and Charlie Hunnam lead the tribe to victory. Of course, there are villains and naturally, a moral twist as the simple plot and theme gets aced by human failures, which drains all the nobility from the initial premise.<br/><br/>Excellent performances are delivered by Leo Gregory who plays Bovver, the fly in the Firm's ointment; and Geoff Bell and Terrence Jay, the bad guys, each on opposite sides of the pond draw our our natural tendency to hiss on cue. Claire Forlani as Matt's sister delivers a credible performance, trying to match Elijah Wood with Buckner family nuances. Lexi Alexander, in her first directorial credit, does a splendid job handling angle and shot, many of which are iconic and deliver memorable punches, much like Elijah's Wood facial essays, which dot this film more than his others.<br/><br/>Rated R for language (not only the proverbial F word, but also a bushel of the more offending C word) and mild drug use, the only thing this film lacks is sex-and if it were included, that would have been gratuitous. With strong performances from all cast members and particularly from their flagship, Elijah Wood, this is one film that may not be for all young Hobbits, but (I predict) will linger in the halls of film favorites for years to come. The film that Hollywood doesn't want you to see should be seen as often as possible, if not for the brilliance of the work, for no other reason than a firm vote of confidence for all grass roots efforts in the world of the creative arts.

","I went to Edinburgh to see this film, and on the 24th of August I walked out of the cinema absolutely amazed. It was the same feeling I had after seeing The Cranberries ""Zombie"" video clip for the very first time (when I was 10 or so). I went together with a friend, and although she is not a football lover, nor a specific fan of either Elijah Wood or Charlie Hunnam, she was just as blown away by the film as I was. On the way home we were utterly quiet (an accomplishment for the both of us), and we were each caught up in our own thoughts about the film. I don't think the film glorifies hooligans, but it does explain it partly, making hooligans seem less 2-dimensional as they are now to a lot of people (including me before I saw this film). It shows you just enough to make you think. A lot. I woke up the next morning, and the first thing that played through my head was this film. Just as a good film is supposed to do. Excellent."

","I just saw the film and thought it was great! i had assumed that i wouldn't enjoy it much because of it being about football, but the sport actually just provides the basis for an extremely enjoyable film about a complex and interesting subject that I, even living in the UK, had no idea was so serious. Unfortunately the question and answer that followed the premiere hinted that some may find it too controversial, with questions about it ""glamorising"" violence. I personally feel that this is a very similar situation to Trainspotting - the film makers simply provide an honest view of a way of life, portraying the characters as real people, not just criminals. Though this led to audiences identifying with characters, both films showed bad outcomes as well as why the characters chose to live these ways. The actor Charlie Hunnam answered the questions extremely well, pointing out that it was necessary for the film to show why, not just how, a minority of people take such joy in violence. I would urge people who do not particularly like football to not be put off by the fact that it features in the film, the few scenes of football matches are shot and edited in a way which makes them very interesting to watch, as were the fight scenes.

It had plenty of funny moments, particularly the differences between Yanks and Brits, but this film was pure drama.<br/><br/>Now I have to warn those who haven't seen it -- yet (yes, I am hopeful it will get a distributor), it is quite violent (lots of head bashing, etc.). But I have to reiterate what Lexi said before the movie was played, that the message she was trying to convey in the film was one of anti-violence. And she did it in spades! There was no stylized violence herepure brutal fist-a-cuffs. I have to admit it was a little hard to watch at times (especially Elijah Wood getting bruised up quite a few times), but overall it wasn't gratuitous.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood was brilliant in this movie. He just put in another great believable performance. You can see how he gets involved with these guys (or my word for that day  intoxicated) by the Firm. The other gem here was Charlie Hunnam. He was phenomenal. His character was a punk, yes, but he also had a redeeming quality about him that I won't get into here.<br/><br/>This film just has to get a US distribution deal! It would be a shame if it didn't. I believe US audiences deserve to see it for themselves."
"view_and_review","3","2","6","2 July 2018"," British Fight Club
","This movie had two things I didn't care much for: soccer (yes I called it soccer) and senseless violence.<br/><br/>It would be an error to say the movie was about soccer because it had very little to do with soccer. It had more to do with senseless violence than anything. Green Street Hooligans did its level best to convince us of the nobility of soccer ""firms"" (aka gangs). Apparently, the soccer teams of England also have unofficial ""firms"" attached to them. These ""firms"" are nothing more than liquored up thugs that fight each other for a ""rep"" and ""firm"" dominance. <br/><br/>What failed to resonate with me was the fact that these firms fought each other based upon their chosen soccer team. They make a point to insult the Crips and Bloods who fight over turf as though fighting for soccer is somehow more noble.<br/><br/>It's a sport. It's for entertainment. The players themselves wouldn't even fight over their respective teams. And I get sports passion because I love sports myself. Still, I'm not fighting over it.<br/><br/>The main character, Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood), was a languishing spineless soul until he fell in with the West Ham United firm--or so they'd have you believe. After he got a taste of blood and excitement he was a changed man. A better man.<br/><br/>The plot was painfully simple and one-dimensional and Elijah Wood didn't sell it at all. Nobody really was able to sell this movie to me. It was hard to take one iota of this seriously. Fighting over soccer teams, reputations, journalist phobias, and daddy issues all made an appearance and none of it made sense. I'm assuming that this movie is so beloved because it's like a British version of Fight Club. Fight Club I liked, this I didn't."
"Der_Schnibbler","9","2","6","20 December 2007"," Beautiful, beautiful film
","First off, my ""credentials"": I am not a soccer fanatic and I've never even seen a ""hooligan"" in real life. I'm just a typical American who has played soccer once or twice for fun, and that's about it. I'm as far removed from even the most average of European football fans.<br/><br/>Let me also add: I almost never post a comment on here unless I absolutely DESPISED a film. If I enjoyed a movie, I like to savor that feeling for myself. But if I hated it, I vent it here and warn others to stay away. I figure it's the least I can do.<br/><br/>Now that we have that out of the way, let me tell you what I thought of the film based on its *own* merits. Not how I compare it to ""real life"" (after all, as someone said, this is a movie, not a documentary), not how I view it via my biased experienced with whatever football-related history I may have experienced or learned about, etc.<br/><br/>This is one beautiful movie! It's so well-written, the subject matter becomes almost irrelevant. When all the mechanics of great film-making are combined in such a successful manner, a viewer can't help but be engrossed and moved by the happenings on screen.<br/><br/>I'm sure you are familiar with the synopsis, but if not, Elijah Wood gets wrongfully kicked out of Harvard (typical ""victim of circumstance must back out to protect rich politician's guilty son"" theme) and goes to England to visit his sister, who is married to a Brit. The husband is the responsible, upstanding type. However, when Wood meets the husband's younger brother -- the leader of a football gang, or ""firm"" -- one things leads to another and he becomes inducted into the world of violent hooliganism.<br/><br/>That's the plot in a nutshell, but there's more to it than that. So much more. The characters are all very well put together. No one in the film is a hero, not even Wood. But for me, what makes this film truly great is that there is not a single villain or antagonist in the movie for whom you do not, by film's end, feel at least some degree of sympathy.<br/><br/>You are left turning over the characters' different points of view in your mind until, finally, you come to the conclusion that your initial reaction of anger or indignation is pointless. Why? Because you realize the past events in each character's life have always been leading up to exactly what they got in the end. No matter how it pierces you in the gut, there was no other possible turn-out.<br/><br/>Or was there? I suppose in hindsight we can all say things ""could've been different."" But that's wisdom attained too late.<br/><br/>I wish I could say more. A lot more. But that would really give away the plot. So I'll just point out a few specifics I found particularly impressive.<br/><br/>Wood is perfectly cast here. A spineless weakling who has spent his entire life in the cushy world of academia. There is a point by the middle of the film where you see him walking down the streets of London, long after he's been introduced to the ""hooligan"" lifestyle, and the look in his eyes is *wild*. It's angry. Those few seconds alone speak more about Wood's character than all scenes combined.<br/><br/>Wood's brother in law -- the older, upstanding citizen type -- has a haunting past. Who he is, you would never guess (unless you're one of those irritating people who think it's their job to ""outsmart"" a film instead of enjoy it). When he is revealed, it's just... so fitting. It's perfect. The events that follow are truly fateful.<br/><br/>The brother in law's younger brother -- the one whom Wood befriends, and who in turn inducts Wood into the ""firm"" -- is, well... cool. Walks with a swagger, leads the gang, and fears nothing. While his brother had to face his past, this character is trudging headlong into a not all too unpredictable future.<br/><br/>The film is effective, it is moving, it is *heartbreaking* and, at the same time, uplifting. It is one of the best films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Watch it.<br/><br/>PS. Eight stars for the films silly, albeit momentary, portrayal of the *actual* sport of football being some physically hazardous activity where people regularly get their noses broken by flying feet. It is possible someone tries to do a high kick on a ball while another player tries to head it, and the latter gets hit in the nose, but the film obviously made it seem like this was some kind of run of the mill injury. Rubbish."
"djglory03","1","2","6","13 March 2006"," The worst film ever?
","This film is terrible. I can't believe it has such a high average rating. It wouldn't take much to make a half decent film about football hooligans, but these guys fail miserably. First of all Elijah Wood just looks like a scared little boy all the way through the film. The leader of the 'Green Street Elite' goes through several different accents, ranging from sounding Australian to sounding northern but never sounding like he's from anywhere near London. None of the characters deliver convincing performances. Their whole firm seems to consist of about 6 people. Other films on the same subject are far better, such as the much lower budget 'ID' and even 'Football Factory', which wasn't very good itself. They even manage to mess up the fight scenes with lame songs in a weak attempt to make it seem all deep and meaningful when its actually just people who met up to have a fight having a fight."
"shadowtoast","1","2","6","12 September 2005"," Would you Adam 'n' Eve it?
","It's been a good long while since I saw a truly awful movie, but it turns out that I was due. There's little I can add to the (scathing) criticism of this film that's appeared elsewhere. What I would say however, is that even if you can ignore Charlie Hunnam's distractingly bad accent, and EVEN if you can accept that Frodo is really a thug underneath it all, the fundamental problem with Green Street (as it's known under its UK release) is that the script sucks. Really. Sucks very badly. I mean seriously, did the character Peter actually say 'we're gonna end it right now' at one point near the end? The film feels like every bad cliché from every bad 'life on the streets' movie ever made has been dropped into a blender. And what was with the soundtrack to the climactic fight scene? I was expecting it to break into Brothers In Arms.<br/><br/>People have made comparisons with both The Football Factory and Fight Club. The former is a poor comparator - Football Factory had its faults but the portrayal it gave of the motivations of the members of the Chelsea firm was far more convincing than the two-dimensional 'thug by numbers' characterization in Green Street. Ironically the comparison with Fight Club is better, if you can draw some kind of tenuous linkage between the journeys of discovery of Edward Burns' and Elijah Wood's characters. But don't expect any of the invention, wit or intelligence of Fight Club here - you'd be better off just blowing bubbles."
"bombersflyup","10","1","2","16 June 2018"," Matt Buckner: I've never lived closer to danger, but I've never felt safer.
","Green Street Hooligans is a terrific film about violence and heartache, but brings much joy.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood's character Matt, gets embroiled into the world of soccer hooliganism and mateship, helping him become more self-assured. The characters of Tommy Hatcher and Bovver bring the necessary hardness to the film. Claire Forlani's a little underutilized, even if only to add a little sexual provocativeness. In fact, all of the Dunhams could be better. I love the final showdown and everything it entailed."
"Kalle_it","3","1","2","5 March 2015"," Hoolligans: the soap opera
","The movie get so many things wrong or depicts them in such a hackneyed way it's hard to take it seriously or to fathom where all the raving reviews came from.<br/><br/>Apparently one of the most violent firms in English football have no qualms about letting in a preppy American student with zero credentials and negative knowledge about football...<br/><br/>But that's fine, because those hooligans aren't terrible people when not dealing with football... One of them is an airline pilot, another one has the odd position of History AND P.E. teacher at a primary school (unrelated subjects, but go figure... those pesky London schools) and he's even allowed to have random strangers play with/give lectures to his kids...<br/><br/>Alas, all good things come to an end when the jealous henchman decides it's time to betray his pals and strikes a deal (for what?) with the leader of their/his fiercest and most deranged rivals... Things take a turn for the worse, the traitor has another change of heart and comes back for the save.<br/><br/>Frodo can now go back to the U.S., a tougher man, but also more mature and fair, because that's the lesson he learned while bonding with a bunch of friendly psychopaths in London.<br/><br/>Last, but surely not least, the hooligans scene depicted in the movie would have vaguely been credible in the mid 80s, with the bleak neighbourhoods, the stereotypical ""working class England"" setting and, mainly, the complete absence of stadium security that has been enforced since English Football has become a multi-millionaire business that can't be disrupted by a bunch of maladjusted thugs.<br/><br/>P.S. The scene where one of the GSE mocks the rival fans on the pitch dressed as a steward (or being one?!) sums it up pretty well... In contemporary football you couldn't pull it off, not even on the crappiest amateur field, let alone at a Premier League game. You'd not even get close to the stands and you'd be filmed by security cameras from 10 different angles. And no more stadium for you... But apparently the movie takes place in an alternate dimension where no such things exist."
"s6502340","1","1","2","4 August 2014"," Some people actually got paid for this???
","This is one of those moments in life where you sit back and say to yourself; ""Somebody actually got paid for this..?"", That is the only feeling I can accurately describe about this film. I am unsure whether the production team are absolute geniuses or extremely fortunate buffoons! I imagine that it takes quite a lot of education, experience and overall talent to get to the position where you are responsible for the production of a film, so I can only imagine that the people in charge of this production must be laughing themselves to sleep in the knowledge that they have cleverly fed a load of absolute garbage to the public only for it to be lapped up. The acting is awful, the accents are comedic and frankly borderline offensive, and the token American character is beyond the realms of ridiculousness. It's as if Elijah Wood was used as some sort of challenge to see if they could actually pass off the softest baby faced actor as a hardened football hooligan.<br/><br/>I wish I could invent a new word as 'awful' just doesn't cut it with this film, how about disgruvile?"
"low_flying","2","1","2","2 July 2014"," Don't bother
","Sometimes movies are made to tell a broad, overarching story which is tied in to reality using various sub plots. Other times, movies are made about specific ideas or themes which have a story inserted into them, effectively using the story to carry the theme or idea. This movie does neither of these things well at all. In fact, it fails to hit anywhere near the mark.<br/><br/>In reading a lot of the other reviews for this movie, it's obvious that the English are bothered by two things: the accents and the way ""hooliganism"" is portrayed. <br/><br/>As for the accents, most of us are ignorant. In America, at least, accents don't typically play in to people's impressions of others. We have people with southern accents and New England accents, and that's about it. Now if perhaps there was an Englishman in the film attempting an American accent, we might be a little more aware of that, but on the whole, we don't make much of accents. If the movie had been made for viewing only in England, then of course, people would be totally within their right to be annoyed by the terrible accents. But the rest of the world in all likelihood didn't know the accents were bad, and quite frankly, probably didn't care. <br/><br/>""Hooliganism"" isn't something we know anything about, either. As a person who has spent a lot of time reading about the exploits of people like Cass Pennant, Dave Courtney, the Headhunters, Naughty 40, etc., I found the whole movie to be humorous. It was written by a person with limited first-hand experience of firms for people who have even less of an idea about them. No, of course Frodo wouldn't just be able to step into the GSE (ICF) on his first trip to football. What's even more ridiculous is that for a movie which tries to highlight the camaraderie, trust, and respect between members of the firm, they sure had no issue taking on a completely unknown man in Elijah Wood and letting him run with the firm on his first day. ""We're brothers, we rely on each other, and know how to back our mates up. We face pain and severe beatings together as a team and - what's that? Sure new guy, step right up and join out exclusive brotherhood.""<br/><br/>This isn't a movie about ""hooligans"" anymore than it is a movie about a man learning to stand on his own feet. The story chafes at every turn, and even trying to suspend belief long enough to try to relate to these characters is too much. Wood is horrendously miscast to the point of satire. The average age of these lads is 4, and their firm isn't nearly big enough to be believable. The rhyming slang is abusively bad, etc. And here's wood, a Harvard student who apparently never seems to think twice about running with a firm - something most intellectuals would have a very hard time rationalizing. It just makes no sense, and in the end, we're left trying to decide if the movie was about lads playing up at football, or Frodo getting in touch with his inner yob and learning to take it like a man. Just disappointing."

"Bioweapon","5","1","2","6 December 2011"," Mixed emotions
","Providing a pragmatic analysis of this movie is difficult, since conclusions may vary depending which aspect of the movie you focus in: the plot (and its sociological aspects) or the movie itself.<br/><br/>When it comes to the movie itself, it delivers. Performances are solid, times are properly managed, stunts are well done, good costume design. The plot is in some way weak, since it is unoriginal (a guy suffered an injustice, leaves his comfort zone and finds something that will help him redeem himself and grow stronger... similar to ""Scent of a Woman"" in some aspects).<br/><br/>But I can't help to think about the social aspect of the movie. First of all, hooliganism is presented in a mild way, characters are ""bad"" but not as bad as in real life. I mean, come on guys, UK government had to take deep measures to stop hooligans in their own country, since they were unstoppable.<br/><br/>Secondly, the movie tries to present a ""romantic"" aspect of hooliganism: companionship, group cohesion, team spirit and respect. The truth is that Hooligans are a bunch of brainless retards incapable of fitting in a normal society, rebel enough to ""make their own rules"" and cowards enough to avoid acting as individuals (or for the case, using their punching skills in licenced boxing). In my opinion, this is a flaw. Hooligans could have been a raw movie that depicted the cruelty and wilderness of this underworld.<br/><br/>Thirdly, in my home country we suffer the local variety of ""hooligans"", which are known as ""barrabravas"". They are the scum of society, involved in drug trafficking, ticket reselling, extortion, GTA, murder, thievery and many of them have strong bonds with local politicians from the most corrupt political party in Argentina's history: the Peronism (Partido Justicialista). For this reason, even when I may feel some ""empathy"" with the main characters of the movie, I couldn't stop thinking how stupid is to fight a person based on the fact that he likes another football team, and the fact that the characters are plain thugs. If killing someone is an act of savagery, killing a person because he likes a rival team is retarded."

","I was just turned on to this film by a pal of mine who owned it. He was convinced that I would ""like it a lot"" since I'm into violence in movies. I held on to the movie for about 2-3 days before actually viewing it. However, once I viewed it, I couldn't stop watching it. I watched before I went to sleep, I watched it once I woke up, and it was the first thing I watched once I got home from work. To say that I love this movie is not overstating the fact. It's stunningly violent, it's funny, it's clever, and the fellas aren't all that bad to look at either. Independent films are awesome, and this is one of the gems of the genre. I hope to see a lot more from the likes of Charlie Hunnam, Ross McCall, Leo Gregory and Rafe Spall. And who knew that Frodo could kick arse! There were just a few hiccups that I noticed and some that I didn't but later read about. But they were not worth writing here and didn't ruin the film overall.<br/><br/>Excellent film and my pal is going to get a HUGE thank you for introducing me to this it. Yeah, he'll get a huge thank you, but he won't get the movie back...lol."

","This movie was a really bad attempt at trying to mix both the glamour of extreme sportsmanship in the UK with the brutality and violence of gangs in the US while also mixing in the drama and seriousness often associated with Greek tragedies. I did not feel the least bit persuaded that the main character was any kind of a hero with dignity and instead associated him with stupidity. Also, I didn't think that it was possible for me to find gangs as being anymore pitiful than I did already prior to seeing this movie. It was way too melodramatic for a movie that's really about a bunch of sports fanatics. The ending brought a little bit of amusement, although it was also a little too weak. The tagline for this movie should be, ""And you thought gangs were pathetic before..."""
"Mr_Saxon","2","1","2","7 February 2007"," An Awful Film Filled With Terrible Mockney Accents
","I have just seen this movie and feel compelled to comment on it before anyone else makes the same mistake as me.<br/><br/>This is - quite simply - an awful movie. The main problem with the film is that Elijah Wood's character spends the entire running time of the movie reacting to events instead of being pro-active. Imagine that you sit down to watch Die Hard and Bruce Willis spends the entire movie sitting back, watching the bad guys and not actually doing anything. It would be kind of boring and you'd eventually become a bit irritated wouldn't you? Well, that's Elijah Wood here. Instead of making his own decisions, he spends his time trailing after people blinking his little puppy dog eyes and smiling. And that's really it.<br/><br/>What makes the film even worse is the way in which all of the other characters are completely one dimensional. It's hard to believe that the director claims she grew up in the world portrayed here. Characters like the 'hooligans' in this film do indeed exist - but not like this. As someone who lives in London, I was also shocked by Charlie Hunnam's performance. His attempt at a cockney accent is incredibly bad - I initially thought his character was Australian! If i was to find any good points about this movie, it would be the depiction of violence which is suitably shocking. The fight scenes are well crafted; it's just a shame that the story and dialogue (""Are you havin' a bubble?"" one of the characters asks which caused me to giggle) surrounding these scenes are so bad.<br/><br/>Not recommended. Watch 'The Firm' instead."

","Overall a badly researched and poorly made film, with bad dialogue and unbeleivably implausible plot.<br/><br/>But as an English man and West Ham fan all I can say is...ACCENTS I know my American cousins have gave abandon when it comes to English accents BUT.<br/><br/>An Englishman portrays th eleader of the West Ham Crew(Charlie Hunnam) but he is actually a Geordie, a completely different accent to the one he's trying to portray in the film and he does an appalling Cockney accent.<br/><br/>At the start of the film they say they are going to see Birmingham play, (despite the fact that anyone who knows about English football can see they're playing Gillingham). I would like to know why none of the Birmingham fans actually have Birmingham accents either?? <br/><br/>Also the lame way Charlie Hunnam's character goes on about how we (West ham)hate journos (because I assume SHOCK Elijah is an expelled journalism student), well firstly cockneys don't say ""journo's"" , also you average football hooligan really doesn't care what's written about them in the paper in fact a lot are quite proud if their exploits make the newspapers.<br/><br/>Not only this but football hooliganism is an English stereotype and has largely been eradicated from the game It really was an 70s and 80s phenomenon so at least set the film in that time frame. Another point anyone invading the pitch to taunt opposition fans will automatically be banned from every premiership ground in the country and it would take more than putting on a baseball cap to evade detection.<br/><br/>I could make more points such as the fact that fights were organised between rival firms and usually took place at an agreed location away from the ground and the eyes of the police (don't want them ruining a fight!!)The fact that they fight at the start of the film near what looks like Trafalgar square which isn't in the East End, isn't near any football grounds and is far too public for them to risk having a fight in broad daylight sums up what tripe this is..<br/><br/>On the whole not a very well researched story at all. As a life long West Ham fan I can inform you that our hooligans went by the name ""the ICF"" or Inter City Firm because they travelled on Inter City Trains to away matches.

And for there to be so many deaths was a little over-the-top in trying to ram home their point that hooliganism is 'really bad' and is likely to end in serious injury/death! <br/><br/>Football factory was much better (dramatically and definitely with its humour).

"Andyjn","3","1","2","19 September 2005"," forgettable green street
","I must admit, as someone who watches films almost as emphatically as they enjoy watching football, I have been looking forward to Green Street with not only joyful anticipation, but also vexing trepidation. The reason for these mixed feelings is simple. Whereas I am all too familiar with the passion that immerses people in Britain's most watched and most loved sport, I was somewhat weary and quite sceptical owing to the deluge of recent films that have feebly attempted to capitalise on every nook and cranny on western culture and history. <br/><br/>Unfortunately my worst feelings were realised when I watched a ludicrously miscast and grossly exaggerated film that was as unrealistic as it was forgettable. It would not be unreasonable to disagree with The Times' 'The Knowledge' supplement that Charlie Hunnam's cockney accent is the worst since Dick van Dykes, or that Elijah Wood is poorly miscast as a young impressionable lad caught in a zeitgeist renaissance of a London gang. The pros in this film, although vastly outweighed by the cons, would include the ensemble cast, particularly Geoff Bells portrayal of the opposition leader, and the other members of the Green Street Elite. Welcomed also is the depiction of the average hooligan, an educated, considerate and sociable person as oppose to the immoral and depraved hoodlum that the media so quickly vindicates. However the unrealistic clapping and chanting of rowdy West Ham hoolies is choreographed so well Torvill and Dean would take notes, whereas the toe-to-toe fight scenes have been savagely debased through digital trickery. Combined with the nagging deductions that the key material in this film is directly plagiarised from the far superior 'The Football Factory' and 'The Firm', you can appreciate that although it is by no means imprudent to breath new life into such a well documented idea, to do it in such a slip shot execution is outrageously inept. <br/><br/>To see the flaws in Green Street, you have to recognise that it plays like a comic strip chain of events, an embellishment lacking in any of the true grittiness needed in such a poignant and ardent subject."

","Some mildly interesting insights into the lives (so to speak) of the average young male British sports fan, but the writing is pretty much a series of embarrassing clichés strung together to bind the fight scenes. Poor Elijah Wood, I could almost see him cringing at the lines. The crowd I saw it with loved it though, I'm sure it will be a smash hit.<br/><br/>Oh, I need to type more, apparently. Charles Hunnam does a pretty good job as the lead thug. I'll be happy if I never have to see Claire Forlani on screen ever again except maybe in a makeup ad on TV. All of the other characters were completely two dimensional. Can I go now?"

It's like an American read some reports about hooligan violence and then tried to make a near-Hollywood production out of it.<br/><br/>I think it had a good start though. Filmed in London, inside the stadium etc. But then it went downhill very fast. I mean most of the actors were just awful. Really, a geeky Frodo fits right into that hooligan gang? It's just really weird. When he comes to London he's like: ""naaa, i don't wanna do this"", then out of nowhere, he loves fighting??????? And the others accept him??? And one guy goes to the RIVAL TEAM'S hooligans for HELP???????? Absurd. <br/><br/>Way too melodramatic, and Frodos sister seriously cries for like half of the film.

","This film tries to get into the shady world of football hooliganism, the film surprisingly succeeds very well.The main character an American played by Elijah Wood is introduced to a new world of violence by his brother in law.This world is full of guys who drink in pubs dedicated to their own teams, each of which is submerged in its own culture and all have their own songs about the clubs they support with a passion.The passion comes through really well i have been in many pubs where spontaneous singing and chanting break out, however i have never been involved in violence .The violence in this film is realistic and definitely for an adult audience, the people involved in the fights are incredibly loyal to each other and have a pecking order, and it seems the most important quality they have is a bond between them, its just a pity that they behave so negatively.A side issue is that these guys are incredibly normal for most of the week, one of the main hooligans teaches children which considering the philosophy of violence he believes in is quite shocking.It must be stressed that hooligans are a small part of English football but the problem has not gone away."
"Barky44","6","1","3","21 October 2006"," Green Street Hooligans: A Must-See for Film School Students
","Green Street Hooligans is an independent film by German-born director Lexi Alexander. Starring Elijah Wood and Charlie Hunnam, it tells the story of an American's introduction to the violent culture of English football hooliganism.<br/><br/>It's an interesting idea: GSH tries to portray a subculture that, to my knowledge, has never received a motion picture treatment. This alone makes it unique, a clever hook to tell a story about violence taking control of a man's thought process. This is usually Lesson One in any art form: finding a new story to tell.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film has a lot of problems. There are problems with the script, problems with the acting, and problems with the photography. That's why I am giving it a poor rating. It's also for this reason I heartily recommend it for all film school students. All of the problems are completely salvageable, for the premise and foundation are sound. It just has some problems with execution that could be quite educational for aspiring filmmakers. A few of the lessons to learn:<br/><br/>1)When casting against type, modify your script accordingly. Elijah Wood is a fine actor, but he doesn't quite sell the role of a football hooligan (even if the character is a fish-out-of-water). Frankly, he's too small. But the script writers could have compensated for this, by playing up not only his American ancestry and his lack of knowledge about football, but also his small stature. If that was *also* given to his character as an obstacle, the film would have been more interesting. As it is, they glide over that aspect of the character.<br/><br/>2)Every troubled character needs a conscience. In every story, especially stories with violence, you need a ""Jiminy Cricket"" character to represent the internal conflict to a troubled character. This adds the element of decision, of choice, and, therefore, of choices gone bad. Yet Wood's character, Matt Buckner, doesn't have any such character as counterbalance. The sister character doesn't really sell, she doesn't have the authority. And clearly Matt Buckner has contempt for the father character (which is nice, but not really effective as the conscience of the film). <br/><br/>3) Believable, exciting violence is difficult to film. It's taken years to get the technique down. Apparently, Lexi did experience hooliganism herself to some extent, but experiencing it and being able to convey it on screen are two different things. Some fight scenes work well (the brawl in the bar and outside the train station come to mind), but others (like Buckner's first fight in the alley) do not. It was probably a budget restriction, but a good fight choreographer could have done wonders. At the very least, research other films with great fight scenes before attempting to film one yourself.<br/><br/>4) The climax needs a believable element of risk and danger. In the film, Matt Buckner's sister is endangered by a rival gang. Sadly, her reason to be there, and her entrance into the fracas, is horribly contrived and makes no sense. The audience can forgive a lot of plot holes if the film is good, but if the plot hole immediately proceeds the big finish, it takes away a lot of the film's momentum. <br/><br/>5) Don't underestimate the value of sex. If there's anything this film needed, it was at least a smattering of sex. These are adult men engaging in this world of violence, yet there are no women around! Highly unbelievable. I don't think hooligans are an abstinent bunch, it simply doesn't make sense. There is this one brief scene where Matt Buckner gets the phone number of some blonde, but he never hooks up. Are hooligans gay or something? It makes no sense, there should have been some women around, even one-night stands. A well-placed female lead could have provided the conscience needed in #2, or the risk needed in #3. <br/><br/>6) A character's journey needs to be shown, not simply implied. At the end of the film, Matt Buckner confronts a man who screwed him over in college. After perhaps a year of fighting and football-watching, he doesn't look very changed at all. Yes, Wood has a bit more of a scowl, but he just doesn't convey the tough-guy image. The director should have spotted this and made some adjustments, coaching the actor better. It was also a make-up problem: his face isn't even tanned (die-hard sports fans are quite tan in the face); and he doesn't have visible facial scars. His stance isn't even that tough. <br/><br/>7) Music is everything in film. There are some great soundtrack moments (gotta love the Stone Roses), but right at the end, after Buckner's confrontation, it really needed a ""hurrah"" musical moment. Yet there isn't much of one. There is the chanting of ""bubbles"", a pub song oft sung by the gang, but it really needed a bigger moment than that. It just doesn't sell. I don't think the film needed a big John Williams orchestration at that point, but ""bubbles"" wasn't enough. <br/><br/>I don't mean to be overly harsh of Lexi Alexander. She did give it a good try, and I hope she learned from the experience. And I do like the general concept. Perhaps, some time in the future, someone will make a better movie about this subculture. And hopefully Lexi will continue working in film, I sense that she does have a good story in her somewhere.<br/><br/>6 out of 10, but still worth watching for the lessons it provides.<br/><br/>Barky"

","I just finished watching this on DVD and at first I was a bit taken aback by the way that they glamorized the violence, but then I got into the storyline a bit more and found it to be enjoyable. Who knew crazed football fans beating each other up could be so entertaining? If you like films about UK culture this is a must-watch. The cockney accents are hard to listen to at first, but as the film progresses you get used to it. They sound pretty authentic to me... although Charlie Hunnam has apparently been criticized for his work in this movie. Well, all the criticisms aside, I think this movie gave a good insight into ""firms"" and football riots. As the blurb on the back of the DVD said... there's so very, very much more."

"jestang95","8","1","3","23 June 2006"," Extra Reading
","I really enjoyed this movie. Anyone who is reading this has probably seen the movie already, and if so and you would like more reading on this subject, check out the book Among the Thugs, by Bill Buford. It gets a lot more in depth about what really goes on in England regarding the hooligans and their way of life. It was actually written by a ""yank"" who went in to tell the truth about the lives of these hooligans. I really recommend this movie, as well as the book. It is written in journal form from the first person perspective, and at times it is shocking and horrifying. The only major difference between the book and the movie is that in the book the thugs he spends most of his time with are fans of Manchester United."
"xredgarnetx","6","1","3","15 June 2006"," English FIGHT CLUB
","In HOOLIGANS, Frodo gets kicked out of Harvard and goes to stay with his expat sister (the delectable C. Forlani) in England. He immediately runs across a soccer hooligan gang, and the gloves are off for the remainder of this gritty flick that at times looks like a sequel to FIGHT CLUB and at other times like a sequel to A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Apparently, there are roving gangs of soccer hooligans throughout England, if this movie is to be believed. Scary thought. Unfortunately, Frodo is not terribly believable as a college boy turned vicious street fighter, and the gang resembles nothing so much as a road show company of ""West Side Story."" But there is a message here about loyalty and standing up for yourself and your mates that keeps the movie from simply being a series of skirmishes and beer drinking. The movie also contains two decent plot revelations, both having to do with gang leaders. Charlie Hunnan as a head hooligan is impressive in a Paul Bettany kind of way, and his role reminded me of Heath Ledger during his A KNIGHT'S TALE period. Recommended for fans of fighting, although the violence isn't quite as realistic or gory as I would have liked. There is no ear biting or eye gouging or tongue removing, which is what guys usually do when they get together for a bit of a throwdown. You want some more realistic and satisfying violence, rent A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE or RUNNING SCARED."

","After walking past the poster for the premier of Green Street Hooligans taped to the concrete in front of my University Center, the words Stand Your Ground caught my eye. I wanted to attend the premier, but my class schedule would not allow me to do so. I instead waited the five or so months for the film to come out on DVD. The film blew me away. I am an avid futbol fan, but as an American I cannot fully relate to this so called ""hooliganism"". Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, except in America, where baseball and football reign supreme. This movie really captured the intensity and pride that the West Ham fans had for their team. While the movie is brutal, it presents what I feel is a very realistic depiction of this underground thug lifestyle. When watching the World Cup or any sporting event, try to consider the fact that not everything about the sport is glamorous. es, athletes are getting paid millions of dollars to compete, but many fans are losing large sums of money to gambling debts and players are turning to drugs to make themselves perform under the watchful eye of the media as well as the fans. With that said, I just wanted to command the actors as well as the director for providing such a great atmosphere. I have not seen a movie that captures London as well as this one."

It was strange to see the Police so low profile when looking back at the last excursion with Birmingham, it was the Police that probably started the riots a few years back.<br/><br/>And it has been going on a long time also...<br/><br/>Millwall in fact invented many things of the ""hooligan"" brand, the calling card, the ""Millwall Brick"" (a method of taking a tabloid newspaper and making it into a very quick and deadly weapon capable of breaking a thigh bone) but the very thing, the football violence began at Millwall in 1920.<br/><br/>After a shocked parliament debate, it led to since that day, police presences at all football matches.<br/><br/>I think the film casters could have done better than Elijah because of his typecasting as the ""Ringbearer"", he looked out of place and out of sync with the film whereas the lesser actors did their part excellently, this is not a criticism of Elijahs acting prowess but the type of person required in this was more your Ray Winston than your typical Hollywood actor. Elijah lacks the ability to pass off as a thug with any credibility, Imagine you are some 18 stone heavy and he comes at you... what would the result be? Paté de ringcarrieré The passage of boy to man in this is sound enough though, which in essence this film is really about, mixed in with a bit of revenge and plenty of wanton violence in small bursts, keeps the pace running well.<br/><br/>However, the boring bit from this end is that looking back at it all, from my early teens growing up in the south London slums, it can never be justified and I wonder if people out there will identify with this film in the way that I and others identified with ID, the Firm, Scum, Made in Britain, that gives people the boost to move out of the fantasy stage and go forth and create real violence on the streets.<br/><br/>This is probably why this film is being banned in some parts of the US because some people out there see this type of film as an agenda for life and whilst some of us make the break and walk away, I know plenty of ex-Millwall boys either dead or imprisoned for a long long time.<br/><br/>Good film though, he writes looking at his Millwall tattoos, good film indeed."

So when I saw that they had done a movie about West Ham's ICP, I was interested. However, the problem is, that English soccer and even the hooliganism had to play second fiddle to a rather formulaic story. And the story is very formulaic, with hidden secrets, plot twists, predictable conflicts, etc.. It really seemed like the storyline was so interchangeable, that they could have had any sport or form of entertainment to revolve around. Moreover, the acceptance of Elijah Wood into that group strained all credibility. One of the other problems was how the story had to dumb down ""soccer"" in almost every scene. Treating audience members like they did not even know what a soccer ball is, much less Man U.

The movie has an OK storyline, and the bonding between the two guys is enjoyable enough. As is often the case with films like this, someone is going to get hurt badly, the question is who?

They should try walking down Green Street. They'll be tripping up over the kebab and curry houses, and as for seeing any indigenous Londoners, forget it, they all moved out to Essex (the suburbs) years ago. <br/><br/>The violence is over simplified and unreal and the characters are boring and one-dimensional. The ICF (Inter City Firm) was broken up years ago as was the violence and hooliganism that benighted football (soccer to you Americans). Come on, violence like this was eradicated years ago! <br/><br/>The problem is though, for some weird reason, the American film industry has this outdated and outmoded idea that England is awash with football hooligans, druggies, single mothers and derelicts.

Elijah Wood is good though, using his wide eyed naivety as the Yank new to football, or 'soccer ' as he calls it. The film shows how pointless the cycle of violence is, how it goes on and on without an end as each firm gets their own back for violence or perceived offences by another team's firm, then the opposition wants payback for that, etc etc. It shows how violence just ends in sadness and pain and nothing is really achieved, and also shows the humanity behind those who could be seen as mere thugs.

Three of the greatest films ever made and yet after their monumental success two years later he opts to take part in a football hooligans film. Mabe he thought the story was excellent, but in fact was rubbish. The cinematography also, well OK, credit for the mildly nice locations but apart from that it was trash.<br/><br/>Everything from beginning to end was utterly forgettable and should be put down as one of the worst films ever made."
"larry.launders","4","1","4","29 August 2006"," A very well made movie about a bunch of really stupid people...
","There are easily identifiable story lines going here: loyalty, revenge, self discovery, confidence, a couple of bits of mystery, and family. All the makings of a gripping story line that should make for a smashing film.<br/><br/>Except for the setting.<br/><br/>I am an American, and therefore a foreigner to what the rest of the world calls football. I have watched World Cup games, I have watched local level games (both on television and live) in Brasil, and have yet to have run across any trouble at all...although my friends who took me to the games in Brasil were very alert to signs of trouble on my behalf.<br/><br/>Being foreign to the 'culture' of what most of the world calls Football, this was a difficult movie to warm up to. To watch a group of seemingly intelligent people (including a teacher, a pilot, and our protagonist the not-quite-a-Harvard-grad) get so wound up to the point of such stupidity made it hard to get past that point and find anything redeeming about the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>If you can get your brain around what appear to fairly intelligent people willing to fight, damage, terrorize, kill and die for a football club they otherwise have absolutely no affiliation with, then you should enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>Or, if that description of our crew makes your eyes roll, save yourself the better part of two hours and watch something, no...ANYTHING else.<br/><br/>A Harvard student with a notable father gets expelled mostly by his roommate who is of course also a Harvard student with an even more notable father. Elijia Wood (Matt) decides to run to England where his sister now lives and has a family. Since sis's hubby (Steve) has already made plans for himself and lovely bride, our Yank gets pawned off on brother-in-laws brother, Pete.<br/><br/>This apparently isn't what anybody wants, but it starts our protagonist on his Odyssee of being thrust into a culture he has absolutely no knowledge of, including its violence and dedication.<br/><br/>Matt and Pete become fast friends, Pete introduces him to his group of friends including a required-member-who-doesn't-like-outsiders (Bovver). Matt continues to work really hard at fitting in, virtually forgetting all about his sister and family except for occasional scenes. Oh, and all these new friends really hate journalists and conveniently, Matt's notable father is a well known across the world journalist, and Matt was a journalism student, just to make things nice and snappy.<br/><br/>Since Pete and Steve both knew about this, and Steve wasn't happy at all with Pete for getting Matt ""involved"" in his gang, Steve takes it upon himself to save Matt from the wrath the rest of the gang (who eventually learn he's a journalist from a journalist family there to practice journalism on them) Steve goes to the gang's headquarters pub. Here we learn Steve is the somewhat legendary former leader of this gang, why Milwall hates them so much (or at least Milwall's gang leader, who by the way looks like he's only a couple of years away from retirement).<br/><br/>Of course, one of the gang who really, REALLY doesn't like outsiders (Bovver) goes to Milwall and tells them ""hey, we got a journalist in our midst"" but also that the former leader is now at their headquarters, this then instigates a penultimate climactic bar fight.<br/><br/>Which in turn instigates the real climactic fight, just not at a bar this time because it got destroyed in the penultimate climactic fight.<br/><br/>The wrap-up to all these story lines is a bit heavy handed, leaving the following ponderous points of plot: If the Milwall leader knew the name of the GSE leader he held a grudge against all these years (Steve), it doesn't seem that Steve was exactly living discreetly and staying under the radar. Seems he could have been found easily enough to exact revenge upon.<br/><br/>Once it is mentioned that Matt's sister and child ""aren't safe here anymore"", she's awfully cavalier about answering the front door and/or just leaving it wide open...not to mention she has to come find Matt at the real climactic fight and put both herself and baby in harms way just for drama.<br/><br/>Mixed in this mess are a few of moments that explains Matt's family that cumulatively cover almost 30 seconds.<br/><br/>The tale ends with Matt back in the States confronting his former roommate with his newfound violent confidence and sets him up, but conveniently leaves you to your own imagination as to how he uses the setup material because it only goes so far as to let you see it become obtained.<br/><br/>All this movie manages to do, to foreigners such as myself to not-American-football, is reinforce the negative stereotype that football fans are criminally insane. Knowing that stereotype of course doesn't fit the majority of fans, and knowing they don't always exist, doesn't make it any easier to watch this movie."

Real shame that people may come away from this film believing that this is what happens at football matches for your average fan. Football Factory seemed to me to be a much more accurate portrayal of young male culture in Britain in the 21st century.

","OK, lets face facts here - the 'football hooligan' genre film is not a particularly rich seam of cinematic history.<br/><br/>It's been attempted before, and no doubt it will be attempted again. However, on the back of this film, that won't happen for a long long time.<br/><br/>Where do I start ? The soap-opera plot, the terrible dialog, or the even more terrible accents ? It all becomes a swirl of badness after a while. OK - some of the acting is passable, I'll give you that, but the majority is laughable ! Check out the pantomime villain who leads the evil Millwall mob (boo ! hiss !) for details.<br/><br/>After watching this film, the first thing I asked myself was who this film was aimed at. (Not quite true - the first thing I wondered was 'How did this piece of pap get made ?'). Surely its not for the UK market (derision levels would be way too high) or the US market (who, for the most part, don't really care about football). After careful whittling, I could only come up with the idea that this film was made for people who like to look at Eliah Wood. That's it. You're not coming to this film expecting to be entertained, are you ? File this under 'Avoid like the plague'. And I sincerely hope Mr. Wood chooses his next film with more care - he is, after all, not a bad actor, but even a world-class heavyweight thespian would struggle with the diabolical dialogue in 'Green Street'."

","This is a fantastic film. The power of the allure of the acceptance of a firm is greatly illustrated. The main theme applies to many different aspects of society. A man needs to find acceptance and have a role in life. Without that he feels incomplete. <br/><br/>The main character grows and changes right before your eyes and in the end an important lesson is conveyed to the audience. It is a shame that this film did not earn 50mil in the U.S. It is better than any movie that I have seen this year. It has the power of Rocky with the realism of Saving Private Ryan. That is the best I can give you. I am sure that you will feel the same. The violence is very prevalent, but necessary.

"smut_husky","1","1","4","18 September 2005"," There's not one element of this film that works!
","First things first, not one layer of this film worked in my opinion. I really failed to see what the script was getting at. There were times when it was obvious the script intended to glorify football violence, then other moments were it went for the whole ""violence solves nothing"" idea.<br/><br/>One of my major problems with this movie was why a Hollywood star needed to be involved, or more to the point why the Harvard student had to be involved. It was a pointless layer to the script that could have easily have been substituted with a different character. Added to that, the character of ""Matt"" seemed to undergo an extremely rapid and unrealistic descent into this gritty violent world, and seemed to instantly gel with a seemingly inhospitable social group. <br/><br/>Although i don't think it fair to draw comparisons usually, i will in the case of this and the far superior ""Football Factory"". The Football Factory was a film i didn't really enjoy much, or rate highly but it was far more confident in it's story and characters and was far more comfortable in exploring this world then Green Street managed.<br/><br/>With this movie, i felt there was too much of an emphasis on explaining the whole underworld element, and the wider world of football violence never really became evident. Plus, i felt the whole thing was bogged down by the back story involving the rival Milwall firm. I felt with this movie, it was hard to point out a lead character. Who was the focus??? Was it the leader of the GSE with the ever metamorphising accent? Was it his elder brother? Or was it Elijah Wood whose only role in the movie was to go through a cringworthy and clichéd journey??? I just couldn't stand this movie, and i feel like i'll be here forever in trying to put that across. But just to wrap things up...the performances are on the whole terrible and not believable enough, the story is weak, the characters un endearing and ending disappointing. If you want a movie about football violence and that whole suburban society go watch the football factory, if you've seen it and want more of the same, you won't find it here. Utter tripe !"
"larrywhitemgt","10","1","4","18 September 2005"," This is a great piece of work.
","Green Street Hooligans is one of the best films of the decade. The cast is flawlessly authentic and every performance is an absolute masterpiece. This was a great career choice for both Elijah Wood and the amazing Charlie Hunam. (I think I spelled his name wrong). In any case, this is a great script with a great cast. I can't wait to see it again and again. There are many scenes of violence that are quite well staged and seemingly authentic. Football in Great Britain is taken very seriously and this film delves into the truths of the fans' commitment. The performances are outstanding from every actor in this well cast and beautifully directed masterpiece. Do yourself a favors and see it on the big screen. You won't be disappointed."
"Tomst7","7","1","4","12 September 2005"," Simply NOT Football Factory....
","Firstly, I have just found out that Charlie Hunnam is not an American attempting an East London accent, but a Geordie. Why a Londoner was not cast I will never know, but I do know that with him as the main character the whole film is let down. Don't get me wrong, he is a good actor. But there is no conviction behind the acting when he doesn't know how to ""speak proper"" and says ""mate"" way too much for a real Londoner. Not once does he say ""guv"", ""bruv"", ""ya know wot I mean"" or any other slang common to any East London lad. And frankly it feels like the film is trying to fool the audience. Give us some credit please.<br/><br/>Just easy things like make up are awful. On 3 occasions at least Elijah Wood has a harsh vertical cut dissected by 2 horizontal cuts down his face from merely being punched once by an opposing fan. Now I'm no Firm member but I've been in fights and I know that the morning after you will get bruises like you wouldn't believe after some of the things the characters go through.<br/><br/>Little points like the amount that they drink in the pub before the match are inaccurate. Proper geezers/nutters would have 3 pints at most: any more hinders their ""performance"". I have this on great authority having drunk with members of the Tottenham Hotspur firm...The Yid Army.<br/><br/>However the most incorrect part of this film is the fact that a lad turned just turned 20 could run a Firm. In football Firms you only get to the top through years of fighting next to your fellow lads. Even the ""Major"" is mid 30's at most, and neither are anywhere near as intimidating as the real thing.<br/><br/>I went into this film with probably too high expectations, having seen the beautiful ""Football Factory"" a year back. However it let me down through it's numerous inaccuracies and things which simply didn't make sense: A Head of a West Ham Firm would no sooner stab a Yank than look at him, let alone take him under his wing.<br/><br/>The only saving grace I can see from this film is the fantastic performance of Leo Gregory playing Bovver. He was the only intimidating member of the Firm and then acted superbly when drinking Vodka down by the Thames having nearly killed his old Boss.<br/><br/>Put simply: ""Green Street/Hooligans"" is let down by sloppy dialogue, inaccuracies due to lack of research, bad casting and, although it has great potential, is let down by trying to be 2 films at once: A moral film and a violent film at the same time.<br/><br/>At least Football Factory knew what it was, and didn't pander to the American audience. Americans trying to make a British film."

I'd go see it again if it gets a theatrical release.<br/><br/>Although the story is very ""fight intense"" the characters were rich and fully developed and made you care about whether they got hurt or won or loss. And although Elijah Wood was the lead and gave an outstanding performance, I think it was really Charlie Hunnam's performance that was the break out of the film. He WILL be a star if given the opportunity.<br/><br/>Overall I'd have to say it was a great indie flick!"

I can also recall a made for TV film that involved an undercover cop infiltrating a gang of hooligans but I cannot remember the name of it - think it was on Channel 4 and probably made by them - the main character got really into his alter ego and at the end still thought he was an undercover cop infiltrating a group of Neo Nazis - anyone know what it was called?"

","I went to see a preview of this film last week before its general release in the UK as Green Street next month and having seen some good reviews of it on here, I went with some quite high expectations. I can't complain about the acting, but the storyline and some slight niggles left me a bit disappointed. It was difficult to believe that Elijah 'pretty boy' Wood would ever get involved in a Fight Club-style street brawl; Charlie Hunnam, whilst a good actor, does the most unconvincing cockernee accent since Dick Van Dyke; and the dialogue and the singing at the end made me feel I was watching an Americanised version of a British story, rather than feeling involved in it. Other niggles such as 'Birmingham' actually being Gillingham, hooligan fights in Bank where in fact nothing at all happens at weekends, Bank not having an overground platform and 'Manchester' being a dead ringer for Fenchurch Street station did nothing to draw me into the film. Other comments say they find it difficult to believe how a Harvard kid can get drawn into football and its tribalness so easily, but as a British football fan it's easy to understand. What's not so easy to understand is why a group of British football fans would accept a wet-behind-the-ears American who's never been in a fight and states his major as History. Overall the film was entertaining, but for a British audience some of the dialogue is far too corny and American to be believable. The Football Factory does the same job much better, with better characters, better story and more humour. Check that out instead."

","I had heard bits and pieces about this film, I knew the leading American actor, I knew it was made in Britain, and I knew it had something to do with football, so all those things in mind I tried it out. Basically student Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood) has been wrongfully expelled from Harvard, set-up for stashing cocaine, and he decides to travel to London, England to live with his sister Shannon Dunham (The Rock's Claire Forlani) and her husband Steve (Hustle's Marc Warren). He quickly meets Steve's cocky younger brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam), who helps him know the ropes and what's what as he will be seen as an ""outsider"", but after a few sessions of heavy drinking this changes. Matt establishes himself as part of the gang, or firm, of football hooligans the GSE - Green Street Elite, and after football matches their enemies are the gang of Birmingham City thugs. Initially he is opposed and afraid of getting involved in any violence, but he becomes desensitised to it, almost enjoying it, and he gains more of an independence as well. His attitude changes almost completely that he is reluctant not to return to America with his father Carl (Henry Goodman) and put the expulsion events to rights. In the end however Matt does return to the United States after some pretty harsh events, such as the attacks and getting into fisticuffs with Jeremy, I would assume he is alright. Also starring Leo Gregory as Bovver, Geoff Bell as Tommy Hatcher, Rafe Spall, son of Timothy as Swill, Kieran Bew as Ike and Ross McCall as Dave. Wood's wide-eyed and often scared look does help his character, but none of the other actors really stick out much, not even reasonable stars Warren or Forlani, I agree with the critics that the violence of the well known football hooligans should have been the focus more than relationships within, a predictable crime drama. Adequate!"

And I would say that for the most part, it explores themes and situations that are largely new and untouched. That's hard to say about many films, but this one is one of a kind."

","My goodness this was a boring movie. I still don't quite understand the theme, was it sports, fighting, distant father relationship, expelled from college, journalism? It reminded me of Brad Pitts movie, Fight Club (but Fight Club was better).<br/><br/>The only strong, memorable, noteworthy acting I saw in this movie was by the thug, Tommy, that only had a few minutes in the whole movie.<br/><br/>The story just reminded me of street thugs fighting about football; an all too common theme in British films, like we're suppose to have a connection to their barbarism. It was kind of stated in the movie, it's not what your friends can do for you, but what you can do for them (something stupid like that)."

","It's a while gone seeing this movie for the first and absolutely only time, but the story was predictable (that the brother in law is old boss of the firm, is pretty clear after 10 or 20min)and the characters really are ridiculous, especially Elijah Wood whom i not believing a second that his character has a fascination of football violence. I don't really understand people here comparing this movie with football factory and actually say, this is the more realistic movie.One has said, A Hooligan can't be a Florist (Billy Bright/Tommy Johnnson), of course he can be, that is one of the Problems, if you think about hooligans as a ""crisis"" of society, there is no frame what a hooligan does on the weekdays, you having all kind of different people. I'm from Germany, so I don't know about English football from experience, but seeing the Guys from Football Factory brings back some memories. Seeing the Guys from Hooligans really brings me laughter, because you can see that the actors don't even have a clue about footballculture. And a moral point really is the shocking statement at the end of Football Factory saying, Was it worth it? of course it was worth it, not some American outsider gets back to his original purpose. Everyone who is going to football games and supports their teams with all heart and support football in ways they ever prefer, know that this movie is the less ambitious work ever done in the context of footballculture."

","There is no nil on the IMDb rating system. Which is a pity. Because that's what this dismal pile of sentimental offal deserves. A big round nil. <br/><br/>The accents: It would be alright to pick one actor incapable of speaking with a proper east London accent, perhaps. But to pick all of the actors on the basis of their inability to talk in a convincing dialect seems a little perverse. I expect that Elijah Wood's American accent is wrong, too, but I can't tell. <br/><br/>The plot: I couldn't care less whether plots are realistic or not, but they need to obey at least an inner logic, and this one fails on that score. Thrown out of Harvard because his roomie was dealing blow, Mr Wood lands among a bunch of ""thugs"" as soon as he hits London. I really believe that one, just like the idea that an ex-hooligan is now a big wheel in the city or something generically successful, like Mr Wood's brother-in-law is meant to be. <br/><br/>The message: The most repugnant thing about this film is its message. Essentially it's telling us that hooligans are all good fellows really, that the feeling brotherhood that they offer to the waifs and strays at the edges of society is a good thing. The film ends with the lamentable Mr Wood singing ""I'm forever blowing bubbles"" triumphantly, having stitched up his blow-dealing roomie, with the message being that he has grown and matured from his contact with the London yobs. Soryy, but it's not that diofferent from doing a Waffen SS buddy movie. Any plans for something like that in the pipeline? Because these people are viciously racist anti-semites who maim, injure and intimidate with impunity. Which makes the film not only dreadful but completely amoral in the worst possible way. Waffen SS here we come. Oh, and if you want to see a good film about English youth, watch the wonderful This is England."

","First of all i have to recognize that they made a good effort, it's not a bad movie but i don't think they captured the real feeling of hooligans, for my taste it had a lot of American details like: the ""secret past"" dude (the grown up guy happens to be the retired major), the happy ending (the Yank learns to be strong, grows some testicles, kicks some ass and leaves singing a West Ham United song: I LEARNED A LOT, I'M STRONGER...you know, you've seen it time and time again), too me those superational details are the American details you might find in almost all of Hollywood big hits. And about the cast it's just very complicated to me to see Elijah Wood being brave and intimidating ANYONE else, the dialogs are just a little to cliché (sorry, i also hate the word cliché, but i couldn't find a better word) to me, like the way the British talk about Americans: ""We saved your life in World War II"", ""You Americans don't know about football"". Now, don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, it also has a good story, but the American details (that they might added to get some audience and to ""not promote violence) end up by stealing a little of the English essence of being a hooligan, but that's just my opinion, anyway, watch it, but i wouldn't buy it."

","Caught this rubbish on TV the other night. I have to say the glorification of hatred and violence shown sickened me. I am not surprised that West Ham FC distanced themselves from the movie; I am sure that the vast majority of their fans must be embarrassed at the depiction of mindless knuckle-dragging morons 'supporting' their team. English football has been trying to rid itself of this sort of culture of violence for many years, and has largely succeeded. Their cause will not be helped by movies such as this. In my opinion everyone who had anything to do with the making of this film, from Elijah Wood down to the key grip and best boy, should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. Morally bankrupt as it may be, it is also poorly characterised and acted, with fake cockney accents and over the top posturing. I've seen other movies about football hooligans, such as 'the Football Factory' which were pretty awful, but this pile of you-know-what really takes the biscuit. For me it's the worst film to hit the big screen for a very long time.

I simply do not feel that it is a masterpiece in any way.<br/><br/>The cast is great, I usually get really annoyed with Elijah Wood, and sort of still did, but I think he did a fantastic job in general. The story, as I said, is fairly one dimensional, it really revolves around gang fights and not much more but it was done extremely well.

","Cannot understand why this film seems to polarise opinion. Perhaps it is too violent for some. This film was the 2nd or 3rd feature made by a German-born female kick-boxing champion who now resides in California. Maybe some people are unnerved that a 'teutonic yankee bird' can deconstruct, with such unrivalled acuity of perception, the forces of working-class English tribalism, with far greater style and wit than ANY home-grown efforts. THIS IS A MUST SEE. Elijah Woods delivers a performance of subtlety and puissance, never once making us question the plausibility of his character's transformation from Harvard Golden-boy to Eastend Nutter. Sure, there's a lot to take in, but if you stick it out to the end - unlike so many other reviewers - the rewards are plentiful. Seen it 5 times already and it gets better upon each viewing, with new details leaping out at the viewer from its meticulously constructed complex narrative strands, and sensitive (and wholly believable) characterisation. In short, this is a film for any thinking fan of cinema, who doesn't like overly-pretentious and ponderous foreign efforts."

The script is a joke, the acting is pathetic and as for some of the accents they sounded like they were from a masterclass run by the Dick Van Dyke School of British Acting.<br/><br/>This is an unpleasant film attempting to portray English thugs as heroes belonging to some working-class tribe who are loyal to each other while breaking the law. Note the use of the word ""English"" as football hooligans are uniquely English and not British.<br/><br/>The final straw for me was the music played as the fight at the Millennium Dome started.

This clearly shows what a great actor he must be. The other actors, like Charlie Hunnam, play their part very nice too.<br/><br/>And, as I said before, the plot is well written.

","Americans should make a movie about American life solely. When Hollywood movie makers try to adapt some alien ideas, they never make it right. Apparently it happens, because this alien idea in authentic aspects never will get support enough in America and will be not well sold. And exactly Hollywood movie makers take their native subjects and disguise that by mysterious foreign cover. Of course, there are exceptions out of this rule, but ""The GSH"" film, which I watched yesterday unfortunately isn't one. <br/><br/>Couple of words about plot line. Modest American boy, who got kicked out of Harvard by mistake, has come to London to sister. Certainly, her husband turn out a brother of top lad of most famous ""firm"" of football fans. Of course modest American boy and this leader of thugs become a best friends. In the end modest American boy became ""not a boy, but a male"". Scheme for similar sort of movie is quite standard. Modest American boy's part was portrayed by ""pretty flower"" Elija Wood. No comments. <br/><br/>In either case, there is problem with clash of two worlds in a film. World of civilized American middle class in the person of Mr. Wood and world of mad British football hooligans. And if portrayal of first isn't raise any doubts, I have some comments in connection with second one. <br/><br/>First of all it's a bunch of a nice ways for more clear division on ""black"" and ""white"". I can't get why leaders of rival firms are brutal gloomy males entirely, but our top boy looks like a top model. Young, with perfect body, and diabolical righteous, righteous up to disgust. He is teacher in school (my God!) at the free time, beyond fan fights. <br/><br/>Next. I have no idea about reasons of football violence, but I don't think that it's connected with some personal motives. I also don't think that whole firm is just going to fight only for decision of personal problem of single member, even if he is leader. But I must repeat, I have no idea about that and I can err. <br/><br/>Third. It's everlasting Hollywood pathos. Diffuse speeches about eternal values. That's really annoying. The gang, when they are going to final fighting look likes Hector going to fight against Achilles.<br/><br/>And last. I can't believe, that near-graduate of Harvard couldn't find any better ways of spending time. I also can't believe that becomes the member of British hooligans firm so easily.<br/><br/>Sum up. I can say that this film is a good commercial project, no more. Somebody who has no idea about British football violence will be caught the fancy. Moreover Mr. Wood, whatever you may say, has coped with difficult task very well, displayed that transformation very convinced. Although modest American boy isn't convincing as ""male"" he really has lost image of ""little boy"" forever, I hope. As regards everything else... Don't worry. It's just Hollywood."

This is real footage of a game, however the team are supposed to be in the Premiership when the film was made however the season before it was made they were relegated. In the game footage they are in fact playing against a Championship team who look to be Brighton & Hove Albion or Gillingham, this not only be worked out by the kit they wear but their sponsor.

"pecosshafer","10","0","1","29 September 2006"," One of the best story lines in film
","Elijah Wood pulls this movie off, but the characters around him fill in holes and also make this movie compelling. Gritty, hardcore, and somewhat poetic storytelling made me think that Shakespeare would have written this if he were living in today's world.<br/><br/>Wood leaves America and his college troubles behind and travels to England where he transforms into a ""hooligan"" soccer fan who enjoys a pint of beer a the local pub with his new mates. <br/><br/>The fights are awesome, but nothing so extreme that it might cause you to get sick. In fact, the hooligans seem to have a code of conduct where they use only hand-to-hand combat and a few foreign objects (beer bottles, bricks, and the occasional scrap of lumber or a rock)--Essentially, the soccer fans fight against each others for team pride. It's the idea of neighborhood pride, not just cheering for the local team you live near and root for: But rather, actively seeking out the hooligan fans of other teams and engaging in street fights with them.<br/><br/>Reading the comments by British persons whom have viewed this film, you get the sense that they are not at all impressed by the plot, the actors and their accents, and the entire film itself. Their comments are mostly very negative about this film, which puts a damper on my personal viewing experience because I believed whole-heartedly in the film. So, to the UK fans I say this: It makes up for the hack jobs us Texans have to endure when we see a bad impersonation of our Texas accent and our ways of life. That stuff just happens when your national/regional identity is more unique or outlandish than those around you. Take it as a compliment. I am sure the Australian audience also gets its fill of bad Aussie characterized films, too.<br/><br/>Back to the fil itself: I suggest putting on the subtitles so you can read what is being said: You can read the lines and get a better grasp of what is being said and communicated in each scene. Otherwise, you might get lost in the amazingly fast tempo that the English actors incorporate into their speaking styles.<br/><br/>The storyline is about boyhood friendship, defending each other in the face of others who seek to shame you, and the concept that we all need someone to ""catch our backs"" if we're up against the wall in life. In contrast, it's also a tale of what happens when we choose to associate ourselves with those who engage in activities that risk your own life, and the lives around you.<br/><br/>Language is rough, so don't watch this with someone that might get offended by the f-bomb and other vulgarities. It's vintage ""English"" hooligan dialect and terminology in the film, so be aware that they talk pretty rough throughout the film.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed ""Layer Cake,"" then you will also like this film."

","There is only one good thing I can say about this film, after about two hours it ends and you can forget all about it. Everything in it is laughable to anyone who has ever been to a football match. The story line is about as weak as the acting, and the way Elijah Wood strolls away at the end singing about West Ham makes most normal people want to vomit.<br/><br/>There are so many things which just don't make sense (How is one of the firm a pilot? Why does the hobbit look down on his roommate for doing drugs while firms are notoriously linked with it? (ofcourse not mentioned in this Hollywood film who want you to be on the side of the ""goodies"" the GSE) why is the top bot of the firm an Ozzie? and finally why do we care what happens to any of them? After watching the football factory I thought it was a shame not to have any real football footage in it, but after seeing how appalling it looks in Green Street you realise Nick Love got it right omitting any shots of a match.<br/><br/>Hooliganism is a dangerous topic to cover for any film maker as hooligans aren't really the stereotypical Hollywood good guys, yet Green Street tries to make us like them and think of them as the comic book heroes. People might feel sorry for what happens to Pete but think back to the start of the movie where he says something anti semitic to the Totenham fans. He then proceeds to beet one of them with a bin, which would probably have killed them in real life. Is it really such a bad thing that this obviously racist thug dies? The film does a good job in getting you on his side and at the end you do feel sorry, but if you think about it afterwords, a lot of that sympathy goes.<br/><br/>Having said all of that I'd still recommend that you watch it so that when you next watch a bad film, you'll realise it could be a lot worse."

I am from England and this movie romanticizes and some how tries to take a noble turn on people who are mindless morons with a bent for violence hiding in mobs to achieve their agenda - which is destruction simply for the sake of it. There is no one blood , there is no honour and there is nothing nice , decent or good about the football hooligan. NOTHING. So , if this movie makes you feel good in any way. Realise it is a work of absolute fiction with no basis in truth other than the existence of the blood , the bashing , the crunching of teeth and bones , the desire to smash someone in the face , to kick his effing head in and watch him puke on his own body fluids. That is the ONLY thing hooliganism is about. There is no code of ethics. None at all. As far as I am concerned this is a movie made for Americans and is a gross miss portrayal of the reality of Hooliganism. Let me tell you the truth. There are nearly 60 million people in GB squished into a land mass the size of one of the US's smaller states. The Church , the Upper class and the Crown own ALL of the Land in GB. The people , the masses are relegated to the cities and it is truly very difficult for anyone in England to own a decent sized chunk of land anywhere. The result ?. Rats turning on one another like rabid scum and using football matches as one of the outlets for their desire for violence. In reality this is no different than the inner city violence erupting in US cities for exactly the same reasons. Too many people in too small a space. That is the reality of hooliganism.

Football firm's are still active today, but not as portrayed in Greenstreet!, (eg An Airline pilot who is a Hooligan come match day, and the Leader of the West Ham Firm managing a worse Cockney accent than Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins!(Great Film by the way) Anyway to set the record straight....originally 'football firm's' came out've the late 60's/early 70's when it was more of a Working Class London youth culture which spread across the country,(similar to the Mods v Rockers rivalry), kids between the ages of 15-21 would fight for there clubs and particular area or town they were from, that was the norm from the early 70's up until the mid 80's when security at English football grounds was almost non-existent, it was almost fashionable to fight at football in those days, it was a youth culture that carried on in a sad way to adulthood, unfortunately some of the youth's who started off rucking at football in the early days are still trying to do it now.... which is a joke!, but it is still around in this country and is very active in Europe and South America. Trying to explain 'football violence' to a North American would be hard as they are pretty gullible!(inturn believe Greenstreet!), but the closest thing I can relate it to is the Hip-Hop culture that come out've the Bronx, NYC in the 70's, where different gangs and crews would battle each other for supremacy, B-boy's, DJ's&MC's would go to different area's or borough's and battle rival crews etc, again a working class culture which spread across a nation and beyond, a way of life to the people involved. If you want a more realistic view on this subject have a look at a real-life documentary titled 'Hooligan' a documentary examining the 'Inner City Firm' or 'ICF' - a core of West Ham football supporters made up of professionals dedicated to the orchestration of organised hooliganism and violence. The documentary went on to inspire Alan Clarke's 'The Firm'."

","Hooligans has a good way of showing how hooliganism is in Britain. But the movie really lacks of some of the major issues that involves in hooliganism. <br/><br/>It shows a band of friends who will do anything for each other and never desert each other. Who in the name of their football club Westham and their firm GSE, will do anything to protect their rep. The movie shows how the hooligans are not just the typical violent offender, who will attack an old lady if they had the chance. The movie informs that the fights the hooligans have are arranged and only involve those who seek to fight as well. <br/><br/>But there is more to hooliganism than the movie shows. There are a lot of drugs involved in the football violence environment and most hooligan firms are right winged, which this movie has chosen to show. The movie doesn't show what happens on the away trips the GSE have. For example on buses or trains. The British hooligans also listen to a lot of British rock and pop, and many come from the lower working class. I think that the Football Factory gives a better perspective of what happens in the hooligan environment. Football factory has a real British touch to it, where as Hooligans is a bit too Hollywood for my taste."

","I felt this movie was a) too contrived (wasn't it convenient that the bother law was the major) b) too unrealistic (come on really? soccer gangs??) and c) it tried too hard to make soccer violence cool- I'm sorry but i just wasn't buying anyone's tough bad guy role.<br/><br/>I didn't identify with this movie at all. Maybe if i was male or a soccer person I would've related to some parts but being a 20 something female I didn't get half the reasons for the character's actions. If this had've been a good movie I would've enjoyed it remotely despite not relating (ie. I loved usual suspects despite being a male and I know guys who loved devil wears prada despite being a movie about females) A movie has to be deemed a great movie in order to obtain fans that cannot relate to the superficial relations/actions/situations of the characters.<br/><br/>While people may dispute the purpose of movies...is it to entertain? educate? create social awareness? I found this movie had nothing. It didn't entertain me and it didn't show me the true world of soccer fans. It felt like it was trying to make English soccer fans cool and tough and glorified the violence they caused and yet it didn't provide any moral or reason. It was violent to Be ""cool"" and lacked any insight into the character's choices."

","""Green Street Hooligans"" fortunately isn't a worse version of ""Football Factory"". Even though the subject of films is the same (football hooliganism), both movies visibly differ. In contrast to ""Football Factory"", ""Hooligans"" doesn't have a humorous bent and has a clear-cut message. Namely, the violence addiction is destructive and does not leave anybody unharmed. The film says that violence is indispensable part of every man's life and every man is, like the main character played by Elijah Wood, susceptible to it if only he has an opportunity. Matts falls deeper and deeper into the firm under Pete's influence. On the other side, the movie has a good pacing and fight scenes shot with a feeling. The acting is exceptionally good. In particular, Charlie Hunnam as an ambiguous Pete Dunham did a good job. His balance acting oscillates between practically two different characters (brutal vs caring). Major vices of this film are its predictability and that some threads are far-fetched, but still it remains a profound insight into the hobby of sport-obsessed England."

Most of the adulatory views of this movie come from an America safe from the phenomenon of the football hooligan and where they may be regarded as some sort of exotic species ,here in the UK we are under no such misconception. Dougie Brimston,the co-writer of this rubbish,has made a living out of chronicling street violence connected to football for some time.

There is-for want of a better word - a plot but it is an insult to the intelligence of anyone over the age of nine.There is also - yet again for want of a better word - acting,albeit outrageously bad acting.It is as if the director assembled all of the thesps who failed their auditions for ""Eastenders"" and shut them in a pub with instructions to drink themselves stupid for 3 days then filmed the results. I will not court the libel laws by naming names,but many of these actors are clearly more used to resting than acting,and,in an ideal world,will remain so. There is not a single imaginative shot in the whole movie,not one believable moment.I watched in vain for the slightest sign that a creative hand was on the tiller.

"tohu","6","0","1","18 June 2006"," Graphic, thought-provoking and worth seeing.
","I was encouraged to see this film by reading some of the more effusive IMDb comments. Well, it isn't as good as they led me to believe. But I certainly don't regret seeing it.<br/><br/>If you live in the UK you know about football hooliganism. Even if (like me) you don't go to football matches, you can't avoid it. It's a part of our culture, sadly. Football is a hugely emotional game, which large parts of society take very seriously. And - when fuelled by alcohol and a trouble-making minority - this does occasionally does spill over into violence and gang warfare.<br/><br/>It is very very very rare - and that's an important point to make to anyone overseas who may be inclined to believe the problem is worse than it is. But it happens. And the value of a film like this is to help portray that and even perhaps understand why.<br/><br/>The more complimentary reviewers of this film all make this point, and they are right. They are also right that the film is well-made and atmospheric. The violence is shockingly realistic without being glamourised, and we see also the camaraderie and enjoyment that attracts people to being part of such gangs in the first place. We are left at the end of the film feeling we have witnessed something that must be quite close to the true experience of being part of the world portrayed.<br/><br/>Where the film falls down is in the performances. There are some decent actors here, but none of them are allowed to shine. It is almost as if the bleak concept of the movie discourages any enjoyment of playing their roles and so squeezes out the possibility that we can truly sympathise with any of the characters.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood is, ultimately, miscast, quite failing to achieve any basic credibility as the naive outsider drawn into this extraordinary world. And I'm not sure what Charlie Hunnam's true-life accent is, but if he isn't capable of turning in a better version of cockney than this, then it would have been far better to allow him just to use his normal voice - or get another actor. As it is, his bizarre Dick van Dyke impression is risible and distracts attention throughout from what should be the most important single role in the film.<br/><br/>Some may feel that is a bit harsh, and other performances do their bit to make up - notably I think Leo Gregory as Bovver, the borderline psychopath who actually manages to engage emotionally at times. But the fact that the film succeeds at all is really a credit to the script, which does shine with originality and vigour, in spite of a leaden acting style from a seemingly dispirited cast.<br/><br/>It is a bleak film, overall. There aren't many laughs here, and London has rarely looked so joy-less on screen. But then, it's a serious subject. It deserves a serious and thought-provoking treatment. And it gets that with Green Street.<br/><br/>Go and see it. But brace yourself."

","Chronicaling the lives of rival soccer (football!) fanatics in England, GSH offers a gritty, somewhat realistic view into some of sports most misguided fans. While bordering on overzealous, the plot is sustained by the collective spirited grunts exuded throughout this film testifying to the power of brotherhood in sports. The overall appreciation for the love of the game and a love of the groups that support them overshadow any over the top scenarios the die hard football fanatics get themselves into, providing an entertaining time for young male sports fans to sink their teeth into. Elijah Wood portrays his metamorphosis with quiet integrity, making this one of his more interesting lead performances. Right through to a gut wrenching climax, the film adds onto it's momentum, drawing even non sports fans into the partially commendable code of street ethics those willing to live for their particular British football teams selflessly display"

"chriswright-2","2","0","3","11 April 2006"," This is not a good review
","This review contains lots of spoilers. Trust me, you're better off knowing how bad this film is before you spend any money.<br/><br/>Basically a half-hearted retread of the superior ""I.D."", This film attempts to show the reality of a life of football hooliganism using quasi-""Fight Club"" philosophy and ""Grange Hill""-style acting.<br/><br/>Those who say that this film does not glorify violence must have seen a very different cut from the one that I watched. Not only is violence given status as a way to ""feel alive"" (you'll see what I mean about ""Fight Club""), but no explanation is offered as to why Elijah Wood's character gets involved in the first place. He turns up, gets invited to a football match, nearly gets beaten up, and then he's a football hooligan. Why? Just because.<br/><br/>The acting is mostly poor, with the best performances coming from incidental characters, while the leads butcher the already hackneyed and predictable script.<br/><br/>The most obvious offender from the beginning of the film is Charlie Hunnam as gang leader Pete. It is unbelievable that this guy, who hails from Northern England, has a London accent worse than Dick van Dyke's. I thought he was an American actor making a bad job of the accent until I looked him up on the IMDb. This performance jars from the first scene of the film, and is one of the major factors that gang up on this film and kick its head in.<br/><br/>Despite being filmed on location, using mostly British actors and including footage of real football matches, the film feels as though it is being viewed through an American filter. A typical example the idea that London (a city of ten million people) cannot be navigated without running into people you know at every turn.<br/><br/>Wood's character receives no development - considering that we are supposed to be seeing the world of football hooliganism through his eyes, it would have been nice to know more about him than simply the fact that he is an American student. The other lead characters are also two-dimensional at best.<br/><br/>Major plot developments make no sense whatsoever. For example, at the end of the film, a main character turns up driving past a fight at Trinity Buoy Wharf, supposedly on her way to the airport. Aside from the fact that you can't get to an airport by driving onto Trinity Buoy Wharf, she has no business being there, and could have quite easily escaped without her arrival becoming the pivotal plot point that it turns out to be.<br/><br/>Other major plot points suffer from the same problems. A member of ""the firm"" becomes disgruntled for apparently no reason when Wood's character arrives, and his first act is to ride six and a half miles across London on a scooter, in order to eat a pie and pea supper in the middle of territory belonging to a vicious rival gang. Please, someone tell me why. The same character's later ""Judas"" role becomes predictable but utterly without explanation.<br/><br/>Also, a major character turns out to be a former hooligan, and despite this development being telegraphed from the start, it is presented as a shocking surprise twist. This is only mildly satisfying as you get to turn to your fellow viewers and say, ""told you it was him,"" having predicted it within the first ten minutes. As a whole, the story is riddled with holes, and is deeply unsatisfying.<br/><br/>The much-praised violence is in fact presented in a series of fast cuts, and usually takes the form of someone being hit in the side of the face, turning their head and having a bit of blood fall out of their mouth. Any sense of realism is taken away by the Rocky IV-style punch sound effects.<br/><br/>Journalists are held up as figures of hatred for the hooligans, and when it is revealed (in another unrealistic scenario) that Wood's character is a trainee journalist, the vitriol he encounters just doesn't add up. An earlier vague suggestion that ""journos"" tell lies about hooliganism is thrown away by the fact that no lies are actually told by any journalist at any point in the story. There's a sense that a whole section of the film has been cut in which the hatred of journalists is set up. As it stands, the idea doesn't hold up.<br/><br/>The story is weak and predictable, the message weak and pointless, and the casting lazy.<br/><br/>The ultimate truth behind this film is that it has been done before, and far better. I recommend watching ""I.D."" instead, in which undercover policemen infiltrate a football hooligan gang, and real tension is created by the fear of what will happen to them if their identity is discovered. ""ID"" also has a good story, and a central character who we learn a great deal about, as well as inventive plot devices and terrific acting, as well as hooliganism scenes with genuine realism and menace.<br/><br/>For those who have commented positively on this film, I have only one thing to say:<br/><br/>Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough."
"dopeydave98","6","0","2","4 April 2006"," A Movie of Two Halves...
","I had heard much about this movie and was very much looking forward to seeing it. The most apt a description I can give is that this is a movie of two halves. The first half starts well, we get into the action pretty quick and there's a lot of exciting stuff. The second half descends into melodrama and stumbles along to a predictable conclusion.<br/><br/>I can forgive the speed at which fresh faced Elijah is accepted into the firm as this allows us to get straight into the story. Lexi Alexander does a good job getting across the atmosphere and passion of the game and how this spills over into the fighting. The fight scenes themselves are well produced and the reality of finding the other firm whilst avoiding the police is pitched just right. I also liked how we are shown that these 'thugs' are ordinary people during the week doing ordinary jobs.<br/><br/>The one thing that grated me was Charlie Hannams laughable Dick Van Dyke cock-er-ney accent. We are told what being a member of a firm is all about... front, respect and belonging. Part of this is the clothes and the language. ""Shat yor maff, you wan-car..."" says our Charlie... the rest of the cast who I would hazard a guess grew up in London have it spot on, poor Charlie... it's a good try, but as Don Cheadle found out in Oceans 11, if you get it just slightly wrong you sound like a right muppet...<br/><br/>Then we get to the second half. It turns out Charlies brother is the legendary ""Major"" with a reputation second to none. When being fronted up by his old foe though he simply wilts. Tommy Hatcher is a has been who has to be about 20 years older than the Major, but still manages to bottle him because he was responsible for the ruck that killed his son. And so begins the melodramatic finish.<br/><br/>It's a pity because it all started so well and the premise of a 'yank' being involved is great. I've read the other reviews here and have noticed that most of those that have given the movie a good rating are from the US. Unsurprisingly those giving it lower ratings are from the UK (except one guy from Reading, but then in Reading they wouldn't know good football if it punched them in the face, and they think a good scrap is a conker fight...!). And that says it all really, here we have a clash of cultures. Are we watching a 'film' about the culture of the football firms... or are we watching a 'movie' about a tragic morality tale...<br/><br/>I've given it a 6/10 because it is well made, and I am sure those unfamiliar with the football scene will enjoy it as it gives an insight into a unique culture. I applaud Lexi Alexander for having the balls (as it were) to make an interesting and likable movie... film... movie... well you know what I mean..."

","First of green street as it is called in the Uk or the less adeptly named 'Hooligans' is one of those films that is just simply fantastic. It had been the talk of my form and amongst friends at school yet I simply never found the window of opportunity to see this film. Now I'm glad that I did.<br/><br/>The actor who portrays the protagonist of green street Elijah Wood pulls of a damn near flawless performance as Ameican Matt Buckner, and pulls every bit away from his spellbinding role in The Lord of the rings, but to a finely attuned one which soon grows on you. He is without doubt the star of the show with acting that truly, truly shows his skill and talent. As with all films however one actor cant make a truly fantastic film. Wood is complimented with another truly fantastic performance from Charlie Hunnam. Hunnam again is an example of how fantastic these actors are in that they pulled away from their own characters and presented the audience with 100% believable characters with strength,depth and heart. The character Hunnam plays (Pete Dunham)is one of the characters who becomes such a vital and integral part of the film that he really does leave the trademark of a great performance, in that he becomes truly infallible in his role. The way the story shows Pete Dunham's guidance and care for Matt Buckner in a gradual progression is a true asset to the actors and adds to just how fantastic this film is. To finish on a positive note about the actors, the majority of which are all relatively unknown, however with only 1 relatively red carpet name the actors create an ensemble worthy of at least an Oscar or two which i feel isn't represented fairly by the academy. However this is irrelevant to my personal love for the film.<br/><br/>I don't want to give to much away about this film but the music that is included is nothing short of a sublime compliment to the films assets. Terrance jay's music truly does do the most seldom of things and fit the film in every respect with lyrics, backing and rhythm. The film gives of an emotional feel that again is complimented by this music and helps to portray the wider message this film contains. I myself live in the U.K and can say that a lot of the scenes in this are indeed true. The film helps to show the true passion of some fans which is inexplicable yet so evident and a prominent part of our culture.<br/><br/>Although the exterior of the film portrays a bunch of hooligans who support their club with their minds, passion, fists and hearts the interior goes much deeper than this. The film truly shows that even the most different people can learn to grow with each other and give their lives for something that would seem ridiculous yet means everything to them. The film gives the moral that you should always stand your ground and fight for what your heart truly believes in and a ironically a gang of football hooligans was the best way to portray this.<br/><br/>To conclude Greent street is no simple film about hooligans, it is a rare film with a fantastic story, message and ending which are all so seldomly seen in todays industry. I truly hope Lexi Alexander and all involved will pick up some recognition for this fine work and that it will not slip into the endless line of films which are made, seen and forgotten. For me Brokeack mountain, crash, the constant gardener and such others as Capote come 2nd place in 2005's best film. For me if people can truly see the message this film gives then hopefully they can recognise its unique and sublime existence. Green street is for me the best film of 2005 and probably one of the most underrated films in todays industry. And all i can do is hope that it can stand its ground on IMDb and everywhere else."

","First of all, a note to warn you of the bad reviews. Why take the opinion of people who have never been to a football match, never met a fan of football and never grew up during an age and environment where GSE and the like where at large every Saturday during the football Season? Now for this film! Wow! The atmosphere of this film sets the tones that was accompanying the dark side of football during the 1980's in the United Kingdom. In fact not so long ago, about 2001, I witnessed the frightening sight of seeing as mass football riot between the ""hardcore"" of Swansea and Bristol (I will not say which Bristol team to not cause offence). Like the film shows it is extremely violent, they do get straight back up to continue fighting, the constant use of the worse language is present. It is all captured here. These gangs CAN be run by 22 year olds, despite some other saying it makes the film unrealistic! These people ARE in normal jobs! They ARE family men! If you want to watch this film, then under no circumstances expect a ""nice"" film, it is very hard hitting! But that is just the thing that Hollywood would not dare to portray... real life, and it is a lot scarier, gripping and wonderfully accurate than the make belief worlds of Steven Spielberg and co.<br/><br/>Still ain't seen a 10/10, but I have only rated two films 9/10. The other 9/10...? The Second Coming, a 2-Part TV drama made for the UK's ITV network!"
"clairy_ozfan","10","0","2","9 February 2006"," An Elegant Portrayal Of An Un-Elegant Subject
","One of the most absorbing films i have seen in the past few months, Green Street is an honest portrayal of football hooliganism which manages not to glorify the violence but at the same time commends the courage and loyalty of those who take part in it. Elijah Wood does a surprisingly good job of banishing his Hobbit past and throws himself into the role with an enjoyable enthusiasm, Charlie Hunnman moves away from his 'Queer as Folk' roots in a stunning performance as the leader of the 'Green Street Elite', he manages to portray every aspect of his complicated character in a realistic and enjoyable performance. This film is gritty in its social realism and the violence of some of the scenes may be disturbing for some but highlights the disconcerting reality of the world of 'hooliganism'."

","Green Street is a brilliant, absorbing film that takes you into the world of football hooliganism, and follows the actions of an East London football firm, the GSE (Green Street Elite). The club they live and breath are West Ham United, but this film comes down to more than football.<br/><br/>The film's hero character is Matt Buckner, played by Elijah Wood, he is wrongly expelled from Harvard and moves to London to stay with his sister, and pretty soon he joins the firm.<br/><br/>Elijah's performance as Matt in this film is excellent as he displays the changes that transform him from weak and scared into someone who lives for the fight, and will stay by his friends through anything, as that is what this film is most about, friendship.<br/><br/>Any football fan will love this film, and even people who are not so keen on football will find this enjoyable and will not fail to be affected by the struggles and courage of the firm.<br/><br/>With all that being said, this is a very violent, realistic film that doesn't hold back, making it truly memorable, and is the best football themed film made yet."

","I went to watch Green Street at the cinema and really enjoyed it. The acting was superb in all parts and the story was well written and made the viewer experience everything the world of hooligans is about in and out of the violence. I am not a football fan but i really enjoyed this movie even so as it was not actually about football but more about the hooligan side of football and went inside the lives of each hooligan.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood was perfect for his role as Matt an American outsider who gets drawn into the world of Football Hooliganism. Charlie was good as Pete apart from a slightly dodgy London accent and Leo as Bover the rebel of the Green Street Elite but he came through in the end.. Overall the movie was excellent in my opinion and i give it 10/10.<br/><br/>Elizabeth"
"harding4eva","8","0","2","12 December 2005"," A lot better than i first thought
","Well first off, i went into the cinema expecting to come out refreshed as i assumed i would fall asleep. But i was wrong and let me tell you why. The film starts off in an excellent way, a fight between 2 rival gangs, and this sets the mood for the whole entire play. Woods acting was amazing, i mean i wasn't expecting much, but he amazed me, his representation of his troubled character shows that he isn't a typecast of Frodo. However Hunnman(sp) was also good, but his cockny accent was poor, at time it was cringeworthy. In my opinion this was better that Football Factory, the violence was better and more realistic, the tension created was better, but maybe it was because it had Wood in it and we've grown to love him as Frodo, nevertheless it was more realistic as well. For a first time director this film is a great stepping stone and I'm sure we will be seeing more of this female director for years and years to come"

","how can you people say this film was a joke it was amazing best film I've sat down to watch since lord of the rings trilogy,just because yanks don't understand the game of soccer you can learn its like us Brits not understanding baseball that there is a pointless game hitting a tiny ball with a bit of wood and running around a pitch with little white things to stop at where soccer is a game of passion thats why its the best sport on the planet,come on as well its an American star in the film have some compassion for him as he choise a good film to star in.The story line towards hooligans of football is true as well the whole film points out how true the violence in English football is bad but like i have already said if you love something so much you would fight and die for what you love and that is what i believe this film was about and i thought you couldn't of made it any better"

"privatehead","10","0","2","21 November 2005"," A very moving film
","Ever since I have watched this film, all I have read and heard is that most places will not show the film because it ""glorifies"" violence or something to that effect. Sure, there are some very violent scenes, but nothing worse than what you would see in a Mafia movie. In my opinion, this film explores something which very few of us have or ever will experience. That is the feeling of true friendship, true camaraderie. I can say that in a way, I feel like Elijah's character because I am in the Army. With me and my crew, if one fights, we all fight. But, back to the movie. This movie emphasizes the fact that sometimes people can become disenchanted with their everyday hustle and can sometimes find the answer in the strangest of places. This is what happens to Wood's character as he meets Charlie and the rest of the firm. They teach him to keep his head up and stand by your friends. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has felt that feeling of true ""blood friendship"" before because it will hit close to home. And to those who haven't, I still think there is much to be taken from this film."
"beverleylast62","8","0","2","20 November 2005"," Violent and brilliant
","I went to see this film for one very simple reason. I wanted to see the conclusion to Elijah Wood's ""Anti-Frodo trilogy"" and I was not disappointed. Elijah Wood plays a young American who has been unfairly expelled from Harvard. Unable to face his parents he goes to stay with his sister Claire Forlani in London. Once there he meets up with Charlie Hunnam, the brother of Claire's boyfriend, who introduces him to the world of football violence. Despite what people have said this film does not glorify football hooliganism. In fact it does completely the opposite and shows what a destructive path it leads down to. Elijah Wood's performance is magnificent and believable as the young American out of his depth. Charlie Hunnam's performance is also good, except for that awful Dick van Dyke accent. This is a film I would recommend to any fan of Football Factory or the superior I.D. Do not be put off by the content. This is a masterpiece"

"val-147","9","0","2","5 October 2005"," Excellent casting, believable take on football hooligan society
","We did not expect to enjoy this film until the quality of its casting and the authenticity of its shooting became clear. Neither of us had any sympathy for football hooligans nor any understanding of their social ties, and so it was a rather fascinating insight. I felt that it highlighted an essential social difference between men and women of which I, as a woman, had never had personal experience. Some of the 'Cockney' accents were clearly not native, but they were good all the same. Some of the casting was brilliant, and we were very emotionally engaged in it. Less credible as characters were the two main ones - Elijah Wood and his sister - but it was a glimpse of a raw London, shot with amazing technical effect. Loads of gratuitous violence, but at least it was in context. We came out of the film feeling we had had a really positive cinematic experience and wanting to recommend the film to others."

Such as ""I was going to learn something they could never teach me in Harvard,"" and other lines that were supposed to obviously be inspiring or moving, but were kind of cliché.

What did they do outside of hooliganism? How did they get into it in the first place? Did they even follow the team and players or just show up for fights? How did the general public or even their fellow team's fans view these hooligans? The film is worth seeing but it falls short of a classic."

","There's a reason why this fiercely brutal heart-stopper won both the Audience and Jury Awards for Best Narrative at the South By Southwest Film Festival this past March. Green Street Hooligans simply kicks a**. My true love, Elijah Wood, stars as Matt Buckner, a wrongfully expelled Harvard student who moves to London and gets involved with a gang of hardcore soccer fans (""hooligans"") who teach him to stand his ground and kick the crap out of anyone who gets in his way. This is a side of Frodo you've never seen before. Without preaching or moralizing, German writer/director Lexi Alexander illustrates the sense of honor and family that attracts people to these gangs, but she doesn't hesitate to reveal the violence, destruction, and death that comes along with the territory. If you love Elijah, if you love England, or if you just love movies that give you a punch in the gut and the adrenaline ride of your life, you will love Green Street Hooligans."
"mc12000","7","0","1","14 September 2005"," Strong, gritty, gutsy and violent
","Broadly speaking for me, there are two types of films. Ones that inspire serious thinking and discussion, and ones that don't require a lot of thinking about. ""Green Street"" was strange in that I did not know what to make of it. On face value, the simple storyline places it in the latter category (possibly on the mindless violence shelf). But after watching it, I was hoping to find some kind of excuse to salvaged the film from the trashy depths. For one thing, I thought the acting was good and convincing and I could be made to believe that the actors (bar Elijah Wood) were/are from hooligan backgrounds. Then I tried to decide if I felt any sympathy for any of the characters. After all, one character lost his teenage son in a street brawl, another character lost his chance for a reformed life and finally, the main protagonist is killed. And yet, I couldn't help but think that these characters got exactly what they deserved because of what they have done or what they are doing. Hence, I could find no reason for feeling anything for the characters. So what about the film's message? Here, I was equally confused by what the Director was trying to get across. The obvious message is to highlight England's football hooligan culture and thereby issue a warning to those out there. But I also got the sense that the film was glorifying the whole issue. For instance, making martyrs out of the main characters and promoting the whole ethos of hooliganism being about reputation. That is not to say that I did not enjoy the film. After all, strong performances from the cast kept the momentum moving at a solid pace. I felt that someone less ""flimsy"" than Elijah Wood would have made a better lead but he wasn't bad. The film was full of holes and coincidences which would only be found in a fictitious world but again, I don't hold that against any film. Putting these ""negatives"" aside, I would recommend it to the 15-40 year old age group, even if it is a Cert 18 in the UK."
