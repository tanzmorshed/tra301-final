","George : Hey guys, remember that movie we all did a few years back called Ocean's Eleven?<br/><br/>Brad : Course we do, we had such a great time.<br/><br/>Julia : And let's not forget we made stacks of money on it. It was a hit!<br/><br/>George : Well here's an idea.Let's make a sequel!<br/><br/>Matt : Fantastic idea! I mean the first one had all of us in it but most of all it was directed, had cool music, had lots of us in it and had a great script.<br/><br/>Brad : The script? Oh yeah, the script, whatever.<br/><br/>Julia : Let's do it. Everyone will love seeing us mugging it up on the screen. Steven Soderbergh's a friend of mine so he'll love directing us again.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, he'll do it. He won't have to work too hard though because it's got us in it. In fact he can just stuff around and experiment with all sorts of stupid camera angles.<br/><br/>Matt : Won't that just confuse the audience and make them dizzy?<br/><br/>George : Stuff that! Just so long as everyone can make out it's us up there on the screen they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : And the music??<br/><br/>Brad : Pfft! Music? No one goes to the movies for music. They want to see stars. Like us! Let's just have any old stupid music for this one.<br/><br/>Matt : That's fine. What about the script?<br/><br/>Brad : What is it with you and the script? Hey here's an idea. Julia, you're so famous and wonderful<br/><br/>Julia : So are you Brad.<br/><br/>Brad : Thanks Julia. What I was saying was how about we have an entire sequence where your character pretends to be you! Everyone knows you're fantastic so they'll love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great idea Brad. How do we fit that into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Julia! Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK. How about we get someone else as famous and wonderful as us to join in the cast? The audience will love that.<br/><br/>George : Yeah, let's get Bruce Willis in a pointless uncredited cameo. He's never been too fussy about what movies he's made before. He's bound to say yes.<br/><br/>Matt : How do we fit him into the script?<br/><br/>George : Who cares??? It's Bruce Willis. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Julia : OK, who else?<br/><br/>Brad : I'm way ahead of you here, Julia. I've got a famous wife so let's get someone who is famous and wonderful, with a famous husband and who they audience will love if they see her and I having a romantic scene.<br/><br/>All : Catherine Zeta Jones!<br/><br/>George : I'll call her and see. <br/><br/>(Ring Ring)<br/><br/>Catherine : Hello. George : Hi Catherine, George Clooney here. You might remember working with me in Intolerable Crueltythe audience loved it!<br/><br/>Catherine : Hi George. What's up?<br/><br/>George : We're making a sequel to Ocean's Eleven. It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt in it. How'd you like to be in it too?<br/><br/>Catherine : Yeah sure. What's it about?<br/><br/>George : Who cares?? It's got me and Brad and Julia and Matt and you in it!!<br/><br/>Catherine : OK. But how about we film it in Europe? The audience will love that!<br/><br/>George : It's a deal. See ya.<br/><br/>Catherine : Bye<br/><br/>Julia : So how'd it go?<br/><br/>George : She's in AND she had a great idea. She reckons we could film it somewhere in Europe.<br/><br/>Brad : Fantastic!<br/><br/>Matt : So how does that fit into the script?<br/><br/>Julia : Who cares about the script!! It's got us in it! And anyone who liked Ocean's Eleven will get sucked into seeing it and by then it's too late for them to worry about the script because they've already paid their money.<br/><br/>George : And besides they'll love it because it's got me and Julia and Matt and Brad AND Catherine in it AND it will be filmed in Europe. Everyone will love it!<br/><br/>Matt : Great. Let's do it!!<br/><br/>you get the idea."

","Great actors, beautiful European scenery, funny lines, witty banter, nice camera work, what could go wrong? ... The plot. When I saw that 27% of the people gave this movie a 10 rating, I wondered if I was the slow one. Then I read the reviews.<br/><br/>When most of the stars started appearing on talk shows, trying to convey the buddy buddy tomfoolery that went on behind the scenes, I kind of sensed that damage control was underway. There was a moment in this movie where a few of the actors were sitting at a table talking complete gibberish, and it was later joked that they pulled a ""lost in translation"". I guess the joke was on me the viewer.<br/><br/>What rolled along as a pretty good movie slowly gathering steam, stalled into chaotic incomprehensive mess. If you loved the first movie because it developed into a brilliantly masterminded theft with many twists, you be left with the empty feeling that the only thing that was lifted in this movie; was your money for the admission ticket.<br/><br/>It is too late for me now, but you still have a chance."

","Every James Bond movie has its own set of rules. Just like every Indiana Jones movie has ITS own set of rules. And the fact that screenwriters don't break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters. With a completely unnecessary plot twist, the integrity of both Ocean films plummets somewhere between Airplane 2 and a Roadrunner cartoon.<br/><br/>Imagine what would happen, while teetering on the rope bridge outside of the Temple of Doom, if Indy told Shorty and Willie not to worry because throughout the entire first two movies he's secretly had super powers and can fly them both to safety.<br/><br/>Entertaining? Sure, for a Roadrunner cartoon. But Spielberg would never have done that because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film. More importantly, it would have ANGERED the audience. They'd already sat on the edge of their seats through 3 hours worth of Indiana Jones movies and they were counting on Indiana to get them off that bridge in a believable way. If he were to fly off? People would have walked out of the theaters the same way people did during Ocean's 12.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>1. Julia Roberts'character, Tess, infiltrates a museum by disguising herself as...Julia Roberts?!? A clever twist? By breaking the fourth wall three hours after we've been introduced to these characters? Is this the Naked Gun 33 and 1/3? It's a textbook example of how a cheap laugh can ruin an entire film. But wait...just in case you haven't walked out yet...<br/><br/>2. The suspense builds throughout the last hour of the movie -- how will they pull off the heist -- there are only 10...8...5...2 DAYS LEFT! And then in the last 12 minutes of the film, the ONLY entertaining part of this movie, we see that the heist was made days earlier and took Matt Damon all of 30 seconds to pull off. The past 10 days? A complete waste of your time.<br/><br/>BACK TO INDIANA JONES ON THE ROPE BRIDGE...""Just relax, Willie! I stole the REAL stones back about a month ago! Besides, I convinced them you were Kate Capshaw!""<br/><br/>If you haven't already seen it, cut your losses and go see the Polar Express. I don't want to ruin the ending for you, but there really is a Santa Claus. Most importantly, you won't feel cheated leaving the theater."

","Unfortunately I think this is one of those films that if you or I took it to the studio and said, 'can I make this great movie with my friends Mary, Mungo and Midge from school?' the studio would have you kicked to death on the spot. However, if a bunch of massive Hollywood names say, 'look, I fancy a jaunt to Italy with my mates, how about it?' the studio writes a cheque.<br/><br/>We kick off with the casino boss from Ocean's 11 tracking down the robbers who made off with his cash, and then Brad Pitt is shagging Catherine Zeta Jones, and then there's some monkeying about in Amsterdam and Italy and such and such and then it all ends somehow.<br/><br/>The film does, however, include the most shameful moment of both Julia Roberts' and Bruce Willis' careers, which is a cinematic gem. I nearly vomited in my lap and tore my eyes out when Julia Roberts, playing Tess in the movie, pretends to be (you guessed it) Julia Roberts! Bruce Willis stands about clearly wondering when he can leave, and how much the cheque will be.<br/><br/>Ah well, to be fair, I'd have done it for the cash, so I suppose I can't really criticize the poor loves, but I'm a penniless slob not a Hollywood legend. I guess what really annoys me about this film is not that it is boring and pointless and has a terrible story, but that I think the actors probably all had good fun doing it! I think the actor's entire job is to project emotion outwards...I feel like I paid to go to the party, but had to stand outside in the rain.

"katmarsen","2","150","201","11 December 2004"," The Ultimate Heist Movie-- *I* was Robbed!
","SPOILER!! Terrible camera work, horrible writing, non-existent plot, and numerous plot wholes. Wonderful acting! Except for Julia Roberts. Who poorly plays someone who is impersonating Julia Roberts, poorly. Catherine Zeta Jones is adorable in this movie.<br/><br/>During the movie, we repeatedly zoom in, on each of the twelve (!) characters. Twelve is too many, even for a classic like 12 Angry Men. And the problem is, we tediously zoom in on the characters, when all of them are in the same room, doing the same thing.<br/><br/>Yep, Clooney's eating. Yep, Pitt's eating. Yep, the ""Jew"" is eating. Yep, the geek is eating. Yep, the bodybuilder's eating. Yep, Mr. Sensitive is eating. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep--Yep. Yep. Phew! This happens at least three other times in the movie. Yep, they're all sitting in cars, bored. Yep, they're all getting arrested, frightened. Yep, they're all being led out of a jail, depressed.<br/><br/>But it wasn't until I was home that I realized how badly they'd ""got"" me on this one. This is a heist movie, right? That's what I went to see, right? But when I walked in and set my car keys in the change jar, only then I realized: NOTHING WAS ACTUALLY STOLEN IN THIS MOVIE! That's right. It's a heist movie, where nothing gets stolen. Oh, they try. They go to try and steal some boring document or something, from some guy's house (whatever), and it turns out it's already been stolen. 20 minutes of my life, wasted. Then they try to steal some egg from some museum (YAWN!), and they screw that up and get arrested.<br/><br/>Then we see how some fairy french guy stole the egg even before they did, and we get all the joy of ""Entrapment"", except this time the person inside the tight catsuit dancing around the fake lasers is... an ugly skinny french guy. Um.<br/><br/>But it turns out he didn't actually steal the egg either. Actually, our heroes stole the egg, LOOOONG ago, in another movie entirely, which would have been a GREAT movie to watch, had they made that movie.<br/><br/>Instead we see a 30 second clip in black-and-white about how they robbed some college student of his back-pack. You heard me... the daring caper, the ultimate heist-- the buildup of this 2 and a half hours of utter boring crap-- is them stealing a back-pack from a college student, by creatively getting into a fight over baseball teams and distracting him, and replacing his back-pack with an identical back-pack? What?? <br/><br/>Ugh. I'm telling you, this was so bad, I didn't even realize just how bad it was-- just how badly I'd been robbed-- until I got home."
"Sweet_Ophelia","5","265","384","11 December 2004"," Leaves you pining for '11'
","Three years ago Danny Ocean (Clooney) and his team stole 160 million dollars from Terry Benedict (Garcia). Now Benedict wants his money back. Plus interest. Thus Ocean and his crew must scramble together what they owe; too hot to work in America, they set their sights on Amsterdam.... where, not so coincidently, Rusty Ryan (Pitt) has an ex-love (Zeta-Jones) who just so happens to be head of police and hot on their trail. But Benedict and sexy cop Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones) aren't the crew's only problem. Another thief under the alias of ""nightfox"" ( Vincent Cassel) is keen to battle it out with Ocean and his team; to decide who the best thief (or thieves) are. <br/><br/>And there you have Ocean's 12; a film which falls too short in terms of wit, appearance, plot... and pretty much everything else in comparison to the original Ocean's 11.<br/><br/>One thing must be made clear, however; the cast is great. Spectacular really. There is a definite and rare chemistry between everyone; even Catherina Zeta-Jones, newcomer to the Soderbergh film. And it is indeed very rare to jam-pack a film with so many big name celebs without the film being ruined by too much star power and not enough of anything else. And these films do indeed have A lot of Hollywood star power in them; Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherina Zeta Jones, Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle... just to name the biggest names. And watching Ocean's 11, you can tell that the crew enjoyed making this film. Unfortunately, the audience may not gain the same pleasure as the actors did....<br/><br/>If you were like me, absolutely blown away by the chic and jazzy first film, then Ocean's 12 will be a disappointment. The first movie was simply 'classy'. All of the shots, every single take, camera angles were all very clean-cut, solid and very stylish. In this film however, Soderbergh decides to use the currently popular 'shaky cam' technique for some scenes. I can understand why. In this film, unlike the first one, the crew haven't had time to plan to perfection their 'pull'. In this film its a mad rush to meet Benedict's deadline and I suppose Soderbergh wanted to get that rashness and disorientation across. But it wrecks the film. He really should have stuck to his original idea of having it all snazzy, bold and clean. Plus it is confusing when the film snaps between past and present to explain how the crew made some of their robberies; it looks messy and ugly to change between shaky cam to the bolder scenes.<br/><br/>Secondly, the laughs are fewer in 12 and the script is duller. Ocean's 11 had a quick-wit and many a memorable line. Ocean's 12 has to sink so low as to throw in an age joke for Clooney; ""Do i look 50?"". The plot is predictable; from Julia Robert's 'impersonation' to the crew's great escape. It's all very blunt and can be spotted a mile away. And the summing up of the 'pull' is a little confusing; past tense (there's that shaky cam again!). I cant give too much away but my personal opinion is that the explanation of how the team pulled of the robbery is a little confusing and a sort of ""huh""? moment which you will need to disucss with other's who have seen the film, to make sure you absolutely understood everything.<br/><br/>All in all the film is a let down. By all means go and see it; if for no other reason than to drool over the gorgeous Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and George Clooney.... But do not get your hopes up. As the credits roll you will find yourself feeling cheated somehow. Ocean's 11 was a real gem but Ocean's 12 just leaves you pining for the original.... 5.5/10"
"patrickjw","5","446","712","14 December 2004"," Awful
","Simply put, this is a boring movie. The strength of Ocean's 11 was that it started at point A and it ended at point B, and it did so in a convincing and entertaining matter and threw in a believable plot twist at the end. It was very simply and straightforward.<br/><br/>Ocean's 12 is nothing like this. The film is in desperate need of a better editor, as it is so bloated and ponderous that towards the middle of the film, if you've even managed to keep track of who's stealing what from whom and why they're doing it, you won't even care any more. You'll just be begging for the ending. <br/><br/>The film is filled with bizarre camera angles, such as a shot of an incoming airplane that for some inconceivable reason is filmed sideways. There are also some VERY bizarre scenes, such as a scene where Julia Robert's character has to pretend to be Julia Roberts, and a thief break-dances through lasers.<br/><br/>However, the biggest flaw of the movie is the absence of a good heist scene. The heist in Ocean's 11 was masterful, and there is nothing in this film that even comes close. I didn't go to see this movie to watch a cop get reunited with her father who happens to be a master thief, I went to see a team of funny people go up against the odds to steal a lot of money.<br/><br/>Bottom line: You will hate this movie. Don't waste your money on it."
"SkdRow8","1","322","518","11 December 2004"," That's IT? No, really, that's IT?!
","I had very high hopes walking into this movie. After all, Ocean's 11 was a truly great Hollywood product. Its rapid-fire jokes, incredible star power and tight script made it one of the most fun caper films I have ever seen. Of course, with all the money it made, a sequel was on the way, and I, for one, was excited.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I was absolutely blown away by this movie. Blown away by how horribly wrong things can go. This movie had everything going for it; the return of the entire original cast, the same director, news stories of crazy on- and off-set antics. How could it possibly have gone so wrong?<br/><br/>It starts immediately with one of the most awkward and unnecessary opening sequences ever and goes downhill from there. After reasonably goofy short scenes between Pitt/Zeta-Jones and Clooney/Roberts, the film spends several minutes watching Andy Garcia waltz from scene to scene, telling each individual member of Danny Ocean's original eleven that he wants his money back. Believe me when I say that these scenes are only here to pad Andy Garcia's running time, because without these ridiculously awkward shots, his screen time would be WELL under five minutes.<br/><br/>This leads me to another major qualm I had with this film. The pacing is so uneven that characters are dropped completely from the story, and only sometimes brought back later. Bernie Mac's character is dropped from the script early on, and never comes back except for 2 short scenes with no dialogue. Garcia appears for the first few minutes, and returns for an exceptionally brief scene at the end. Roberts shows up for about 5 minutes at the beginning, and isn't even mentioned again until there's about 20-25 minutes left. Even Clooney himself spends a large chunk of the film in prison.<br/><br/>This would all be excusable if the film was funny. At all. 90% of the jokes fall completely flat and the ones that do work are worth a chuckle at best. The ""plot"" is undeniably worthless, and left me feeling cheated. At one point in the film, the team takes on a job worth $2.5 million of the nearly $100 million they need to raise before Garcia's two-week deadline. Several characters even acknowledge how absurd wasting the time to do this job is, but they do it anyway! Over 30 minutes of the film revolve around this job that they shouldn't even be doing, and one gets the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to pad the running time. Furthermore, the equipment they use to pull this job off CLEARLY cost millions upon millions to fund. Just wait until you see what they do to pull this job and realize it would cost far more than $2.5 million to pull off. Obviously, because of this, they have to pull off several jobs to make the money. The beauty of the first film was the one big con and how ingeniously and intricately it was pulled off. Here, they pull so many jobs, in so many different ways, that they rush through all of them because to explain them would make the film several hours long.<br/><br/>We all know walking into this film that there will be a big twist at the end. Thus is the nature of the caper film. The twist at the end of Ocean's Twelve made me laugh; not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe how cheated I felt. I won't give it away, because I know most of you will be foolish enough to throw down the money to see this movie anyway.<br/><br/>What I will say is that it makes most of the 2 hours you have sat through already completely irrelevant.<br/><br/>I was excited to see this film, after absolutely adoring Ocean's 11. I left the theater feeling like I had been the victim of a truly great con pulled by the cast and crew of this movie in tricking me into thinking that this movie would actually be worth watching. I have never given a 1 to a movie on IMDb.com, but there's a first time for everything. Consider yourselves warned....1/10"
"arahman","1","44","63","19 July 2005"," A Complete Mess
","Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) catches up with Danny Ocean and his team and demands that they repay the money that they stole from him (in Oceans 11) plus interest. He holds back from violent action however as he is under the instruction of the world's greatest thief, the Night Fox. The team then have to pull off a series of heists to pay Benedict back whilst testing their abilities against the Night Fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever. Put simply, this film is a complete mess. The masses may argue that it is ""cool"" and that Clooney and Pitt put in great performances but these are the same people who have a subscription to ""Hello"" magazine and think that David Beckham has the potential to be a great actor. The story is convoluted, it is not complex or clever and it does not have intelligent twists and turns, it is just a complete mess that spills out in multiple directions with the hope that the audience will think it is cool and intelligent (Hello magazine readers). Any respectable movie watcher will however see the film for the farce that it is. Whilst Oceans 11 wasn't a great film it had a decent pace, was stylish and had some decent twists and turns. This movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up. It is as if the director and cast said to themselves, hey this isn't really working out, lets just have a laugh! Indeed the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves but I was not. I will not delve into the plot as its confused evolution does not warrant any examination. The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely annoying. The scenes where Julia Roberts impersonates herself (with Bruce Willis undertaking a cameo role) whilst mildly amusing appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested. The movie is so full of plot holes that it as if Arnie has emptied an Uzi 9mm into the film studio. Credit can only be given to some scenes where the Night Fox uses Caopeira to undertake a heist against the back drop of some funky music but this is hardly justification to watch the movie. The final scene features the team in a nonsensical drunken stupor; this accurately sums up the movie. Stick with the original."
"jackson-50","1","42","60","26 March 2005"," Insulted my intelligence.
","I felt compelled to write about this movie after i joined IMDb because i thought it was the worst script writing i have seen in a while.<br/><br/>The acting/direction/other-areas of the movie are fantastic. I love brad Pitt with George Clooney. It works. The witty banter was still there too from the first movie. My question is how in the world did they let this script out of the drafting process? I thought that not only did the plot develop like a slug racing to the end of the sidewalk, but that twist? (can i call it that) was so incredibly stupid that i wanted to go demand a refund from the ticket booth. I have never felt so played and used from a movie in my entire life. Here i was expecting something similar to the first movie (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, amazing plot) only to find that they had taking my 8 dollars and made a mockery out of it.<br/><br/>The part that gets me still is that this movie has now grossed more than 125 million dollars.<br/><br/>In summary, I felt that this movie insulted my intelligence. I still feel like the only part the writers concentrated on was that little bit with Julia Roberts acting like Julia Roberts. This movie made me sad and angry."
"NiGe2011","Null","122","195","13 December 2004"," Neither awful nor amazing...
","I went into 'Oceans 12' as being a big fan of the first installment, but my hopes were not astronomical. And for the two or so hours that I watched the movie, I was not disappointed. However, I cannot say that I enjoyed it nearly as much as I had enjoyed 'Oceans 11'.<br/><br/>'Oceans 12' was a very fun, but at the same time flawed, movie. The movie was every film students dream come true, full of indie style camera and editing tricks from beginning to end. But this could not hide the fact that at its core it was still a studio movie. The storyline was entertaining and full of just as many twists and turns as had graced the first one. However, when the final credits rolled I could not help but wonder about some of the loose ends (and there were many). It almost felt as though the scriptwriter had too many ideas that really did not fit with one another, but he threw them in anyway. At times it could be a little frustrating and leave you wondering why they even showed the last ten minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>By far the strong suit of the film was the cast and their generally above par performances. Brad Pitt was excellent again, and Matt Damon was probably even better then he had been in '11'. The rest of the gang was about as they had been previously, with the possible exception of Shaobo Qin whom I felt was even funnier this time around. Catherine Zeta Jones turned out to be a welcome addition and she fit right in with the movies flow as Pitt's love interest. She perhaps looked the most comfortable in her role out of all of them, despite the fact that it was her first hand in the series.<br/><br/>All in all, I was pleased that I had spent the eight dollars to go and see this the day that it opened. But by the same token, I doubt I will be purchasing it when it appears on DVD.<br/><br/>My Overall Rating: 6 1/2 out of 10"

","Three years after Ocean's Eleven the gang's all back for more in this sequel. This time around the elusive group of thieves and con artists reunite and travel abroad to Europe to pull off another elaborate heist after vengeful casino mogul Terry Benedict (Garcia) tracks them down looking for reimbursement. Little do they dream that they'll face stiff competition from a self-proclaimed criminal mastermind (Cassel) who's determined to try and upstage them. The latest in a long line of tepid Hollywood sequels; the cast may have had fun making this film but that doesn't mean the audience will as it drags on for over two hours with endless story lulls, self-conscious humor, and banal dialogue. One particularly embarrassing in-joke falls flat and leaves you wondering just how desperate the producers were to earn cheap laughs. The same group of gifted actors that made the original so special are wasted here, as the needlessly convoluted ""script"" lacks any wit, style, or sense of purpose. **"
"movieguy1021","6","114","183","15 December 2004"," Ocean's Twelve: 6/10
","It's inevitable, isn't it? After the success of the remake of Ocean's Eleven, out comes the sequel three years later. I liked the style of the teaser trailer (and was probably one of the only ones who didn't mind the name), so naturally, I was looking forward to the movie. Naturally, it's a sequel, so it's inferior to the original (which I liked more than the original of the original). The entire cast is back (plus one more, obviously) for the necessary foreign-country locations and trendy scene transitions. There's the constant music, the people with the general European accents (well, villains), and every other caper movie cliché in the books.<br/><br/>Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his eleven/twelve compadres are forced to pay back the money that they stole from Terry Benedict's (Andy Garcia) casinos three years earlier. To get the money, they have to steal it in Europe.<br/><br/>Where the first movie was fun, this sequel was mildly entertaining. It went on a little long, but was never boring. It's watchable (as all crime movies like these should be), but not really entertaining. I wasn't having fun while watching a lot of Ocean's Twelve. I wasn't bored, either. I was in Limbo of the movie world. All of the Vegas glitz added to the first, and here it's drab European backgrounds. Steven Soderbergh's directing also makes the film harder to enjoy. The film's choppy-we don't see events that happened until after the fact (if that makes any sense), and there are so many subplots and characters with similar sounding names that eventually we stop caring. Whenever a movie makes me do that, I usually focus more in on the fun aspects of the movie. And sure, the movie had its fun moments, and never left me bored, but overall, it just lacked that ultra-cool style that the first one had.<br/><br/>Then again, every actor's back in cool form. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the newbie here, and although her character is barely defined, she still manages to be cool. George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt (being on screen probably more than anyone else), Matt Damon-they're all cool. But it's obvious that this isn't the best sequel that could have been made for Ocean's Eleven-the movie was originally written for a completely different movie, and then readapted to a sequel. Because of that, there aren't really any reminders on who these people were. I remembered Clooney, Roberts, Garcia, and a few character names and quirks (such as Pitt's obsessive eating), but, really, who were these people? Did Soderbergh think that we would all rush out to see the first one before seeing this? I'll bet as many people did that as the number who went to see the Russian Solyaris after Soderbergh made Solaris.<br/><br/>The caper this time around isn't as interesting (the major one doesn't come in until halfway through), nor as easy to follow. In fact, the whole movie's basically a convoluted mess. The subplot about Isabel's father, things like that...if there's a definition of worthless, that's it. Also, that ""Julia Roberts"" bit went on for too long. We got the joke there. At that moment, I think that the movie thought it was funny enough to abandon basically the entire plot and go with a ten minute schtick, when there was basically no other humor in the movie. Still, Ocean's Twelve isn't terrible, and can offer a good time if you're the right person.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10 Rated PG-13 for language."

Plus that kind of stuff has already been done in at least one other movie.. and it was stupid then as well...<br/><br/>Also, there's no reason to have even HALF of the 12 or 11 in this movie! What difference do half of the cast really make to the outcome of this movie??? Half the SCENES don't even need to be there! <br/><br/>The first one was classy. This was CHEAP!

","Man I loved Ocean's 11.<br/><br/>Smart movie. All eleven characters were crucial to the heist as each had their own specialised skill that was necessary to pull of the grand finale.<br/><br/>What on earth was Oceans 12? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I assume it's supposed to be Zeta-Jones but she wasn't really a part of the 11 as she was trying to trip them up and working against them the whole film?? It was more like the story of Brad and Zeta-Jones' characters boring relationship with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some bums on seats to watch the movie.<br/><br/>With O-11, the gang were always a step ahead of Benedict (Garcia). They were always able to outsmart him. What happened here? He catches up with them after a tip-off and suddenly they're all wusses? The whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay back Benedict for the heist they pulled on him 3 years earlier. So next movie they're going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist? Puh-lease...<br/><br/>This movie could have been achieved with just Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and 5 mins of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene.<br/><br/>Slow moving movie, not the energy of the first one. I tried hard to like it and I'm usually very easy to please but I'm really disappointed.<br/><br/>SPOILER!!! The twist - the whole movie didn't need to have been made as the real heist was done before everything you just saw over the past 2 hours.<br/><br/>END SPOILER.<br/><br/>Wait until it comes on TV or if you're a fan of the original from 2001 please don't watch this."

","Ocean's Twelve works for me because it's self-referential; in other words, it plants its tongue firmly in its cheek, and scatters references through the film to the real life people/situations behind the film. I can't tell you how without bringing down the wrath of the IMDb spoiler police on my head, but let's say that if you enjoy Hitchcock cameos or the humour of films such as Star Trek IV (""Computer? Computer!""), you should like this one.<br/><br/>It's also refreshing to see a film that treats Europe as being more than Big Ben, the Eiffel Tower and the Colosseum. I actually watched it in Rome, one of the locations used in the film, and not a single ancient ruin appeared (apart from George Clooney ;->); indeed, the opening scene of a line of cars all sounding their horns was familiar enough to send a laugh around the Roman audience.<br/><br/>There were one or two plot oddities that'll probably show up in the IMDb goofs section (Arsenal FC going from Amsterdam to Barcelona?! By bus?!) but overall, a good night out."

","I loved Ocean's Eleven so I was hesitant to watch the sequel but this didn't fall flat the way so many sequels do. It is strange in that it builds off the original, you would be lost without previous knowledge of Ocean's Eleven, but yet it has an entirely new tone and feeling as well as European look rather than the Vegas glitz of the first movie. I was very happy that all of the originals came back for the sequel. If you like a good action movie that keeps you guessing then this movie is for you. It was very nice to see Brad Pitt's character fleshed out more in this movie. I would like to have seen more of the banter between the Malloy brother characters but on the whole the movie left me wondering if there will be an Ocean's 13. There seemed to be an opening for one with where they left the Night Fox at the end of Ocean's Twelve."

","I had read the newspaper reviews of this film and I must say my expectations were very low before watching Ocean's 12. I really enjoyed the first movie but this successor is one of the worst movies ever. I would rate it top 5 of the worst movie I have ever seen. Why do I say that? First of all there is a story so thin that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller. The fragments that could be assigned the term ""story"" is loosely held together at times but most of the time the movie just moves along with no purpose or drive. The entire story seems forced and the script surrounding the story is even more forced that it become farce at times.<br/><br/>The actors show up but doesn't do anything to deserve any credit or appraise. Most embarrassing are leading ladies (Roberts and Zeta-Jones) that either overplay or are extremely plain. Damon, Clooney and Pitt aren't brilliant either. To be honest I really don't understand how they would want to be associated with something as bad as this movie.<br/><br/>=== May contains spoilers ==== Camera and editing, sigh where should I begin. There are many unnecessary camera movements that just make the experience painful. Combine that with extremely untactful editing and you start looking for a wooden spoon to carve your heart out. Especially the scene where the entire gang is moved out of the prison to be transported away by car. The camera zoom to each person just get boring and when you are at number 3 of 12 you got the message: wow you are cool and can do simple zoom effects - NOT. I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) playing Julia Roberts is supposed to be funny but it just gets extremely embarrassing and you turn away to avoid experiencing the mess. Bruce Willis. Why? Please explain it to me! WHY???<br/><br/>To summarize ... if you have to choose between root canal work and watching Ocean's 12 I recommend the former. Make sure they do all the teeth while you are at it ..."

Speaking of the story,...there is one, kinda,...but its barely visible for all the ""look at me"" shots and cameos. Only Matt Damon seemed to actually ""act"" during this film...the rest of the cast appeared to only be there to participate in a rat-pack-wanna-be session.

","A few years ago, Steve Soderbergh made a clever little heist film. Well, really, he remade a heist film from the '60s. It featured a healthy dose of star power. The remake, that is. Well, so did the original, but most of them are dead now, so he got new ones. Pitt, Clooney, Damon, Roberts, Garcia, etc., etc., etc. And it was all set in Vegas, the self-admitted epitome of hip American glitz. And money, let's not forget the money, because that's what this film is all about. Making money. Stealing it, even.<br/><br/>""Ocean's Twelve"" serves as perfect illustration of the desperation Hollywood must feel when it has a hit film on its hands. How to best milk a new potential franchise, especially one that doesn't have its own set of source materials (i.e. books or comics or video games) to provide the sequels? How to keep a long-stale formula (the crime caper) fresh? Why, just add another star to the mix, shake, stir, and pour into the collective consciousness of the indiscriminate, entertainment-fixated public. Dispose of any logic or believability. Feel free to break the fourth wall, just for the fun of it. Make most of the film one red herring after another. Throw a few more stars into the mix, uncredited, just so the audience can admire the hipness of it all. A few odd camera angles, some hand-held shots, more self-conscious star mugging, a plot that only a committee could love, and voilà! You've got a final product that is...<br/><br/>(return to summary)<br/><br/>Good job, Hollywood! What's your next cheap trick?"

At least in the start of the movie you'll partly believe that something is being hidden, a subplot if you must. I watched it all the way to the end waiting, and when the credits started rolling I was still waiting. I borrowed this movie off a friend before he had watched it. I was vocal on how bad the movie actually was and I explained the worst parts of the movie and still to this day he has it, but still hasn't watched it. The worst part, this: Julia Roberts plays Tess Ocean, Danny Ocean's (George clooney's) wife within the actual movie. The real problem with this is, a scene which Tess Ocean dresses up in different clothes and looks like she is pregnant, to disguise as ""Julia Roberts"" within the movie. This calls the entire storyline & cast into question, she is pretending to be herself within a movie, even a Bruce Willis's cameo just added more confusion. If you have 2 hours spare and all you're dvds catch fire except ocean's twelve, STILL Don't WATCH IT. Trust me, it has some ""witty banter"", actors, destinations, jokes etc. But if you honestly watch it through not even these small things can possibly save you're viewing experience.<br/><br/>1/10"

Of course since die-hard fans of Oceans 11 (such as myself) will have to see this movie even if it is to just believe how bad it really is its a no brainer for the producers to dish any hogwash onto our plates - its a well thought of commercial strategy but very cold blooded and callous on the fans.

","The 2001 remake of Lewis Milestone's ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a good adventure, with action, comedy and thriller in an updated screenplay. When this sequel was released, I was impressed with the number of stars and locations mostly in Europe, and certainly a huge budget. Unfortunately, this movie does not have the most relevant component: a decent screenplay. The beginning is confused and most of the situations and dialogs are not funny, being indeed ridiculous; when the execution of the heist is disclosed in the end, it is ludicrous; and the absurd plot itself is totally unbelievable and does not work. The direction is also very bad, with horrible and weird movements of camera. Steven Soderbergh began his career with exceptional works, but his last films are very deceptive (""Full Frontal""(2002); ""Solaris""(2002)).

The only saving grace for this film were the actors and actresses. Beautiful people in beautiful clothes and beautiful locations. If you have money, I guess you can spend it unwisely! Take my advice. Go see a different movie. This one stinks! The jet-lag from traveling to Europe should have been a part of the plot. Instead the time frame of the movie does not relate to real-world time. Catherine Zeta-Jones is, as usual, very beautiful! She played her part as best as she could until the very end. Then the plot really gets twisted. The flash-backs are distracting and unnecessary. The role Andy Garcia plays as Terry Benedict (the casino owner) doesn't use enough muscle and his role is stupid. The movie should have been renamed, ""Greed of the Rich!""

This of course doesn't work, and the four of them get busted. Linus's mom bails them out of jail in a plot twist so asinine that I wish not to comment any more on it.<br/><br/>All in all, the only thing Clooney's Croonies end up stealing from us is $68+ million of ticket sale.<br/><br/>Ocean's Twelve *(one) out of **********(ten) stars"

","A heist movie works on the premise that the audience is in on the heist. We dread the incredible security measures. We get to see the planning and the development. We marvel at the skills of each expert. We experience the same suspense and drama as the characters. Ocean's Twelve discards all these elements in favor of creative editing, avant garde camera work and superficial writing. It tries to extract great performances from so-so actors. O.K. so they all are beautiful people. That doesn't mean they are automatically the best actors. It doesn't mean that they can carry a film on their performances. Clooney and Pitt are no Newman and Redford. The acting talents of Catherince Zeta-Jones have never been anything to write home about. Only Finney in a tiny cameo draws any real emotion from the audience.<br/><br/>The best heist movies have real suspense. This film has none. The outcome is never in doubt. No matter how the surface of the plan is seemingly foiled...everyone is in on the far deeper ""actual"" plan.<br/><br/>On major problem is Garcia's character. <br/><br/>If the original ""11"" successfully pulled off the job we are made to believe they did in the first film, they wouldn't panic and crumble like a house of cards to Benedict's pressure and scare tactics. In fact, once a member of the cadre had been contacted, survelliance would have captured Benedict's strong arm tactics and bellicose threats immediately.

There are so many obvious in-jokes, cheap jokes, leaps of logic that even die hard Ocean's Eleven fans should feel cheated.

All those scenes with Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis are painful in their smugness. This movie feels like a bunch of friends got together and decided, on a whim, to make a movie.

The team then goes to Amsterdam to try to get rich.

There was a compact feel to it and some elegant twists and turns of plot that made for an entertaining escapist movie.<br/><br/>In contrast, Oceans Twelve feels bloated, stumbling along with no apparent point in mind. Worse, there's far too much explanation going on. It has been said that if you have to explain a joke, the joke was a dud. Oceans Twelve proves that the same theory holds true for movies. Since the script was perhaps trying to do too many things at once, there was a need to resort to extensive flashbacks to explain what should have been key plot points. Apparently no one wanted to work hard enough to weave those plot points into the script, so they resorted to Gilligan's Island-style flashbacks to reveal key pieces of information that would have made the story much more coherent had those bits of information simply been given to us in the first place.<br/><br/>That would have entailed some deft script-writing and, again, it doesn't seem like anyone other than Catherine Zeta-Jones and Matt Damon wanted to work that hard in this film. George Clooney and Brad Pitt spend most of their time on screen trying to out-smirk each other. I'd smirk a lot too if I was being to do as little as each did in this movie.<br/><br/>The most annoying bit of contrivance was the ever-so-cutey-pie idea of having Tess Ocean, played by Juila Roberts, of course, pretend to be Julia Roberts. I guess that gave them an excuse to let Bruce Willis add a few smirks of his own to the story.<br/><br/>In well-done ""con"" movies, like The Sting or even the Oceans Eleven remake, the viewer is pulled into the heist and knows enough about the con being pulled to enjoy seeing it unfold. In Oceans Twelve, the heist becomes secondary at best, with the story of the actual heists told in flashbacks. From the flashbacks it looks as if they had the makings of a pretty good sequel, but instead of telling us the story of the heist,we got a weak episode of the old TV show ""It Takes a Thief."" Perhaps most annoying feature of this movie were the painfully obvious teases for yet another sequel. When that comes out, I'll pass, but I do have a suggestion. Since they spent so much time telling the story of Oceans Twelve in plot-repairing or plot-supplying flashbacks, why not just tell us how they pulled the heist so that I don't have to sit through two hours of fluff to get there.<br/><br/>Mediocre at best."
"kimflorenceasta","1","7","10","1 January 2005"," almost no story combined with bad acting
","Although the movie was filmed for most part in the beautiful city of Amsterdam, I found it hard to stay awake during my watching. There hardly isn't a story to be found in the movie. The story that is there is full of mistakes and because of that didn't make much sense to me. What really annoyed me though was the bad acting. Some famous movie stars, for example Catherina Zeta Jones, just put on an overdone accent, smiled like a princess and read their lines. That is were their acting stopped. I think it is a shame this movie was actually released. To conclude my opinions on a positive note: I liked Julia Roberts in the movie."

Catherine Z. Jones-Douglas gave her typical lackluster performance and Julia Roberts cameoed in her own film.

","Sure, this movie wasn't as good as the prequel, but it is great for what it is... a comedic heist film with the best cast ever.<br/><br/>This movie lives up to the star power shown in Ocean's Eleven, but it has a different twist of humour.

"stonedonkies","Null","8","12","21 January 2006"," A brilliant satire of the heist movie... I think.
","I sat for a couple hours after seeing Ocean's Twelve trying to figure out why Soderbergh and gang had made such an outrageous film. Too much of it didn't add up: the ridiculous laser system guarding the egg in the museum and the equally ridiculous way in which it was defeated; the flashbacks containing information that completely undermined the apparent narrative thrust; Julia Roberts' plot twist and the avalanche of seemingly nonsensical and irrelevant self-reference that immediately followed; O12 had me completely stumped. Until I re-interpreted these scenes as clues towards something else: that O12 is not, in fact, a heist movie, but a *satire* of the heist movie.<br/><br/>Why else would someone of Sod's stature overstuff the film with clichés, like the enigmatic and debonair master thief, and the colorful and completely trustworthy team of people who would never exist in real life? One character (the woefully underused Eddie Izzard) even overtly mentions that one particular element of the film is a cliché -- but he doesn't say what it is a cliché *of*. Notice all the decoys, impostors, holograms, secret languages... O12 is littered with breadcrumbs, and I'm willing to believe that there was never actually a spec script called ""Honor Among Thieves."" As a heist movie, it falls flat on its face, arguably worse than Hudson Hawk (which suffered more from sheer goofiness overload, rather than bewildering nonsense). It simply does not make sense. How did the Night Fox get into that house in Amsterdam? Conveniently not explained. How did Benedict find all of the Twelve at once? Conveniently not explained. How did Julia Roberts' plot twist work, while Matt Damon is with her but does not experience the same story change? Conveniently brushed off. How in the name of Zeus did a certain someone show up out of the blue while the gang was locked up and help them with a certain problem? How was this individual aware of certain aspects of Isabel Lahiri's paperwork? An outlandish narrative convenience... or a satire of the genre? Why was so little narrative dedicated to convincing the audience of Benedict's extremely vindictive motivation? How else do you explain the obvious expenses the thieves racked up in their very quest to make money? I mean, come on, when Damon and the other two remaining thieves start spouting off all the heist jargon as they try to figure out a contingency plan... it's preposterous. No one talks like that.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm reaching. But either way you slice it, O12 is much, much more enjoyable as a *satire* of the heist film. That's the only way I can understand the film. I know why a sequel was made, certainly: The original made over $450 million dollars worldwide, far and away Sod's most financially successful film. Its closest competitor is Erin Brockovich, which made a little over $250M worldwide, and Traffic clocks in at a little over $200M. Successful, certainly, but not blockbusters like O11 was. A sequel was as inevitable as death and taxes. So it occurs to me that Sod decided he might as well have fun with it -- screw with the audience a little, poke fun at the actors themselves (good naturedly), and they still walked away with about $360M.<br/><br/>There also might be a meta-commentary going on about American audiences and how little they catch on to stylistic subversion (I am an American myself, for the record) but it's pure speculation. All I can tell you is that O12 simply does not work as a straightforward film and can really only be enjoyable as a satire. There's simply too many outrageous scenes and too many clichés. There are simply too many lines of dialog that only make sense if the whole movie is a genre skewer. It's also much easier on my brain. And I'd like to think that Sod hadn't morphed into a cynical robber baron who no longer cared about making a good movie."

"tedg","Null","42","85","10 December 2004"," Shifting Realities
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I'll go to see any Soderbergh film, but in the past I'd have to be prepared for them to be either one of his 'serious' or 'cash in' projects. Cashing in is okay, but I think his serious experiments say a lot about his intuitions and intents. They aren't the most intelligent experiments, but possibly the cream of the mainstream Hollywood director's establishment.<br/><br/>Here we get both rolled into one. Its not as edgy or visually intelligent as 'Good Thief,' but it has some elements.<br/><br/>First the bad: Soderbergh's notion of structure is the vignette. He'll shape a segment as if it were a skit with all else just backstory. For instance he has here a terrific piece where Pitt and Clooney as veterans and Damon as novice go to visit a Dutch heist coordinator. They converse in a highly abstract and idiosyncratic parablese which amuses us and flummoxes Damon. Damon inadvertently calls the boss's young niece a slut, and we are never sure who is putting on whom.<br/><br/>It is a wonderful orchestration of clever writing, spontaneous acting and intimate camera-work. These last two are a particular concern of Soderbergh's, but with a well-written shape it both confused and clarified in different directions. This one segment is the soul of the whole project: it amuses, it has a lot of collaborative, seemingly ad hoc acting, and it makes no sense.<br/><br/>This was never a heist film, instead it is in the con genre. That genre derives from the detective story where the writer is trying to fool the viewer (and some characters). In the con, some characters try to fool some other characters and the writer selectively covers and uncovers narrative so that the viewer is fooled as well.<br/><br/>Interesting twists happen when the viewer is fooled differently than the sucker character, or when there are multiple and parallel cons. The narrative folding comes in the parallel, warring realities that the viewer must surf. But always there is a resolution of the 'real' narrative, just as in the detective story. You always find out who is the fooler and who the foolee (including ourselves).<br/><br/>And as with the detective story, we are told just _how_ it is done. We expect this and have to be given some special reward if this doesn't happen.<br/><br/>It doesn't happen here. There is no way to go back and put together a story that makes any sense at all. Surely this could have been done, but the plain fact is that Soderbergh doesn't care and he wants us to know he doesn't.<br/><br/>Instead, he wants us to focus on his folding. He folds all his 'serious' films: movies about movies (more than four levels deep in 'Full Frontal') or about imagined reality. 'Limey' overlaid scattered intent with parallel jumpcuts.<br/><br/>In this case, he has Julia acting a character who pretends to be Julia. In an homage to 'The Player' he has Bruce Willis as her companion when Julia com Julia. You can just imagine him cackling with his players over this bit.<br/><br/>But it is all clever bits like this in the small: nothing clever at the scale of a real movie. For that, we'll have to wait until he stumbles away from his enchantment with the miracle of acting and discovers the miracle of long form writing.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","Really great movie. Honestly, it's better than the first one. The main reason I liked the movie is that it's so beautiful. It as an amazing 70's look and the soundtrack is incredible. Just one thing tough : why is Catherine Zeta Jones' an actress??? She is always BAD and Ocean's Twelve confirms it!!! They also push a little too much with Julia Roberts' part, it's a little too risky, and honestly, it does not really worked for me. It's a little incoherent at the end. It opens way too much on something we're no sure about. Globally, I can't believe the ideas! It's never boring and quite funny. The funniest part?... when Danny and Rusty are waiting to go on the job and watching movie while pouring wine."
"johnlewis","1","9","14","20 December 2004"," An Empty Shell Game with the viewing audience as the mark.
","I usually try to keep silent about movies I really disliked, but this one goes too far, and seems to be getting off the hook with both the public and reviewers. The two main problems this film had were: 1. The plot, tension, action, and every other feature possible were vastly inferior to the Oceans 11 remake from two years ago. That movie was also on the light and fluffy side of things, but at least it had some real thriller elements and some good solid action to fill out the plot holes. This film has almost no action, no tension (this is not a thriller), and the characters are obviously all just rich actors sitting around BSing (reading their script), admittedly having a great time doing so, but...<br/><br/>Which leads into point #2: this is a very boring film. This is why I have never written a review like this. Every time someone else reviews a film I liked, and calls it boring, I feel that the review is unfair and should not have been written by that person since they obviously don't like the particular genre. The problem is I love flawed but interesting action thrillers like Ocean 11 (both original and the remake). O-12 had far too much dialog from these gleeful stars. The so called brilliance of the two ringleaders George Clooney and Brad Pitt was so trite and unbelievable. The things they could find out about totally unknown identities of other crime figures were ridiculous. None of the lead roles demonstrated the least bit of superior intelligence in anything they said or did, except possibly Katherine Z-J, but she wasn't a criminal, so what is the point?<br/><br/>Finally, the Julia Roberts thing was a travesty. I just hated it. It wasn't funny. It was only an empty shell game, and the only mark was the entire theatre audience for wasting $6 or $8 on such an empty movie. This whole film was like a loose, very weak imitation of The Spanish Prisoner. Since all the crooks had no brains, it was totally unbelievable and boring."
"cjanine23","10","13","22","6 January 2005"," This movie is awesome!!!!
","I went and saw this movie last night and as the first one I loved the second one. The best part is when Tess(Julia Roberts) has to pretend to be herself. And the fact that they pulled it off(I knew they would) and trumped the Italian guy. The scenery of Lake Como was awesome. Did they film it at George Clooney's villa? When Rusty takes Isabel to meet her father made me cry. I didn't meet my dad until late in life and it really touched me to see his character cry when meeting her for the first time, as if he was seeing her born for the first time. All in all this movie rocks. Keep movies like these coming. The only part of the movie I didn't quite understand was when they are all arrested and then Lynus's mom comes in and tries to get him to testify against his friends. Then they all leave. What were they let go? Was it all apart of a plan to catch the Italian guy? Either way this movie was great I wish they'd think about doing a third one cause I can't get enough of these guys."
"feelinglistless","10","10","16","28 August 2005"," weird chemistry
","There are certain times at the cinema when it slowly becomes clear that you're the only person who is loving the film. A weird chemistry occurs in which your enjoyment of the evening is diametrically opposed to everyone elses. And so it was tonight during Ocean's Twelve. It really isn't the film anyone was expecting, but that actually means is so much better. If you're a fan of the first film because of all the heist hijinks you'll probably hate this. If you're a fan of Steven Soderbergh and seen all of his films, you'll just love it.<br/><br/>I don't want to talk about the plot here because frankly you wouldn't believe me. Just when you think the film is going to settle down into some kind of recognisable rhythm, something entirely unexpected is thrown in turning everything on it's head. You know the moment at the end of the first film when everything you thought you saw turned out to be something different? Pretty much every scene here is like that. Which is probably were I and nearly all the mean spirited reviews I've read part company. The general feeling seems to be that the plot was thrown together and the story lacks structure. Well yes that's the point. Soderbergh's messing about with what you're allowed to do in a so-called typical Hollywood sequel. It's experimental rather than erratic.<br/><br/>I'll admit to a degree that is a greatest hits of Soderbergh's greatest hits, with a variety of film stock and messy camera angles on display. Flashbacks are in full evidence as are the freeze frames and captions in multiple fonts. But so what? Would it have been better if some hack had been hired to trot out a clone of the first film, clinically perfect without any passion? He should be applauded for not making the same movie again, opting instead for something which resembles his own Full Frontal, with obscure film in-jokes intact. Go with an open mind and a clear heart."
"htowninsomniac","3","4","5","19 February 2006"," Only makes it half-way
","""Ocean's Twelve"" tries to copy the non-linear style of ""Ocean's Eleven"" that leaves the viewer guessing until the very end, but it only manages to get half way: Instead of being confusing and smart, this movie just ends up confusing. Instead of working on pulling off one major job, the group of twelve is now sent from one job to another, and in the end, they all somehow end up as inconsequential. Why are they inconsequential? I can't really tell you. The movie lacks logic. My guess is the director just felt it wasn't quite complex enough, so he threw in another shocking twist. And Julia Roberts basically playing... Julia Roberts? That almost made me vomit in ""Notting Hill"" already. ""Ocean's Twelve"" was a sore disappointment."
"stamper","6","4","5","4 January 2005"," I think the cast had a better time on this one than the public has, or maybe I just hope so
","I went to this movie, not expecting much. Actually I didn't even intend to go, since I thought it would be a crap movie, but you know how it is when a friend of yours wants to go to the movies with you. SOmetimes it's just hard to pick a movie. I had coincidentally seen quite a few cinematic releases recently, he doesn't like Jim Carrey (Series of unfortunate Events) and the rest of the films are even more unappealing than Ocean's Twelve (Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Alexander, The Grudge or some stupid dutch film like Floris). What do you do then? You settle for the lesser evil: Ocean's Twelve! Finally when you go to the cinema with expectations that low, you sometimes are surprised at how good the film actually is. Too bad Ocean's Twelve isn't one of them. I actually felt that the whole first hour of the film was pretty bad. It could have been much tighter, even in the beginning. I mean, why make the part with Benedict all so lengthy when god knows there are telephones and Danny Ocean is the leader. But that's not the main problem with this film. I mean while it is fun to see all the characters from the first film in action and the whole deal Julia Roberts in the hotel are well-meant the entire film has nothing of the adventure of the first. There is no excitement, no suspense, even no sexual tension between any of the characters (I was especially disappointed with Zeta-Jones' addition on that last point). I can see what the story is here, but it is just too elaborate and there are too many different set-up's. The whole thing is filmed in a very uninvolved and non-thrilling way, which is exasperated (I've seen Shaun of the dead as well!) by the fact that many to all of the heists and set-up's are revealed after they have already been made. Also: why set up another heist when you could set up Benedict again? The makers of the film clearly want to make you think they do it because they itch. Well make it clearer and more obvious to see. For I do not believe it after seeing this film.<br/><br/>When criticizing this movie, one has to include the cast and I must say that overall I was pretty disappointed with it. George Clooney didn't have any charisma this time around as Danny 'smooth operator' Ocean , Andy Garcia wasn't quite mean enough, I can't figure out why Bernie Mac was in the film and as already mentioned I felt that there was more potential romantic / sexual potential in Zeta-Jones' character. So far as to doing you job badly. The rest of the cast was only mediocre, with the exception of Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts who did OK. Considering Vincent Cassel, I just thought he was miscast and the entire character structure was crap. I mean an adversary to THE GANG should have been much different than the character he played and his whole scheme and and his whole set-up could have been much more believable. No matter how mediocre I thought the acting was, it is not my intention to slam the actors here, for much of the blame can be allocated to the writers and the director (most obviously in Zeta-Jones' respect).<br/><br/>Is there nothing good then here? Well, of course there are some nice moments in the film and it makes you smile at times. Of course it isn't a total snooze-fest and not utterly boring, but it compared to it's predecessor it really is A LOT worse. I'd actually given this one only a 5 out of 10, but because of some nice bits and that tad of charme that shine through at times I'll be gentle this time.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 <br/><br/>post scriptum: please no Ocean's 13 or Ocean's 10 / Ocean's 9 (after one or two members of the crew have been kidnapped<br/><br/>I BEG YOU !!!!!!!!!!"

Granted, it had all of the actors, including Catherine Zeta Jones, and a few funny/exciting scenes. But there was pretty much no suspense. I will not give any spoilers, but Ocean's Twelve, in the end, leaves you wanting more, not as in a third movie, but as in at least some creativity in the heist, and in the movie altogether.

"MovieAddict2016","5","6","9","15 September 2006"," Dull and disappointing.
","Heist movies should be fun and entertaining  not dull and glib. But that's precisely what ""Ocean's Twelve"" is  a smug, slow exercise in Hollywood banality. You can feel the sweaty palms of fattened executives draining the zest and energy out of this picture. Granted, the first movie wasn't anything great, but it was unassuming and amiable  a bunch of celebrities got together, had a good time, and made a movie that invited the viewer along for the ride. It worked as a slice of distracting summer cinema.<br/><br/>But ""Ocean's Twelve"" suffers from that complex that a lot of sequels get  you know, the first flick is an unexpected success, and then the studios push for a sequel and completely dominate the production now knowing they have a bona fide lucrative franchise on their hands.<br/><br/>In this case it feels as if the studio execs weren't the only ones to blame. The cast is obnoxiously self-aware  in the first film Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) walked the line between ""cool"" and ""fool"" and in ""Ocean's Twelve"" he comes across as an utterly annoying, wannabe hipster. I don't think Brad Pitt is necessarily to blame, although his delivery of lines doesn't help much. They sound forced and overtly dramatic. It just isn't real enough, even for escapism.<br/><br/>Some of the actors seem to disappear for large amounts of time  Andy Garcia and Bernie Mac must have been called away for another shoot, because they mostly vanish after the first fifteen minutes. In fact, the first fifteen minutes of the film really just exists to give Garcia a role in the movie  except for a brief appearance at the end, it's the only screen time he really gathers.<br/><br/>The new additions seem tacky and unnecessary  likewise the cameos are contrived, and the self-referential Julia Roberts-playing-Tess-playing-Julia-Roberts scene must have looked a lot better on paper.<br/><br/>Soderbergh's direction is harder and laced with grit  the hand-cam shots and filtered bleak cinematography really give the film an abysmal edge that hinders it. The original was vibrant, colorful and alive  ""Twelve"" is dead from the start.<br/><br/>Not a terrible motion picture by any standard, but then again I'd hardly feel compelled to label this ""entertainment."" It's a sporadically amusing, mostly grueling sequel that never really rings true  it's like an exclusive in-joke for the cast and crew, and the audience's involvement was obviously of secondary importance during filming."

","Clooney and cohorts are back with a predictable script--the owner of the Bellagio, the victim in the first movie, wants his money back even though he has already been paid by his insurance company (defamation lawsuit anybody) and through some convoluted plot sequence it is determined that Clooney has 2 weeks or is it a month, or is it Monday afternoon, to do something. On-screen notes give time lines, but it is never certain what the time lines are for--either getting the money back, or the second heist, or the date the Bellagio owner is going to do away with Clooney. The ending makes no sense so I can't spoil it because I never really got it. However, it should be noted that Albert Finney as the real mastermind thief and Bruce Willis as himself are both uncredited--probably at their own request. Although Julia Roberts plays the role of Ocean's wife Tess, she also is uncredited--the credits actually state, ""and introducing Tess as Julia Roberts."" Julia's probably hoping people will think it wasn't her, especially since she wore no makeup (evidently to make her role as a housewife more believable.) IMDb won't let me give a lower rating than 1 star, but a one half star each for Catherine Zeta-Jones' and George Clooney's looks does add up to 1 star total."

","""Ocean's Twelve"" is possibly the most underrated film I've ever seen. If you haven't seen the film, watch it now (or better yet after seeing ""Ocean's Eleven""). Forgive me for giving away scenes of this film, but I cannot properly describe what I love about it without doing so. Everything about this movie is brilliant, and you won't realize that from seeing it only once. By watching it many times with my family, I've found that this film is chock-full or little surprises and ingenious quotes you won't help but remember; from the great gag with Julia Roberts pretending to be herself (including a cameo with Bruce Willis) to the Night Fox's (an excellent character) attempt to steal the artifact Danny and his gang are after, the plot and script are excellent. If you only choose to see the film once, you'll be not only confused but possibly bored with the film. Multiple viewings will cause you to see how amazing this film is. In my opinion, it's the best of the ""Ocean's"" series.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

No ingenious robbery, the use of equipment/technology that would have cost more than value of the stolen item (if they had stolen anything) and complete lack of believability. Let's face it, in any super heist film, a good script and acting will make you think ""yeah, it could work"" - not here it doesn't. What else? Oh yes, boring and often incomprehensible conversations, camera movements that are screamingly annoying and a general absence of any direction. Can a minus 1 be awarded?"

Another master thief offers to pay them the money if they can steal the 1st Faberge Egg before he does... Most of the movie is there just to give each star equal amount of screen time, mostly to show the love story sub-plots. The movie drags on and on with out anything happening. Only the last third has anything to do with the heist (which how they do it is ridicules). The part where Julia Roberts character plays Julia Roberts is the worst scan in a movie ever. I would liken this movie to other mindless romantic comedies like Sweet Home Alabama... It would be an OK movie to rent, where you don't have to pay much attention to the screen and still not miss anything."

I have lost count of the times I've watched Ocean's Twelve on DVD - it is pure, engaging entertainment, a 2000's version of a 60's movie. Audrey and Carey are lurking just around the corner. There is something plain likable about a bunch of desperate thieves who have a conscience, and actors who buy into the dynamic. The dialog is snappy, the situations are believable, if not entirely plausible, but not absurd either. I liked Ocean's Eleven, this one with the European connection is classier, and funnier. The music is upbeat, and attractive, like almost everything else about the production. Actually, I can't think of anything negative about it - maybe a few scenes look fudged, but that is only apparent after looking at it repeatedly. The plot switches are most satisfying. This movie is smart."

","This may be number two in what is another franchise but Steven Soderbergh's love of movies and the movie-making process is evident in every fabulous looking frame, (this is probably the best-looking movie you'll see all year), and if the extremely daft plot, (there are daft heist movies and then there is ""Ocean's 12""), could be scribbled on the back of a postage stamp this is also the most sheerly enjoyable film I have seen in a very long time.<br/><br/>As for that daft plot, it exists only as an excuse to do a follow-up to the hugely successful ""Ocean's 11"". It's complicated, at times it's basically non-existent and this movie, more than the last one, often feels like a bunch of pals goofing around in front of the camera; (remember the very first ""Ocean's 11"" with the Rat Pack? Well, that's what killed it). The difference here is that everyone on screen is having a ball and it's infectious and Soderbergh is a master stylist and a great innovator who loves playing fast and loose with plot mechanics. None of it may make the slightest bit of sense yet there is not a redundant moment in the whole movie. Clooney, Damon, Pitt, Reiner and Gould are all marvellous; Julia Roberts has one great scene in which her character Tess passes herself off as ... Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones works wonders the the film's only misbegotten character, Pitt's love interest who happens to be the female detective on everybody's tail. It may be inspired silliness but I loved it to bits and can't wait to see ""Ocean's 13""."
"nycritic","10","6","10","30 May 2007"," The Second Time Around
","Now, the trick with a sequel to a remake of a lesser movie is this: how to repeat the magic without making it a bland retread of what's been seen before? Well. It's a truth universally acknowledged that when a film revolves around a heist that goes smoothly even when the victim may eventually retaliate, the only thing its sequel do is go the opposite direction: build momentum around another heist that will redeem our pack of thieves from their state of disgrace and send the story off some odd directions with characters who have their own ulterior motives. If you look closely you can actually feel the noose slowly start tightening itself around Danny Ocean's group. Eccentrics pop in and out, never to be seen again, leaving their own mark -- this is a light ballet gliding towards the moment when everything converges, gets messed up... and to say more would be criminal. You have to experience it on your own. See how one of the most ballsy in-jokes involving a certain Oscar-winning actress from one of Soderbergh's earlier films obliquely leads to the denouement where not one, but two double-climaxes -- one frankly hilarious, fraught with its own little family dysfunction, the other sweetly emotional -- virtually sweep the rug off of you. If that isn't entertainment, I don't know what is."

","With a cast like this, I knew the acting would be amazing. Still, I was cautious, as I always am of sequels. Would it sustain the feeling of the first film? Could they possibly replicate the tension and thrill of the masterful heist of Ocean's 11? We'll never know, because they didn't try. At least, not in the way I expected. Instead, they made a light and truly funny parody of the heist genre. If you want a gripping, logical heist, don't watch this.

In my opinion the audience is taken on a spectacular joy-ride with many twists and turns. The Actors and Actresses play their roles as you want them to. Everyone is believable and funny in their own way. Vincent Cassel is my favorite actor in this movie, don't get me wrong they were all very good but he stood out a little bit. The people who have seen the Movie already know which scene I'm talking about.

"MartynGryphon","7","5","8","15 February 2005"," Very Entertaining if not disappointing
","Oceans 12 has been given a lot of bad press, Some, if not most of it, deserved. However, there is no escaping the fact that this is a very funny and very entertaining movie.<br/><br/>The film does have it's bad points though, first of all Andy Garcia reprising his role as Casino Owner Terry Benedict, is hardly given screen time apart for some at the beginning and some at the end, as a result the film is robbed of a really menacing 'bad guy' even though our hero's are in fact villains themselves. With this in mind I cannot help but feel that the trailer is somewhat misleading, as it wrongly portrays Benedict to be a major protagonist in this sequel, when he's there only to flesh out the plot.<br/><br/>Three good things about this movie is Matt Damon, Matt Damon and Matt Damon as he is the only person on the screen that is taking his role half seriously, and he's a delight to watch, especially when he takes the reigns when most of his cohorts are incarcerated.<br/><br/>Most of the cast from the first film, seems to be there only to tie it in with oceans 11 as Elliott Gould hardly says a thing neither does Carl Riener, and Bernie Mac spends the majority of the movie in a dutch prison and is hardly seen.<br/><br/>Clooney and Pitt, don't seem as cool or as smart as in the 1st movie, and the whole team show themselves to be nothing more than frightened children afraid of the boogeyman, when confronted with an irate hotel owner to whom they owe nearly $200 million. So in contrast from the 'who care's who we're stealing from' type of guys we were introduced to a couple of years ago. This is where the disappointment of the movie comes.<br/><br/>Catherine Zeta Jones, is introduced as some Interpol type of cop, who conveniently used to have an affair with Pitt's character, and for the first time in ages, she doesn't adopt a phony American accent, which subsequently make this one of her less annoying roles.<br/><br/>We are also introduced to a character called 'nightfox' who tries to steal a faberge egg by somersaults, back flipping and dancing over the laser floor sensors, just like erm....Catherine Zeta Jones did in Entrapment.<br/><br/>I almost die form Calcium overdose when the movie gets so cheesy to include a scene with Bruce Willis as Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts, pretending to be Julia Roberts, the cheese continues, when a woman comes to question the group from prison, which, (and quite predictably might I add), turns out to be Damon's Characters Mother. and the mozzarella marathon continues in the clichéd and predictable scene where Jones is reunited with her father.<br/><br/>Contrary to the shape my review is taking, I did like the movie, and there was enough shenanigans to keep me chuckling throughout. However, a further sequel would be ill advised as it in no way stands up to the 1st movie.<br/><br/>This movie will not win any Oscars, but an award should be given to Casey Afflecks Moustache, for 'best supporting actor in a comedy role' such is it's hilarity."
"meako1973","7","5","8","1 February 2005"," A second dose of Cool
","Ocean's 11 was always going to be a tough act to follow. Breaking the remake rules by firstly remaking a pretty bad movie (as opposed to the usual method of going for a good one to remake), and then making it into one of the freshest films of recent years was quite a double whammy. The cast were cool, the story was cool, the setting of Las Vegas was cool, the soundtrack was cool, and the direction was cool. It was, you could say, a cool movie! Well, when all involved said they wanted to do another one (and even took a pay cut to prove that they weren't just in it for the money), fingers were crossed. Could they repeat the success, or would it be a prime example of lightning never striking twice.<br/><br/>Ocean's Twelve picks up a few years after events of the last film, with all the band of thieves scattered, and still trying to outrun Casino owner, victim of their heist, Tess's ex, and all round nasty piece of work, Terry Benedict. However, it seems, pretty soon into the film, that Benedict has found them, with the help of a mysterious ally. To appease him, they all need to pay back what they stolewith interest! In order to obtain the cash they must plan another heist. To complicate matters there is the small detail of Rusty's (Pitt) recent ex-girlfriend, Isable (Zeta Jones), an Interpol agent tracking down them, and the mysterious thief The Nightfox, who has a small matter of honor to work out.<br/><br/>The film takes around 20 minutes to really get started, and that first 20 minutes will alienate a lot of people who just want to chew popcorn and be excited. The initial set-up doesn't seem to work well, and is what lets this film down. However, for those of you who can keep your attention over this troubled start, what kicks in after that marker is another slice of that cool we were delivered in the first movie. Once Ocean's Twelve hits its stride, it paces along wonderfully, with each scene flowing nicely into the next. The witty dialogue and interplay between the characters is as snappy as before, and you just can't help but get that buzz. This time around Julia Roberts, as Tess, gets her own moment to shine, in a scene which some have criticised for being cheesy, but I thought was immensely fun.<br/><br/>All is assisted by the same snappy cut direction, with good use of filters and cuts allowing each scene to bounce along vibrantly to the cool score. Yup, as with the last film, the soundtrack is toe-tappingly good, and adds a colourful energy to the events unfolding on screen.<br/><br/>All in all, a damn good attempt at a sequel. Not on par with the first, but I never expected it to be. Let down mainly by that off putting first 20 minutes, but recovers nicely to deliver a good end result."
"ebolart","10","5","8","15 January 2005"," style in motion
","The key to understanding Ocean's Twelve and enjoying it is to realize that this film does not try to be a film about a bunch of gangsters pulling off a heist. It is a film about style. When it is explained in the end how they pulled off their heist, we understand that almost everything they did in the last third of the movie had no reason at all. They just did it for the style points and to make their adversary's defeat even more bitter. In my book, that's style. The movie flows freely, never really climaxing, watching beautiful people with beautiful voices, dressed in the height of fashion. It is amusing, not really funny except occasionally, not really suspenseful, but it is permeated by the feeling that everyone involved had a lot of fun - and it practically oozes out of the screen infecting the audience. It seems as if Soderbergh thought that he had done ""his heist-movie"" in Ocean's Eleven, so now he made the ""meta heist-movie"". It is a thoroughly enjoyable experience and i left the theater with a feeling of joy in my heart and the wisdom of true style in my bones. Style Uber Alles! Mahalo!"
"Fantazmya","7","5","8","26 December 2004"," One great big cast party
","Soderbergh is a fabulous director, but nothing he could conjure could beat the amazing cast he gathered for this zenith of sequels. Clearly, he knew this from the get-go. The term ""star-vehicle"" has traditionally been used to refer to a movie that builds itself around one star. What this film does is net a whole herd of Hollywood hot shots and make them shine even brighter than before. The last scene says it all--all the stars sitting around with NOTHING happening and NOTHING being said. We just get to see them socialize as though it were a scene from a reality show where George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Don Cheadle are just hanging out, being themselves. So the story's not important at all--at least, that's not where the films' greatest pleasures come from. If you want a clever heist movie, better stick with 11. But if star-gazing turns you on, this will make your day."

","Sorry, folks.<br/><br/>This may have been an all-star cast and all that stuff, but the movie just wasn't that good. Lame plot and bad acting. In addition, they did not use a steadicam on several of the scenes and if you are susceptible to motion sickness, you're gonna have a bad time.<br/><br/>Even the little twist of having Julia Roberts play a character playing the role of Julia Roberts couldn't save this dog. It was cute enough that I gave the film a 3 instead of a 1, but it is the only saving grace and they ran it into the ground quickly enough. Bruce Willis might as well have been seeing dead folks in this film, too."
"Brogan","10","5","8","11 December 2004"," Twelve is different than Eleven.
","To be honest, I saw this movie back in August at a special advance screening. I was actually so overwhelmed because I got to meet and talk to Steve Soderbergh before and after the film. In my opinion, Soderbergh is one of the few directors whose films I can trust for quality entertainment, intellect, and style. But to review the movie back then would have been unfair, it's like judging the first demo take of the Beatles song ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" before George Martin added the tape loops.<br/><br/>So I decided to wait and review the movie after seeing the final cut, and I was actually pleased that I did that, because just like what I've been telling people for four months and will continue to tell people ""Twelve is different that Eleven."" ""Oh, o.k. so it's not good."" Is what most reactions are after I make that comment. ""No, not true,"" I replied. OCEANS TWELVE is different that OCEANS ELEVEN, the same way KILL BILL VOL. 1 was different that KILL BILL VOL. 2. VOL. 1 was the ultimate homage to the films of the Shaw Bros., VOL. 2 was the homage to the Spaghetti Westerns. OCEANS ELEVEN captured the hip and cool feel of the Vegas heyday of the 60's, when Frank, Dino, Peter, Sammy, and Pal Joey ruled the strip. OCEANS TWELVE captures the European feel when Truffaut, Godard, and Fellini were kings of the art house cinemas. OCEANS TWELVE takes place three years after the infamous ""Belligo heist"" when Danny Ocean (Clooney), gathered his crew of men and managed to steal over $160 million dollars from casino Mongol, Terry Benedict (Garcia). Now Benedict has tracked Ocean and his entire crew, and the situation has turned into what Danny's wife Tess (Roberts) alerts Danny about Benedict knowing who did the heist, ""the basement is flooded and the lights are out."" So Danny gathers his entire crew back together again: Rusty (Pitt), Linus (Damon), Basher (Cheadle), Saul (Reiner), Ruben (Gould), the ""Mormon twins"" (Affleck & Caan), Yen (Qin), Dell (Eddie Jemison), and Frank (Mac). The first scene when the entire crew are all together manages to create some nice witty in-joke laughs, such as Turk Malloy questioning Ocean, ""and since when was this called 'Oceans Eleven?'"" The problem is that Benedict knows who pulled off the heist three years ago, he's angry and wants all $160 million dollars back, plus three years worth of interest. The problem, Ocean and his crew can't pull off any job in America since their faces are well known. The solution, go overseas to Europe and pull off another heist to payback Benedict.<br/><br/>Yet there is still two other problems, first, it turns out that Rusty had a relationship with Isabel (Zeta-Jones) and suddenly left her after she was about to find out the person who pulled off a heist was actually Rusty. Now Isabel is one of the top detectives of the Euro-Pol force for the crime division. Second, there is another master thief Toulour (Cassel), who calls himself ""the Fox"" decides to have some fun of his own with Ocean and his crew. OCEANS TWELVE succeeds the same way OCEANS ELEVEN did, is one of the most enjoyable, witty, and entertaining movies of the year. Yet, like KILL BILL VOL. 2, OCEANS TWELVE is more plot and character orientated. And with OCEANS ELEVEN where the focus of the romance was Danny and Tess; OCEANS TWELVE it focuses on Rusty and Isabel, with some very enjoyable flashback scenes. Soderbergh again has a batting average of Barry Bonds, and hits another home run with this film. His directing is fantastic, capturing the look, mood, and feel of the European heist films such as GRAND SLAM, the original Italian JOB, and TOPKAPI. Such as the pan of the camera to focus on a particular character, the rapid zoom close-up shots, and the freeze shot before cutting to another scene. Yet he blends it well with modern European style with the technology, talk, and fashion of the modern hip world. I mean, I would love to hang out with this crew! I also highly enjoyed the soundtrack music supervised and composed by David Holmes (who also did Soderbergh's OCEANS ELEVEN and OUT OF SIGHT). Holmes did a great job using his very hip-techno mixes and songs and mixing it well with 60's era European artist such as actress/singer Ornella Vanoni, and composer Piero Umiliani. And the performances are fun and enjoyable to watch. It is obvious that all of the cast members had a fun time while making this movie, and it shows. Yet, that doesn't mean that the viewer should be left out, since there are some witty scenes that make a lot of reference to the previous film, the way Linus trying to understand how Danny and Rusty operate, and about the twelfth member of the crew looking like somebody else. While OCEANS TWELVE doesn't have a intelligent or great plot like COLLATERAL, SIDEWAYS, RAY, or THE INCREDIBLES. It does exactly what it promises. It promises fun, enjoyment, and laughs, and that is exactly what you will get when watching OCEANS TWELVE. This isn't the most intellectual film of the year, but it is the best looking, and one of the most entertaining and best films of this year. Hats off to Soderbergh, Holmes, writer Geoge Nolfi, and the entire cast for OCEANS TWELVE, for making a delightful film! ***** (out of five)"

Second almost all of the actors didn't make any effort to deliver their characters. Often I felt that almost everyone was just reading their lines without any emotion or passion - the only exception was Catherine Zeta Jones who made a genuine effort to deliver her character of an Interpol agent. Although her various successful and magical red-handed arrests of the various team members of Daniel Ocean appeared too cheesy at times.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts looks tired and old in most scenes; I don't understand why she couldn't have been made more presentable using make-up etc..<br/><br/>My recommendation is to wait for the DVD which should be out in a month or two."
"veryevilpenguin","5","5","8","8 December 2004"," Semi-enjoyable, overall a letdown with questionable cinematography
","Ocean's 12 is destined to be relegated to the pile of sequels that didn't live up to the original. Watching it made me wonder if I was viewing a 'final draft' cut as some of the cuts and 'shaky cam' footage were distracting and some of the cinematography was frustrating (ie: bright background with a foreground so dark that actors' features weren't detailed during dialog.) Seeing as a lot of the movie is set outdoors or in a large rundown warehouse it was never going to be as aesthetically beautiful as the original with its Las Vegas setting.<br/><br/>Content wise the movie stops and starts which slows down the continuity. The original (original meaning the movie from a couple of years ago) had a definite Bad Guy, a definite Goal and a definite direction towards that goal; that isn't the case here. A few plot lines are created that are left unresolved and some of the other plot lines have sizeable holes dotted through them.<br/><br/>A couple of comic moments (particularly the cameo and the 'impersonation') are wonderful and prevent the movie from becoming lifeless. If you enjoy 'I know what happened, but how did it happen?' movies then this is worth watching and if you're a fan of Catherine Zeta-Jones you'll love this movie as she's absolutely beautiful in it, but if you're expecting Andy Garcia to play a prominent role (his Bad Guy in the original was great) you'll be disappointed; if you're expecting a high-tech crime movie with believable techy stuff you'll be very disappointed; if you're expecting a visually great movie (which is a fair expectation considering the Rome/Amsterdam setting) you'll be disappointed.<br/><br/>The under-use of Andy Garcia's character makes me believe that he'll be the main Bad Guy again if significant box intake results in another movie - but don't bank on it.<br/><br/>2.5 / 5."

","Now, the idea itself of continuing with the Ocean's Eleven franchise was a bad idea in the first place. No movie could live up to the success and sheer brilliance of the first, but with a cast like that, and the visionary wonders of Soderberg, I suppose it was worth a try.<br/><br/>This time around, the team goes international after Mr. Benedict, the shrak-like Antonio Banderas, gives them two weeks to reapy their debts, with interest. It adds up to around 197 million dollars, which the team cannot put together. They find three high paying jobs, only to discover another, perhaps more talented, thief wishes to compete. His name is the NIghtfox, and he is working with Mr. Benedict (which you will find out later).<br/><br/>Now the movie is very different than the first. Not so much a smooth, jazzy flick anymore. The camera is often hand-held, which is new to Soderberg's previous style, but works nicely. The dialouge is funnier than the first movie, but less relevant. Possibly the funniest part in the movie is when the team discuss's why they were called ""Ocean's Eleven"", yet it doesn't move the movie along at all. The interactions between Rusty (Pitt) and Ocean (Clooney) is great. They work very well together.<br/><br/>The addition of the two new characters, Isabel (Zeta-Jones) and the Nightfox bring the movie to new hieghts. When in the first movie, Ocean picks this job for Tess (Roberts), this movie moves more with Rusty, as he chooses Amsterdam because Isabel is there.<br/><br/>Some of the shots are simply magnificent. When the Nightfox dances through the lasers, and when the incredible Julia Roberts plays...herself. It all just reminds me of what the definition of entertainment really is. <br/><br/>Not the first, and hopefully not the last. Soderberg, you bring hope in sequels."

It 's very clever the way they managed to develop this storyline for no apparent reason. As I previously mentioned, it's more of a fun film. This is the way you have to look at it. It 's one of those films that make u smile, intrigued and (probably) forget them minutes later. A little tip on the film. Julia was pregnant during the filming. U will not see any scenes with her belly showing. The most apparent is a big bucket in front of Julia's body. Wonderful film."

","I loved this movie, I thought it was far superior to the first in most ways. Where the first was just a fun heist movie with some fun characters and situations, this movie is one of the most technically perfect, well directed, beautifully shot movies I have seen in many years. I came out of the theater with a friend who is a cinematographer and we were both gob-smacked by what we had just seen. Even the obligatory airplane landing establishing/transition shot to connect the action in the U.S. to Europe isn't spared from Soderberg's innovative hands. The camera is directly under the path of the plane and as it passes overhead, we tilt over, and over and over and follow the plane until the camera POV is upside down as the plane comes in for it's landing. The concept isn't all that exciting, but the vibrance and energy little moments like that adds a great deal to the experience. The entire film seems to have been shot hand-held - not steady-cam, which can look too smooth for my tastes, but with an old-fashioned, over the shoulder camera rig. The camera doesn't do that ""modern"" (but actually outdated) shaky style that tries (and usually fails) to mimic a documentary feel. The camera is held as steady and is possible by the operators, but the natural, almost imperceptible slight movements the camera makes made the proceedings seem more immediate, a tad more frenetic and overall, more dynamic to watch. The photography is always beautiful and the choice of music throughout is dead-on. Again, all the performances are top notch, my only real complaint is that several of the characters seemed to have very little to do this time around. (Bernie Mac, most notably, who spends about 1/2 the movie in a prison cell - I want more Bernie!) But those are minor quibbles for what is over all a vastly superior movie to the first - this one is actually a work of art."

I also liked some of the new characters that appear, ESPECIALLY the detective played by Catherine Zeta Jones!!

","Ocean's 12 falls into the sequel trap. Either a sequel mimics the original and is bashed because its unoriginal or its different then the original and bashed for not being like the original. Oceans 12 falls into the second category. This movie is totally different then Oceans's 11, the only thing they have in common are the characters. 12 has a more tedious plot but is still extremely entertaining. The acting and cinematography are both great. This movie is less about Danny and more about Rusty, and Linus has a bigger part.

","I was such a fan of the first movie that I had to rush out and see this the first day it came out. Now, I understand the first movie was better, but this one is not that far off either. The first time I saw Oceans 12 I left the movies confused. After buying the DVD and listening and understanding the movie, I have absolutely enjoyed it to the fullest. With actors such as Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, and Matt Damon, How can the movie be bad. The story is much more hidden than in the first one, but it makes it all the more interesting as you have to follow each character in their own way. The stunts in the movie are great and the music is absolutely fantastic, especially towards the end in the laser scene. Oceans 11 was a 10. No doubt about it. This movie, is not that far off, thus my score will be a 9. For all of you who don't believe me, see it yourself, and don't listen to people who say the movie was terrible. It was the furthest thing from terrible."
"szisoman","8","3","4","22 February 2005"," Different & smart sequel
","Actually i wanted to give the film 8/10 but somehow clicked the button while it slipped to 10 somehow! Anyway, the film is quite good, i understand why many didn't like it but at first i was confused as how they got the Fabergé egg, but when i saw it a second time, i realized i had missed about 4 seconds that explained it all. It would be fair to say that the team this time got away with murder, seeing the way they got to it first before the Night Fox, it does amount to cheating but hey, this is robbery and he did bring it on himself by ratting out on them all for his inflated ego. the film veers quite a distance from the first one, i guess soderbergh was smart not to repeat himself or copy the same formula which would have been terribly boring. Instead, he changes it a bit & adds a different colour & dimensions to the characters. If someone wants to see a replica of Oceans eleven, then perhaps they wont appreciate 12 a lot, i prefer twelve to eleven as it was smarter & stylish. The bit where they try to fool the museum by pretending Julia Roberts is actually,Julia Roberts is quite an inventive piece, not to mention hilarious as well. I think for twelve to have been a really great film ,it would've been half an hour longer. The Night Fox is really more subtle & perhaps better than they are, after all, he is only one person & they are eleven, or are they now twelve? I didn't make out who is £ 12 now, Catherine zeta Jones or Vincent Cassel, cos at the end of the film one can clearly see there's gonna be a third installment & i hope there is, perhaps next time they rob a Japanese/Chinese museum, or attempt to steal diamonds from Africa, whatever they do i hope the same cast returns! Only thing i didn't like in the film was brad Pitt's hair!"
"drbone007","5","3","4","23 December 2004"," Review for Ocean's Twelve (Slight spoilers but not enough to blow the movie for you)
","Ocean's Twelve further proves the point that Hollywood needs to stop making sequels. The original movie was very well done and was a great crime caper movie. I loved how the movie confused you just enough so that at the end you sat there and said, ""damn, they're good."" This movie, on the other hand, provides much confusion but you never ever say, ""damn, they're good."" Half the time you have no idea what is going on and when you think you have a grip on it the movie throws another meaningless flashback.<br/><br/>The script of this movie falls very flat and despite the best efforts of the director to maintain the eye-popping cast of Cloony, Pitt, Damon and Roberts the movie is just plain bad. The plot had a little bit of promise with a Catch Me If You Can type thing going on between Zeta-Jones and Pitt. Also the addition of the Night Fox and the little game he plays with Ocean's twelve was a nice addition. But the problem is that the plot got really hokey really quickly. I rolled my eyes many a time at the corny dialogue and found the only amusing part to be when Pitt and Cloony talk code in front of Damon. But when the movie starts bringing in holographic eggs, laser trip sensors that need to have characters break dance across the floor, Bruce Willis in a random cameo and Julia Roberts needing to play herself for a distraction so that the 12 can steal something, the film just goes awry.<br/><br/>Overall, the film does not live up to the charming original. But it does prove one thing, even if you have a cast full of wonderful actors and award winning actresses, if you have a bad story your movie will bomb."
"anhedonia","4","3","4","20 December 2004"," Soderbergh's slumming
","About 80 minutes into ""Ocean's Twelve,"" there's a rather clever joke involving Tess. If you pay attention, you'll realize it's set up much earlier in a quick conversation between two characters. Even though you know it's coming, the joke's pretty funny. And it's made funnier by the novel use of a cameo appearance. This is not just a cameo for cameo's sake, but actually using a person to play with the plot. A nice touch, it is.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's about as interesting as director Steven Soderbergh's dull film gets. Reuniting the cast from the original remake, ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001), this one finds Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his band of thieves running to Europe to pull of heists to pay off Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the hotelier they ripped off in the first film.<br/><br/>Trouble is if Terry didn't intimidate them the first time, why would they really get worried this time around? Ah, but that's thinking too much about this fluffy, airy film that simply tries to float on occasionally amusing riffs and star power. And why not? Consider the stars. Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Elliott Gould, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Vincent Cassel.<br/><br/>The last two are new this time. Zeta-Jones shows up as Isabel, a Euro cop and former lover of Pitt's character. And Cassel gets thrown in to the mix as French master burglar François Tourlour, who challenges Danny to a contest to see who the better thief is. Yes, that's actually a subplot in this film; one of a few superfluous subplots, including one about Isabel's father.<br/><br/>One wonders why Isabel is in this movie at all. Talk about adding a character simply so it can be played by a movie star. Too bad, the star happens to be untalented. Sorry, pretty she might be. But Zeta-Jones quite possibly is the most over-rated actress working today. Sure, she may have won an Oscar for ""Chicago,"" but clearly any of the other nominees - Julianne Moore, Meryl Streep, Queen Latifah or Kathy Bates - actually deserved it that year.<br/><br/>Zeta-Jones couldn't generate sparks with rocks if she rubbed them ceaselessly for hours. What passes for chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Pitt is laughable. She has one expression and she sticks to it.<br/><br/>Since the story's set in Europe, Soderbergh apparently felt the need to give his film a European feel. In fact, the music and camera work gave me the impression Soderbergh was trying to emulate or, at least, pay homage to the films of the French New Wave.<br/><br/>Problem is, Godard, Truffaut, Chabrol and others had no qualms about something bad happening to their protagonists. But ""Ocean's Twelve"" is pure Hollywood flash. And with this kind of star power, do you really wonder whether any of these characters would be sacrificed? With none of them under any real threat and the ending a foregone conclusion, all you're left is with actors trying to look and sound cool and charming. But George Nolfi's script - initially written for John Woo and then reworked for this sequel - thinks it's smart, when it isn't.<br/><br/>Occasionally, the film wins a chuckle. But there's nothing genuinely exciting or even vaguely suspenseful about this story. In Soderbergh's breezy, but fun, ""Ocean's Eleven,"" the dialogue crackled, characters made us laugh and the story had some grit. Not even the bumbling Malloy brothers can save the sequel. We can only hope that Danny Ocean and his crew will not find the need for another outing."

","In my 22 years of life, I have never fallen asleep in a movie theatre, until today. I loved Ocean's Eleven, but this movie failed at every point where the previous Ocean film was successful. It was extremely boring. It was one of those movies where a lot of stuff is happening, so you have to pay attention, but the film is so boring, it is nearly impossible to pay attention to the film. One thing this film asks you to do is pretend that the characters you are watching, are not quite the same as the characters in Oceans Eleven. First off, when Benedict comes after them demanding his money, all the characters flip out, like they are completely scared to death of Benedict, but in the first film, they behaved as though they had no fear of him. It is little inconsistincies like this tha make this film a ""wait for video"" kind of movie. I was highly disappointed. It you want to watch a new fun sequel, go see Blade Trinity. 4/10"
"mysteryegg","8","4","6","7 March 2006"," Witty Sequel Stands Alone as Intelligent Comedy; not a Traditional Heist
","Ocean's Twelve faces the same difficulties as any sequel. By this I don't mean those movies that are essential components to trilogies that continue the story; I mean those movies that basically take an established cast and throw them in a completely new storyline. The problem is trying to meet the expectations of an audience that loved the first and wants a new movie to love for all the same reasons. So many people were disappointed to learn that Ocean's Twelve was not yet another heist movie.<br/><br/>This film had to be a sequel. The plot takes advantage of the relationships the characters developed in the first film, and throws in many MANY subtle jokes the average viewer may miss if they don't listen closely. Some of the phrases like ""thief a la mode"" used in the film may require a bit of culture to appreciate.<br/><br/>Be warned that while Ocean's team do work together in the same fashion as the first film, the thievery itself doesn't take the spotlight in the film. Ocean's Eleven was the traditional heist film in its plot development with its climax at the point of executing the plan. Ocean's Twelve breaks away from this formula in favor of developing opportunities for some great character interaction.<br/><br/>The film disappoints with many characters taking a back seat in their roles to such an extent that the film could have been named after Pitt's character, with the Benedict aftermath merely serving as a catalyst for the characters finding their way back together. However, it would have been unreasonable for all eleven original characters to share an equal share of the spotlight and still turn out as well.<br/><br/>In the end, Ocean's Twelve is not a mere heist film but an Intelligent Comedy that may need to be watched more than once to appreciate some of the subtleties in the dialog. Just the amount of activity on this film's message board regarding some of the subtleties in the plot is a testament to the thought that went into making this film."

It's very cool.<br/><br/>The movie also had some funny parts, like where one man speaks only in metaphors that mean something entirely different and have nothing to do with the topic and one of the characters has no idea what he's saying and decides to say the lyrics to Kashmir by Led Zeppelin, which definitely insulted the other man.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was very enjoyable, and is the movie you can watch over and over again."

Hey,after all,it's not a documentary; if you want realistic, watch the news. There were several subplots going on and which must be where some people get lost, but I didn't think it was hard to follow. I thought it was unpredictable, I could not guess what was going to happen next most of the time, which kept it interesting. There were a few loose ends left at the end, some of the subplots were never really resolved, but nothing that really bugged me.

","That pretty much explains all the bad reviews it gets: these are all written by 14 year olds who sit in their basements all day long online. This movie is a classic, and though it could be argued that it doesn't match up to Ocean's Eleven, you could retort just as easily that Ocean's Eleven is decades-old classic and Ocean's Twelve was written recently.<br/><br/>This film is clean: no gore, cussing, sexuality/nudity, or drug use. It does have plenty of characters though, and these serve to spice the plot up all the way to the end.<br/><br/>The plot is brilliant, and everything that happens, does so for a reason. Those who complain about plot holes need to realize that J.R.R. Tolkien, the greatest author of the 20th century, did not write without plot holes. I find it strange that these people will criticize a storyline that they could never write the equal of AND the acting that they could never pull off, while still complaining that the movie was too slow-paced and was boring. Perhaps they'd prefer the Star Wars prequels. Oh wait, they complained about those as well, for just the opposite! It appears that there is no pleasing them! With that in mind, ignore the critics, and recognize a masterpiece when you see it.<br/><br/>The subtle humor and classic characters in this are just brilliant. Daniel Ocean and ""Rusty"" Ryan, played by George Clooney and Brad Pitt, both good-looking and talented actors, are just complete geniuses. The conversations they have maintain the hilarity of the the predecessor film, and they are just a joy to watch. Also with new characters such as a detective played by Catherine Zeta-Jones and a mysterious rival thief known as the Nightfox, this movie is every bit as brilliant as the first.<br/><br/>Indulge yourself. Watch this movie in theaters, making sure to have plenty of delicious popcorn and refreshing Coca-Cola, and then rent it once it comes out, and then by the DVD for good measure. You won't regret it."

It's ending screams of an upcoming trequel and I will be one of the millions who flock to see 120 minutes of George and Brad and Matt parlay through Clooney's digs in Lago di Como as they swindle some rich bad guy again and again.

","Soderbergh springs a surprise. It's not a pleasant one. 'Ocean's 12' has an awful screenplay and the director seems clueless at times. Seriously, to even think that Soderbergh was behind this is still a little difficult to digest. The film has some cool gizmos and gadgets, none of which manage to sustain our attention for long. There are some very nice shots of Europe and the soundtrack is quite awesome. It actually drags a lot in the beginning until Catherine Zeta-Jones appears in the fake Interpol (which was actually shot in the City Hall of the Hague). Perhaps it's the glamour portion of Ms. Zeta-Jones that grabs the attention and she does reasonably well until her character is messed up towards the end. Sadly, she and Pitt do not have chemistry. Actually, all the actors from 'Ocean's 11' are terribly wasted in this one. Clooney looks uninterested and lost. Pitt looks as though he could care less. Damon tries to bring some comic relief but fails (what could he have done anyway, if his co-stars were so uninterested?). Cheadle is given nothing but a few lines and the rest are all relegated to the background for the most part. However, I thought Vincent Cassel performed the best. His amazing Capoeira demonstration is in my opinion the best thing to come out of the film. As I myself have practiced capoeira for a while, I was impressed by Cassel's skill. Julia Roberts is whining in the beginning but she the Julia Roberts playing Tess playing Julia Roberts sequence is ridiculously funny. It made me chuckle and made the film worse. Thus, in spite of all the hi-tech, 'Ocean's 12' is quite a wasted effort. the film lacks a heart."

The soundtrack is astounding and a great asset to the film; all the Old Italian music and the new David Holms is great. The cinematography by Chris Connier and Soderbergh is innovative and amazing, and as always it has the classic Soderbergh editing style. The plot is great.

"bob the moo","Null","5","9","13 February 2005"," Reasonably entertaining but the messy plot and lack of cohesion really suck the fizz out of it  even if the stars appear to be really enjoying it
","Several years on from their job in Las Vegas and Danny Ocean's crew have been sold out to Terry Benedict, who has visited each of them to give them two weeks to pay back the money they stole, with interest. Too hot to work in America, the crew head to Europe to pull off a series of jobs to earn the money but find themselves outsmarted by another ""master"" thief who is willing to pay off their debt if Ocean will indulge him in a challenge to see who is the best thief. So, with Benedict and Interpol Detective Isabel Lahiri breathing down their necks, the crew come together to pull off the job.<br/><br/>With the remake of Ocean's Eleven, things seemed to move so quickly with such flair and style that substance didn't matter that much and it managed to pull off the trick and come across as fluffy fun. The sequel clearly tries to pull off the same trick but it cannot manage it and, although it has some fun moments, it ends up being pretty messy, lacking slick pace and failing to really please the audience in the way that its predecessor did. The plot feels like it has been forced and it cannot cope with the messy detail nor move fast enough to distract us from it; whole sections make little sense and, when the final twist comes you will struggle not to feel betrayed by how you have spent the hour before. Instead of a nice narrative flow the film is more like a series of set pieces  few of these really work that well and some of them fall quite flat. Even when they worked I couldn't shake the feeling that the cast were enjoying it more than us; certainly this appeared to be the case with the whole ""look-a-likey"" collection of in-jokes and several of the other scenes.<br/><br/>The cast are enjoying themselves but that doesn't mean that the film uses them well at all. Clooney and Pitt are good because they have plenty of screen time and ooze cool for the majority of the film. Damon cuts his way into the screen time with a nice line of joking about ""coming up"" but Roberts and Jones are really pushed to the edges of the film even if they do have some things to contribute. Affleck, Caan, Garcia, Qin, Mac, Cheadle, Reiner, Gould and Coltrane are all pretty wasted and are often just pushed out of the story for the sake of convenience (Mac and Qin are two very good examples). Willis is actually quite amusing, Cassel is not that bad and Izzard is pretty good in a minor role.<br/><br/>Overall though the film is never better than average; reasonably entertaining at best. The plot is all over the place and cannot even distract the audience enough so that the holes are hidden until the end; as it is the second half of the film is a shambles and I couldn't help but be annoyed by it  hell, it doesn't even have the gloss, shine and flair of the first film. The cast appear to have enjoyed themselves but many of them have next to nothing to do and it all just feels a bit too cluttered for most of the time. The first vehicle was fun and slick; this one tries to keep up but stalls way too many times."
"jackcade","8","8","17","25 January 2005"," Pleasantly surprised at the inventiveness of Ocean's Twelve
","As a great fan of the original Rat Pack fan, I didn't bother watching the remake of Ocean's Eleven until it appeared on a dreary night on pay TV. What an incredibly boring, dull, cold, sterile, lifeless, worthless film. It should never have been made and I kicked myself for wasting my time. The blandness of all the lead actors compared starkly in mind to the great personalities of the 1960 minor classic.<br/><br/>It was with reluctance I traipsed in the rain (with my friend Alita) to see Ocean's Twelve on the big screen at the fabulous Delta Cinema in the main street of Ayr, North Queensland. (One of the world's great cinemas, well worth a visit).<br/><br/>However, I was pleasantly surprised that Soderbergh took a completely different approach to his earlier clanger. Ocean's Twelve had humour, wit and warmth that was completely lacking in his first effort.<br/><br/>The same pretty ordinary cast (give me the Rat Pack any day) made an effort to put some spark into their performances. The Julia Roberts sequence was hysterically funny - almost slapstick - without taking away from the texture of the film. I admit The low-key acting of Damon, Willis et al worked well in this particular sequence.<br/><br/>Best of all Soderberg was much more inventive in his cinematic storytelling. I have only seen a couple of his pictures, so I am no expert on his work. But it occurred to me that with Ocean's Twelve, he may well have been influenced by the inventiveness of Richard Lester. Possibly no surprise since Soderbergh's revealing and entertaining interview with Lester is a classic of film literature. The playful use of titles and imaginative camera angles and shots gave the sequel the pizazz good caper film needs.<br/><br/>And as for those twists - well, it added to the fun.<br/><br/>I was so pleased that the director took a different tack. For days afterward the one-liners, the ""Amsterdam"" title and the zoom shots of the prisoners being released were still playing over in my head.<br/><br/>Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven was like watching paint dry, only not as entertaining.<br/><br/>Ocean's Twelve is film-making.

That's not to say that the remake of 'Ocean's Eleven's new chapter to a shaky franchise is the case but it is certainly a tricky maneuver much like a sucker has to deal with in a fixed game of three card monty.<br/><br/>The Ocean Eleven is back - just like the film's tag-line 'Twelve Is the New Eleven' in that this incarnation the odds are even more against the rag-tag cool cadre of thieves when they are reluctantly re-assembled after their last mark, silky sinister Vegas casino hot-shot Terry Benedict (sadly underused Garcia) is chomping at the bit for his nemesis Danny Ocean (Clooney practically attempting to pass somnambulism as waycool fortitude in a phone-in charm curdled turn) to repay him the $160 M bust (plus interest) his posse pilfered three years ago. With a window of two weeks the gang are back together for one final job in Europe.<br/><br/>Returning are retro cool Rusty Ryan (Pitt), eager to be his own criminal Linus Caldwell (Damon), bloke safecracker Basher Tarr (Cheadle), street smart Frank Catton (Mac), knuckle-head Malloy brothers Turk and Virgil (Caan and Affleck, respectively), seasoned pros Reuben Tishkoff and Saul Bloom (Gould and Reiner, respectively ), techie geek Livingston Dell (Jamieson) and Chinese acrobat 'greaseman' Yen (Qin)  who more or less have gone to less-distinguished yet 'legit' lives since their big score.<br/><br/>Also on hand is long-suffering Tess (Roberts), now Danny's re-married wife who pines for domestic niceties and police detective Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones)  ex-gal pal of Rusty  who is hot on the trail of her boyfriend.<br/><br/>This over-thought and undercooked crime spree is convoluted and a tad too sure of itself even as it asks the ridiculous notion of the group to simply screw things up and let the domino effect fall where it may is what is truly at fault in George Nolfi's screenplay and the addition of master thief Eurotrash Francois Toulor Cassel) to gum up the works slams the brakes on the trip to Coolsville the film so arduously attempts to rekindle the far superior remake it subsists off like some cinematic vulture on carrion.<br/><br/>What is to like are the sprinkles of humorous dialogue between the chemistry, baby, chemistry of this unlikely gathering of men on the take for the easy life with no strings attached and the bonhomie, although stilted since many of the ensemble is stretched out like so many potholes, retains a few moments of relaxed anxiety.<br/><br/>What I truly tired of was the addition of Mr. Willis' unwelcome 'cameo' that is the definition of star-tripping smugness that clearly grinds things to a halt by the film's troubled third act ; 'nuff said.<br/><br/>Soderbergh's camera is all knowing angles and scattershot editing is his trademark and at least attempts to keep the plottings such as they are lively. Nice try but sadly a bilked one at that."

","Oceans Twelve is another good caper film but with some flaws. It's not as good as the first one but the movie isn't that bad either. The all star ensemble cast makes it worth seeing though including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, the late Bernie Mac and Julia Roberts are still great in their roles not matter how big or small their part is in the movie. Also returning from the original are Carl Reiner, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Eddie Jamison, and Elliot Gould. Catherine Zeta Jones joins the cast along with Vincent Cassel, Robbie Coltrane, and Eddie Izzard are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. Like the original it's best not to know too much about this one because there's some surprises in store for anyone who watches it. I wasn't as impressed with this one as I was with the other one but Ocean's Twelve is still worth seeing at least once. The film still seemed to be juggling too many characters and the pacing was slow at times again but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Overall despite it's flaws Ocean's Twelve still has an intricate plot, humor, drama, surprises, and exceptional performances by the whole cast but this sequel could've been a little better."
"coop37","9","4","7","22 December 2004"," So you want an intricate plot?
","Film certainly can be a narrative medium, but by no means is it the ideal medium. Literature best carries a plot, because the reader can supply the imagination necessary to complete the structure. Film is appreciated best when viewed for what it is: a series of images grouped together. What Soderbergh does in Ocean's Twelve is combine impeccable film-making technique with the free-flowing form of American movies from the 1970s. From looking at the comments posted recently, most people went in expecting a standard-issue heist movie, a la Entrapment; it seems people actually miss the tiresome clichés of romance disguised as tension between the leads and ridiculous plot twists designed to keep the audience awake. Soderbergh's directing prowess is reason alone to see this movie, but close-ups of Pitt and Zeta-Jones forty feet high on the screen don't hurt either. A true treat for those who love the flickering of lights on the silver screen, and a disappointment for those trying to make film something it's not."

","This is a very good sequel. The cast is terrific. Steven Soderbergh gives a solid job. The script has the same power of ""Ocean's Eleven"". All the film is right and predictable. And i like it. We can see the best Julia Roberts since ""Erin Brockovich"". Brad Pitt takes the pole position in the starring. And George is... George, of course. Vincent Cassel has a dangerous role with some french tics. Stephen Mirrione makes another impressive editing and the photo is the best of the picture. Obviously the story is very unbelievable but i don't want a true story. I like to comment about Catherine Zeta Jones. She is beautiful in this film and she leads all hers scenes.

","This movie was BAD! I gave it a 2 b/c only tripe like ""Independence Day"" gets a 1 in my book. But this had very little to do w/ the original, except the cast (not a big surprise, though - not many sequels do follow the same story). Anyway, here's a stream-of-consciousness list of complaints: Bernie Mac completely marginalized and under-utilized; ditto Andy Garcia and Albert Finney; the tension between the two Mormon (?) brothers is not explained AT ALL & therefor completely unbelievable; the 'plot-line,' if you can call it that, is completely unbelievable - not once during the film did I find myself 'on-board,' or following along with the story; there cutting back to the robberies were trite, forced and not plausible. <br/><br/>Two redeeming parts are the jobs put in by the actor playing the Night Fox & the woman playing Brad Pitt's mom.<br/><br/>[Some of my details may not be 'on the mark,' but that's because this movie was so bad I don't care to do the research. I want my money back & since I can't get it back, I simply want to warn as many people as possible to AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS. If you're thinking of seeing this movie, just get a lighter and burn your money instead, you'd be getting more entertainment value from the fire (and warmth!!) than you would from seeing this movie.]"

","Well, I saw the movie about four hours ago in a special sneak preview in Tempe, AZ. The movie was.. well.. different. The first movie contained something that's been locked in a room in the Department of Mysteries in the Ministry of Magic. It's a force that Voldemart hates and which Harry Potter possesses in abundance. It is the force of ""COOL"". Ocean's Eleven dripped with this force, and was the best heist movie I ever saw. Don't expect that from this movie. <br/><br/>You remember how in the 'Eleven' there was also the humor factor involved with the 'oomph'. Well, that's the other force 'Twelve' contains. This movie contains stories of different humans, involved in a situation. Yes, Benedict is on their case. He wants his money back. They have 2 weeks to get it back. You'll have drama. Excitement. Lots more 'Cool'. More thieves. More Cops. More relationships ( Clooney-Roberts, Pitt-Zeta Jones parallel), 'human' situations (which I like), of course some heisting and lots more fun.<br/><br/>I give it 9/10.

No, it doesn't.<br/><br/>The story picks up some time after the first and focuses on the 11 trying to gather up money to repay their old nemesis Terry Benedict, who's still angry at them for robbing his casinos.<br/><br/>While working in Europe, they encounter a fellow thief who wants to compete in a heist, stating that if Ocean and his team out smart him and beat him in an almost impossible heist, he would pay off their debt.<br/><br/>I found the story to be intriguing enough and it held my interest. I enjoyed the fact that the entire cast of the first returned in this one. It seemed weird that it focused on some of the characters much less this time around, but it also focused on others more, such as Linus and the Malloy brothers which I'll admit I did enjoy.<br/><br/>If you liked the first one with George Cloony and the gang, I highly suggest this one.

"tieman64","Null","3","5","20 February 2012"," Soderbergh does Mamet
","The ""Ocean's 11"" franchise started in 1960 with Lewis Milestone's ""Ocean's 11"", a glossy heist thriller which saw a gang of thieves pulling a daring operation in which several Las Vegas casinos are simultaneously robbed. Milestone was a bit of an auteur, known for several fairly good war films, but his ""Ocean's 11"" remains an anonymously directed affair. Instead, crooner and mega-star Frank Sinatra seems to be the one pulling all the strings, playing the titular role of heist-master Danny Ocean within the film, and the star and money-man calling the shots outside the film. The production was reportedly wrapped around Sinatra's lengthy stays in Las Vegas, where he performed various concerts at up-scale casinos, hotels and theatres.<br/><br/>While Milestone's ""Ocean's 11"" made ridiculous amounts of money back in 1960 – everyone wanted to see its big name cast: Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford and Angie Dickinson – today it's a hugely dull movie, with large chunks of exposition, unnecessary filler and a heist that's been bettered by countless heist films released both before and after. With notions as to what is and isn't ""cool"" constantly changing, ""Ocean's 11"" also looks completely neutered, its ""smooth"", ""relaxed"" and ""cool"" cast now positively lifeless. Half a century later, only Sinatra comes off looking well, though precisely because of him the film plays like one of those bad crime movies by modern African American rappers, designed to show off the star's ""riches"", ""bling"", ""money"", ""rule breaking"", ""flashy accessories"" and ""bad boy criminality"" (Sinatra had close ties with the criminal underworld – both the Italian mafia and US government). It's a white bread version of such mega-celebrity egotism. Milestone's best scenes? A colourful Saul Bass opening and a wordless ending shot, much imitated by Tarantino, in which our suited gang of heroes walk down a pavement. Everything between these scenes can be missed.<br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh would release a remake of ""Ocean's 11"" in 2001. It's a much better film, featuring a cast of photogenic mega stars (Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould etc), smooth operators, bad boys and likable character actors. ""I owe you for the thing with the guy in the place,"" is the line which gets the plot rolling, a slice of dialogue which epitomises the film's comically nonchalant attitude. If Milestone's film strove to be cool, Soderbergh goes for a kind of meta-cool, our cast both too cool for cool and playing uncool with coolness, mega stars Brad Pitt always chomping down on food, Matt Damon bumbling with style and George Clooney perpetually basking in his own silly magnificence. As the heist movie is intrinsically formulaic – first act: assemble the ""samurai"", second act: plan the heist, third act: escape or get captured – Soderbergh indulges in a kind of postmodern devil-may-care attitude. Meanwhile, the film's aesthetic is retro cool, with European/French touches, glossy locales, eye popping lights, sparkling surfaces/bulbs, lush cinematography, romantic editing/music, liquidy shapes and a camera that salivates over its suave actors, smooth villains and expensive locales. It's all about the money.<br/><br/>Soderbergh describes his ""Ocean's 11"" as a ""big wind up toy"", and while its designed to be ""just entertainment"", it does fit in with a number of the director's ""heavier"" films (""King of the Hill"", ""Che"", ""Traffic"", ""Eric Brockovich"", ""The Girlfriend Experience""), which have focused on economic inequality, economic depressions, Marxist revolutionaries and violent corporate muscle. Indeed, the casinos where Soderbergh's heists take place, the Bellagio and several other mega-casinos on the LA Strip, were built in the 1990s by entrepreneurs and corporate raiders like Steve Wynn (the real life model of Benedict, the film's villain, played sexily by Andy Garcia) with junk bonds and help from organised crime lords. With its art galleries and upscale restaurants, the Bellagio was then part of a diversification strategy in LA to earn profits from non-gaming sources. Yet the appeal of all these amenities, like gambling itself, is fuelled by a drive to offer consumers escape from a reality of diminished opportunities for upward mobility (within an American economy of diminishing wages, outsourcing and continuous lay-offs). Within a postindustrial, globalized economy, gambling, and even crime, increasingly appears to offer the best way, in the words of Jackson Lears, ""to get ahead in a world where work no longer seems reliable"". Indeed, each of the film's robbers comes with some indication that they embody the disaffection created by the increasing division of American society into ""haves"" and ""have nots"", whether it be a criminal past, lack of work, or entrapment in a job they find to be unrewarding. Even the bank-roller behind the heist, a former casino owner named Reuben Tishkoff (smoothly played by Elliout Gould), wants revenge against a new economy in which corporate moguls like Benedict can use their financial muscle to push him out. On the flip side, such readings are contradicted by the film's need to work as a big budget wish-fulfilment fantasy, and the fact that the crime genre has always portrayed the criminal as Soderbergh does here: cinema's lovable criminals may live on the outside, but they're still perfect conformists, chasing money in their own way because of capitalism's failings.<br/><br/>Soderbergh would release a sequel, ""Oceans 12"", some years later. This one takes the form of a ""con movie"", its narrative bending giddily in all directions, mercilessly toying with both convention and audience expectations. The film wasn't well received, despite being as good as its predecessor, which led to Soderbergh releasing the dull, and far safer, ""Oceans 13"" in 2007. The villain's name is literally ""Bank"" (Al Pacino) in this outing, but the film is mostly dumb.<br/><br/>8.5/10 – Some overlooked modern heist films: Mamet's ""Heist"" and Neil Jordan's ""The Good Thief"", a remake of Melville's genre defining ""Bob The Gambler""."

","I heard that after the first Oceans movie, the sequels begin to go downhill. I believe that this is not the case(at least not for this film). This movie is even better than the first film! The original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed Terry Benedict's casinos. Now, Benedict is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks. To do that, they must do a couple heists in Europe to get the money.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. The all-star cast exceeded expectations. Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Catherine Zeta-Jones were probably the best in this film.<br/><br/>There are some confusing moments in this film. But that does not matter because there are only a few confusing moments. Anyway, this movie is only made for harmless fun.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great heist movie. I rate this movie 9/10."
"redbud211","10","4","8","13 December 2004"," Worth seeing
","While perhaps not quite as perfect as Ocean's 11, this movie is definitely worth seeing - especially for fans of Ocean's 11.<br/><br/>I personally feel you almost HAVE to have seen the first movie to get total enjoyment out of this one -- they don't really spend much time in character development, because it is somewhat assumed you already know all the characters and relationships from the first movie.<br/><br/>There are several parts of the movie that are stuck in there almost entirely just for the humor affect, but they are worth it. It will have you rolling in laughter more than once.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with it was the periods of cinematography where, in order to show chaos, they would quickly pan person to person close-up in random manner (I see this in many movies these days) in order to give the feeling of confusion and disorder. These types of scenes on the big screen leave me feeling motion-sick, but thankfully they are short-lived.<br/><br/>The part where the character Tess is pulled into the con is priceless for its laughs.<br/><br/>Overall, a good, entertaining flick. Don't try to make too much out of it, or expect every part of it to make perfect sense to you. Just go with it and enjoy it."
"gregsrants","4","4","8","12 December 2004"," No meat with the potatoes
","I could just see the studio execs sitting around their cozy meeting room, drinking their triple mocha cappuccino's and reacting to the producers' pitch. <br/><br/>I imagine the producer saying, 'I have an idea for a movie that will have George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Carl Reiner, Bernie Mac, Don Chedale, Andy Garcia and Elliot Gould together again. And this time I even got Catherine Zeta-Jones to join the cast. Oh yeah, Steven Sodebergh will direct and I have even convinced Bruce Willis and Topher Grace to do cameos..And did I mention that this is a sequel to the $450 million worldwide grossing Ocean's 11 and that the stars are willing to negotiate back end deals in order to keep the budget the same as the first film?'<br/><br/>I imagine there would be a pause. Not a pause to consider whether or not to greenlight the project, but a pause so that they could picture themselves naked in a mountain of money or maybe a pause just long enough to let the adrenaline run through their bodies and the goosebumps and hairs on the back of their necks a chance to return to their normal state. <br/><br/>Well, whatever the conversation, the boys are back (sorry Julia and Catherine) again in Ocean's Twelve which is also a follow-up to the remake of the 1960 movie staring Rat Packers Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. <br/><br/>Ocean's Twelve picks up a few years after the original ended. If you recall, in their first crack at collective crime, the group elaborately emptied the Bellagio, The Mirage and the MGM Grand casinos' vault in Las Vegas of about $150 million. Well, for some reason, that just didn't sit well with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who not only lost the casino's money a job for which he was responsible - but also his girlfriend Tess (Julia Roberts) to the mastermind behind the group, Danny Ocean (George Clooney). Thanks to an anonymous tip (that really makes no sense when revealed) , Benedict has been given the location of all eleven thieves responsible for the original heist. Benedict seems to be holding a vindictive grudge that is rather hard to understand, really. The insurance covered the losses, and Benedict never even lost his job as a result of the debacle. But for some reason, he is willing to put his life on hold until a personal vendetta is resolved. <br/><br/>After tracking down each character individually (and did we really need to see the bit characters being visited one by one by Benedict and his entourage of men without necks?) Benedict reveals that they have two weeks to return to him the money they stole plus interest. Just one problem. It has been a few years since the heist and everyone has bit into their nest egg leaving them over $90 million short. So, they put their collective minds together and decide to do what they do best, steal. <br/><br/>This is where the movie should have gone into overdrive, but instead it gets muttered in its own stylish format. They first decide to steal a trade ticket worth about $2.5 million (which would only leave them with 99% of the total still to be recovered). Of course, it's again an elaborate plan consisting of an idea that is so ridiculously improbable that if not for the confusion I felt trying to understand the hows and whys of the plan, I undoubtedly would have chuckled out loud in my theatre seat.<br/><br/>But this was only an audience diversion to introduce us to The Night Fox who is a competing thief looking to wear the heavyweight belt as undisputed crook of the millennium. The Night Fox is able to get a message to Danny Ocean and after a brief meeting, agrees to pay the marker owed to Benedict if Ocean and his puppy dog posse can steal a jewel studded egg before him. Ahhh, is there no honor amongst thieves?<br/><br/>So with the plot now spelled out like a spoonful of Alpha-Bits, all that is left is the star power banter, a twist or two to keep us interested and enough screen time for each cast member to keep us at arms length from any kind of character development whatsoever. In fact, never have so many A-list stars wasted so much opportunity by trying to be cool or volleying the ball to the next A-list star, none of which seem capable of spiking.<br/><br/>Not all was a bust mind you. Catherine Zeta-Jones was an interesting character although very underdeveloped and lacking any clear motivation for her actions. And Julia Roberts has the only memorable scene in the film when she pretends to be a particular diva in a hotel that is so tongue-in-cheek I felt like I was coming down with the measles. <br/><br/>Director Steven Soderbergh is a good director, but I can't help think that he is overrated and it is his relationships with the stars that has kept him on the hot list rather than his filmography. Since Erin Brokovich in 2000, he has had under performer after under performer including Solaris and Full Frontal. But still, Julia Roberts and George Clooney seem to praise him on every talk show or awards dinner spewed out of Hollywood, California. In hindsight, I can see why actors must like him so much and that is because he doesn't seem to be that demanding or envelope pushing. Ocean's Twelve is the perfect example of keeping a bunch of stars happy and somewhat occupied without putting any meat beside my potatoes. Instead of trying to dwell on one or two characters and develop a sub-plot or storyline of any interest, he decides instead to allow each of the actors to leave their back room poker games to eat up screen time that is shot with an independent sense, even if no common sense follows.<br/><br/>Anyone who watches television will see anyone of the stars either separately talking to someone behind a desk or collectively as a promotional vehicle for the film, talk about how much fun they all had together during the shoot. The practical jokes, the European experience and even staying at George Clooney's villa where poker games were a daily ritual. It's just too bad that none of this same fun could have been transformed on screen for the benefit of the audience that, in my screening, seemed bored to a point where illuminated watch faces glowed like firefly's as uninterested patrons were collectively counting down the films running time. <br/><br/>With all the star power and the international appeal, Ocean's Twelve will no doubt make poop-loads of money and it won't be long before Ocean's Fourteen (Thirteen is bad luck) will be drafted and in front of the ensemble for review and schedule juggling. I just hope next time, Soderbergh decides to sit that one out and only produce while a script provides us with more than cute dimples and starring glances for two hours.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"

","The heist film lives on every time a slick gang of bad boys and girls gathers to take something that doesn't belong to them, and we go along because these crooks are 'cool.' Three years ago in the very watchable Heist, Gene Hackman was a rough but competent jewel thief aided by the usual gang of helpers conning nasty fence Danny DeVito of his ill-gotten gains. That was then and the literate David Mamet (Spartan) was director. Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven came out that same year, a smooth caper film with hip actors such as George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon stealing a cool $150 million from casino owner Andy Garcia. Heist was a better character study; Ocean's Eleven was more fun.<br/><br/>Ocean's Twelve brings back the same relaxed thieves plus Catherine Zeta-Jones in a more complicated project, three European robberies culminating in stealing a Faberge egg to assuage the vengeful anger of Andy Garcia's casino owner. Europe, especially the wide-open and beautiful Amsterdam, looks as inviting as ever, though Chris Connier's cinematography (Angela's Ashes) is nothing to write home about. The actors seem jet-lagged and the plot weary from trying to be ingenious and new while it is really tired and old.<br/><br/>More intriguing than the de rigueur fashion clothes for this series is the addition of Vincent Cassel (Birthday Girl) as Francois Toulour, the superior thief arguably better than Danny Ocean but still not as good as the world's best, LeMarc (Albert Finney). Cassel's savoir-faire and dance among the museum's laser beams are welcome relief from the clichés of Clooney and gang. <br/><br/>But continuing to enjoy even the most modest of heist films such as Ocean's Twelve, I come out of the theater with a smile although my admission dollars were stolen. As Shakespeare said in Othello, 'The robb'd that smiles, steals something from the thief.'<br/><br/>I want to go back to Amsterdam but not with tired thieves.

","I know that's pretty blunt, but those were my feelings right after watching it. It's not bad per se, and it definitely has some of the great elements of 'Ocean's Eleven' - mainly the characters and performances. But what mainly lets it down is how overly tangled and messy the plot is. Firstly, for a movie that's posited as a 'heist' film, there's very little actual heisting that's going on on-screen. You only get to see some snippets of a few heists, and in the van der Woude house heist, a lot of the actual heist is just 'sped up'. Secondly, you have the romance subplot between Rusty and the Europol agent, which I found to be quite dull AND it takes up quite a significant amount of screen time. But before I rag on this film too much, there were some things I really liked about it. Like how in one scene, where the 'gang' are discussing the best approach to the van der Woude heist, they talk over each other in a convincing manner - instead of feeling like it's just actors waiting for each other to say a line, it actually sounds like a discussion between real people.<br/><br/>But back to what wasn't great about the movie. Much like the first, the editing was bizarre but, to its credit, less so than 'Ocean's Eleven'. The cinematography was really poor in some scenes, looking like an episode of a really low-budget documentary or children's television show. And finally, the soundtrack wasn't nearly as memorable as the first. In general, while it does some things well, it's just too convoluted for its own good and is simply a lesser film than it's predecessor.<br/><br/>Overall: 6/10, maybe high 5 or low-mid 6."

It took a couple years of fan forums and reddit pages to build such an exaggerated hatred of the Star Wars prequels, which began ironically and evolved into actual hatred. The same can be said, I think for Oceans 12. Of course it wasn't as good as 11 and no one expected it to be. Part of the reason 11 is so good is that all the styles and motifs, even the screenwriting, was brand new to everyone. Newness plays a huge factor in how large a place 11 holds in our hearts. If 11 had never been made and 12 were a standalone movie (assuming the backstory was explained and all), I guarantee all these people giving 1 star reviews would be giving 8s or 9s. Oceans 12 is a great movie. It's only slightly less great than 11 and 13. And all these people spewing nonsense like ""it insulted my intelligence"", first of all, get over yourselves, and secondly, you weren't as shocked or impressed with the twists and turns because you had already seen Oceans 11 and were specifically looking for them and trying to figure them out! Again, if Oceans 12 was a stand-alone movie, you all would have loved it. You're all just lemmings following the afactual and wrongly reasoned opinion of the zeitgeist."

"Tweekums","6","2","3","26 November 2017"," A rather messy sequel
","A few years have passed since Danny Ocean's band of thieves robbed Terry Benedict's casino in Las Vegas, now he has tracked them all down and he wants his money back with interest. Obviously most of the money has been spent; if they are to avoid being killed they will have to steal more within a fortnight. Since they are too well known in the United States they head to Europe and set about planning a job which has been given them by a contact. Their do the job but find somebody has got there before them and left a message. Danny immediately realises that this thief is the person responsible for telling Benedict where everybody was. The other thief is 'The Night Fox', a French master thief who sees himself as Number One. Danny meets him and they make a bet; each will try to steal a Faberge egg that is due to be exhibited in Rome; if Danny's gang gets it the Night Fox will pay their debts; if they lose Danny will acknowledge that The Night Fox is the better thief and Benedict will have his revenge! If that wasn't enough Europol agent Detective Isabel Lahiri, who had previously dated Danny's partner Rusty is hunting the gang and the Night Fox.<br/><br/>The previous film was a fun caper movie; with a bunch of thieves working together to rob a single 'impossible' target this sequel has plenty of fun moments but it is too messy. Here we have two robberies, a rival thief determined to beat them, a cop who one of the team dated and the knowledge that if they fail Benedict will have them killed. There are some good jokes and at one point is gets very Meta as Danny's wife Tess, played by Julia Roberts, tries to pass herself off as Julia Roberts and meets Bruce Willis who is playing himself! While there is an obvious threat and at times it looks as if everything has gone wrong for the gang I don't imagine many viewers will think things won't work out for them in the end. The cast, which is almost entirely well known, do a solid job and are clearly having fun. Overall this is hardly a must see but it isn't terrible and is a pleasant enough way to pass a couple of hours."
"zkonedog","6","2","3","8 March 2017"," Still Manages To Keep You Guessing
","One of the reasons that the first ""Ocean's"" movie was such a success was that it was full of ""Vegas Style"" that really gave it an edge. While this second effort lacks that suave style, it still manages to be exciting and keeps you guessing until the very end.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Ocean's 12"" begins with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) wanting his money back. In order to come up with those kind of funds, the now-infamous thieving gang led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and Rusty (Brad Pitt) must take their act overseas and face off against a formidable foe in the burglary business. This time, however, Ocean's wife (played by Julia Roberts) has a bigger role in the proceedings.<br/><br/>The reason this film manages to still hold up under the huge success of its predecessors is two- fold:<br/><br/>1. The interplay between the characters is still excellent and quite funny. It must have been a hoot to film this one, as it sure seems as if all the main players had a great time with each other.<br/><br/>2. The plot continues to move forward and never gets predictable or stale. It might not quite have the ""flash"" of the first one, but it still is entertaining (especially as it gears up for the climax).<br/><br/>Overall, ""Ocean's 12"" is a solid (if less spectacular) follow-up to the glitzy original. A 3.5 star ranking would be more accurate, but it is closer to four stars than three."

","When I watched this movie first,I also hated it like all others. But when I saw it second time, it started to make some real sense to me. I really admired it. <br/><br/>It's a fine rendition according to the term sequel.In the first part,they just stole the casino money from Benedict. What would you like to see in the sequel actually? Of course not another famous heist by Ocean gang,because that would've been a cliché. Instead, we would like to see how arrogant Benedict reacts at Ocean gang. And when he got the chance through Night Fox,he reacted even to the surprise of Night Fox. That suited really good for a sequel.<br/><br/>People are complaining about the camera angle and long shots. But it didn't bother me at all. The long shot taken in the Matsui scene perfectly presented Linus's(Matt Damon)helplessness in front of Matsui's code language. He is the same man to play super CIA agent Bourne who looked very confident and desperate in Bourne's trilogy.But here in this shot,his rendition of helpless young ambitious gang member just stated his versatility boldly. The long take in Rusty's room with he and Ocean drinking and watching TV was also great to show off their frustration.<br/><br/>Livingstone was referring to Yen as modern man who is disconnected, frightened and so on in a way that he was mocking the memorizing of literary Q/A for exam. This idea really uplifted the class of the movie much more than Schumann's special did to the building. That was really innovative,experimental and funny.<br/><br/>The movie had great acting support from every cast member,there was great background music as well. I mean,really,how can you hate a movie with such good background music? The finishing was also very good 'twist in the tail' sort.<br/><br/>This movie is a bit different from Hollywood mainstream. It had it's own style which included behavioral,gesture-rich acting with which we weren't quite accustomed to. But that's our problem,I guess,not the director's fault. When I first read T.S.Eliot,I dumped the book loud on the floor. Does that make Eliot rubbish?<br/><br/>Don't try to watch it with previous determination of watching a traditional caper movie,watch it with a free mind. I think you will get the tone of the movie like I did in the second attempt."
"shadowman123","8","2","3","9 July 2007"," Well I liked it !
","The Oceans saga following the exploits of Danny Ocean and the gang is something you will either like love or hate. Yes of course, you have this over hyped nonsense about sooo many stars being in it and it cost this much to make and the hype is spread all over the place. The first movie kept me entertained long enough with its wise cracks and build up to its master heist but to be honest I really did not think it was all that so naturally I was having my doubts about watching Oceans 12 although whilst reading other reviews I was rather surprised to see how much some people really disliked it. So I was taking quite a gamble on watching it but to be honest with it was not all that bad!!! Yes of course it had problems but my advice is just to watch for the sake of entertainment and for the sake of entertainment only and not get to nit-picky over every small little detail. Set 3 years after the events of the first movie we find our band of thieves in hot water again as Terry Benedict has mad as hell and wants to be paid with interest for his loss. So our group reassembles once again to pay Terry and keep their lives this time headed of to Europe , of course things take a turn for the worst as there is a twist involved which does not help them at all with time running out! The layout of the film was great , fans of the BBC show Hustle will understand what I am saying and with funny jokes running all the way through ( I love part where the Chinese acrobat talks in Chinese and the gang say it in English). Geroge Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Bernie Mac not to mention Don Cheadle (aside from his crappy English accent) all done great. But this also Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones (never really took the time to see how sexy she was) and Vincent Cassel (the laser room) rocked. There was also a certain special someone who turns up and kind off adds a surreal feeling to the film which may not sit well with everyone but I thought it was cool. There are problems visible like the movie sets out on a target but never really seems to accomplish it as it gets torn away into a sub-plot ties into the main plot, the Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones love thing was good but just ends out being a little too cheesy and nothing we can connect with on a deep level and there were elements that made it look a little to dame easy. But however to conclude not everybody would agree with this review but if you searching for a good night in with some good food and a glass of wine then pop this into your DVD player, just watch just for the sake of entertainment.<br/><br/>OCEANS 12 - 8.8 OUT OF 10 <br/><br/>TWELVE IS THE NEW ELEVEN!"
"joaocruzferreira","7","2","3","6 July 2007"," Not as entertaining as ""Ocean's Eleven""
","The film starts strong, catching us up with each member of the gang and letting us see what he's done with his cut of the $160 million. There are some good character bits here, and the same sort of loose, smart patter that worked so well in the first film. Savor those moments, because the rest of the film doesn't have enough of them. Once the gang is reunited and working to steal the money they need, the plot mechanics take over and we're subjected to a dizzying series of flashbacks and too many scenes of Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones) a Europol detective who has history with several of the gang and a superhuman deductive ability.<br/><br/>Clooney and Pitt retain the suave chemistry they had in the first film, and, along with Damon, they all display their good-natured ability to send themselves up. The rest of the eleven also reinvest their characters with their unique ticks and quirks, but Garcia spikes Benedict way too over the top. Zeta-Jones adds the requisite glamour and Cassel adds the French accent.<br/><br/>""Ocean's Twelve"" provides some nice scenery in Amsterdam and Lake Como. Not as entertaining as ""Ocean's Eleven"". 7/10"
"wolosek","Null","2","3","28 March 2006"," Did I miss something?
","Did I hear the plot correctly? Yes, the camaraderie was charming, and yes, the stars obviously enjoy working together. I agree with everyone that the script was convoluted and the movie contained none of the cohesion of Ocean's 11. And yes, the dialogue was witty and contained a lot of subtle jokes. But there's a big problem. Part of the enjoyment of seeing a caper movie is seeing the thieves get a bunch of money. So here's my problem: The cast spends the first part of the movie counting up how much of the original stolen money they haven't spent so that they can give it back to Terry Benedict, and then spends the rest of the movie trying to steal just enough money to make up the difference. (Review the math and you'll see what I mean: they're trying to steal 90-plus million, but they owe Terry 160-plus million.) Huh? So, in the end, even if they are successful, they have no money left? Great! How satisfying. ""Hooray! We're poor, but we're not dead!"" And then why do they end the movie playing cards? What are they playing for -- macaroni?"

","17 December 2004. This robbery caper is dazzlingly funny and entertaining. But the characters in this movie get uneven movie time and one of the great switches at the end of the movie is flat. Yet, it appears that the star-studded cast is having a good time, the Julia Robert's acting role at the end is delightful, the surprise cameo is fun. Overall the script, plot is decent, the required tension and conflict present. This is fun but perhaps unmemorable movie that is a nice holiday treat that is easy to swallow but required some help along with way. Matt Damon is particularly fascinating because of his other movie, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" that offers an amazing contrast in characters, illustrating his acting depth. Oceans 12 is like a cast of super stars having an opportunity to get together, allowing us a glimpse of an ensemble performance with some of the actors being given a bit more screen time, and an invitation for us to join in the romp and display of informal holiday spirits and jollies. Seven out of Ten Stars."

It doesn't quite work. Everything that's good here (performances, dialogue, music, characters) is either as good or better in the first, & everything that's bad here (emotional connections, heists, villains, general freshness) is done well in the first.

"classicsoncall","7","1","1","17 February 2018"," ""There's water in the basement and the pilot light's out!""
","If this movie has a downside, and many of the reviewers here think it does, I think it tries to be ambitious to a fault trying to top it's predecessor, ""Ocean's Eleven"". This was no more evident than in the gimmick to raise the level of a building by three inches using some underwater hydraulic contraptions. I couldn't follow the logistics of that escapade, much less think it was feasible at all, but the sheer audacity of the idea sounded compelling as all get out. But come on, Linus Caldwell's (Matt Damon) idea for a 'lookie-loo and a bundle of joy' was brilliant; who else would have come up with the idea of Julia Roberts impersonating Julia Roberts in a movie? It was almost as good as Bruce Campbell portraying Elvis Presley who in turn impersonates an Elvis Presley impersonator in 2002's ""Bubba Ho-Tep"". Try wrapping your heard around that one.<br/><br/>So Julia Roberts provides the number '12' in this outing, which reunites the usual gang of idiots from the first movie. Good to see Don Cheadle got his own credit for the flick this time around. I will agree that there's a lot to be confused about in the story if you're not paying attention, so you need to be glued to the picture throughout. Noteworthy scenes include Tess's (Roberts) encounter with Bruce Willis (as himself), and Vincent Cassel's turn as a slow motion break-dancer doing the laser field jump. <br/><br/>In the end, the caper turns out to be almost secondary to the zaniness involved in all of this. None of it's believable at all, but what was believable about ""Ocean's Eleven"" when you come right down to it? Leave your brain at the door and just enjoy the flick for the camaraderie and fun involved with the Ocean crew. It's easier that way."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","1","8 September 2017"," Lacks The Freshness Of The Original And Doesn't Add Anything Of Substance
","Lacking the freshness of the original and going a bit overboard with its twists n turns, the follow-up chapter to Ocean's Eleven does exhibit the lavish look & carefree vibe of its predecessor and adds a couple more charismatic actors to its ensemble but its story is weak and only gets messier as it progresses.<br/><br/>Taking place some time after the events of the previous film, Ocean's Twelve brings back all the members of the original team as they battle against time to pay back all the money they stole from the owner of Las Vegas casinos, with interest. To meet the demand, they decide to pull off another heist, however, there's a new player in town.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film picks up from where it left off in the last picture and doesn't take long to bring all of them back into the same room. The basic storyline is interesting but how the events unfold in the final print is where the problem arises, not to mention that the subplots relating to new characters don't add anything of significance.<br/><br/>The sumptuous look n feel is retained and the European scenery is beautifully photographed. The smart manoeuvring of camera & refined use of colour palette adds a vibrant quality to its images. Editing is a mixed bag, however, as the numerous twists don't carry the same weight and appears forced into the narrative. And the background score doesn't have anything new to add either.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, pretty much the entire cast of Ocean's Eleven make their appearance in this one with Clooney & Pitt leading the pack like before while the new additions include Vincent Cassel & Catherine Zeta-Jones who play their part responsibly but their respective characters are very poorly sketched. Roberts however gets additional screen time and is able to improve on her earlier input.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Ocean's Twelve is an inferior sequel by all means that does take the arcs of its characters a little forward but doesn't add anything of substance. What's also disappointing is the climax that's far more ridiculous this time and seems way far-fetched than it did the last time. Still, there's some fun, laughs & amusement in store but if you're expecting a sequel that improves upon the original, then Ocean's Twelve isn't one of those."
"Sammy_ExpertCritic","9","1","1","25 December 2014"," Better than before!!
","A better movie than before. Although a little unrealistic, the movie again redesigns the plot of a heist performed with many twists and turns and comical situations. The plot depicts the story of Daniel Ocean again, along with 11 of his team members, including one more this time, to perform a heist. Matt Damon in this movie has a role much important than it's prequel. Exotic locations, casinos, wealthy and artistic homes, all this movie shows will make you dream of being a thief. Dynamic storyline and screen pace and fabulous performances again, will keep you glued to the screen. Stealing could never have been so much fun, until in this movie. Must watch."

","There are a lot of people who didn't like Ocean's Twelve. Enough so, I feel they made Ocean's Thirteen as a make-up movie, à la Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade when Part Temple of Doom was such a joke. Of course, using that theory, they still need to make Indy 5 for that tragedy of part IV<br/><br/>At any rate, I'm a HUGE 2001 Ocean's Eleven fan. I've seen that movie more than a, ah hem, dozen times. This one, not as much, but I still appreciate it when I do see it.<br/><br/>Is it anywhere close to the magic that (somewhat) part one held? No. But, it's a fun addition and original to the max.<br/><br/>Basically, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and crew stole more than $150 million in the original movie from three Las Vegas casinos. They were set to get away with it and live happily ever after, or so people who only saw part one would count on.<br/><br/>In this follow-up, the man they stole from, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) comes a'looking and teams up with another thief to ensure they pay back the money with interest. Playing it by ear, they cook up some European schemes to ""earn"" back the money so they don't get murdered, or worse.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of the gorgeous Vegas backdrop, or the normality of the original, Ocean's Twelve does manage to capture the same crew with pinpoint accuracy on their individual characters and the dialogue is still incredibly rich and absolutely hilarious. I always love George Clooney and mostly love Brad Pitt – together, whether this is the original or not, they certainly deliver in the fun I watched time and again in the original.<br/><br/>In truth, this movie is a mess at times. It's random and despite the original aspect of characters having to make up for their sins in the first movieit's still a ton of fun, funny and the cinematography and scenes are crisp and fun to look at.<br/><br/>In truthPart Two or Twelve, honestly, I wish this movie hadn't been made. I loved them just getting away with it in the original and riding off into the sunset. Butif it had to be made, I would have strongly preferred this version. I am a fan. And I endorse this."

Steven Soderbergh has once again contributed a wonderful film to cinematic history, that contains some of the most fantastic acting and writing which, of late, is rare in Hollywood. If you have only seen this movie once, and judged it on that basis, I would urge you to view it over again and truly analyze it, rather than coming to hasty conclusions."

","Oceans 12 is an entertaining sequel but the original is better. Terry Benedict {Andy Garcia} has hunt down Danny and his crew and he wants his money back with interest. Since they are too ""hot"" to work in the US, they travel overseas to try to get his money back before the deadline. Ocean's 11 was a very entertaining heist film and while the sequel is good its not as good. A lot of people are complaining that the plot is complex but if you pay attention then you should be able to follow the story pretty well. Some of the scenes are very unrealistic but the film is still fun to watch. The cast is all back with a couple of new people as well. My favorite is Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan, he had a lot of funny lines. Matt Damon has a bigger role as his character wants to be more involved with the heist. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Isabel the cop who's on the tail of Danny and his crew. She is very pretty but her acting talents aren't that great. George Clooney plays Danny, he does a good job but wasn't very memorable. Julia Roberts isn't in the film very much in the beginning but by the end she plays a big role. Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, Elliott Gould, Eddie Jemison and Shaobo Qin are all back. If you enjoyed these characters in the first film, then you should like them here. The one exception is Bernie Mac. His character is eliminated in the beginning and he doesn't reappear until the end. Bruce Willis also has a small and funny cameo. I think the best comparison too this film is The Italian Job but Oceans 12 is better. The stars seem to be having a lot of fun and there are some really funny scenes especially one near the end with Julia Roberts. The dialog is smart and funny. The direction is pretty good as Steven Soderbergh seems to know what he is doing. The film could had been better if they had worked on the script a little more since the heist wasn't as good as the first. Also their given a short deadline so it seems a little unrealistic they would had been able to pull it off. In the end, Oceans 12 is a an enjoyable film that's worth checking out now that its on video. Rating 7/10, if you expect something like Ocean's 11 you will probably end up disappointed as this ones more unrealistic. So just try and have a little more fun with this one."

","First of all, anyone who said they were confused by this film or couldn't keep up with what was being stolen must been a bit slow. (Very mild spoiler ahead) Basically, Ocean's crew try to steal something, they are out-foxed by a master thief who then sets them a challenge to see who is the best. If they win, he gives them the money to pay of Benedict who is on their tales. Not difficult to follow. (End of spoiler) OK, it's not as strong as Ocean's 11 but if you enjoyed that film then there is something for you here. It still has a pervasive sense of fun and is brilliantly shot, and the cast has become even better with some choice additions and cameos. Vincent Cassel as 'The Night Fox' puts in a great performance, and especially memorable is his dance number (don't worry, you'll see). Yes this film has a few in-jokes, yes there are a couple of obvious twists, and yes it sometimes feels like they just decided to take a holiday in Europe and film it, but it is still worth the price of your ticket. Ignore the dullards who gave this a bad review, they missed the point."

This movie is totally different from the first. It is not at all a ""mission : impossible - like"" but rather a good robbers comedy. It is a very intelligent story, with twists of another type, much more comic. The acting is generally good, especially Matt Damon. The only real criticism I would give (and a big one) is for the filming. I really felt sick with all those zooms in and out, absurd camera movements, and so on.<br/><br/>But on the whole, it was a fairly acceptable movie.

","I am a bit exasperated and even a little disappointed at the mixed reviews for ""Ocean's Twelve"". The 60% score registered on RottenTomatoes' scale works as well as any to reflect the division within critics' ranks. Generally these are the films most worth viewing to determine how in the world such a large spread of opinion exists.<br/><br/>Unless I am mistaken, the adult American moviegoer is a relatively well informed consumer. To that point, I cannot recall a single moment in any of the pre-release marketing blitz for ""Ocean's Twelve"" that indicated we had Oscar-contending material, great emotive acting or social impact/political value here. And since this is essentially ""O.E. II"" what major surprise might it be that what we have here is a great goof? Let's examine some facts.<br/><br/>The plot: Terry Benedict (we are treated to another Andy Garcia portrayal), victimized Bellagio owner of the first movie, wants his money backwith interest. He leans, in succession, on all the original members of Danny Ocean's (George Clooney) eleven teammates. And of course the note is due in an impossible time frame. A lot of cash will need to be stolen, and fast. So the original ""O.E."" team needs to be reassembled to pull some more capers.<br/><br/>What the team also finds out in short order is that not only are they being tailed by a resourceful (and strikingly  Katherine Zeta-Jones) international policeman but are also threatened by a master thief (Vincent Cassel as Francois) that wants to top them in every way. So our boys have to buck up and try and fend off all manner of adversity as they pursue their less than honorable  ""does anyone have any moral issues about this?"" is asked early on  goals.<br/><br/>This is not a flick filled with Bond-like gadgets or even the usual heist-focused set ups. But there is just enough of that to whet the appetite. The elaborate set up in their first caper, beginning with a shot of a sailboat at anchor and then penetrating it's eerie appearance to see what is going on below gives just enough of a head scratching high-tech look (and isn't it all about ""the look""?) to satisfy.<br/><br/>One-liners and quips are expected and by rights a necessity not overlooked in ""Ocean's Twelve"". And knowing glances. Lots of glances. Let's face it; this really is a hip collection of talented individuals. Most of us aren't, couldn't be and probably don't even know one. Well, here is a whole room full. I suspect most critics are jealous; always have. <br/><br/>Listen to Elliot Gould's line when surprised at an interruption during his visit to a fortune teller. Watch K. Zeta-Jones turn in the only real emotional scene. It is actually quite touching. Having played the somewhat hard-bitten and driven law enforcement pro, she offers a bit of vulnerability for us to savor. See Brad Pitt grimace when he finds he's made a mistake.<br/><br/>Check out two interviews (there are many available) to share the sheer fun these stars have and consider how lucky we are for their collaboration. See what George Clooney says (http://www.darkhorizons.com/news04/ocean1.php) about caper movies. Better yet, check out the ensemble interview at http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=79148&ran=247675 in which we sense the fun this group had and continues to have.<br/><br/>In all, we are offered what we expect  a smart caper film with some of the best in Hollywood delivering the goods. There is no political message here, no social axe ground nor remarkable signature or auteur offered; I trust you to relegate those criticisms for the art-house films and the annual launch of Oscar contenders as 2004 winds down. What we have here is a nice entertainment for the holiday season!<br/><br/>Rating: 3-1/4 Stars."

I just love Steven Soderbergh films, despite the fact I've only seen three of his movies. Those three movies are ERIN BROCKOVICH, OCEAN'S ELEVEN, and this one. Also, I especially loved the costumes. They were really well designed in my opinion. When Tess (Julia Roberts) asked Danny (George Clooney) if he was doing recon work on their anniversary, I laughed.

Knowing that most members of the eleven are deeply in debt, Ocean and buddy Rusty Ryan(Brad Pitt)put the crew back together and head to Europe to put together a job that will pay well and sustain Ocean's reputation.

","Ever seen a film with 86 endings? No? Well should the urge ever overcome you, Oceans's Twelve is the only film that refuses to just wrap up the 'plot' for good. There are about a zillion climaxes that are all anti-climatic. Steven Soderbergh couldn't even get one of them right? <br/><br/>Andy Garcia comes back and demands that Ocean's 11 give him back the money they stole, plus extra. So they go off to Europe to steal things by not stealing them and not really planning anything at all. The whole film is made up of narcissistic filler. Ooooohh it's all so sophisticated and cool isn't it? Puh-lease.<br/><br/>This movie shouldn't have been made. Ocean's Eleven may have worked well but Twelve was taken from a non-related script called 'Honor Among Thieves' and adapted into a sequel, that no one asked for. So how do you go about cramming in 12 main characters into a story that did not have 12 main characters? You can't.<br/><br/>As a result Ocean's 12 never interact all at once. Several characters are left with nothing to do, forgotten about, stand about like idiots, fight for even a couple of lines of dialogue (all sarcastic, self-aware, notionally 'cool' dialogue btw), disappear, reappear, wonder what the hell they're doing, forget who they are etc...<br/><br/>It's just plain horrible and too convoluted and contrived for its own good. The whole film seems out of order and you are frequently left wondering what on earth is going on. This elitist, condescending attitude makes us feel like the movie was made for the cast instead of us.<br/><br/>Plus Julia Roberts looks dreadful in this. She's very pale and thin and gaunt-looking. I thought I was looking at Skeletor to begin with. And if you don't believe how sickeningly 'clever' the film thinks it is, a certain plot development has Julia Roberts play Tess Ocean playing Julia Roberts (oh stop, that's too ingenious for my feeble, average movie-goer mind). Somehow Catherine Zeta Jones comes off a prettier, if not a better actress (I do NOT like Catherine Zeta Jones-but she was an exception here when compared to the Plain Jane Julia Roberts) as her accent is still all over the place.<br/><br/>The only good bit about the film is Vincent Cassell in a small supporting role as a master thief (like everyone else in the film). Funny how his one character is more interesting than a dozen others combined. Plus, we actually get to see him do stuff other than stand around. Which helps.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time with this film. Life is too short and there are other, better, shorter movies than this out at the moment. Ocean's Twelve is a dirty dozen."

"Quinoa1984","7","3","6","11 December 2004"," Has its moments, but overall it was a bit too much (though I liked it better on repeat viewings)
","...Steven Soderbergh, with his cast returning (and then some) from the first film, can create results that show how talented they are. Ocean's Eleven was a fun, fresh kind of heist picture, that worked off a good story on good characters, and had enough wit with comedy to balance out the more dramatic elements. Ocean's Twelve, on the other hand, juggles with the story like Tarantino on whip-its. I understood the premise pretty well from the trailers (Benedict, played by Garcia, wants all of his money back, or all eleven will be dead, so they high-tail it to Europe for a couple of prime heists). What sometimes boggled me were how the double crosses were handled, or how certain character knew others and so on and so forth. Adding to this confusion- or rather, not so much confusion as not really investing much interest in the story- Soderbergh fuses the film with his camera-work that is stylish, but overly so. It's one thing to be expressive with the camera, as Soderbergh can be (Traffic works very well off of the hand-held usage and filters). It's another thing to draw attention to the technical side while the story jump-ropes.<br/><br/>On top of this, the actors, while sometimes on the money (in particular Vincent Cassell in what could be his American breakthrough role as the ""night-fox""), can also be a little too thin to deal with. I understand it's a silly caper comedy, but I should be able to invest my emotions with these people, and about two-thirds into the movie I didn't care much about them. Take Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, playing a cop who once had a fling with Rusty (Pitt). Are we supposed to not like her, or like her, or kinda go back and forth. She's gorgeous to look at, but she's not given the kind of one-liners the others get. By the time the third act rolls around, the scenes seem like they've been filmed improv style (not a total downer), but without much coherence to where the story to go.<br/><br/>Basically, I knew I didn't totally despise Ocean's Twelve, however the sense of over-load made me say to myself a few times ""ok, so what's the point?"" I respect that the actors had fun making the film, as it is a lot better than being miserable through the shoot. But when it starts to distract from the focus of the scenes there's trouble (I could see smirks on them in some scenes where they could of had more of a better grip on what was really going on). Now, this is not to say I don't enjoy it when a director implements a crazy kind of style- Kill Bill vol. 1 is a triumph for that very reason- as long as it doesn't try and compensate for something wrong with the material. To put it another way, Ocean's Twelve is like an art-film that's struggling to break away from the hackneyed, conventional Hollywood 'hip' kind of standard, and the result is an equal amount of boredom, fascination, and slight indifference. There's also a sweet, if occasionally tiresome, jazz score that rings of 70's TV. C+ (6/10)"

We won't be able to get to the cinema (well, she won't, anyway) but let's hope it turns up on DVD pretty soon, or VHS. It's a shame sometimes that films like this can't go straight to video to help out the housebound and bedridden.

He's French and tends to do a lot of arty stuff which I'm not too keen on. Mother saw 'Read My Lips' but didn't like it as it was in French and she wasn't going to be bothered to read the subtitles. Anyway Cassell looked awful and my mother said that he should be ashamed of himself, turning up to work looking like that. Anyway, I hope they don't give him much screen time as I don't see why I should have to read subtitles when the film is full of Americans so I hope they've got him to speak English or dubbed him or something.

","""Ocean's Twelve"" is an interesting film to consider, and has many reasons to like it and many reasons to dislike it. Pros include the superb cast and the breezy and entertaining way in which Steven Soderbergh shoots the film. The Cons center around the plotting, which is often hard to believe. Whether or not you like the movie depends on which you value more: superficial entertainment value and beautiful people, or a plot (if the latter, you must not enjoy many movies). I personally was very entertained by the movie. The cast was what made the film, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts. Zeta-Jones is the main newcomer, and does very well, not to mention being extremely sexy. Matt Damon and Julia Roberts provide the most laughs; Roberts in particular has a hysterical sequence where her character Tess is called upon to impersonate Julia Roberts. I give the film an 8/10. If, while promoting ""Ocean's Twelve"", Soderbergh in taken by a particular location and decides to do ""Ocean's Thirteen"", count me in."

Sure, there are potholes galore: if Ocean can discover the real identity of the 'Night Fox' so quickly, why can the police not do it? And if you start trying to logically connect things (so Rusty just left Isabel one night more than three years ago and she never looked for him and then calmly knocks on his door one day?), you'll get a headache. I know that the odd camera angles and abrupt cuts were supposed to give the film an 'edgy' feel, but I found them to be distracting.<br/><br/>But I thought the movie was cool and a lot of fun. I love heist movies with double-crosses and such, and 'Ocean's 12' does not disappoint in that area. I love the 1960's-era movie feel that the music really helped portray. Clooney did his usual cool bad guy with a heart of gold, Zeta-Jones and Roberts gave more of the 'lightly scolding, but-I-love-you' act and Brad Pittwell, all he had to do was look directly at the camera and smile. **Sigh.** And I'm not even a fan of his. I thought Andy Garcia had the right amount of menace and charm as the revenge-seeking Benedict. Eliot Gould was terrific (as always!) There is lots of humor and there is a ruse near the end of the movie that involves Julia Roberts' character that I found to be hysterical! All in all, a fun story, lots of good-looking people to look at and the scenery was wonderful!<br/><br/>The ending totally leaves the door open for an 'Ocean's 13,' if any of the actors are interested.

Clooney and Pitts smugness, Cheadle's abysmal accent, Gould's OTT theatrics, the clichéd romance(s), Garcia failing to convince as a 'scary bad guy', these are all points i was able to overlook in the first movie, namely because it had a decent plot, a well instigated heist and enough supporting characters to amuse and engage the mind.<br/><br/>Unfortunately all the negatives i mentioned came to the fore for the sequel. So Benedict found them all, why not escape and disappear again? Or why not hire somebody to kill him? The dude really is'nt that scary.

They were so short of ideas they had to resort to something as lame and embarrassing as that. Simply pitiful.<br/><br/>The plot/heists were confusing and muddling not clever as they were supposed to be. And seeing as the movie was set in Europe we had the usual dull cameos from English 'actors' Izzard and Coltrane.<br/><br/>And then the whole Zeta Jones reuniting with her father ending seemed totally out of sync with the rest of the movie. This is a heist film right? Not a big budget version of a lonely hearts ad. Wholly inappropriate IMO.<br/><br/>I know what the studio was doing with Ocean's Twelve. They were making the obligatory sequel to anything that happened to be successful first time round. It's a sad state of affairs in modern Hollywood when supposed creative inspirations (such as Soderbergh) are so starved of fresh ideas they have to rehash their own movies to make a few bucks.<br/><br/>2/10"
"sol-","Null","2","4","12 March 2006"," My brief review of the film
","While there are enough reasons for one to have reservations about calling this a great film, I must admit that I still found it quite decent entertainment. Soderbergh keeps it well paced and entertaining on a visual level, even with some overly shaky photography and awkward freeze frames, plus there is a great plot twist involving Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis later in the film. The best aspect of this crime caper though is Catherine Zeta-Jones, who adds a lot of sparks and a fresh streak to the material. Yes, the film has its downfalls, such as the plot, which is mostly a series of incidents that only work because one does not know what will happen next, and such as Andy Garcia's cardboard acting. The film lacks much depth and does not execute the buddy-buddy aspect as well as the first film did; however it is kind of fun in its own way: mindless amusement with some great visuals, a twisted plot, and credible acting by Zeta-Jones. No, it is not as good as one would expect with Soderbergh at the helm, but neither is it all that bad."
"CarsonTrent","1","2","4","17 February 2006"," I'm getting real tired of these Soderbergh arty yawners
","Yes, the arty, trembled camera-work we have seen to death in his movies, and yes, the slow-paced narrative and the colors. In addition to that, the bloated, lazy Hollywood aging bankable stars: Brad - not to mention any recent movie - Pitt, George - ever growing double chin(but making OK movies, still) - Clooney, Julia - lately transvestite look-alike Roberts, Matt - pig-face - Damon and ever plain and insipid Catherine Zeta Jones. No story, no point, except the ""behind the scenes"" - buzz that the cast partied in Clooney's Italian residence which was the pretext for the whole movie, I believe. The only plus is Vincent Cassel, who is excellent as always, but even that cannot make up for the rest. I'm glad I ripped it off the internet and didn't stuff another 10 bucks for a ticket into these bloated guys pockets, because it would have made me regret it. Maybe the ever-growing internet piracy will water-down the exorbitant paychecks these wretched f**kers get just for doing what is increasingly NOTHING."

","Ocean's Eleven came across like a loose, fun affair but with a tightly-wound plot and twists that you actually cared about and seemed clever. This movie, the twists show up, but by the time they get there, it's almost as if they couldn't be bothered to really stage them effectively or really had any desire to make you care about them. If the filmmakers don't care about what they're doing, why should we? The movie is so detached it's almost like a camera was pointed at the actors and they just improvised the entire thing. In addition, most of the actors are completely wasted. Carl Reiner's character is at least forced to the sidelines intentionally - by him saying he wants out - but Bernie Mac disappears for half the film, and basically nobody makes an impression perhaps save for Matt Damon and Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Waste of time."

","I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. I saw the first Ocean film and found it to be cleaver and very entertaining. This sequel had a terrible plot and was confusing. But seeing the Heist is what makes these types of films fun, and the Heist isn't really shown and only lasts a few seconds and was one of the most boring ideas I've seen.<br/><br/>From what I could gather, the Heist occurred before the egg was even put on display. It was snatched by the thief of all thieves ( who happened to be Isabel's father) in order to prove a point to the Nightfox, another expert thief. He then allowed Ocean to make a bag switch on a train for the egg. So, the rest of the film was pointless. What I didn't get is why does Ocean allow himself and his gang to be arrested in the museum when he already knows it's a fake on display. Did he know all along that Linus's parents were cons and would get them released? Also, Bernie Mac was hardly in this, he sat in jail most of the film, so what was the point of him being there? And the whole idea of Julia Roberts pretending to be herself was silly. If that's the case, why not have Brad Pitt pretending to be Brad Pitt in order to get close to the egg.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: This film just wasn't clever. I expect to see a Heist during a heist film. And you don't get that in this. Don't waste your time with this."

","The best swindle that goes on in this movie is the one behind the scenes. Not only do the cast and crew con the studio out of paying them salaries for a movie that makes PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE look like a masterpiece but they get free trips to Europe as well. To top that they release the movie and con people into buying tickets. Sweet.<br/><br/>Everything that can go wrong here does. Bad writing. Inept direction. The most annoying musical score since THE HOURS. Actors who seem bored and don't even attempt characterizations.<br/><br/>Somehow the costume director and cinematographer didn't get the message that they weren't supposed to work too hard. The film is very well costumed and has good camera work.<br/><br/>This is a sequel to OCEAN'S ELEVEN and presumes that the viewer saw that movie last night. I could only remember about half of the characters and many of them for the wrong reasons. George Clooney for being the ringleader. Don Cheadle for that dreadful attempt at a Cockney accent. The Asian guy for being Asian. Brad Pitt for being Brad Pitt. Elliot Gould for a bad haircut. Carl Reiner for being bald. The other five were just there.<br/><br/>The first movie very carefully built up the characterizations and gave motivation for the big robbery. Here the characters are rounded up like cattle and thrown together, and these fine actors simply deserve better.<br/><br/>The story literally skips all over the place. Various locations in the United States. Several cities in Europe. Of course that gave the actors more stops on their vacations, so it's understandable. It's just confusing for the viewer.<br/><br/>The first movie's downfall was going on two minutes too long. If they had ended with the scenes in front of the fountains it would have been a classic in the genre. By tacking on the scene with George Clooney and Julia Roberts getting together at the end it ended on a flat note.<br/><br/>This one goes to the bad early on in the game. And Julia Roberts is subjected to a plot twist (don't worry, no spoilers if you want to see it) that is probably the stupidest one ever seen on film. It was so stupid that I do hope the director released Julia's mother from the dungeon when she finished filming it.<br/><br/>One of the worst moments in this involves a, well, dance number that's part of one of the heists. It's done in a room being constantly being swept by lasers in a random pattern. Let me repeat that: RANDOM pattern. What we see is interesting but your brain is telling you, sorry, this won't work. Not if the lasers are in a truly random pattern.<br/><br/>Hopefully this one was bad enough that we'll be spared an OCEAN'S THIRTEEN, unless they want to have Jason Voorhes slaughter the cast, the writer, the director, and especially the composer on screen. I'd pay $7 to see that right now."

"Pavel-8","8","2","4","18 January 2005"," Ocean's Twelve...or Thirteen...or Seventeen...whatever
","""Ocean's Eleven"" is one of my favorite recent movies, as it seamlessly excels in nearly every aspect of film-making. So of course I eagerly anticipated the release of this sequel, ""Ocean's Twelve"", although I did not expect a movie that matched up to the superb original.<br/><br/>All of the actors and characters from that first film are back. The premise picks up about a year after the conclusion of ""Eleven"", as Andy Garcia's villainous Terry Benedict is hunting down the men who robbed him. He threatens harm if they don't refund his money, so the eleven must reunite to pull another heist, this time in Europe.<br/><br/>Infused with Soderburgh's brilliant cinematography, the first film was a smooth, sleek Hollywood production. The look matched the tone of the smooth, sleek caper pulled by the always-in-control titular crew. ""Ocean's Twelve"" has a drastically different feel, as the classic subdued beauty of Europe substitutes for the modern flashiness of Las Vegas. As everyone hops around the continent, the singularity of the first film is almost recklessly replaced by the atmosphere of various countries. Initially bothersome, this tone eventually clicks with the characters, who themselves are less of a machine than before. The end result has the feel of an independent film, like something a bunch of friends made while partying, but with a $110 million budget. Of course from all reports that isn't far from the truth. The good news is that the congenial atmosphere produces a movie that oozes amicability. But even that sense of camaraderie cannot mask the deficiencies elsewhere in the picture.<br/><br/>Most missed is the saavy overall film-making of the original. Whether it be the lack of creative shots (except for a plane landing) or the not-quite-as-crisp dialogue (throwaway lines in particular), Twelve simply isn't as much fun as the original. Granted, that's a high bar to clear, and the sequel is still better than most, but comparisons are inevitable. The Venetian blind wipes and clever use of titles spice things up; the actors' delivery is still timely; and small touches like the Boston-New York thing still shine, but ultimately the script doesn't quite measure up to the original. Instead of a tight and driving story that hoodwinks but explains fully and logically, Twelve utilizes two dei ex machina (or di or machinis or however the phrase is pluralized) that are not adequately buttressed, leaving the viewer feeling not robbed, but a little cheated.<br/><br/>""Eleven"" was a popcorn film, if there is such a thing, while ""Twelve"" is more of a popcorn movie, meaning that is isn't as crisp or cohesive from a cinematic angle. Perhaps this was an purposeful choice intended to reflect the more haphazard nature of the story, but the method does not succeed as wildly.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Entertaining but not quite as satisfying as the original, ""Ocean's Twelve"" is still better than most movies, worth a few bucks and a couple hours. 7 of 10.<br/><br/>As a side question, any thoughts on which character was the titular twelfth? I think there is an easy answer, but I'm not sure it's the right one. In fact, I don't have an definite opinion. I posit that it's just a silly sequel title."

","Sometimes a movie is made just for the sake of being made and making money. Oceans Twelve is a prime example of such a case. First of all, awful title. It's right up there with ""Beethoven's Second"". Oceans Eleven was such a great remake of an old classic. It was stylish, well executed, and entertaining. Most of all, it was concise and concluded well. There was no need for a sequel. And there was definitely no need for a sequel with as little plot development that went into Oceans Twelve. The same cast returns, with the same, now tired gimmicks and personal neuroses. In Oceans Eleven, the crew rip off Mr. Benedict's money. This time around, even though the insurance company has paid Mr. Benedect what he lost in the robbery, for some reason he is intent on hunting down Danny's crew and getting the money back from him, with interest. This whole idea is just so preposterous, it's almost funny if it weren't so sad that this is the best the ""writers"" could do. My advice: don't waste your time or money on this film. Use the money and rent ""Oceans Eleven"" and re-watch that instead if you need another fix of Danny and his crew."

The director and writer should be shot for not thinking of something better then this in what could have been a charming sequel. and by the way Steven, when the audience starts paying more attention to the weird camera angles then the story you have a problem. Capra, Hitchcock, all used some creative cameras but they were talented enough not to lose the audience in them or just show off with the camera. You seem to have forgotten a cardinal rule of film-making in the name of ""style"". The Pitt and Zeta Jones chemistry is quite good however, perhaps if they had made the film more focused around them and dispensed with the narcissism it might have worked. Once again Zeta Jones shows how she's got more talent and beauty then Roberts could dream of. Sadly, this film wastes talent and fails on many accounts. I want my money back."

Ocean's 13 will be about the same thieves who are trying to steal a screenplay well hidden somewhere in Hollywood. The 13th member will be a foreign (maybe,Russian) screenplay-writer who knows all tricks to write a copy of this well hidden screenplay, so they can replace the original they'll have to steal.

This has been said by a lot of the cast members and also the director, Steven Soderbergh. Ocean's 12, while it did lack a gripping plot, is being bashed because it was different then what people wanted. If it were released before Ocean's 11, it would be taken much differently, not as a failed sequel. The problem with sequels is people go into it with a preset idea of what it should be like it and have lots of expectations.

","I enjoyed the first film, Ocean's Eleven, but the tension is gone from Ocean's Twelve. I think everyone's having too much fun with the self-parody and there isn't much thrill and danger in the film. There is a badguy who isn't really that bad. There is a love interest with no real chemistry. A good cop passes up a chance to do something good. It's unclear why Ocean's Twelve agrees to take on the movie's premise rather than just scattering to the winds and hiding. The ""funny"" bit with Julia Roberts struck me as self-absorbed as stupid.<br/><br/>The plot is convoluted and hard to follow, especially as it is partly hidden from the audience for effect. And when the scheming is revealed it seems really unnecessary.

That aside, I believe that the actors did very well with what they had, particularly Matt Damon, who actually had a little character in his character, little quirks that weren't egotistic or like a smooth criminal who always knows what he is doing.

Danny Ocean's quick allusion to his ""second third anniversary"" at the jewelry shop at the very beginning is fun, but to have it repeated at the end, not only once but twice, is getting rather tedious, as if the audience needs hearing aids.<br/><br/>The fun carries on (at least for those who realize that this is not a heist movie) and just when you think that the laughs have been exhausted, Soderbergh throws at you this Julia-playing-Tess-playing-Julia bit, which is just fantastic. You don't know how fantastic it is until you hear somebody's line about Tess not having to do much because Julia sometime just laughs in front of the reporters and doesn't say anything, and then you realize that the person standing there listening to this with a straight face is not only Tess, about also JULIA! This reality-turned-inside-out is seen again and again. We have Linus Caldwell asking for a bigger role in the caper, but Matt Damon actually asking for a smaller role in the movie! There's also referencing for those who like that sort of thing, such as Vincent Cassel's disgustingly carried-away stunt with the moving blue laser beams referencing Catherine Zeta-Jones's graceful maneuver through the stationery red laser beams in Entrapment.<br/><br/>Behind the scene, this is also a fun party, from what I've heard and read. It seems that the cast of O11 had so much fun making it that they just loved every minute doing it again in this sequel that is not really a sequel. To this already impressive cast is added Zeta-Jones and Cassel mentioned before, plus versatile veterans Robbie Coltrane and Cherry Jones, and even uncredited cameos Albert Finney and Bruce Willis. Although belonging to a very different genre, Ocean's Twelve is just as much a Christmas party as Love Actually was last year."

"Criticalstaff","8","0","0","31 May 2020"," The Best Ocean's movie
","This movie is quite fun. A surprise to be sure but a welcome one. It is not quite a heist movie; it is rather a comedy on the previous heist movie.<br/><br/>So to put things into perspective, when the Oceans Trilogy was done the consensus was that 11 was an instant cult-classic, 12 was a weird disappointment and 13 a highly welcomed return to the roots.
As in many cases (Alien 4 or Ang Lee's Hulk, Starship Troopers) sometimes everybody is wrong and only later we rediscover how beautiful, poignant or visionary certain art can be.
I am re-watching the series more than a decade later and I am surprised how wrong the zeitgeist was. 11 is very dated, 13 is pure garbage and 12 is actually not bad.<br/><br/>Oceans Twelve is actually the diamond in the rough. The forgotten gem. The overlooked ugly duckling of the trilogy(universe).
I low-key love this movie. It is not perfect, it is not the best movie ever. But especially after watching Ocean Eleven, this movie was so refreshing, funny, original and interesting.
It is not surprising on paper : Oceans Twelve enjoys doing the opposite of 11. I think it adds to the quality of the film, Twelve is fairly meta and loves no to take things too seriously. That is already the case in 11, and it bothered me. Because there was no reason these character acted so nonchalantly. The charm was not earned. The characters were not caricatures, they were played straight. They were the best and the coolest not by doing anything but just by being there. They had all the skills and they were the best at them.
In this movie the main characters Clooney and Pitt are acknowledged to not have any skill whatsoever. In this movie, they are plain assholes. And it is great. Of course it is intended to be ironic, but I think it works towards the film. In that regard the movie is rightfully the sequel of 11, where Clooney and Pitt do something that they think is clever but that is not in reality. In addition, the irony that the film wants to convey is not aimed towards Danny Ocean and Rusty, the characters or the plot; but it is towards Clooney and Pitt themselves. How funny the films thinks it is when Pitt and Clooney watch Oprah on the couch, while trying to fall asleep. The film involuntarily builds its characters through these inside jokes. And of course it is bad. But it is so bad it's good. Same with the scene Matt Damon asking for a bigger role, same with the Julia Roberts as Julia Roberts cameo.
This film works because it is an inversion of the first movie. You see Clooney and Roberts actually interact here, they have affection, they have a secret code, we get why they are together. Pitt plays Rusty as a suave seducer, which is hiding how clueless he is, we get an understanding of his characters because we see his failings. Everybody plays a caricature of themselves, and it works because the movie is in on it. The movie does not understand why it is funny, but we do. My favorite scene is when Matt Damon takes a moment to ask if we should make fun of a handicapped person, and everybody shoots him down. I loved it because the movie then proceeds to go with it anyway.
My enjoyment of this movie comes in larger part from the contrast with the first one. However the movie also tries in many ways to subvert the heist movie tropes. Again that is why this one is more watchable 20 years later. The heist in this movie is basically an anti-heist. And I don't really mind. Ocean 11 also at its core did not care for the heist, which made me ask to myself why the audience should. Here the movie does not care and we should not care. Here the movie is pure charm; you get to spend 2h in travelling through Europe with the gang. That is it. This is just a big excuse to spend some time with these guys. And it is actually enjoyable, because the locations are cool and exotic and not fake with the veneer of luxury, the music is cool and not recycled, and characters seem genuine and not artificial.
The first movie spent actually a lot of effort to try to not take things too seriously. Twelve actually does take things less seriously.
And this were you find the reason why people hated it. It builds on the first movie, but it goes resolutely against the grain. On purpose. So it is at the same time the best sequel, because it takes the first movie at face value and asks what do these characters do after they've executed the biggest heist ever. And for someone looking to have the same movie as the last time, it is the worst sequel.

"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","25 December 2013"," Utterly forgettable
","This film's biggest sin is that it just isn't as interesting as a heist film should be. I'm writing this review about a month after I saw the film, and I honestly had to read the Wikipedia plot summary to even remember what I was supposed to talk about.<br/><br/>The first film was great because it had a very clear premise and the twists all played with the viewer's expectation and the conventions of the genre. This is just plain unpredictable, and not in a good way. You have no way of knowing where the story is going to move next and this is a problem, because the film keeps throwing new characters and locations into the mix in order to liven up the film, but all it ends up doing is diluting the plot to a point where the viewer couldn't care less what happens next.<br/><br/>The characters are also a bit of a hit and miss. Some of the returning characters, like most of the Ocean Crew, are fine. They haven't really evolved in between the films, but they work like they are. All the new character and especially Julia Roberts' Tess are utterly uninteresting and/or unlikable. Even a cameo from Bruce Willis ends up being just plain weird instead of good, as unbelievable as that sounds. And the less is said about the ""villains"" the better.<br/><br/>This is not a good sequel. It tries to follow in the footsteps of the original, but it has none of its intrigue, charm or ability to tell a coherent story. If you're a major fan of heist movies, you might find some good things in this - and yeah, the locations are actually pretty nice - but the rest of you, don't bother."
"gcase-2","4","0","0","30 May 2007"," How'd they get away with this?
","Before I go off on this utter disgrace of a movie, let me add that I personally enjoyed Ocean's 11. It wasn't a GREAT movie, but it was definitely a good movie...<br/><br/>Compared to the first movie, this lazy 'sequel' tends to do nothing but bring a bunch of both well-known and not so well-known actors together and create one of the worst flops I have seen in my life of movie watching.<br/><br/>Half of the time I was unsure if the actors were even acting!! It appeared as if they were not even looking at the script, and instead talking amongst themselves like, ""Hey, so how you've been?"" . ""Oh , I 've been good, the kids at home are taking up a lot of my time, ya know"". It was ridiculous! Another major flaw in this 'sequel' of a movie was the cinematography; It lacked everything. Only twice I recall seeing full shots of a building, the rest were all close ups on the actors. It seemed like a mini monologue every time an actor or actress said something! Just out of nowhere, extreme close up on the 1 or 2 individuals speaking, with no shot of a location, building, or even a room.<br/><br/>In fact, some of the backgrounds appear to be CGI, computer-generated imagery for those who don't know the acronym. The inside of a house looked as if a programmer slopped on a few walls and colored it up to give the look of an actual house! The story in this movie was a joke as well. Nothing seemed to tie together. Newcomers who have not seen the first one will probably be lost in the lacking story, such as not knowing any of the characters.<br/><br/>In fact, the only reason I gave this movie a 4 out of 10 is because some of the dialog is actually funny. Yes, there were some parts in the movie that made me laugh! Unfortunately, I thought this movie was supposed to have a story.. you know? Something with a dilemma, a build-up to the climax, and then a resolution at the end?...no? PLEASE only see this movie if you want to laugh a little. Whether you're laughing at the horrible attempt of the movie or just a funny phrase an actor said, that is all you are going to get out of viewing this poor sequel."

","They were reaching on this one. ""Ocean's Eleven"" was such a wonderful movie and such a huge success they figured: ""Let's do a sequel"". So a sequel they did and they reeeeeeached to find an adequate reason to have the Ocean's Gang perform an encore. They were reaching for something... something unique, something intriguing, something that would put butts in the seats and keep them there. Without a doubt they failed. ""Ocean's Twelve"" was weak. I don't care how much it made (which I'm sure it can't be as much as O11) this movie was not that good.<br/><br/>The plot was so contrived. I mean, here it: is everyone is happily enjoying the fruits of their labor from masterfully stealing $180M or whatever it was, and then they are thrust back into the role of being thieves again because of the envy of some obnoxious French guy. And after the elaborate, well planned and well executed scheme of the first theft, the O12 theft was so amateurish. The only rooting interest I had in their success was to wipe the smug look off the snotty French guy's face. And what was Catherine Zeta-Jone's role anyway other than to be annoying? <br/><br/>Ooh this movie disappointed me on so many levels.

The first was mediocre this one is simply a turkey. I find it hard to name a movie with so many A list actors that fails so terrible. Utter rubbish!!! It proves that even A list actors who could be selective in choosing their roles more carefully are simply greedy cash whores. By having so many big name stars it's true that there is always going to be some eye candy but there is nothing to distinguish them as they are all vying for attention. The wage budget must of been huge for this film but simply because you have a load of big names does not mean that the film will be good, especially with such a confusing and convoluted script. Julia Roberts playing herself, wow that's original. Utter rubbish and they should all have hung their heads in shame and given away their fee - Not just bad - AWFUL!!!!"

","Ocean's Eleven was a somewhat indulgent jolly-boys outing of a movie, but it worked for what it was and proved an entertaining light thriller. Ocean's 12 is one of the most self-indulgent films ever made, just an excuse for the 'guys' to have a laugh at the audience's expense. The scene where Julia Roberts as Tess impersonates Julia Roberts with the aid of Bruce Willis as himself ranks as one of the worst scenes in recent cinema history; the scene where the cocky French thief dodges laser beams is pretty resistable also. I couldn't recount the plot of the film as the script, editing and direction are fairly incoherent, and there are so many different characters involved (as if 11 wasn't enough!) that it is hard to keep track of them. I wouldn't describe myself as a fan of Catherine Zeta Jones but she is about the only bright spot in the film."

","I really enjoyed Ocean's Eleven, and wanted to like this movie as much. There were moments with the kind of fun, witty interaction in the first movie, but mostly it just felt like the screenplay was an effort to give some camera time to each of the 12 actors. There really wasn't enough effort (or time) to give us more than a glimpse of any of them, and it made for a jumpy, confusing movie.<br/><br/>Also, there's a subplot involving Julia Roberts's character that's just brutal.

"Poseidon-3","Null","0","0","6 February 2006"," The very definition of cinematic fluff
","After the considerable success of ""Ocean's 11"" (itself a remake of a chummy Rat Pack 60's movie), Clooney and Co. returned for this flashy, but fairly empty, sequel. Set a few years after the casino heist of the original, this film has Garcia (the mark in the first caper) threatening Clooney and his gang with death unless they pay back every cent of what they stole, plus interest! (This despite the fact that he's already received an insurance settlement!) Since the eleven men have already spent more than a little of the dough from their caper, they must come up with a plan to steal even more, this time traveling to Europe. Following one unsuccessful attempt on a wealthy recluse, the team conspires to snatch a priceless Faberge egg for a fellow thief (Cassel) who has agreed to pay off their debt if they can capture the item. Unfortunately, Cassel actually makes things harder for the team as he wants to maintain his reputation as the world's premiere burglar! Things fall apart fairly quickly, forcing Clooney's wife Roberts to attempt to aid him (in one of the film's most controversial plot maneuvers.) The film alternates somewhat uncomfortably between loud, frenetic moments and languorous, quirky ones. The director is to be admired for attracting all of the original cast members for this sequel, no matter how little they are utilized in the plot (some of the actors on view have precious little to do), though they were surely compensated with lots of good times on location as noted in the press throughout filming. Clooney and Pitt still look good and provide some interesting moments and Zeta-Jones is great as the fly in their ointment, an investigator. Damon also does a fine job as the novice, trying to break through to the big time. However, there just isn't room to showcase the rest of the large supporting cast, especially with the many other billed and unbilled cameo appearances. Most of them are merely furniture in the sprawling tale. They take a back seat to showy cameos by folks like Jones and Willis. Garcia is pretty ridiculous, wielding a stick and strutting around in some bizarre get-ups. This time around, the methods and plot twists of the caper can't possibly be taken entirely seriously. It's all just too preposterous and fanciful to hold up to close scrutiny. Better to take the film as the unrepentant piece of fluff that it is and try to enjoy some of the beautiful locations, the glossy production design and the appeal of its leading players. Still, all that can only go so far in trying to put over a movie that is more than two hours long. At times it seems like Soderburgh and Clooney tried to throw in everything but the kitchen sink and the whole thing starts to turn in on itself. A lot of criticism was aimed at Roberts' joke on herself near the end of the film, but the bigger question is why did she go from an elegant and stylish presence in the first film to a wan and gaunt hausfrau in this one? Perhaps it was to make her transformation more distinct visually, though, to be truthful, even then she just doesn't look as good as one might expect. Did they run out of budget for some lipstick? There are a few stylish and striking moments in the film, but overall it lacks punch and certainly emotional investment as well. Most of the potentially-tense heist sequences are relayed in flashback or otherwise awkwardly handled. It's likely destined to become a camp classic several years down the pike the way some 60's films come off now."

","During the Summer of 2001, Ocean's Eleven, a remake, was unlike most remakes of the early 2000s. It was fresh, it was lively, it was fun to watch. Steven Soderbergh, who has directed some very heavy movies (Erin Brockovich, Traffic, Solaris) brought us two hours of con-man entertainment that had very little to do with the premise of the original Rat Pack film from the 1960s other than Danny Ocean led 10 other thieves to rip off a Vegas casino. The pace, the plot, and the fun I had while watching Ocean's Eleven made me want to see Ocean's Twelve very much, hoping this would be the movie that bucked the sequel trend of the 2000s. While I was not expecting Godfather II or The Empire Stikes Back, I was at least hoping for a serviceable sequel, one that at least kept the life and energy of the original flowing through the characters and the scenes of the movie. By now, you should be getting the feeling I didn't feel it from this sequel. While Ocean's Twelve is not a bad movie, it just does not live up its predecessor's. Perhaps it was the genius of the fun little movie Ocean's Eleven that this movie just looks so different and less entertaining. Ocean's Twelve's first mistake? They make the good guys losers in the first scenes. Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), who had $160 million stolen from him in the first movie by the band of 11, finds out who stole the money and gives them 2 weeks to return the dough, plus interest, or it's ""game over."" This gives the movie makers and excuse to send the crew to Europe, to new fancy locales with new music and characters to meet. The plot is unimportant, as it just serves to allow each character a chance to scheme and plot some impossible scenario, and the acting is solid. George Clooney knows more than he's letting on as Danny Ocean, Brad Pitt knows even more than Ocean as Rusty Ryan, Bernie Mac likes his nail salons as Frank Catten, Matt Damon shows a nice comedic touch as Linus Caldwell, and, well, I could go on about the cast, but I wont. The newest additions to the cast are Catherine Zeta-Jones as an international thief expert and Andrew Cassel as the Night Fox, the designated bad-guy in the film. His motivations are juvenile but keeps the plot moving. The ending is border-line confusing, as the ultimate motivation for everything in the movie becomes clear only after the last scene of the movie, or possibly after a repeat viewing. As I said, this is not a bad movie, especially for those who enjoy a good caper movie, but perhaps the overreaching breadth of the movie made it difficult to capture the fun little moments of Ocean's Eleven, or allow much humor, or allow the banter we saw in the 2001 movie. Maybe it was the different tone of the movie, but those who loved 2001's Ocean's Eleven may see something good in Ocena's Twelve--though don't expect a great time."

","Like everyone else, I rented ""Ocean's Twelve"" with high anticipation after watching ""eleven"". It would be rude to say that my hope is totally crushed or I thought this film is total crap, but certainly in terms of story and screenplay, it comes nowhere near its prequel. The story is too much complex from beginning to end as if the writer had too many things in his mind but never quite used them properly. I asked myself ""What's going on?"" a number of times during the film but didn't get a satisfactory answer in the end.<br/><br/>Still, the film has the original's stylish film-making, with innovative and interesting camera angles. It has got more star-studded cast including an enjoyable cameo by Bruce Willis as himself. The new starring role by Catherine Zeta-Jones is definitely one of the reasons one should however watch the film. Her looks, attitude and very comfortable performance are this film's valuable assets.

","Sesame Street is having an aneurysm over this movie's slogan: ""Twelve is the new Eleven.""<br/><br/>Having nailed the formula down pat with ""Ocean's Eleven""  ridiculously implausible action and pulp coincidences, snide and smarmy rock soundtrack (evoking a Guy Ritchie-ish élan), smash-cuts and wobbling Steadicams, overlapping, smart-ass dialog, and A-List megastars glutting all 70 millimeters of the widescreen  director Steven Soderbergh now hurls ""Ocean's Twelve"" at us like an elitist Upper Class Molotov cocktail and hopes we don't run screaming into the sallow beigeness of our mundane, everyday lives.<br/><br/>Filled as it is with man-toys (from Clooney's too-hip instigator, Danny Ocean, to Damon's stuttering novice, Linus, to Pitt's glib Tyler Durden franchise, here named Rusty Ryan) and toy women (the stunningly rapturous Catherine Zeta-Jones as Rusty's ex-sex, Detective Isabel, and the stunningly bland Julia Roberts playing Tess, Ocean's spouse), we find the camera righteously slewing all over creation trying to cram them all in, making for a movie so self-aware of its megastar cheese-wattage that it can't quite get over its own smugness.<br/><br/>There is something intrinsically twisted in a society bulked with Middle and Lower Class peons, who would patronize a film centering on the illegal exploits of High Class thieves, tolerating the hijinks of these outlandishly enabled hedonists for the very fact that they are too rich to be stealing for necessity in the first place. It's good to be a man-toy.<br/><br/>The megastars quickly exposit why they should all go to Europe for this film (besides to annoy those of us trying to EARN a living): the casino entrepreneur whom they heisted in ""Ocean's Eleven"", Benedict (Andy Garcia, foreboding as always), has located them all and craves payback  with big vig  so off they traipse to heist Continental rich men for the funds. ""Robin and the Seven Hoods"" this ain't  the rich robbing the rich to pay the rich. See, Lower Class peons, how it all works out for everyone? <br/><br/>Thus does malarkey ensue. When their first Euro heist requires a cable shot that cannot be made from one building to another due to the second building being too low, instead of chipping away at the ramparts of the first building, or taking a shot from a *lower* window, these monumentally-thick thieves opt to *raise* the second building 18 inches (via underwater pylon-jacks) to achieve their goal. If you sat in your seat without batting an eye during this incomprehensibly-gratuitous sequence (which would have realistically put Ocean's crew so far into the red financially that they'd be selling their suave man-behinds in Amsterdam just to pay for the plane tickets home), the rest of the plot would make complete sense.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you are not in the 1-percent of super-thieves currently trawling the French Riviera billionaire circuit, or if you have not the faintest clue where to purchase building-raising pylons with digital leveling readouts, the plot will become one sad contrivance after the next, magically twisting in on itself whenever it wants to pull another double-con on its audience.<br/><br/>In touch with reality about as solidly as Michael Jackson, the movie's prime directive is eventually established - a thievery competition between Ocean's Eleven and acclaimed Euro thief, the Night Fox (Vincent Cassell, suitably Continentally Charming-yet-Treacherous).<br/><br/>The competition's Prize is housed in a museum room rife with laser fields  which begs the question: when is a security company going to produce a laser field that actually encloses the object it is guarding? From ""Entrapment"" (where Zeta-Jones herself breaches a laser field), to ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,"" laser fields only exist in movies to illustrate how pragmatically they can be breached, and are as much a hindrance to super-thieves as geriatric rent-a-guards. <br/><br/>With a climactic soundtrack lifted from Iron Butterfly's ""In A Gadda Da Vida,"" the grand double-triple-con goes into effect  with Julia Roberts suddenly playing Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis suddenly turning up for added camera-slewing, and everyone else getting arrested and clanked into a cell, isolated from any *real* perps lest their luscious posteriors suffer the brunt of caged man-lust.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Ocean and the Night Fox face off to explain to the addled audience (replete with crash-cut visuals) the obvious discrepancies and plot holes that we wanted to slap the screenwriter over. After the Night Fox gets his Bond-Villain on, revealing his methods in heisting the Prize  including a scene of break-dancing through that vaunted laser field - Ocean accounts what *really* transpired during the heist. It's suddenly ""Rashomon"" with man-toys.<br/><br/>As in this film's predecessor, seems like a heist can only be pulled off successfully in past tense. Clooney should wipe that smirk off his face before someone slaps it off.<br/><br/>As for the two women in the mix (Isabel, out to bust Rusty's taut butt, and Tess, incessantly prodding Ocean to renounce thievery) - seems they were only hounding their men until a big enough heist brought in enough income to reconcile them with Crime being a viable vocation. The final scene sees all these megastars partying around a poker table  which speaks volumes about the vapid principles that the women supposedly stood on.<br/><br/>In moving out from under the daunting yet protective shadow of the Sinatra-based ""Eleven,"" Soderbergh's ""Twelve"" was less financially-successful than its predecessor. In deference to this genre's trend, all the bombast, neo-realism and implausibility must necessarily be ratcheted up on successive sequels, thereby we can rest assured that, although Sesame Street may cringe in anguish, ""Thirteen will be the new Zero.""<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"

But to be fair this is what i liked about the movie, its not trying to cover up its huge ensemble cast by giving them bit parts etc, i think each character is given fair screen time, and their persona's are developed further from the first movie, this time around instead of learning about Danny Ocean (clooney) and the way his mind works, we see a lot more from Rusty's (Brad Pitt's) point of view, with even an old flame thrown in for added measure. OK so the storyline is a bit ropey, with holes all overt he place, but what good heist movie isn't a bit far fetched? Again the gang are trying to pull off a major coup in stealing millions, but this time its to pay off their last victim, Benedict (Andy Garcia). There are plenty of laughs throughout, more so then the first one in fact, but there are also a few silly moments that border on ruining the movie.

","2004's ""Ocean's Twelve"" picks up where 2001's ""Ocean's Eleven"" left off. When we last saw them, Danny Ocean and his hand-picked gang of professional thieves had successfully heisted multi-million dollar fortunes from three Las Vegas casinos, then headed their separate ways to start life anew as upstanding members of their respective communities. However, they've since learned that the past has a way of catching up with a person no matter how much he may try to hide from it, when Tony Benedict, the Bellagio owner, still stewing over the money that was stolen from him three years earlier, shows up on Ocean's doorstep demanding restitution. He gives Ocean and his gang two weeks to come up with the $97 million they owe him or face the consequences. Thus, Danny gathers up the gang once again and heads off to Europe, hoping to lift a few priceless art pieces to stave off certain death (though it's never made entirely clear just how Benedict is proposing to carry out this rather grandiose threat). What Danny doesn't count on is that he will be going up against two worthy adversaries - one a detective and the other a rival thief - who will give him more trouble than he ever bargained for.<br/><br/>""Ocean's Twelve"" is a disappointment for a whole host of reasons, most of them rooted in the format and structure of the film. For this second outing, writer George Nolfi and returning director Steven Soderbergh have come up with a ha'penny storyline that lacks the intricacy and elegance of the tale in ""Ocean's Eleven."" Not only does this caper seem haphazardly planned from beginning to end, but the resolution of it falls miserably flat, providing neither the amazement nor the amusement we expect to find in these kinds of stories. Perhaps the idea of stealing a priceless Faberge Egg just doesn't rank up there in either chutzpah or style with knocking over a whole Las Vegas casino, and so the enterprise is more or less doomed to failure from the start. Or perhaps the filmmakers simply failed to find enough for all these characters to do while they're roaming the streets of Amsterdam, Paris and Rome on what appears to be little more than an extended European vacation for some talented but woefully underused actors. Moreover, there is a side foray involving Julia Roberts trying to pass herself off as Julia Roberts that is inane, incredible, preposterous and embarrassing. The sequence is indicative of the lazy, half-hearted approach the filmmakers have taken towards both their material and their audience.<br/><br/>It's also unpleasant watching the one character with even a smidgen of a moral code crossing over to the dark side at the end of the story - and asking us to get all misty-eyed and choked-up when it happens (at least when Anakin does it, we aren't expected to cheer him on from the sidelines).<br/><br/>The high-priced, big-name actors - George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon and Albert Finney - go through the motions, but they seem hopelessly cut adrift by the meandering, substandard screenplay. Actually, only Catherine Zeta-Jones, as the detective and former girlfriend of Brad Pitt, is given anything of genuine substance to work with here. All the rest are just picking up paychecks.<br/><br/>In this type of film, plotting is everything, and the sad truth is that the plotting in ""Ocean's Twelve"" is pretty damn awful any way you slice it. We've already had it sliced 11 and 12 ways with noticeably diminishing results; do they dare go for unlucky 13?"

But Mr. Soderbergh has decided to make it so screenwriters were forced to find a way for Ocean Twelve, way stupid and unnatural. Now, the reason to unite Ocean's team again three years after Las-Vegas is Mr. Benedict who seeks the revenge. He has lost no money because of insurance but anyway he wants his money back as compensation from Ocean's team so they need to come back to action.

I mean you get the sense of the plot and the characters, the story is there somewhere, but what you mostly see is battering between the characters/actors filmed in all sorts of funny angles.

Good premise I like that. There are some funny parts in the first few minutes or so but mostly it's Clooney acting like he knows what he is doing but unfortunately he doesn't. There is no script apparently and the acting is atrocious. I guess they think since they are some of the most well known actors in Hollywood they don't have to work at it anymore they can just show up put in the hours and go home. Wrong.

However, this film was always going to be another way for Hollywood to make money, as is the same with Italian Job. It had nice plot twists through the story to keep you guessing but lacked the depth in the script. I don't know whether I liked the scene with Bruce Willis or not, was it too unrealistic and corny, maybe. For me it didn't quite have the same rhythm as Oceans Eleven where the story was fresh. The movie seemed to have been done because the actors wanted it to happen, even though their wasn't a good enough plot to entertain the viewer. The film seemed to have focused a lot on the same three characters throughout the movie, Clooney, Damon and Pitt. I didn't see much of Garcia, Roberts, Cheadle or Bernie Mac who are very entertaining actors who if were in involved more could of spiced the movie up.

","Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his bad of idiosyncratic thieves are tracked down, one by one, by casino owner Terry Benedict, from whom the Eleven stole $160,000,000. Benedict wants his money back - plus interest - or else. In this milder, innocuous sequel to the 2001 film (itself a remake of the 1960 film), the Eleven-Plus-One must pull off three major robberies in Europe to satisfy Benedict.<br/><br/>It's an intriguing premise, and yet for some reason I thought the idea was that they were going to perform all three capers at the same time, which would have been a neat feat to watch, what with the gang having only eleven members. But alas and alack, that's not how it shook down. What we do get are three separate robbery attempts, each running into greater difficulty than the previous. Kind of like the logistics of getting a whole mess o' Big Stars to rearrange their schedules so they could work on this floppy film at cut-rate prices.<br/><br/>Danny and his boys have their work cut out for them, because they also have a rival - the Night Fox, a wealthy man-about-town who effortlessly steals, steals, steals. Seems he's the best there is, ever was, ever will be, or something like that. And he's one step ahead of Ocean all the time. Don't you just hate people like that? Meanwhile, Linus (Matt Damon) wants a larger role in the planning of heists and such, perhaps as a sidekick/apprentice to Danny and Rusty (Brad Pitt). Why director Steven Soderbergh thought Linus needed more screen time is beyond me; the whole secondary plot of the misfit Linus trying to assert himself seemed a bit out of place - and quite a bit of a stretch for Movie Star Matt Damon.<br/><br/>Which kind of brings me to another slightly annoying aspect of the movie - all the Movie Stars. Sure, I know they all took way-smaller salaries to work on this film, and bravo to them. But you could never get away from the fact that this was a star-studded affair, something a little above Battle of the Network Stars but not quite as good as, say, Chicago. Pitt and Clooney usurp most of the screen time anyway, although Damon and Julia Roberts are a close second. Luckily, there are plenty of other familiar faces: Elliot Gould, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck ... Oh, and did I mention Catherine Zeta-Jones? She's an intrepid Interpol agent who shares a past with Rusty, and she's hot on the trail of the Ocean Gang. Unfortunately, she's a bit underused, although a late subplot about her works fine, although it seems shoehorned in.<br/><br/>The plot gets a little complicated at times, and you might well ask yourself, ""Where are they now? Why are they doing that?"" and so forth. I liked the intricacies of the plot of the 2001 film, but for some reason this script left me a little cold. Complex is fine, but the plot still needs to draw you in, and it just didn't do so this time around.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie kind of dragged a bit for me, but I'm glad I stuck with it. In the second half, there are a couple of excellent cameos - both surprises to me - and some clever twists indeed. The action in the latter half of the movie did make up for the torpidity (look it up!) of the first half. Kudos to George Nolfi's script, albeit somewhat grudgingly.<br/><br/>The acting isn't bad at all; in fact, the players all seem to be enjoying themselves immensely, which is kind of what all-star movies are all about."

","""Ocean's Eleven"" was one of the best made ""caper"" films to be made in the past twenty-five years (my opinion). It was smartly made, with an interesting, handsome and talented group of actors. A wonderful script, updated by Ted Griffin. Steve Soderbergh kept the action and story tight, and gave the film a first class ""look"".<br/><br/>It went on to garner much critical and commercial success, and provided a hit vehicle for Brad Pitt and Matt Damon, that neither one had had in the previous few years. Talk of a sequel was guaranteed. Anticipation was high, for this surely seemed to be a franchise that could be tapped every couple of years.<br/><br/>Sorry to say that ""Ocean's Twelve"" is somewhat of a mess, and too much of a disappointment. The problem is with the difficult to follow screenplay by George Nolfi. I don't mind jumping back and forth in time to tell a story, but there are too many holes in the story that ask you to wait until the end of the movie for resolution. The problem with having so many holes in the story, is that it makes you realize how flimsy the screenplay as a whole is.<br/><br/>While it's good to see everybody back in this film, there seems to be less chemistry amongst the leads. Clooney and Pitt do not have any interesting scenes with each other here that makes you believe their characters are still friends., which was one of the things in the first film that made them so endearing. Garcia is largely wasted in what is little more than a cameo role. Roberts, who was pregnant at the time the film was made, has little to do, and the rest of the cast is wasted. The only one who comes off well is Zeta-Jones, who is absolutely beautiful.<br/><br/>There are some moments in the film that seem to be there only to let the cast and Sonderbergh show how much fun they had on their little vacation in Europe. An idiotic plot device that centers around Robert's real-life celebrity doesn't work, nor does an appearance by Bruce Willis. There are also an endless number of individual shots of each member of the gang. Oh look, here they are all walking out, one by one, of a building. Here they are, one by one, getting caught. And here they are again, one by one looking at each other. Not very interesting. And lastly, too much of the movie is explained after the fact. One of the best parts of the first film was to see how the caper went down as it happened. Here, it's all presented as a follow-up to the events. Not good.<br/><br/>""Ocean's Twelve"" is in the end, a bitter disappointment. I wish I hadn't seen it and could just have preserved the memory of the first film in my mind."

The criminals work out a plan to repay the money but things begin to go awry when a former girlfriend and detective picks up on their trail (Catherine Zeta-Jones). A challenge is made by the Night Fox in which he will pay the price on their heads if they can steal a priceless egg. It's sort of a ""whoever is the best thief wins"" type of thing.<br/><br/>While this is an entertaining enough story, its contents are jumbled together straight from the opening. There is no clear succession in the film's plot and with so many characters, it jumps around quite often. It also feels like many pieces are missing and makes the viewer feel that either the film is lacking in discussion or that the audience consists of a bunch of dolts. Other aspects don't make any sense at all even from a Hollywood perspective (unless of course this was some dry satire). You'll be asking yourself plenty of questions as to the possibility of the ending, which to save you some breath and frustration, I will tell you that is next to impossible and furthermore isn't worth spinning your wheels on. I can understand why the behind-the-scenes interviews all came back with the cast saying they had an incredibly fun time making this film. I just wish the audience could say the same thing regarding watching it. 4/10"

","One word - confusing. The movie starts completely from the end of the last movie, Oceans Eleven. If you haven't watched Eleven, you will not understand what happens at all during Twelve. And even if you did, it wouldn't make much sense anyway. I watched this movie with 5 of my friends, none of them really understood the plot of the movie. The actors and actresses however were quite good. Among George Clooney & Julia Roberts. Personally I didn't like this movie.

","So i finally decided to see ""Ocean's Twelve"". And i must say that it was above expectation. I feel the movie has been rather unfairly treated in the media, at least here in Sweden. But then again i never considered ""Ocean's Eleven"" to be a masterpiece either so perhaps it has mostly to do with expectation.<br/><br/>""Ocean's Eleven"" was an entertaining movie no doubt. But the whole almost legendary status that it's gotten is pretty much beyond me. Sure it had loads of good actors, a fun sense of humor and was pretty nice all around. It was good entertainment for the moment, and in that respect it was among the best of it's genre. But a masterpiece? Not really.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is also why i can accept ""Ocean's Twelve"" more easily than many other people. The actors are still there, the style of the movie is pretty much the same and the comedy is also same brand as in the first movie. What is somewhat lacking here might be good ideas. It seems like in the first movie they knew exactly what kind of movie they wanted to make, they had a decent idea that (while being very far from original) worked. Also they had a plan when it came to using all the obvious talent in the cast to best effect. Here that plan seems to be missing. Also the movie has a problem with pacing, the first half is rather slow and it's not until the second half that the pace is picked up properly.<br/><br/>Heist-movies pretty much follow a very strict formula and the ""Ocean's""-movies are no different. Cool people stealing things in a ridiculously complicated way. Added to all the famous names from the first movie is also french actor Vincent Cassel who is always a colorful addition to any movie he stars in. Despite his french antagonist, and despite the obvious attempts to leave the heist-formula a little bit, this movies greatest problem is still that we've seen it all done before.<br/><br/>In short this is not a movie to remember, but i found it decent entertainment while it lasted. ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a better movie, but not by as much as people seem to think. I rate this 6/10."

","First of all, no, I'm not a film snob, and yes, I liked the first one. I love Traffic, I love Out of Sight. This is easily the worst Soderbergh movie ever. Worst Clooney movie ever. Yes, I've seen Return of the Killer Tomatoes. It's worse than Meet Joe Black. Mary Reilly. Volcano. Charlie's Angels 2. Eurotrip. Do you see what I'm getting at?<br/><br/>Before I get flamed on this website for being ""too serious"" or ""looking too deep"", let me point out what's wrong with this movie:<br/><br/>It's not funny. It's not exciting. It's not romantic. It's not clever. It's paced slower than molasses. I love Solaris, and that's a Michael Bay movie compared to this thing. It runs on 30 minutes too long. Even the premise of this movie is awful. The bad guy from the first movie wants his money back with interest so everyone agrees to steal again to pay him back?? What?? That's the plot of your movie? In related news, I hear they're going to make another Star Wars sequel where the Empire wants reparations for the damage done to the Death Star, so Han Solo throws up his hands and is like ""well, alright, just gimme a week or two"". That's a joke, by the way.<br/><br/>Yes, all of Ocean's 11 are back, but they are given literally nothing to do. It's actually a lot like American Pie 2, where the ads are like ""everyone's back!"" and then maybe 3 of the 12 people actually do anything. <br/><br/>Seriously, no spoilers here, but ask yourself at the end why did anyone even bother to appear, other than to fulfill their contract. How many of the 12 were actually involved in the heist? Entire scenes pass where key characters are missing, with no explanation. It doesn't appear the cast is in the same room with each other, and old-fashioned editing is used to make it seem like they are. Check out the scene on the ship when someone yells something to the camera. Cut to Bernie Mac, standing all by himself, nodding to the camera, as if he's having a conversation and not showing up on the set a month after the other actors have left.<br/><br/>Anything good to say about this movie? The acting's pretty good. Vincent Cassel is great as always, and will probably get lots of work in the U.S. now. (Unfortunately, probably picking up bad-guy roles Lambert ""Merovingian"" Wilson turns down) Julia Roberts is fantastic in a scene with a surprise actor. (I won't spoil it here). The scene with Matt Damon and Robbie Coltrane is amusing, but mainly b/c the joke is so old and creaky I couldn't believe this passes for humor in a big-budget movie in 2004. (You accidentally said something that translates to an insult about a relative!! That never happens in movies!!)<br/><br/>I saw this in a packed theater. I doubt everyone in the audience was an avant-garde film snob. But people were restless. People were groaning by about the 5th hour of this monstrosity. People were sleeping, for Pete's sake. I started to wonder who exactly ""Pete"" was, when i should have been paying attention to the movie.<br/><br/>I like most movies, I see. I'm not hard to please. So you know this movie's bad when I say it's the worst movie of 2004. Yes, I've seen Garfield. I've seen The Village. I've seen Fat Albert. I've seen Taxi. I'd rather watch any of those films than sit through this again."

","Really badly edited movie. Scenes looked stuck together at random. Plot was so intricate that it stopped making sense and arrgghhh!!.

Specially cashing in on the personalities of Pitt and Clooney, who try to breath some life into their lackluster roles but .... Pitt ended up looking like a dressed up mannequin in the movie or a male prostitute It was really annoying to have some shots repeated 11 times to show all the 11 cast members (specially the prison scenes). A group shot of all of them being for example arrested would suffice but the director made us watch each and every one being led in separate shots by the cops!! Ocean 11 was a slick movie and somehow seemed to pay justice to having 11 leads. But this movie just makes a sham of it.

","Ocean's Twelve is an unnecessary sequel to the terrific Ocean's 11. What we have here are big movie stars getting paid a lot of money to service a script that is neither coherent or interesting. Did anybody think that these actors needed a script to work with? I guess the movie is about Andy Garcia wanting his money back that was stolen in the first movie and hunts down all 11 of the thieves to demand it back. I knew immediately this movie was in trouble when the setup took too long. Does he really need to visit all 11 to get his point across? So, they reunite and try to do new jobs in Europe. Along the way, they are chased by cop Catherine Zeta Jones. Well, enough about the plot.

","How can the director of 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape', 'Erin Brockovich' and 'Traffic' do such a bad film? I was no fan of 'Ocean's Eleven' either, but 'Twelve' is by far worse. The film belongs to the genre of big burglary movies, but there is no credible or interesting story to follow or tell about. It's just a pretext to gather the most impressive list of stars in a major movie in the last year, and put a failure in the biography of each of them. The problem is that the story line is so broken and so confuse, that I simply did not understand the end, and worse than it - I did not even care. The brightest idea of the script is a cameo in cameo trick - you will find out when time has come, but it's too little for a genre that asks for creativity and humor. Some of the stars on the screen do their best, each is certainly flattered to share the screen with the other, but this is one of these movies where the stars simply cannot save the day. What a gathering of talent, and what a less than mediocre result. 5 out of 10 on my personal scale."

","I really enjoyed seeing Ocean's Eleven and was excited to see Ocean's Twelve (especially since the jewelry store scene was shot across the street from my mom's office), but I was VERY disappointed.

Very Anti-climactic and not sure how they figure it's the ""biggest heist"" since it was a hoax-heist to begin with. They just got on a train and had it handed to them. Anyways...

Suffers from phoned in performances by a cast looking for a paycheck, ala lethal weapons 3&4. suffers from poor pacing, very slow and boring in parts, which leads to the idea of poor editing. important to point out is that you cannot really become invested in any way because the ""aw-shucks"" attitude of the whole things leaves out the idea that there is any real peril. you don't really care what happens because you know that they are supposed to win at the end and they do. its all very Mighty Ducks if you ask me. and the contrived ending.

","If Steven Soderbergh is such a great talent, then why am I so underwhelmed by his films? Why, when he attempts to make a meaningful picture, do I sense that he is being insincere, at times even patronizing? And why, when he tries to make some funky, larky piece of genre-tribute fluff, do I find myself slipping slowly into indifference? <br/><br/>Ocean's Twelve is Soderbergh's latest homage to the hoary Hollywood Heist genre, and it is less entertaining than Ocean's Eleven. It's not that it doesn't have amusing elements, little dashes of humor, some clever styling - it's just that none of it seems to amount to anything. The film seems to have been made in a playful, throw-away spirit, as if no one took any of it, or themselves, very seriously. This is fine by itself - certainly there have been good films made in a mood of giddy fellowship - but for a director like Soderbergh, whose movies are kind of slight anyway, this lack-of-concentration is death.<br/><br/>It doesn't help when your stars are a little short in the electricity department to begin with. Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Matt Damon all have the virtue of prettiness, but none of them is Mr. Personality 2005. Clooney seems like the template for a leading-man, yet like Rock Hudson before him, there's a nagging sense of the generic about him. Pitt has seemed like little more than a walking cologne-ad for a long time, and does nothing here to dispel this impression; and Damon can muster little beyond that vague nice-guy quality he tries to pass off as star-power. The supporting male performers all seem more promising, but for Soderbergh to concentrate on any of them would mean taking screen-time away from his big three, and that of course would never do.<br/><br/>You would hope for an infusion of charm and sex-appeal from the female principals, but alas none is forthcoming. Catherine Zeta-Jones has some intensity as a feisty, brainy Europol agent, but she's not filmed very flatteringly and her sexual rapport with Pitt never materializes. And speaking of not being filmed flatteringly, there's Julia Roberts, who should sue the cinematographer for what he does to her face. She was probably never more charming and attractive than in Erin Brockovich, so you know Soderbergh has some idea what he's doing with her, but here he makes her frankly ugly, and gets nothing out of her jokey scenes later in the film.<br/><br/>A movie like this should intrigue us with its plot, but the plot is so convoluted that you can only see it as a put-on. That being the case, it's up to the stars and director to entertain us with style, wit and sexiness, but each is spread so thin across the movie that we barely notice. Soderbergh's brain is obviously engaged, but he seems to have a hard time getting his heart into what he's doing. His movies have had a cold, impersonal quality ever since sex, lies and videotape, which made a virtue of cold impersonality. This same quality is not a virtue in Ocean's Twelve, which needs a fire lit under it. The movie definitely doesn't cook - hell, it barely simmers."

Why this scene was written, shot and included in the film is perplexing and undermines the entire film, if they shot this sequence and watched it themselves for some laughs I could understand. The rest of the film isn't too bad but it's not at the same level as the first and large paychecks must have gotten all the cast back.

The fact that the piles supporting the Amsterdam house inhabited by the Jeroen Krabbe character were standing IN WATER was totally ludicrous. What the *** were they thinking? Do these nut cases genuinely believe that Amsterdam is some sort of raft on poles built on a lake or something? For crying out loud!

An anonymous call tips him off about the identity of Ocean's 11, and he pays them a visit and gives them 2 weeks to pay him back.....<br/><br/>Danny Ocean feels he needs some time off, so they decide to goto Amsterdam, since they were well known in the Us, to pull off any major heist....<br/><br/>Amsterdam incidentally is, the place where Rusty's ex girl friend, an ex-cop stays.... They do a starting job, which they feel would pay them off a little bit and buy them some time, but when they open the vault they find their object of interest already stolen and a tape stating, the fact that the night fox has been before them........<br/><br/>Meanwhile Ocean's 12, had been visited by Rusty's ex, and they are furious about it.... Anyways they meet up with Nightfox, and they find out that he had given the tip to Benedict, since his master made a mistake to judge them as the best thieves in the world.... His master incidentally was the legendary, Van Der Woude, so the only way to make sure who is the best, is to loot a common object.....<br/><br/>Next the movie rolls on, and apparently it seems that everything has gone wrong as Ocean's 12 fail to make the deadline for the job....<br/><br/>But, apparently all is not what it seems, as, it appears the Nightfox got the replica, and Ocean's troupe of men got the real thing.......<br/><br/>The drawback of this movie is the lack of a proper high tech heist, true Nightfox did good, but we want to see Ocean's 12 do the job right.... Also, the story seemed to drawn and laid off, it lacked a proper solidity and was pretty translucent..... The music was good, and so was the dialogs making you laugh in short bursts, there is more interaction between, the characters, and now that you know them better.... Linus Caldwell,Matt Damon's character plays a more important role in the movie and he brings about most of the fun..... Julia Roberts' performance is totally appalling, primarily due to the script, where she is made to play as Julia Roberts, imagine that!!! Bruce Willis gives an appearance..... but the most important of all is Catherine Zeta-Jones........<br/><br/>If there was anyone in this movie who you'd be watching for it is her.......

","""Why couldn't they have left well enough alone?"" will be the comment made after you see this sequel to the highly popular and fantastic Oceans 11 (which in itself was a re-make of a classic).<br/><br/>O12 suffers from a plot that tries to incorporate twists to make it more captivating and intelligent but instead makes it feel convoluted and downright dull in places. The biggest letdown is that the final twist becomes patently obvious early on in the movie, thus defeating its intended impact and making O12 end with all the impact of a damp squib.<br/><br/>An overly long feature length does not help matters and one gets the feeling that O12 could have been much more enjoyable had it been clipped down by about 30 minutes or so.<br/><br/>O12 is saved in part by some scenes - notably the one in Rome where a good spoof of Julia Roberts played by none other than Julia Roberts lifts it somewhat - but overall, O12 remains a movie with a plodding pace and one that is a shadow of its brilliant predecessor.<br/><br/>The chemistry among the players still exists but seems to have been swallowed up wholesale by the length of the film such that much of the sparkle and sizzle that is found in Oceans 11 is missing.<br/><br/>The shame is that O12 is a fundamentally good idea that is let down by poor execution. Simply put, it could - and should - have been so much better.<br/><br/>If they are ever planning a sequel to this one (and why wouldn't they, just to rake in more $$$?), it had better be much better put together."

","SPOILERS The original Ratpack was one of the coolest group of men to ever exist. With members like Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jnr, it just oozed class. Then in 2001 perhaps their most famous film was remade with a modern cast. Amazingly though, ""Oceans 11"" was actually pretty damn good as a fun, heist film. The problem comes with Hollywood's tradition of making sequels of successful films. So here, in 2004 we have ""Oceans 12"". Sadly, unlike the first film, this sequel might contain the fun, but it lacks the plot and heist quality which made the first so enjoyable.<br/><br/>Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his friends are in trouble. Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the victim of their last major crime, has found them. Now, with a huge debt to Benedict, Ocean's Eleven has two weeks to commit another amazing task of daring and initiative.<br/><br/>From the offset, this film shows signs of being about friends having a good time. With friends making cameos throughout (most notably Bruce Willis playing himself) we have some of Hollywood's finest hanging out together in a fun environment. Sadly however, this does not necessarily make a good film.<br/><br/>The beautiful thing about the first Oceans film was that whilst the cast obviously enjoyed themselves, there was a brilliant plot and some clever effects to fall back on. In ""Ocean's Twelve"" though, scriptwriter George Nolfi got sloppy. With flashbacks instead of heists, the film cuts down on the excitement, and with obscure plot twists, it makes limited sense.<br/><br/>Another key problem is that during the film, there are some really stomach retching moments. At one point, one star even pretends to be herself. Also, there are some truly abysmal lines.<br/><br/>The problem is though that despite all the major criticisms, there are one or two truly funny lines in the film. For that alone, it deserves more than to be completely condemned. It's not a film worth watching, but it's not the worst film in recent years."

","Directed by: Steven Soderbergh <br/><br/>Starring: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Don Cheadle, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Shaobo Qin, Eddie Jemison, Bernie Mac, Vincent Cassel <br/><br/>Smug. No other word can come to mind when watching Ocean's Twelve, Steven Soderbergh's latest step down the ladder of respectability.<br/><br/>When he brilliantly re-made the 1960 Rat Pack flick Ocean's Eleven for the New Millennium Audience, critics thought he was just taking time off. Yet films like these seem to be his bread and butter these days. Why else would he even contemplate making a sequel? Perhaps he might have been better off not going mainstream after all. Since Out Of Sight, his standard has gradually fallen. (I was one of those not overly impressed by Traffic.) Well, in fairness to him, you could do worse. I can't think of many other directors who could get such a cast together for a popcorn film, and then photograph them so well, before proceeding to waste them. Sure, they might be having fun (perhaps too much fun), but you know they could be doing better. That wasn't really a problem in Ocean's Eleven, because the audience were enjoying themselves too. This time, though, the audience appears to have been left out of the ""fun"", so to speak.<br/><br/>During the opening 20 minutes, Ocean's Twelve looks like it might just be the rarity of a sequel that bests the original. Casino boss Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) is set out on taking revenge against Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his band of eleven after their successful heist in the first film. When Benedict tracks them down, he quickly lays down his orders: pay back what you stole, plus interest, in two weeks.<br/><br/>Sounds like the set-up for a worthwhile sequel, doesn't it? Well, it gets more ambitious. The gang decide to jet off to Europe to find the money, but soon, they become tracked by sexy Europol agent Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones). And this, my friends, is where the heists - and the problems - begin.<br/><br/>Screenwriter George Nolfi tries to impress us with dialogue that isn't really that impressive. The heist subplots twist and turn so much that they aren't worth caring about. A character illogically switches to the good side. Two admittedly innovative scenes nearly come off, but end up feeling self-indulgent.<br/><br/>While all this is going on, the cast (and the director, you sense) seem to be smirking throughout. (The biggest offender of the lot would have to be Vincent Cassel, who makes his supposedly important character irritating.) All in all, it's reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino at his absolute worst. Even David Holmes is in below par form as he produces a rather forgettable score.<br/><br/>In a way, watching Ocean's Twelve is like watching a dozen Jose Mourinhos. But at least that man has a good reason to be pleased with himself.<br/><br/>Rating: ** (out of *****)"

","SPOILERS WITHIN One would have thought that the sequel to a hugely popular and very entertaining heist movie would be, well, another heist movie, with an elaborate scheme that at least attempts to rival the first movie for ingenuity and intrigue. But, unfortunately, they just decided to take a bag of unwanted script pages from other movies, shuffle them, and adjust it to suit the Ocean's Eleven characters. Quite simply, this is the least relevant sequel I have seen for a very long time - even American Pie 3, the Wedding was more warranted than this trite.<br/><br/>In a seemingly extremely unlikely twist of events, Mr Benedict is back and wanting all his money back. So, all the eleven come back together and try to figure out what heist they should do. Sol decides to leave instead. They go to Holland, and find that their heist is done by another master-thief on the same night - the Night Fox is his name. Seems he's got a bit of an ego about Ocean pulling off a better heist at the casinos than he's ever done, and he challenges Ocean's team to what is essentially a heist-off - both teams will try to steal the French Coronation Egg.<br/><br/>This is where the movie gets even worse. Practically everyone gets arrested, leaving only a handful. They call on Tess to help in their heist, and perhaps in a desperate attempt to force me to leave in disgust, they have her disguised as Julia Roberts. But, she and everyone else gets arrested too. So, with Ocean's Twelve all in a European prison, how are they going to escape? Easy! Linus' Mum disguises herself as a European prison officer. The Night Fox shows off the Coronation Egg which he managed to steal from within a room of randomly moving lasers - which we saw in a minute-and-a-half display of impossibly fortunate gymnastics - to Ocean, who then reveals that he stole a replica, and that he stole the real one. What was the elaborate heist scheme used to capture the priceless artefact? A two-minute switcheroo of bags on a train. Getting the picture? Throw in an illogical, predictable, and largely unrelated story arc with Zeta Jones' character, and it's done.<br/><br/>There were positives. Zeta Jones' performance was, as usual, pretty damn good, with a character who was enchanting, despite the complete lack of impact she had on the story. The original, shorter heist, where the Night Fox got there first, also recaptured some of the good work from the first movie. But I can't fathom what they were trying to get out of the rest of the movie - the characters' original witty charm was replaced with the occasional unfunny wisecrack. The first movie attracted a large number of fans through its charming characterisation and elaborate story, and since there was essentially none of that in Ocean's Twelve, it was simply baffling that this film was even made - from an artistic standpoint. From a marketing standpoint, it was perfect - use the popularity of the first movie to sell the second without having to make any effort at all. It worked on me, didn't it?<br/><br/>4/10"

","At first glance oceans twelve would seem the perfect sequel. The cast are fantastic(and so too is there paycheck, i would imagine), it takes place in Europe and is directed by Stephen Sodernburg(excuse the spelling)who directed the first. However when you actually watch this mess you're perception deteriorates rapidly. The problem is that it is too clever for it's own good. Everything seems to slip into place perfectly and they seem to have an expert for every problem that they face along the way: A holographic egg, the control panel sliding down the perfectively placed zip wire, lifting a whole house etc. The first film was perfect, balancing perfectly, the technical stuff and the way that oceans eleven work with each other, whereas the sequel is to reliant on technical substance over major plot flaws. There is a nice turn in the form of Julia Roberts playing Tess pretending to be Julia Roberts(keep up!) and a couple of good cameos from Bruce Willis and Albert Finney, but Don Cheadle's English accent is just excruciating , playing on British Stereotypes rather than being truthful. Clever though this film is I still don't understand why they spent loads of money on technical gizmos and staying in hotels when they had the egg six days before the deadline or why they put the Chinese guy in the Arsenal bag, when the police weren't even looking for him! I would recommend this film if you are a die hard fan of the first film or are extremely bored, but as a great film, don't even think about wasting six quid for a ticket!"

","So you know Danny and the boys are going to win out in the end and well in to the film they don't seem to be doing well. This is run of the mill stuff so far but the potential saviour is that you are racking your brains trying to work out how they are going to do it. Just like you knew you would have worked out 'The Usual Suspects' before the end if only your mate hadn't given it away in the pub beforehand. Sure there were some clues to the eventual outcome but it is so simple and lacking in any skill and guile (unlike the first film) that the viewer feels leaving completely short changed. Without a genuine twist this film is left with a few decent one liners and some neat acting from Pitt. What did I expect from a sequel, originality?"

","I had low expectations of this film and it didn't exceed them. It has a nice roll call of talent - Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and the award winning director Steven Soderbergh all turning up - and lining up - to churn out a movie with as much pizzaz as a millionaire buying a new car cos the ashtrays in the old one were full.<br/><br/>The story  for want of a poorer word  follows the heist team of Oceans 11 as they try to outwit fellow thieves (and the efforts of international detectives) pulling off unbelievably difficult and lucrative robberies. It teems with one-liners that are meant to be amusing and aren't, actors who look like they are reprising cameos from earlier  and better  movies, and a story that would be interesting if it wasn't so silly, and directed so unconvincingly.<br/><br/>Director Steven Soderbergh has come a long way since such indie bursts of creativity such as Sex, Lies, and Videotape, the tongue in cheek charm of Out of Sight (which is in a similar vein to Oceans 12, but with the exception that it is a Good Film), or the powerful social statements of Erin Brockovich and Traffic. Here, it seems, he wants to rake in some cash without doing much work  nothing wrong with that if you can get away with it, but don't expect film fans to thank you Mr Soderbergh.<br/><br/>On a positive side, there's a few nice locations around Europe even if they are underused, and the lighting and print quality was excellent. References to other movies are perhaps intentional rather than merely derivative, but they are probably more entertaining to those working on the film than the audience.<br/><br/>In the interests of space, I will only suggest two reasons to avoid going to see this film. One is that it is not worth seeing. The other is to convince people with talent and money that being superstars and knowing how to work a camera is not a license to insult the film-going public. Sadly this film has already recouped its $100,000,000+ investment, due no doubt to a considerable sum being spent on advertising and cashing in on names. But for those who like any excuse to see their movie heroes, maybe you will find it pleasant to watch."

What happened to the other characters? This movie focuses mainly on the big dogs, like Danny, Tess, Rusty, and Basher. Don't get me wrong, they were great characters in the first film, but one of Ocean's Elevens most beautiful elements was the teamwork. Ocean's crew is funnier, smarter, and all out better when everyone gets involved more.<br/><br/>2. Not as professional and smooth. In Ocean's 11, just about everything went exactly as planned. That was another beautiful element. They knew what they wanted, who they were hitting, and how they were gonna do it. This one was just a lot of ""go with the flow"".<br/><br/>3. Where are the clues? In Ocean's 11 you could figure out the twists if you were smart enough before they happened because they threw in little things that you thought were just pointless sideshows when they turned out to be the most important elements of the score.

","We all know how sequels in Hollywood usually go, but I had high hopes for another Soderbergh-directed outing of George Clooney et al in Ocean's Twelve. It was shot in the same documentary style, but gone is the clever plot of the original in favour of dialogue and in-jokes. The central heist is not clever when compared to the original's, while most plot surprises fell flat. An attempt to revive the 1960s with fashion and simple typography failed to impressit lacked the polish of that era. Catherine Zeta-Jones was a saving grace, for her acting ability and seemingly more screen presence than the returning actors, and it was a pity we saw Carl Reiner so little, given he did give the team more gravitas. It gets some marks for the presence of major actors in minor rolesBruce Willis, Robbie Coltrane and Jeroen Krabbé (with no lines) among themand the audience I was with certainly enjoyed the film's main in-joke, but otherwise this was a plot less movie. Wasted potential."

Great. The audience braces itself for what is clearly going to be a revenge story. And they know who the heroes are, so they wonder how, this time, Ocean's 11 (or 12, whatever) are going to outsmart the villain. And they wait for the big fight to take place. And wait. But Andy Garcia seems to have vanished in the ozone. Folks, want me to tell you what the big surprise is? THERE'S NONE! Yep, you read right. Incredibly enough, Ocean's 11 proceed as said.

","The following quote from Nick's Flick Picks' review of Ocean's Twelve refers to the final scene (NO spoilers), but I think it applies to the whole movie:<br/><br/>""I literally can't tell you whether the last sequence in the movie is supposed to be part of the storyline or if it's footage from the wrap party; in either case, I can only report that we aren't really invited.""<br/><br/>This whole movie was a testament to how full of itself much of Hollywood is. One scene involving a pregnant Julia Roberts and a certain prominent cameo (people who have seen it will know what I mean) underscores this. Has there ever been a more star-driven film?<br/><br/>The average movie-goer should be able to follow what's happening in a good caper, or at least be satisfied when ""how it went down"" is explained at the end. I wasn't. This movie does such a good job of trying to lose its viewers that some may never catch up. <br/><br/>The whole film was somewhat like watching from the sidewalk as Hollywood stars go into an exclusive party. You get to see the your favorite actors and actresses, but you're not invited to the party. <br/><br/>Not to make this political (the film certainly wasn't), but given Hollywood's reputation for elitist, outspoken advocacy of losing presidential candidates of late, this kind of self-importance wasn't timed very well. They're just proving the rumors true."

","Perhaps my expectations were too high. Oceans 11 was a delightful surprise for me when it came out and when the previews of the sequel were showing in cinemas, the excitement inside me started to boil. With all the cast returning and some additional names signing on, I thought it would be at the very least, another delightful heist caper. However, I was sorely disappointed in the end. I think the problem for me was that all the ""mishaps"" and ""twists"" in Oceans 12 made Oceans 11 look like a fluke. I know that this was intentional but the tightness of the plot in Oceans 11 was clearly better scripted than this one. There was potential for a really dynamic and explosive sequel and instead it was merely celebrity eye candy with what I felt was a flat and unsatisfying ending. Still that's what makes a sequel so difficult to do, to top the first one is always a challenge in itself and Oceans 12 falls well short. It still gave me chuckles and Brad Pitt is much funnier than I thought he could ever be but a slick twisty heist film this is not."

","I highly anticipated this movie, especially since I enjoyed Oceans 11 quite a bit. In order to make this a two hour movie, unnecessary scenes were included that were five minutes in length. Also, the plot was very complicated to follow. I really cannot compare this movie to Oceans 11, because it's not the same style, and it's not based in the same country. I felt that the story was extremely complicated, and anyone who wanted to simply watch the movie cannot follow it. I didn't even want to try and make sense out of it once I finished the movie. I often found myself looking at my watch on many scenes, wondering when they would move along. This movie wasn't what I expected, and I doubt that it will be what you expected too.<br/><br/>NOTE: BELOW CONTAINS SPOILERS, WHICH COULD RUIN THE MOVIE.<br/><br/>Parts of this movie were not needed, such as the long ""Laser"" scene which lasted about five minutes.

","Its just opened here in Australia. Here are my thoughts.<br/><br/>1. Not a bad caper movie, and although the first was excellent, a sequel was not really necessary or asked for by audiences. <br/><br/>2. Julia Roberts is in the first 2 minutes of the film, then shows up for the last 10 minutes or so. She really is just thrown in there to add to box office & pick up a big paycheck for very little work. Did anyone else think she looked very skinny and unattractive in much of her scenes? She has definitely lost a lot of Hollywood clout i feel. The whole storyline of her playing *******SPOILERS**************<br/><br/>Julia Roberts! was funny at first, but tired quickly, and the whole Bruce Willis thing seemed to drag out. <br/><br/>3. The storyline in general was very weak, and many of the jokes fell flat and just were not funny. I think they loved hanging out, George wanted to have parties in his waterfront mansion in italy, so it seemed like a good idea to film in europe, all cast hang out cause they are best mates, then make a fortune on a poorly thought out script & story.<br/><br/>4.Bernie Mac was completely wasted. Why is Hollywood putting a great comedian in such a minimal role & non-funny scenes such as this (and mr 3000). listen up movie exec's BERNIE MAC IS A COMEDIAN - let him shine & do what he does best - WHICH IS MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH !<br/><br/>5. The bad guy wasn't really ""bad"" and the whole heist caper was about ego's about whose the best thief. You NEVER felt they actually felt like they were scared or were worried about Andy Garcia's threats.<br/><br/>6. Hadn't we already seen someone Dance through the laser lights in slow motion? Oh yeah, it was CATHERINE ZETA JONES in Entrapment !<br/><br/>7. Definitely one of Soderbergh's weakest film. Anyone agree?<br/><br/>There were some great things about the movie though<br/><br/>1. The Cast 2. The locations 3. The comedy that did work ( which was mostly unwritten & unsaid)..more like reactions to scenes & impressions etc.<br/><br/>4. Catherine Zeta- jones. Damn she looks great & beautiful. She DESERVED the main female billing. Out acting & out starring Roberts.<br/><br/>5. Some of the action 6. Matt Damon was great 7.

","This had more vitality and stars than the first. But ended up being lower than it.<br/><br/>First off, the script. Oh that script. It suffers from too many characters, exhausting twists, and incredible silliness. It even whines about a daughter and her lost father, a loving wife and her thief husband who she forgives lately for no apparent reasons, while there is no characterization or whatsoever form the start! The irony of having (Pitt, Zeta-Jones, Clooney, Roberts, Garcia, Damon, Willis, Mac, Cheadle, Coltrane, Gould, and Finney) with this script kills me. Most of them have no necessity at all. For instance; what Gould did do else talking about defecation?, what Cheadle did do else moving around the minim replica?, what Mac did do else being in jail for all the time?!!, and so on and on. Aside from a certain sense of bore, it created also such a frustration that made us really feel ""HOW WASTED!"".<br/><br/>It leaves you with numerous questions; who was that wealthy American, the faceless one in the flashback on the yacht, that wanted the gang to be stopped? Why Finney, as the greatest thief, agreed with his pupil (Nightfox), then double-crossed him later? If Ocean's 11 robbed the egg earlier, why they went to pull off the 3D trick with the fake Julia Roberts plan? (brilliant way to mark them ALL TOGETHER in the police files!), and if that was done for going to jail with Clooney, so Demon's mom gets them out, then why bother yourself using that strange plan B?, just send that mom to get him out! And if Ocean's 11 went to rob (Nightfox)'s palace while they don't know about his hidden cameras, then they're stupid.. exactly like this movie! Obviously, that was for the sake of twists that assume being ""smart"" or ""smarter than you dear viewer"", while they're wholly not. As you see, it moves from the relaxing ""don't think"", to the shameful ""brainless"", to the insulting ""you're brainless""!<br/><br/>I hate the movie makers' confidence that they can make dumb errors and lazy points and get away with it in the name of coolness, post-modernism, whatever. Can anybody tell me why Mac's character was in jail for? Or what did Zeta-Jones's character say to Coltrane's in the interrogation room to break him?<br/><br/>Speaking about that nasty confidence, the dialogue is SO PAINFUL. They thought when very unfunny lines are being said by cool stars then they would be funny. Well, that's the definition of ridiculousness, which this movie has MUCH of it. Review some with me: ""If you're gonna ask if you can ask me a question, give me time to respond. Unless you're asking rhetorically, in which case the answer is obvious - yes."", ""Doesn't this guy believe in fresh air? / He opens the second floor window every now and then. / What does that mean? / It means he opens the second floor window every now and then."" And the ugliest ""..That guy doing Potsie is unbelievable"". I didn't have that dryness out of the worst sitcoms!<br/><br/>Further, thinking that making fun of fake Julia / real Julia, and useless Bruce Willis, led to terrible sequence. While not finishing the jokes is always bad, the movie so foolishly savors it to the max (the lost catchphrase of the stand up comedian, the talk about Willis's movie scene..). Saw the moment in the bar with Clooney and Pitt laughing a long, so detestable, laugh at something that we don't know! Did they think that when these 2 Hollywood stars do it, then we must laugh as well??!!<br/><br/>I knew later that George Nolfi, one of the main writers here, wrote a never made John Woo movie named ""Honor Among Thieves"", then Warner Bros. asked him to *adjust* it for the Ocean's characters. According to what I watched, he made a chock-full messy mix. Remember fine, that guy is the same one who wrote (Timeline - 2003), (The Sentinel - 2006), and (The Bourne Ultimatum - 2007); namely some of the most confident shoddy scripts I have ever seen!<br/><br/>To burn it more, let's talk about the direction. Clooney said in a TV interview that the first Ocean movie was a salute to the 1970s heist movies (Huh?!), and the second one is a salute to the 1960s ones (Double the Huh?!!). Is it because the second was shot in Europe? Actually Steven Soderbergh was more 70s in the second, knowing the weird angles, shooting outdoors, the hand held camera, etc. at any cost, he tried to make the Hollywood stuff yet with different feel, using a flavor from the realistic cinema. However, the outcome is shockingly tasteless. We didn't enjoy the stars through image or basically a good script. And it isn't an enjoyment on the level of being artistic either. I only enjoyed the laser beams dance, with the eastern music of Thé à la Menthe, performed by La Cautionit, as the one thing that could be re-watched.<br/><br/>(Ocean's Twelve) shows a new type of awfulness where endless colors are thrown in sterile vacuum. It alleges being intelligent, funny, cool, and light while it's dumb, unfunny, cold, and heavy. I believe in entertainment it's supposed to make a dazzling illusion, not being full of illusion yourself. This movie is like its (Nightfox); so rich yet with tons of vanity, thinks the job is done, while it's not.<br/><br/>It was produced with $110,000,000, to gain $125,531,634? I think it deserved less!<br/><br/>P.S: When Willis as Willis met Roberts as fake Roberts playing the real Roberts (dizzy!), then asked her about Danny; you have to think was that for breaking the fourth wall (as if Willis ran into the filming of an ""Ocean"" sequel, and asked about Clooney's character), or was Willis a party in the scheme already?? The thing is ""Danny"" is Roberts's husband's name in the movie, and - after little reading - I knew that it's also the nickname of Roberts's husband, Daniel Moder, out of the movie! Anyhow, it was the top of this movie's dullness, and one of the most confusing moments in movie history!"

","Having just rewatched this along with O11 and O13 I decided to throw in another no-go. Such a shame of a movie can not be underrated. <br/><br/>Setting aside unnecessary self-references etc it has one major fault - there is no heist and no story. Instead we get a messy lot of events and circumstances that don't come together, the puzzle pieces never combine into the picture. And in the end we are told it was just another picture! well, we must have been seeing another movie, apparently. I wish I would. <br/><br/>The lovestory between Rusty and Zeta-Jones character looks moderately promising at first but again in the end it just gets twisted stupidely and abruptly, only to hit the most hackneyed cliché you can imagine. Out of the blue, too. <br/><br/>The acting is not bad nor outstanding, with the exception of Matt Damon who has greatly improved since O11 and has in fact the most interesting and funny scenes in the movie, and the brilliant Vincent Cassel who managed to make an enjoyable part out of the rather stupid and contrived character. Too bad it's just wasted in this crap. I was also impressed by the actress playing the small role of Linus' mom (can't recollect her name). But this couldn't help either.<br/><br/>I guess it's too late to say Don't go see it but if you consider renting or buying just don't. It's not worth even pressing play button."

","Ocean's twelve is probably better than Ocean's eleven. I know most people would disagree, But I actually liked it more. After three years, it was good seeing the gang return. The reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around. I see why they stole from Benedict(Andy Garcia) in the last film. This film they have a bit more motivation the second time around. Ocean's twelve is more entertaining, and cooler than Ocean's eleven. With a funny cameo by Topher Grace saying ""I just walked in that new Dennis Quaid movie"" and other things. I think Ocean's Twelve is probably the best in the series.<br/><br/>The Plot: A year or so after Ocean's Twelve, Terry Benedict(the guy they robbed in the last film) is back and says that if Ocean's eleven doesn't pay him back the money they stole, he's going to call the cops. So Danny Ocean and the gang go to Europe, where Rusty meets his old cop girlfriend Isabelle. After she meets him again, she begins to follow them around. Also, the gang learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are.<br/><br/>With many funny scenes like when Tess(Julia Roberts) goes to Europe and pretends to be Julia Roberts, Ocean's Twelve is a pretty clever film. It's cooler, funnier, and more entertaining than Ocean's eleven."

","""Ocean's Eleven"" was an entertaining, high energy film. The sequel, therefore, had everything going for it - good reputation of the previous film, all star cast, beautiful locations throughout Europe and the addition of Catherine Zeta-Jones.<br/><br/>Instead, we got a collection of disjointed scenes, absolutely no pace (a prerequisite for a film of this genre) and a plot that didn't really get off the ground.<br/><br/>Traditionally, you would say that most films introduce the characters, set the premise, and off they go. Ocean's 11 did that quite well. But this film never started cooking. I felt as though the whole cinema was shifting about in their seats.<br/><br/>Scenes lingered for far too long, actors weren't putting energy into their performances and I'm sure that somehow the ""Deleted Scenes"" portion of the DVD was included entirely in the film. Loud, pacey music couldn't even keep the tempo high.<br/><br/>It is disturbing when you're in a film and you start to think about how you're going to rate it on IMDb.com - for me, it hovered between 1 and 3 out of 10.<br/><br/>The wheels really fell off when Tess, played by Julia Roberts, was coerced to fly to Rome to play - wait for it - Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>The concept of the hologram egg just screamed at me, ""We don't have a plot!"" It is acceptable to make allowances in films of this genre, but introducing absolute science fiction SFX bordered on the desperately ridiculous.<br/><br/>The only highlights were the European locations - Rome, Amsterdam, Paris and coastal scenes. Fans of Catherine Zeta-Jones may get some value - she looks pretty, rather than sexy. She too was wasted in this film.<br/><br/>And I couldn't really say who Ocean's 12 were - one would assume Catherine Zeta-Jones, but even this wasn't all that strongly emphasised.<br/><br/>See it on DVD if there's nothing else available at your video library. Better yet, why not track down the original ""Ocean's Eleven"" with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr."

In my opinion, as I am entitled, this movie was brilliantly crafted. And yes, before you get all pissy, I will explain myself. First, however, let me just say that this movie was not the first movie. I am extremely thankful for that. As I was reading the list of filming sites a few weeks ago, I was like man this is gonna suck, but be cool. (Just as the reviews, are now saying). I expected it to be a mirror image of the first in a different setting (europe). However, the fact that this was a completely different movie, with not even the same plot elements as the first, which become cliché to any heist movie, made it all the more great. What situation, could have made this movie good for you, if you weren't going to accept anything to begin with. Finally, the part that really made me enjoy this movie as artistic, and here's the spoiler. The whole deal with Julia Roberts as herself, and the cameo of Bruce Willis. Rather than a ploy to make this movie flashy, this whole matter was actually a brilliant example of ironic foreshadowing. Consider why Julia Roberts played herself? To bring Willis into the picture. And what did Willis do when he was there? He walked around, looked pretty, and talked to people. And what did those people say? Again and again, ""you know I knew what was going to happen as soon as you sat down to dinner, and she didn't talk to you"". This obviously refers to the ironic foreshadowing in the ""Sixth Sense"". The same ironic foreshadowing that was masterly placed in this film. Consider the bag, which contained the egg. The first time you saw it. The second time. The third. The fourth. You know, come to think of it. I knew what the plot twist was, the minute they showed that bag. Ironic, isn't it? Confused? E-mail me at Scottco86@comcast.net. Please no hate."

Remember that 'fox is watching everything that the 11 are doing (hence the quick shot of his video screen before we cut to Damon et al discussing a new plan). Fox has stolen the forgery the night before, and will have time and reason to realize his error unless they push as if they are desperate.<br/><br/>The best inside joke. Ben Snackwell comments on the Oscar to Willis. Damon has not even smelled an Oscar since GWH. Willis has never been close. Damon is complaining that it's been a while since he has been in contention for an Oscar. Willis is basically telling him to take a hike.

","Instead of repeating himself, Soderbergh has taken the unconventional (and very un- Hollywood) route of making a film in which doesn't insult the intelligence and need to spoon- feed the audience. <br/><br/>It's obvious the cast had enjoyed making this film, but the film shows the director and screenwriters had the most fun in creating a combination of heist/James Bond/French New Wave non-linear film that breaks every rule it can. <br/><br/>The plot is cryptic, the feasibility ludicrous, the situations outlandish - but that's the whole point. The cinematography, plot points, titles, soundtrack (!), wardrobe, etc all exude a confidence that is almost completely void in the formula-driven movie industry of today."

I on the other hand thought it was very funny. If you go see the movie make sure you know what you are getting into. This not a purely suspense movie. Its a throw back to the screw ball capers of the 50's and 60's. Its all about having fun and doing things with flare. The plot is very over the top and that's what makes it enjoyable. You have to want to have fun while watching this movie. The actors are having a good time and they take you along for the ride.

"JAKastner","8","2","5","11 December 2004"," The Moose Hole - Review of Ocean's Twelve
","After grossing nearly one-hundred and eighty-five million dollars domestically and well over four-hundred and fifty million dollars world-wide, Warner Brother executives were eager to jump on the bandwagon while the property was still hot and pump out a sequel as quickly, and cheaply, as possible. Steven Soderbergh insisted that the production budget be kept around the same as that of the original film  eight-five million dollars respectively  and asked all his actors, specifically George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts, to take significant pay cuts from their usual twenty-million dollar-per-picture salary. And with the WB studio in a tight market race, currently tied for second place with The Walt Disney Company, they need a hit more then ever, especially if they want to come close to recovering profits lost on the multi-million dollar disaster, Alexander. Perhaps the executives of the studio could learn a thing or two from these con-artists.<br/><br/>The story picks up some time after the original film ended and takes audiences across such glamorous European locations as Amsterdam, Paris and Rome in another crime-capping adventure. It has been three years since Danny Ocean and the rest of the gang of thieves and con artists broke into the 'impenetrable' vault of Terry Benedict's Las Vegas casino and ripped a cool one-hundred and sixty million dollars right under his nose. After splitting the money amongst the eleven members of the Ocean's team, each went their separate ways, with the exception for Danny and Tess of course, and attempted to lie low and live an easy going life with their newly acquired fortune. Unfortunately for them, a fellow con-artist with a grudge against the group breaks Rule Number One by ratting them out to Terry Benedict, thus causing the ruthless casino owner to pay a visit to each and every one of the team members demanding a return of his one-hundred and ninety-eight million dollars  that's the amount of money they stole plus interest over three years  within two weeks. Considering they are too hot to find suitable work in the United States after their last stunt, they travel to Europe to steal an antique item only to run into complications with their criminal rival, 'The Night Fox', who just happened to be the man who broke Rule Number One. On top of that, the gang has to deal with Isabel Lahiri, an intrepid female Europol agent with extensive links with Rusty Ryan, who is vividly determined to catch them in the act. When it comes to the story treatment for Ocean's Twelve, one must learn not to take these sorts of genres, specifically the caper-comedy, seriously. They are for mere entertainment purposes only and not to be destined, or taken as such, for Oscar-caliber quality or serious thought. On another note, the script is not as original as it may seem. In fact, it was originally designed as John Woo action-flick vehicle but when it came to developing the highly-anticipated sequel to Ocean's Eleven, Warner Brothers decided to rewrite the script to specifically fit with each of the characters of the series. Though some may feel cheated by this piece of trivia, this turns out ten times better then anything John Woo could have slapped together, so look on the bright side of things here.<br/><br/>The complication Ocean's Twelve faces, the exact same predicament the original feature ran into three years ago, is that with so many cast members, specifically ones with marquee names, increases the likelihood of each person receiving limited screen time which inevitably causes complaints of certain characters being underused. Quite surprisingly, the whole Brad Pitt/Catherine Zeta-Jones romance angle worked amazingly well and added yet another intriguing twist to the already complicated storyline. Unfortunately, what does not work out quite as well as it should have was the 'family' element to Catherine Zeta-Jones' Isabel Lahiri, if it can be properly described as such. There is hardly any mention of her family other then in limited moments of the film and the scene near the end where she reunites with her father seemed senselessly tacked onto the end without a second thought as to what it should have meant but was not. Perhaps it is due to all these separate story elements  the romance between Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones and the wager with 'The Night Fox'  that George Clooney's Danny Ocean seems quite left out of the picture compared to the last go-around where it was completely and entirely his film. Not that this was a significant problem but this is just yet another demonstration of the sometimes unequal shifting of story involvement amongst the numerous characters of the film series. Without giving too much information away, let us simply say that the way Tess is used in order to help the Ocean's gang pilfer a specific item from an Italian art museum was hilarious. Sure, it does wear a little thin as more time is spent on but, in the end, it works invariably. The only one that can truly be said as being underused in this picture is Andy Garcia reprising his role as the menacing Terry Benedict, the victim of Ocean's Eleven's casino heist from the first film. His appearance in the film, in the beginning and near the end, is really nothing more then a mere cameo, possibly to fulfill the contractual obligation he signed to appear in the sequel with the rest of the cast. This, on the other hand, can not be said of Matt Damon's Linus Caldwell who seems to have had a significant increase in the amount of screen time from the last film, playing a more central role in the story, specifically near the end.<br/><br/>Overall, Ocean's Twelve, in spite of its failure to surpass the magnificence of the original which essentially set the precedent for all modern crime capers to follow, does indeed match it based on pure entertainment value and would certainly be a feature Frank Sinatra and the rest of the crooning Rat Pack would be proud of. All in all, the film itself has very few problems to raise complaint about  A drawback that was apparent with Ocean's Eleven as well was that the first thirty minutes of the picture start off quite laboriously and nothing exactly interesting happens or no real action occurs. Granted, this is to set up the situation and the characters but considering this is a sequel and most audience members are aware of the original film, this should not have taken as long as it did. And was it absolutely necessary to bring back every single member of the original Ocean's Eleven cast for this film? Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, and Carl Reiner barely appear at all  you could count on both hands, possibly only one, the number of lines each one of them has in this feature  and should have been written out entirely based on what they contribute  nothing. Middling complaints aside, Steven Soderbergh's skillful editing, mixing and cinematography style works wonders, except for the occasional still-picture shots, near the beginning and the end of the film, but are not so off-putting as to be entirely noticeable or discomforting. Though not holding quite the level of prestige as some notable sequels that have managed to surpass the expectations set upon by the first film might have, the series still able to maintain its suave composure, intricate white, and stylized flare to make more then worthwhile viewing over the holiday season this year.<br/><br/>My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)"
"JKSweeney","9","2","5","11 December 2004"," Awesome
","Soderbergh delivers again. The movie was really smart and fast paced. It's almost a completely different kind of movie from the first, which isn't a bad thing at all. It took the same great cast of characters we all knew and made another really interesting film. It's hard to compare it to its predecessor, but is ultimately a great movie. It seemed to focus on some characters more than others, but still maintained a balance for the crew of twelve. It had Great Bits, Great Cameos, a lot of situational mishaps, and loads fun in my opinion. I doubt it will be as well received as the first, but I think it stands up well. Some people will like the new direction, others will hate it. I for one thought it was a cool way to go- But then again I tend to really like the majority of Soderbergh's work. (even Schizopolis)"

","I think it is easy to be over critical of this movie. Sure, there were a few plot holes that left me scratching my head, and at times the camera and/or lighting seemed a little out of place.<br/><br/>But who cares? In this movie that's not the point. What really matters is that it follows the same theme as it's predecessor: It's a hip and fun movie that left me smiling through out the whole thing. I love the interaction between Clooney and Pitt, and Damon's role is great. I haven't had so much fun watching a movie in a long while. And Julia Roberts actually puts up an OK job. I felt she was the weakest link in Eleven, but in this one I didn't sense that at all, though it also helped that her role this time along was a bit easier to play.<br/><br/>My only gripes were that Bernie Mac's role was significantly smaller (though not large in the Ocean's Eleven either), and some cheesy high-tech stuff (anyone who as seen it knows what I'm talking about).<br/><br/>Other than that, I loved it. 9/10"
"Sheldogg23","8","3","10","15 December 2004"," Just fun at the movies
","This film has been way over-hyped, but it's also being way over criticized. Everyone disappointed that it falls short of the first one. I think the storyline from the get go informs you that it will be nothing like the first film. Just as the first one was a well planned heist, you have individuals who have ""left the game"" for civilian living, and they're forced to play again. So as it stands those that complain that the film was not a true caper film, who said it had to be? It is not Ocean's 11. It's a film with the same characters that find themselves with completely different given circumstances. Soderberg's chosen style of this film differs drastically as well. It's dirtier, considerably more raw photographically, and I think that is great parallel with the characters realities. You have to remember that in Ocean's 11, it wasn't a goal to go after a specific amount of money.<br/><br/>They focused on one job that offered a ridiculous amount of money...and now you've got characters that have little time and are forced to come up with a ridiculous amount of money. So they scramble, and they look for any way to come up with any amount of money they can. There was also a lot of ""inside"" jokes that weren't really inside for the cast, but for anyone who has travelled abroad and anyone that follows the entertainment industry. <br/><br/>Admittedly, I went in with way too high of an expectation and still came out enjoying the film. It was not what I expected, but I laughed a lot harder than I did while viewing the first of the Ocean's. And I thought Brad Pitt opposite Catherine Zeta Jones was just as intriguing as George and Julia were in the first. You couldn't help but smile every time they graced the screen together. All in all, it was just a good time at the movies! And the chemistry between all the guys and girls involved was just electric. So I recommend the film, and I recommend you listen closely instead of just absorbing what is shown to you."

","Fun caper flick that has that 1960s/1970s Euro-trash style to it as the titled characters (led by George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and the rest) are forced to pay back the villain from ""Ocean's 11"" (Andy Garcia) after he and his associates track down our heroes. Now Clooney and the gang must make $190 million over a two week period as they travel to Amsterdam and Rome to pull their heists. Along for the ride is a sexy detective (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who has a past with Pitt and a world-class criminal (Vincent Cassel) who wants to prove to the underworld that he indeed is the greatest international thief. Totally silly and over-exaggerated, but enjoyable nevertheless. Director Steven Soderbergh uses a proved formula and a top-notch cast to get his wild points across. Cameos abound from big name stars and alums from the original give the picture a cool ""Where's Waldo?"" feel to it. Far from a special picture, but still a legitimate production. 4 stars out of 5."

","They tried to make a great sequel and they failed. BUT nevertheless it is still a mildly enjoyable heist movie, despite being less good than the original Ocean's Eleven, which was absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>The bad: too disjointed story structure. The story basically is a mess and almost incomprehensible and silly near the end. There are simply too many loose scenes that dont add anything to the story. There are 2 villains now instead of one. There are 2 romances now instead of 1. There are 2 heists now instead of 1. Double cross upon double cross. They multiplied everything, they added things and added even more things on top of that, but that made the story only more chaotic and less coherent. What a mess...<br/><br/>The good: judged by each of the scenes individually, they are often still funny and well acted by terrific actors. I mean, what a dream cast of stars! Lots of good tongue in cheek jokes. Seductive female powerplay with Catherine Zeta Jones added to the mix, next to Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>I would still NOT recommend it to anyone, unless you wanna pass the time and you have nothing better to watch...Simply REwatch the original, because the original is heavenly, this movie though is only a failed copycat..."

","This film is fun. Yes, some of the critics were right in that it revealed WXYZ before revealing STUV. Sure. But the cleverness of Ocean's team's primary opponent stealing the egg before they had a chance to being undone by Ocean's team stealing it before he had a chance to is pretty clever. Undoing a trope by using the same trope...<br/><br/>Everyone hates that a bunch of celebrities did a movie together (judging by the first two reviews I read lmao) but compare this to ""This Is The End"" and, c'mon, at least this celebrity ego fest is a clever ego-fest!<br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie is when character's lines immediately contradicted themselves. Like Eddie Izzard's ""isn't it cliche to have a sexy assistant"" line right before his sexy assistant walks on screen. There were 3-4 others in there that I really enjoyed.<br/><br/>Also they set up the Julia Roberts switcharoo quite well by grounding the in-movie universe in our world with Topher Grace playing himself. What's the line - ""never show a gun in the first act if you don't plan to use it in the third""? This film amends it to ""never show a real celebrity in the first act unless you plan to make Julia Roberts play herself in the third.""<br/><br/>Heist films are a popular genre.

"dgilleand","3","1","2","27 April 2019"," Isn't 13 supposed to be the unlucky number?
","Do me a favor. Imagine you're tasked with coming up with a sequel - for any movie. What do you think is the first thing you need to do? You need to discover the ""soul"" of the original film and use it as the foundation for the sequel. In the case of Ocean's Eleven, you're talking about a heist. Then, you'd look at tone. There's a lot of cool, smooth, cleverness going on with a hint of comedy that blends in very well with everything else to make one well-oiled machine. But that's not what the writers of Ocean's Twelve did.<br/><br/>They made a fatal mistake with the foundation of the film. Instead of being primarily about a smart and clever heist, it's about the actors having a good time together. That focus single-handedly got rid of a main heist, transitioning the film into something aimless and convoluted and turned an originally colorful group of characters into a saturated mess that all blend together and no longer play an independent role in the outcome of the film<br/><br/>Furthermore, the type of comedy went from smooth and subtle to over-the-top and even slapstick, which went into some weird and random sound editing issues, like a scene in the beginning where Don Cheadle's character is complaining about them bleeping out curse words in a song while the movie was using phone rings to bleep out cussing in the same scene. It makes no sense with the rest of the movie, only that random scene, and the ringtone was synced with the use of swearing, it was inconsistently patterned so it wasn't even a clever use of swearing either. It is so....bad.<br/><br/>I could go on and on...I just don't get it."

","Definitely an improvement over the first, however, it takes your prior familiarity with the characters + style of the first film for it to land like it does.<br/><br/>It's much more confident and breezy this time around, and you could accuse it of simply coasting on the first film's goodwill, however, Soderbergh pushes himself behind the camera. Different filmic influences drive how scenes are shot; at times it's almost documentarian. Selling the ease at which the camera operates is the chemistry between the expanding cast of characters and cameos. While this is definitely a heist film, what makes the Ocean's films sing are the actors' unwillingness to play up the dramatics, therefore taking away a major reason for you to care about the heists themselves. It honestly sounds like an anti-movie, and in many ways it kind of is, but that's probably why it's kinda brilliant. The movie is so hyper-aware of this that a major beat of the plot is centered around an encounter with Bruce Willis, playing himself.<br/><br/>I wasn't totally sold on either the original or this year's Ocean's Eight, as Soderbergh just isn't quite there for me as a director, but I think he found the formula's sweet spot with this one.<br/><br/>It's both a movie's movie and an anti-movie.

It's cool to use these max. twice I'd say, more than that and it becomes a bit repetitive and looks as if the director/producer just didn't have any other means of transitioning between different plot lines.

The casting is still here, Europe is certainly a nice change of setting, Steven Soderbergh is still the director but this movie lacks a story. Why did they think that multiplying the heists would make this movie better than the first one? Did they run out of ideas? And please can someone explain me how they could have made the antagonist so weak and cheesy after the Great Andy Garcia?<br/><br/>No offense against Vincent Cassel who is a great actor but it seems so cliché. Is it because he's French that he succeeded to bypass that laser field dancing the tango? I have seen some of the movies he starred in including one called the Hate. In it he's ruthless and very dark. He inspires fear. In Ocean Twelve, it's almost if we would laugh at his face! <br/><br/>I also have some doubts about Catherine Zeta-Jones character. She is supposed to be an honest cop. Someone who truly believes in her duty to arrest criminals and thieves but still at the end she's becoming a part of the team? Please!<br/><br/>Oh and one last thing, Europol has never been an investigative agency. It's not the European FBI. They are just sharing expertise and information to police forces throughout the EU.

"Leofwine_draca","5","1","2","6 September 2016"," An easy film to watch and make, but it smacks of self indulgence
","If you're looking for a light-hearted caper movie, then OCEAN'S TWELVE is nothing more – and nothing less – than that. As with the previous instalment in the series, director Steven Soderbergh goes out of the way to make this feel like a '60s movie, with a breezy tone, brisk dialogue, and sweep-along editing that carries the viewer along for some definitely light entertainment. But hey, we don't always want to watch heavy, gruelling drama, so I don't have a problem with these intentions at all.<br/><br/>In retrospect, it was pretty easy to get this film right. It had the chance to throw off the 'remake' tag, so could follow pretty much whatever plot it wanted. All the cast came back from the original, so the camaraderie was already there from the beginning. Soderbergh's idea is to up the stakes, up the money and make things even more twisty-turny than before, and he ably succeeds at that. This film is so chock-full of crosses, double crosses, triple crosses, and surprises that half the time is spent just keeping up with what's going on. Luckily, the cast are more than watchable, although with a huge ensemble like this, it's fair to say nobody is required to 'act' very much. Matt Damon probably gives the most earnest turn, but Clooney and Pitt are just here to trade on their charm and status, and supports like Garcia and Gould barely register. Catherine Zeta Jones plays a large part and achieves some old 'movie star' charm although I never warmed to her ice-cold character. One surprise is a nice turn from Vincent Cassel, an actor I always enjoy seeing on film, and no exception here.<br/><br/>Of course, the film isn't perfect. It takes a rather long time to get to the 'meat' of the plot and the opening introductions are long-winded and unnecessary, also rather repetitive. The film can also be accused of being self-indulgent, especially in the part where Julia Roberts's character ends up pretending to beJulia Roberts. Still, I could forgive this part thanks to the fun Bruce Willis cameo, and it all comes together for the ""pull the rug out from under you"" ending."

Considering that just about every actor in the movie is a megastar, that says something.<br/><br/>Only real upside is that it is fast-paced, so never feels entirely boring, even though nothing substantial is happening."

","Ocean's Twelve is the sequel to the hit film Ocean's Eleven released in 2001. Starting into the film, it takes place where the crew flies to Europe in an attempt to pull off quick heists in order to pay off Benedict. There, they find out they are up against a mysterious character who is thwarting their plans for some unknown reason. They have to find this person and stop him before Benedict's deadline. They are also being pursued by a clever detective, Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is close to arresting them. I was willing to put up with this unbelievable nonsense for a time, but my breaking point came when the film actually has Julia Roberts portraying Tess Ocean, who, in turn is portraying Julia Roberts as part of a plot to get close to a guarded treasure in a museum. I don't think this could ever work, but in order for it to have a chance, wouldn't Julia Roberts have to at least establish the character of Tess Ocean first? It ruined the film as a whole and became quite over the top and silly at this point.<br/><br/>One of the things you need in order to have a successful heist movie is a good heist, or a good confidence scheme. Here, the big heist at the end of the movie turns out to be an afterthought. It is a throwaway heist shown as a flashback. The acting is casual, at best. The big problem is screen time. There is only enough of it for Clooney, Pitt and Matt Damon. Most of the others in the all-star cast, like Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Andy Garcia and Roberts, have very limited roles."
"pfgpowell","2","1","2","1 December 2014"," Something of a con trick by Soderbergh, but which will fool no one but the extremely gullible
","Stephen Soderbergh is one of those directors - make that 'auteurs' - 'cineastes' revere. (A 'cineaste' is a man or woman, but invariably a man, who is 'passionate' about films and filmmaking. That's all you need to know about 'cineastes'.) Drop the name Soderbergh into many a conversation and you leave your mark as a man or a woman, but invariably a man, who is a cut above the hoi polloi in matters film. Sodebergh is one of a small, elite group of 'auteurs' who could fart on film and be acclaimed as 'left-field', 'original', 'daring' where you and I would be sent away with a flea in our ear for doing the same thing.<br/><br/>I have by no means seen all of his films but I rather liked two - Sex, Lies And Videotapes, with which he made his name (on the strength of that film the saintly Roger Ebert described Soderbergh as 'the poster boy of the Sundance generation') and Side Effects, a more conventional film but an effective thriller. Unfortunately, Soderbergh's talents, for he undoubtedly has talent, often fail him and Ocean's Twelve is a case in point. (Incidentally, Soderbergh was either not aware what a self-indulgent hotch-potch of rubbish Ocean's Twelve became - which is unlikely - or he was but thought that given his reputation he could get away with it - for more likely.)<br/><br/>I haven't seen Ocean's Eleven, Soderbergh's remake of the Rat Pack film, which I understand was rather good, not least because the plotting was tight, though the rule of thumb is 'if you're going to remake a film, you'd better have a very good reason for doing so' and as far as I know Sodernergh didn't have one for remaking Ocean's Eleven. As for this sequel, loose, not to say abysmally awful, plotting is one of many failures which reduce Ocean's Twelve to such a worthless piece of rubbish that you wonder why it didn't go straight to video. Actually, given the 'name actors' involved, not least George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt, there was no way they could even contemplate allowing it to go straight to video. Elsewhere in these pages a civilian reviewer has remarked that in the round of TV interviews launched to plug this film when it was first released, the cast was reduced to insisting what a real hoot they all had making it - never, ever a good sign. In the reviewers words the producers realised what a turkey they had on their hands and were engaged in campaign of damage limitation.<br/><br/>The reason Ocean's Twelve was made is obvious: Ocean's Eleven made a shedload of money so the producers took to heart Sam Goldwyn's dictum 'if they liked it once, they'll love it twice' and decided to cash in. Well, they did - just (the budget was $110,000 million, it grossed £125,000 million - not a roaring success.)<br/><br/>So that of the film itself? Well, it gets of to a reasonable start and the first 20 minutes more or less pass muster, although this viewer is getting a little tired of the old Hollywood schtick of 'getting the old gang together again for one last job'. If I've seen it once, I've seen it 1.000 and it doesn't change a great deal. But then the doubts mount. I don't mind being baffled a little if I feel safe in the knowledge that there is an intelligence at play here which will draw all the strands together in an honest and coherent way. But on this occasion I didn't. On this occasion I got the feeling that the inconsistencies weren't clever plot devices but because at the end of the day the director just couldn't be arsed. Roll on to the finale and that suspicion is confirmed: Soderbergh had reduced himself to the status of jobbing director getting a slice of that promised shedload of money. I shan't give a spoiler but the whole script seems to have been written on the hoof and given that finale the previous hour or so make absolutely no sense whatsoever and are an insult to the viewer.<br/><br/>So, Stephen, a few arty camera angles - the shot of the plane arriving in Rome with the camera simply on its side is pure adolescence - and a pseudo cinema verite style of filming with the characters all talking at the same time with the camera behaving like a drunk at a party don't give you a get out of jail card: this is clunky filmmaking at its worst. My advice to all is: just don't bother."
"Clockwork-Avacado","2","1","2","12 May 2014"," The Real Heist in Ocean's Twelve Occurs when Steven Soderbergh walks off laughing with your Money...
","Well, the joke's on him, because I bought a two-film set of Ocean's 11 and 12 together, for 50p. So, technically, he only got 25p off me for this,and I probably did get about 50p worth of enjoyment from ""11"" - although not a great deal more. It was okay; it was fun and silly, with a cast of a few annoying people, and some decent ones. But anyway; back to this one.<br/><br/>Oh, there must have been tears of laughter rolling down the director's cheeks when he made this movie. It is so jam-packed with self-knowing nudges and winks, and quite frankly, ends up way, way too far up it's own bottom. The actual plot itself is negligible, and seems to ratchet everything up to 101, and then resolve it with some ridiculous contrivance. Even the humour falls flat, what little there is - the Robbie Coltrane jargon scene at the bar especially is an appalling piece of cinematic showing off, and not only isn't funny, or witty, or absurd, is actually embarrassing. In fact, the entire film, is embarrassing.<br/><br/>The main talking point of the film, comes when Tess, played by Julia Roberts, decides to pull off a stupid robbery, by disguising herself...as Julia Roberts. Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha...No, seriously. That's ridiculous, and not even vaguely clever. Then Bruce Willis turns up,playing himself, proving the rule that every film with Bruce Willis in it, is total rubbish. This is such arrogant, self-important claptrap, that it happily demolishes everything in sight with a brainless, relentless absurdity, which, when the dust finally settles, leaves you with the feeling that someone has, quite sincerely, just robbed you of time and money, and stuck their middle finger in your face for two hours.<br/><br/>I give this movie two out of ten, because I love Brad Pitt, who plays this entire film with a bored, I can't be bothered with life swagger, and does seem rather fed up; Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is usually good fun, and sometimes quite a good actress, and the marvellous Vincent Cassell, star of ""La Haine"", and ""Black Swan"", who gets a chance to strut his stuff here with some cool acrobatics, but little else. Because any character development, or decent acting all just gets in the way of this film's overwhelming desire to spit on everything, to outdo itself in stupid gags, and unrealistic plot turns. To be honest,it lacks even the superficial gloss which the first movie had. That had twists in it, sure, but this movie has so many twists, that it doesn't even have a story. It's just an absurd collection of infantile rubbish, held together by three decent actors, that has guaranteed itself future economic success by plonking itself square in the middle of a trilogy, and has come after a fairly decent first movie.<br/><br/>I don't know how to impress upon you strongly enough, but even if you thought the first movie was THE BEST FILM YOU HAVE EVR SEEN IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE - In which case, you are probably beyond helping anyway, due to your terrible taste in films - but even if this was the case with you PLEASE...I beg of you...do not give Steven Soderbergh the satisfaction he deserves. This is a travesty of film-making, and its smug laziness does not deserve to con more innocents out of their money. So do everyone a favour - if you want a star-studded, comedy/thriller movie...then watch ""Hot Fuzz"". Or ""Charlie's Angels"". Or, Heck...watch anything. Just not this movie.<br/><br/>(And, if you're still here after all this ranting...it's worth mentioning that this ain't the worst film I've ever seen in my life. I just feel incredibly cheated right now, and have the urge to convey that feeling to others. I'm sure it'll go away soon enough...But, goodness, has this put me off watching the third one, or what?)"
"gainestillinger","7","1","2","30 August 2009"," Too far from the original (!?!) remake.
","'If you steal fifty million dollars, they will find you.' (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, Die Hard) This adage certainly rings true in this sequel. Terry Benedict has been informed that Danny Ocean and his compadres were the ones who ripped him off and now he wants his money back. Therefore, the Ocean gang needs a lot of money and fast, but cannot work in the states as Benedict has made it impossible for them. So it's off to Europe to perform acts of death defying thievery, whilst trying to avoid Catherine Zeta Jones' super cop, an old flame from Rusty's (Pitt's) past.<br/><br/>On their first heist in Amsterdam they find out that who ratted on them was the 'Night Fox', a super slick thief with a legend complex. He issues them with a challenge that could write off their debt in full or land them in some kind of Uma Thurman Kill Bill II buried alive sequence. Interesting? Well, yes. Slow? Sort of. Entertaining? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Plenty.<br/><br/>Soderbergh, who did not direct the first film, has given his actors licence to 'evolve' their parts, which for this franchise is probably not the best idea. What worked so well in the last film was the lack of character development, complemented by the slickness of the mission impossible style heist. Ocean's Eleven looked like the cover of Vogue magazine or an advert for Gucci and the characters' lack of depth helped polish the film to a high and glossy shine. Ocean's Twelve wants to move past this through idiosyncrasies and little character ticks and deepen the glossy and superficial cover picture. This may have worked because the chemistry within the Ocean gang is comfortable and entertaining. Unfortunately, it does not as Catherine Zeta Jones' super cop upsets this delicate balance. She fits into this film like a big square peg in a tight Ocean's 11 sided hole and her chemistry with Pitt is non-existent.<br/><br/>The star of this film for me is Vincent Cassel. His Night Fox is arrogant, cavalier and makes being rich look like tremendous fun. He is the yang to the Americans' ying; he is immoral where they are moral (?!); his Night Fox is the darker side to professional thievery whereas the Americans are the acceptable face of stealing over a hundred million in someone else's cash simply because they make it look so cool. Cassel also plays the part with a natural swagger and depth that contrasts heavily with the newly found 'depth' of the American actors. Normally contrast is a good thing as it makes things complicated and layered, but from this franchise we want superficial, gloss and polish. So, for me, this is where the film does not work.<br/><br/>All of this together and we end with simply this: the age old adage 'integrity comes from being true to yourself' is something that this franchise should have thought more carefully about."
"film_riot","7","1","2","16 October 2007"," Ocean's Twelve
","It's all about the stars in the ""Ocean's"" movies. Above all, of course, there are George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon. Everything is damn cool and easy, decisions are being made quick and nothing discountenances the Twelve. Clooney even stated in an interview that he makes movies like ""Ocean's Twelve"" to coin money, so that he's able to finance his not so mass-appealing productions. The ""Ocean's"" movies are there for the purpose of making money. Many critics blame them for this. But if you're honest they are very well made entertainment, that's their purpose and they achieve this with ease. Steven Soderbergh is the man who makes everything look that easy. He mixes different styles, shakes them and on screen the result is very chic. Of course, that's all very harmless, but why bother, as long as not all productions lose their edges, a few of them are fine. The thing that I really like about ""Ocean's Twelve"" is Catherine Zeta-Jones and her character. That's the proof: The more women, the better."
"dpatters-1","9","1","2","3 October 2006"," Pillow Continuity
","I loved the movie. Just one issue with Julia Robert's (Tess) placing the pillow in the car driving from the airport vs. removing it at the Jail. Did anyone else notice the SQUARE pillow in the car and the ROUND pillow at the jail? I'm a frequent visitor to Amsterdam and love the scenes. I realized in my last visit there the Hotel is not actually on the corner. It exists, but is not actually located in the spot where it is shown. I particularly enjoy the music in this movie. It is very much different from conventional movie music and very refreshing. It isn't the kind of music that I would go out and buy but it seemed to fit the scenes and really complimented the story. I have watched this movie at least a dozen times now and I get a kick out of it every time. It is hard to follow because there is so much happening and it moves back and forth to different locations and scenes. You have to see it more than once to fully appreciate it."
"igiveup2345","9","1","2","25 July 2006"," Better than the first
","I don't understand how some people hate this movie. This was one of the few movies that i have ever seen where you have to watch it all the way through. The movie just moves. Unlike other movies, something is always happening. It has the same all star cast as the first one; a better plot line, in my opinion; and, most of all, it has the same heart as the first one. Unlike the new pirates of the Caribbean movie, for example (I liked that movie, it was just the first one that came to mind.) it just seems to have the same feel as the first one. Except this one is much funnier than Oceans 11. Some of the conversations that they had, such as the one between Rusty (Brad Pitt) and Danny (George Clooney) when Danny realized that he had been given a fake wake up call, and then when they got drunk, made me laugh for 5 minutes after the scene had already ended. Also, the movie is much more confusing than the last one, which i like, because that means that you can watch it several times over without getting bored of it. Because of these qualities, and because Eliot Gould had a bigger part, i can say that Oceans 12 was better than the first."
"jon2005","7","1","2","22 May 2006"," Ocean's Twelve
","Ocean's Eleven (2002) is an awesome film  fact. It's got class, plot, good characters (more impressive considering the number of people it involves), humour, and tons of style. And whilst the sequel brings back everyone from the original it is, to be blunt, not as good. It is good, just not as good.<br/><br/>But this has nothing to do with the cast, which are still the high-point of the film, whether it be the general bickering amongst the group or George Clooney's and Brad Pitt's near telepathic conversations, and everything they had to make the first film so entertaining has been preserved here  it is evident that the cast and crew had a huge amount of fun making the film. All the newcomers are excellent as well, particularly Catherine Zeta-Jones as a Europol agent and former lover of Rusty's (Pitt). So there can be no complaints about the cast.<br/><br/>Where the complaints lie (and it must be said that whilst compared to the first film this is not as great, it is still better than most of the films I've seen recently) are in the plot, and the general look of the film. The plot is a little rushed, and seems almost just an excuse to get the gang back for another round. After a rather effective scene with Terry Benedict threatening each member of the group individually, the film jumps to Europe (Amsterdam, Rome, and Paris to be specific), and this constant moving around can feel a little disorientating compared to the original.<br/><br/>Also, because there is not much of a time frame for the team, there is no time to plan  and therefore show  the elaborate heist. This sense of urgency is punctuated by the use of a shaky camera, but this just alienates the audience from the sense of style from Ocean's Eleven. It also gives the feeling that the whole team just aren't as smooth as they were last time. The sense of timing is a little confusing as well, as it keeps jumping from the past to the present and back again. Finally, the real problem is (and I don't think I'm really giving anything away) that there is no big heist here, at least not in comparison to the lengthy and elaborate heist from Ocean's Eleven. And unlike last time, instead of one big twist  and we all know there's going to be one  it is broken up into several smaller twists which deadens the impact somewhat.<br/><br/>However, as I said above, Ocean's Twelve is a good film. The above complaints are justified because we know what this cast and crew are capable of. So in that respect it is a bit disappointing; but there is plenty to enjoy and it should keep you well entertained. The humour is still very much there, probably even amplified this time around, with several laugh-out-loud moments; including one surreal, though fairly amusing scene, where Tess (Julia Roberts) has to get involved and impersonate Julia Roberts! It comes across as a little too much like a pantomime but is still fun nonetheless, especially when she runs into old ""friend"" Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>The joy about Ocean's Eleven, and therefore Ocean's Twelve, is that it never takes itself too seriously, allowing the audience to sit back and enjoy the fun which, although not on a par with the original, is still damn fine entertainment.<br/><br/>Rated: 7/10 <br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net<br/><br/>Second opinion/ Re-viewing:<br/><br/>I think Ocean's Twelve caught me on a good day, because I can now see how much the quality dips in the second dose of Danny Ocean and pals. The Julia-Roberts-being-herself scene - described in the main review as ""fun"" - is actually very painful and embarrassing to watch. The whole adventure seems like an excuse for the cast to come back and just have a good time amongst themselves; the problem is that they seem to have left the audience out of their group, ensuring that all the obvious excitement on screen is not translated in a way the audience can truly latch onto. Let hope that Steven Soderbergh can recreate the magic from Ocean's Eleven in time to make a difference on the recently announced Ocean's Thirteen.<br/><br/>Re-rated: 6/10"
"camieabz","1","1","2","22 April 2006"," Don't Bother - Plot less, Mindless and Pointless
","Big mistake making this film. Amazed the actors signed up to it. Pay checks and who's who 'A' list credits must have been the catalyst.<br/><br/>The first half hour is a mixture of confusing snippets of different timelines and ""guess who's back?"" shots. Add to this the whispering dialogue, so you can hardly hear the actors, and you have little idea what on earth the plot is supposed to be.<br/><br/>This film is really a plot within a plot within a plot. The half hour prior to the last fifteen minutes moves faster than the rest of the film, but it's completely pointless.<br/><br/>In it we're shown that the remaining 'free' members of the crew decide to enlist Tess (Julia Roberts) to assist them in the heist. Here's the clanger...they come to the conclusion that Tess looks very similar to...wait for it....Julia Roberts!!! Now there's a script with originality and imagination for you. They also get Bruce Willis in a cameo role to make it more likely that the character played by Julia Roberts is really Julia Roberts. Willis seems bemused by the whole thing. Julia Roberts manages to play herself well enough (!) Clanger No.2 comes at the end. We're shown that the target of the heist (a Faberge Egg) was actually 'pinched' by Ocean's crew earlier on. It's the twist to make the audience say ""I didn't see that coming."", and it's an insult to the audience.<br/><br/>Basically we're to believe that with the loot already in their possession, they enlist Julia Roberts to go through a pointless act to attempt to steal the fake one, so they can be locked up, only to then be rescued by associates. All so they can A) Get away with it all, and B) Have the right to boast to another top-class thief The other underlying plot issue is that they have to pay back the cash from the 1st movie. This is the basis for all this happening.<br/><br/>Let's face it. In the real world, or even in a fictional fantasy world of crooks, they don't waste their time on one-upmanship when that kind of loot is at stake. Not do they bother to get caught to get busted out. Ludicrous! It's a who's who of the first film, and even the knuckle-dragging ape from the first movie is there, tattoos and all....but wait for it....he appears in a suit and touting a 'legal council' badge he busts one of the crew out of jail (legally I assume). Yes, like most lawyers have tattoos on their shaven heads and are 7 foot tall.<br/><br/>Plus points? Matt Damon and Catherine Zeta-Jones seem to take their parts seriously enough to be entertaining. The rest are getting an even share of quips, gags, and smart-arsed comments. Few of them get a decent share of the dialogue or the filming to make an impact.<br/><br/>The style, music and what not are good, but there's too much reliance on that to fill in the gaps.<br/><br/>I think the original rat-pack and the original Ocean's 11 became a classic for a few reasons, but one was because then didn't try to do a sequel. The re-make of Ocean's 11 was quite good, simply because with the exception of the location and the target(s), the plot was completely different. They had a real chance to make it a classic, and the corporate idiots of the film industry preferred to cash in on it instead.<br/><br/>Result? If there's ever another sequel it'll flop right out. Few will spend their cash one more time.<br/><br/>1/5 - and it's Matt Damon and Catherine Zeta-Jones who get the 1."

Cassel plays up Frech snobbery to a fine art as he seems to crush Ocean's efforts at every turn with attitude and astonishing acrobatics.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the entire Ocean's Eleven are back, with an important role for the 12th Ocean, Tess (Julia Roberts), this time.<br/><br/>What makes this film succeed is excellent plot twists that hinge on the whirl-wind tour of European locations that host the film.

For some reason the USA was too dangerous for them even though they've live there with all their ill-gotten loot for the last three years without having any fear of being arrested by the police. <br/><br/>In Amsterdam we soon learn the real reason for Benedict's unusual actions?

I understood the jokes and could really follow the plot very closely. I found that the plot was very clever and that the acting was done very well. So my advice to all who saw it and didn't like it, is to take the time and watch it again. You wont regret it."

","Quite a few people have reviewed Ocean's Twelve on this site and I've noticed a few of the same things being said ad nauseum. Some girl from Australia commented on the director going with a ""new, popular shaky cam technique"" that she didn't quite agree with. Perhaps she was talking about hand-held camera shots which have only been a staple in the arsenal of DP's since...the invention of the film camera? I loved the cinematography of Ocean's twelve. When was the last time you can recall a movie using zoom? Not a dolly shot, not a tracking shot, but a straight-up zoom. It's campy and cheesy, but thats what they were going for. That, combined with a warm yet muted palette and a definitively euro-trash soundtrack, invoke a sense of nostalgia. If any of you have seen old school campy Italian films, you'll know what I'm talking about. To make an already long story short, what I'm trying to say is that this was an amazing -looking- film - one full of style. Unfortunately, the story is far too convoluted. There's a heist, but not really. Once you find out that there was actually a heist -before- that heist, you realize you're wrong. It's apparently all a master plan put into motion by some thief. If that sounds confusing, it is. I'm still not even sure whether or not that's what really happened, I'm only speculating. I still have a hard time figuring out which parts of the movie were real, and which were just facades enacted by thieves."
"lemon_magic","5","1","2","24 November 2005"," As you might expect, the followup doesn't measure up
","I'll open with what appears to be a cheap shot: Julia Roberts looked completely pale, frazzled, and worn out in this movie. She was looking a bit brittle and haggard in ""Ocean's 11"", and the trend is far more advanced here. I could be wrong, but I don't think this was a deliberate choice on the part of the filmmakers, I think she's just looking used-up, and they couldn't disguise it. It's hard to believe how far downhill she's gone (at least in the superficial cosmetic sense) since her 'Pretty Woman' days. Since she's always gotten by on her dewy good looks and coltish ingénue charm, I can only hope for her sake that she's just going through a temporary rough patch. Or that she starts going for dramatic 'character' roles (like Jessica Lange) instead of romantic lead parts. I think putting her in front of the camera looking like this and passing her off as a 'glamour queen' could kill her career. Good luck, Julia, hope things work better for you soon. Take a couple of months and spend a few of your millions at a good health spa/ranch retreat, OK? <br/><br/>On to the real comments about the actual movie: <br/><br/>To tell the truth, I liked ""Ocean's 11"" very much indeed...but I recognized that there was an elusive chemistry at work in the film, an inspired blend of clever plotting, cast chemistry, classy actors, cool jazz music and superb directorial timing and rhythm that might be hard to duplicate. So when I heard that a sequel was in the work, I wasn't sanguine about its chances for being up to the first one. But hey, ""X-Men 2"" was also a sequel involving a huge cast, and IT turned out great, so...<br/><br/>I have to report that lightning didn't strike twice. ""Ocean's 12"", while reasonably watchable, has nowhere near the energy and fun of the original Soderbergh film. <br/><br/>The thing about ""11"", was that it was essentially a fairy tale, a caper film where dashing, likable scoundrels went up against the odds and won the day by being slyer, smarter, and smoother under pressure than anyone could ever imagine...and lived happily ever after. Nearly every scene had our underdogs saying or doing something surprising, something delightful, something funny or hilarious, or being just plain cool.<br/><br/>But the sequel takes a chance of going in a more realistic, downbeat direction. It shows our heroes not living so happily after all. It takes forever to get going and get the characters back together. It putzes around for several more scenes with no real forward progress after the basic dilemma has been established. It tests the viewers' patience with one false start after another as the bad guy from the first movie, the police, and a rival thief prove to be ahead of them at every turn. Instead of being delighted and dazzled by how cool they were, I was impatient for these guys to prove again what it was I liked about them the first time...and they just weren't doing it. <br/><br/>And when the final plot twist is revealed, it turns out that most of the time our gang had things under control after all, but the viewer wasn't allowed to see the actual execution of the 'real' caper until the very end. In the first movie, Ocean's crew essentially kept pulling new stuff out of a seemingly bottomless bag of tricks...but they did it right in front of the audience. But in this case, the most important 'trick' is simply sloppy writing that cheats the audience. And BTW,it was a serious miscalculation to have Julia-Roberts-as-Tess her impersonate Julia-Roberts-the-celebrity part of a scam - it was a self-indulgent 'in-joke' that didn't work at all.<br/><br/>In the message boards, one commenter astutely observed that, the real point of the the 2nd half of the movie was NOT to beat the rival art thief, it was to reunite Zeta-Jones' character with her father; once you realized this, some of the previous scenes made more sense. I'll buy that, but it doesn't change the fact that aside from a lingering shot of a back-pack sitting beside Pitt on a jet, and an inexplicable smirk on Pitt's face as he is led away in hand-cuffs, there is very little to clue the viewer about this development in the plot. The director and the screenwriter just didn't play fair. <br/><br/>When you have this many talented actors together, something good is bound to leak through in spite of everything, and that is the case here. Some of the cast byplay is still fun and amusing. Zeta-Jones is a striking screen presence, and no time spent watching her on a movie screen is ever wasted. The rival art thief is the very embodiment of Continental cool and suaveness, and the sequence where he uses Capoeira to 'dance' through a laser maze is the visual highlight of the film (even if it seems like a shameless swipe from ""Entrapment"").<br/><br/>And while I missed the swinging cool tunes of the first movies sound track, I felt that the more jagged, rough edged techno stuff playing this time around was quite compelling and added quite a bit to the movie.<br/><br/>This might be one of those movies that improves with repeated viewings. (like the 1st ""Star Trek"" movie,""Kung Pow"", and ""Hellraiser IV""). Since I know where the highlights are, I can sit patiently through the dull and irritating spots since I know that a good bit is coming up soon. I hope so,anyway."

I heard that the actors just got together whenever they had a free moment, but that is no excuse for the poor planning and execution. What on earth was that scene with Robbie Coltrane meant to be about? I kept thinking I must have fallen asleep and missed great big chunks as it swept chaotically from one incoherent scene to another. Just awful! Furthermore, Don Cheadle's cockney accent, well it left me speechless,right up there with Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. I cannot imagine why the head bods in the studio did not decide to shelve this project, they must have been hoping to pad out their box office numbers.

Catherine did a wonderful job in her role as Agent Isabel Lahiri, because of her aloof, sexy, cold attitude toward the other characters. I commend her ability to be able to not be very nice to Brad Pitt and George Clooney in the movie, because I sure wouldn't be able to! *SPOILER HERE, DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT VIEWED OCEAN'S TWELVE: (In addition, I was so happy to see her and Brad get together in the end!!)* George and Brad reprised their skills as thieves, and their characters looked like they knew exactly what they were doing all of the time, which gives a sense of security. Ocean's Twelve also has a very intriguing plot line, though at times a little confusing. I sometimes was like ""What?"" and had to rewind it a couple of times. My brother watched it with me and was very confused: ""Wait, so it was Ocean's Eleven at first, and then the old guy dropped out, but then the old guy dropped back in, and then did Isabel??"" I was just like....um, yeah, okay. This is not a good movie to watch if you are not very sharply observant, or if you get confused easily. But if you love a briskly entertaining movie with lots of mystery and intrigue (and you don't mind rewinding back a few times) then Ocean's Twelve is the movie for you! :)"

A few other nods to other films, like the laser dance Cassel does mocks Zeta-Jones in Entrapment. Actually, Cassel (or his stunt double) is consistently watchable, at least someone is having fun. Some of the cameos actually have some life, a few of the stars actually have enough dialog or action to occasionally show some chops. All the heists are boring.

It took me over 50 minutes to get into the storyline and after I've accomplished that, I had to keep my head together not to miss anything. What were that saying?

I think the intention must have been to confuse the viewer and thus maintain mystery to the end. The confusion part stuck, the mystery was why on earth the movie was released. Zeta-Jones was a pretty growth attached for...well, who knows what for. The ""plot"" was like walking a maze and bumping your nose at every turn, not because of clever writing, but because confusion for its own sake is chaos. The script itself was undoubtedly written by a committee who each took a segment, forgot to check in with each other, and wrote something that involved characters who shared at least the same name.<br/><br/>Ocean's Eleven had a tight, fast, understood plot. The surprises fit with the foundation of viewer understanding of what was going on. If that element of comprehension doesn't underly what is up on the screen, all you get is a jumble...all you get is ""Ocean's Twelve."" <br/><br/>Isn't it just sad that Julia played Tess playing Julia? I was embarrassed. How much funnier if they had implied Tess looked like a movie star (could pull off a ""lookie-Loo"") and then dressed her up like Gweneth Paltrow.

","I can't comment on the entire film as I turned it off in utter boredom after only 40 minutes. First, when Benedict comes to find the 11, one by one, in different cities in undramatic (except for where he shows up at Danny & Tess's place), there is just no threat, peril, or drama whatsoever. He calmly requests to be re-payed. I guess the treat is implied by the use of his new cane.<br/><br/>Later, the thieves (yes all ELEVEN, one by one) go though how much money they individually owe-a good time to leave, get popcorn, do your taxes. Later, Brad Pitt suggests they just turn themselves in. Instead they decide to do several small heists to pay back what they owe. Why don't they just disappear again? This is like 'what not to do', Drama 101. All the scenes in the hotel room where the 11 are figuring out what to do feel real. Really real. Like you're watching a group of boring, everyday people muddle around, deciding what to wear to dinner.<br/><br/>Question to Steven Soderbergh: Why doesn't Benedict kidnap Tess and give them a week to come up with the money or he'll kill her? At least the stakes would be higher. Then the idea of an interpol-type group being concerned with a gentleman thief like the fox (instead of terrorists,etc.) was just too much. They could have solved this by having Catherine ZJ work for an insurance concern or private collector instead. I had to turn it off then. This movie truly sucked."

","""Ocean's 12"" was a horrible movie. It was what I consider a typical big budget Hollywood disaster. The story was lame, the acting was poor and what the hell is the appeal of Julia Roberts. Her lips are swollen and misshapen from collagen injections and her hair is thinning and limp looking. She looks tired and worn out not the beauty she is supposed to be in the movie. The trick of her playing herself was a ridiculous, self serving plot twist that was there only for the celebrity name dropping crowd. Bruce Willis should be embarrassed with his role in this crap. Catherine Zeta-Jones was pleasing to look at but her role and acting were on par with an after-school special. The plot was convoluted and supposedly full of twists. Here's a secret, plot twists must make sense. You can't just tell a totally different story after building up the heist so much. Why not have one of the, wasted, peripheral characters, (everyone was wasted and peripheral except for the big 3 names), invent an invisibility potion, drink it and just waltz in and steal the item. It would have made as much sense. The story told by the Night Fox and his laser dance was laughably lame. It ranks up there as one of the most ridiculous scenes I have seen lately. The camera work was amateurish and repetitive and the screenplay was written by a committee of no talent children. It was an awful, awful movie and should be an embarrassment to all involved.

","With Ocean's 11 making a big splash a few years ago with mixed collage of Hollywoods's finest, a sequel like this was inevitable. But, as most sequel go, it looks very good on paper, a high demand but rarely captures the original and this reunion is no different.<br/><br/>In Ocean's Reunion, Benedict finally finds the whereabouts of Ocean and his gang and gives them a two week deadline to come up with the money that was stolen (with interest.) While venturing to Europe to do some heists to pay off the debt, the gang finds out they have been set up by a rival thief in order to find out ""who's best."" Now it's race between Ocean and his crew and this thief going after the same prize, with the winner accepting the glory. Oh yeah, and if Ocean wins, the thief plans to pay Ocean's debt. No, I'm not making this up.<br/><br/>Ocean's 11 was a great movie because it had great actors with good acting(OK, except Clooney), excellent plot which was simple yet intriguing, very good dialog and most of a all, a satisfying ending. Now, take that and minus everything that was good about it, except the actors and add Catherine Zeta-Jones and you have Ocean's Reunion.<br/><br/>A had some major problems with Ocean's Reunion. Zeta-Jones's (who took a break from her T-Mobile commercials)was added in to play as a European detective tracking various thieves, more importantly she's shacking up with Pitt's character with them both of them playing a cat and mouse game throughout the the entire movie, because that's what the movie needed. Who knows, maybe I should give Sodenberg the benefit of the doubt and his script of ""Out of Sight"" somehow accidentally got mixed up with this one.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had with this reunion, besides the whole ""Thomas Crown Affair"" thing going on, was that Julia Robert's character, Tess, played Julias Roberts. Did you get that? In fact, the credits later on read: ""Introducing Tess as Julia Roberts."" What? In attempt to steal the prize Tess is brought in as Julia Roberts because Tess and Roberts kind of look alike, that's probably true because they're the same person. Then they topped off this calamity with a cameo of Bruce Willis who plays himself to spoil the gig. I was kind of shocked why Willis didn't recognize Matt Damon who played Linus because they were in the entire scene with him. Weird.<br/><br/>With all sarcasm aside, this was way too drawn out taking forever for the plot to emerge. There were also to many plot twists (which seems to a prerequisite these days) which makes the movie hard to follow. The ending is terrible, comparing nothing like the original. The movie also centered more on Pitt, Jones and the unknown thief when the movie should've been focused on Garcia's anger and revenge, the fact he he lost 167 million dollars and his woman. In fact, Garcia's revenge is limited to only the first 10 minutes of the movie. It also should've contained some comedic scenes while the crew worked together, but that never happened neither. For a movie that spent four years in the making, this was seriously disappointing. The spent more time reliving the success if the first and drawing audiences than actually making a riveting plot. It's worth a rental and that's it."

I guess it was supposed to be cute and cheeky for Julia's character to goof on the real Julia, but the scene with Bruce Willis doing a cameo as himself is truly asinine! <br/><br/>The first movie has Danny Ocean's crew pulling off an elaborate con, and when it is revealed how they pulled it off, the viewer kind of has a surprised and elated ""Eureka Moment."" In this movie, the elaborate con is so elaborate and drawn-out the viewer is looking for the solution just to get it over with.<br/><br/>The most stinging con job pulled off in this movie is that the viewer loses his admission/rental cost! <br/><br/>Oh, one good thing I can say about the movie however is that the score kicks butt!

I don't get me started about the editing..<br/><br/>The Acting.. Now I remember why George Clooney was known as Dr. Doug before he was an ""A"" list actor. If he can't manage a better performance than this, he should stick to tongue wrestling with Bill O'Reilly. Really, after Solaris, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and this stinker, I'm ready to crown Noah Wiley as the only star from ER to make it after ER... and thats based on his Librarian movie on TNT. I never thought the Peacemaker would be Dr. Doug's seminal work!<br/><br/>People, I love movies. But I sincerely have to warn anyone who expects anything close to the Vegas-Love Fest - completely enjoyable Oceans 11 to avoid this disaster!"
"filmbuff-36","5","1","2","18 April 2005"," A good cast's ego project calls horribly awry
","It's fitting that ""Ocean's 12"" is about a heist; it feels like someone stole the cast and crew from the first film and placed them in an inferior movie. With such a talented group of actors assembled, it's a shame that this sequel lacks the inspiration that fueled the original.<br/><br/>It's been three years since the team pulled off the $180 million heist in Las Vegas. Time has eventually caught up with them, and Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) demands payback for his embarrassment. He gives Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and the rest of the gang two weeks to make good on the money they've stolen, or he's going to have them killed.<br/><br/>So Ocean reassembles his team, including Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon), Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle), and the rest. They head off to Europe to make some fast cash and repay Benedict. But there's a small problem. A rival thief who goes by the alias Night Fox (Vincent Cassel) is the one who tipped off Benedict, and holds Ocean and his team at his mercy. In a bid to find out who is the best, the Night Fox challenges Ocean's Eleven to steal the same prize that he is seeking.<br/><br/>With no choice as to other jobs to take in such a short time, the team reluctantly accepts. However, a contingency pops up in the form of European detective Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a former acquaintance of Rusty's who has vowed to put the group behind bars. The team is forced to outwit both the Night Fox and Lahiri while still under the time limit imposed by Benedict.<br/><br/>""Ocean's 12"" can't be blamed for trying. The first film was lighthearted enough with likable characters, but was a fully realized story that didn't demand a follow-up. The sequel in turn strains for credibility, and has trouble finding a coherent plot. The actual heist this time seems like kiddie stuff compared to the ultra coordinated caper in the original.<br/><br/>Director Steven Soderbergh directs the film with the same indie flair he used in the original, but unfortunately, this time the plot comes crashing down on him. The story doesn't have the same fluid pace, and jumps around uncontrollably. Soderbergh does his best, and the parts that work are due to his vision, but he can't make the movie seem like anything more than just a series of interesting scenes.<br/><br/>All the actors give a fine performance, but their parts seem less polished this time around. Clooney, Pitt and Damon are fun to watch, but unfortunately, they overshadow the rest of the actors. In fact, Bernie Mac, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner and Shaobo Qin seem like they're hardly on screen at all. Julia Roberts returns in an almost thankless small part as Tess Ocean, who comes in to help the team. Cassel on the other hand is delightfully hammy.<br/><br/>But the characters can't really save a plot line that seems desperate. Some history tells the story behind that. The screenplay was once an original story, however Warner Bros. tapped the screenwriter to rewrite the story to fit a sequel for their hit original ""Ocean's 11."" This speaks volumes toward the sometimes shoddy storytelling and forced plot contrivances.<br/><br/>""Ocean's 12"" probably won't have the same lasting power as the original. It's certainly fun to watch, and the characters are still a joy to see in action, but the talent that is on screen and behind it is what's driving this film, because the plot sure isn't. There are some neat twists and turns along the path, but the real theft being committed here is on the audience, whose good memories of the first film have been stolen and replaced with this inferior sequel.<br/><br/>5 out of ten stars. Might have been way better if the actors and filmmakers were concerned with the audience having as much fun watching it as they had making it."

","Don't see Oceans Twelve. Wait, go see it. You'll like the part where you don't know what's going on the whole movie, and then you try to figure it out after it is over and become infuriated because there are too many aspects to remember, and when they are all remembered (replayed) they do not make sense. Just kidding, don't see it really. I thought that the first movie was good because it was cool and interesting seeing criminals perform a nifty stealing thing. I have a lot of dislike for oceans 12. The movie would be better in the hands of a different director. The first one was cool, the second one is not cool. I actually believe that the second movie is based on the first movie, in a really unique way. Because in the first movie the cut and dry of it is people tricking other people to get money. The difference of the second movie from the first is that the people being tricked are the ones paying to view the movie. I saw this movie before I went to sleep one night and it ruined my night and I stayed up longer just to write this."
"theseboots","5","1","2","8 April 2005"," A Movie Made For Its Own Stars
","Ocean's Twelve decidedly falls under the ""not as good as the original"" category, but this sequel was not without its own charm.<br/><br/>Acceptable, entertaining performances were turned in by the film's all-star cast. However, I felt that the entire movie was made FOR the film's stars. For example, if I were Julia Roberts (well, I wouldn't be writing this review right now) and I watched the film, I would love it - because it's filled with inside jokes and industry jokes that I personally find funny and probably helped craft. However, as the everyday audience member, the movie comes off as a little too eager to please its own people and not eager enough in being a great sequel.<br/><br/>With all that said, I think if you are a fan of the cast (because they do have arguably great on-screen chemistry), you will like Ocean's Twelve all the same. I had that one major problem with the movie, but I was definitely still entertained. Ladies (or gentlemen), the French guy was hot (or maybe not, I saw it when it came out in theaters and it's been awhile).<br/><br/>If you were a fan of the first movie and its cast - Ocean's Twelve is worth checking out - it won't be a total waste of time."
"SpiralWire","3","1","2","2 April 2005"," Needlessly complex - a highly irritating sequel
","What staggers me most about this film is that it was made by the same people who produced the fantastic Oceans Eleven three years previously. Where Ocean's Eleven was a film with a significant target (the money in the safe), and all the action and drama was leading toward that goal, its sequel is disjointed, aimless and highly confusing.<br/><br/>I defy anyone to tell me on the outset of the film what the thieves are going to steal. First it's one thing, then another, but it isn't really, and then it is. But as it turns out, it was something else, then it wasn't, then it was. Ad infinitum. I can't accurately describe the details because they were simply too muddled and poorly explained.<br/><br/>Another fault is the use of the characters. Where in Eleven there was a coherency in what each member of the team had to do, in Twelve we are shown a billion different plot strands that confuse their roles in the heist and even hide some members away for no real reason (Bernie Mac is put in jail a quarter of the way through and not seen again until the end. In essence, there are many pitfalls on their way that separate them all from each other. And that shouldn't happen, because the whole idea should be Twelve thieves working as a team - rather than some trying to complete one objective, and others getting on with something completely different. Or am I wrong?<br/><br/>Lastly, I found it highly annoying how many little plot strands were being introduced and never fully explained or concluded, and this served simply to make the movie quite unappealing. I just want to know why, when writing this film, they thought it would be cool to disjoint and confuse everything to a maximum degree.<br/><br/>Ultimately, confusing, aimless and not a patch on the original."

The reviews I read on it all made it seem enjoyable if forgettable.<br/><br/>While the first movie was fresh and funny, this movie was... lacking. It lacked plot, it lacked originality, it lacked good acting. It even lacked a steady camera man. While trying to make this movie seem fun and retro, they used a lot of tricks from 70's movies that are best forgotten. While trying to poke fun a recent ""Lost in translation"" they lost the audience. The entire movie lacked a point, in the end leave you wondering instead of satisfied.<br/><br/>What was worse was I actually had to leave the theater about 5 minutes before the movie ended because the camera was so shaky, my stomach couldn't handle it anymore.<br/><br/>Leave this movie on the shelf at the rental place.

"rogerdarlington","Null","1","2","22 February 2005"," 12 is an unlucky number
","A director of the calibre of Steven Soderbergh should stay clear of a re-make, but it worked handsomely with ""Ocean's Eleven"", and he should avoid like the plague a sequel, as proved by the bitter disappointment that is ""Ocean's Twelve"".<br/><br/>This is all style and no substance. The style comes from Soderbergh's lively camera-work, the location shooting in Amsterdam and Rome, and the re-engagement of all the stars from the original movie plus Catherine Zeta-Jones as the twelfth character. The lack of substance comes from the absence of set-piece action and a convoluted plot that involves too many flash-backs and twists. The dialogue is poor and the music is over-loud but, above all, the whole thing is totally derivative - of the first film, of ""The Italian Job"" (foreign gang in Italian city), of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" (male thief has relationship with female investigator), of ""Octopussy"" (theft of Fabergé egg), of ""Entrapment"" (cat burglar evading laser beams) and even ""Notting Hill"" (Julia Roberts playing herself).<br/><br/>For Soderbergh, twelve is clearly an unlucky number and he would be crazy to even think of ""Ocean's 13""."
"alex-216","4","1","2","22 February 2005"," Boring, predictable and incomprehensible in equal measure
","Too many famous faces trying to have their moment, so the film ends up as a game of spot the cameo. A lot of the characters seem to have nothing to do except stand around briefly. Is there anyone who hadn't guessed that Catherine Zeta-Jones' character was the master- thief's daughter within the first half hour? (so boring I can't remember their names). Several opportunities to make the plot both more interesting and more coherent were thrown away. And as for the ridiculous scene where Julia Roberts has to pretend to be Julia Roberts to Bruce Willis - please! Does anyone else feel this is an illegitimate tactic and cheap, cheap, cheap? Matt Damon just seems stupid and wasted, as is George Cluny, and even Brad Pitt seems to have lost his good looks and appears overweight, clumsy, much older than in Troy, and with grating mannerisms. Most of the rest of the team are redundant. Ocean's Eleven was just about believable, and it had a coherent core of scenes around the planning and execution of the robbery. This mish-mash lacks any central core scene, and long before it was over I was looking at my watch and thinking what could possibly happen to fill in the remaining time. 4 is a low vote for me, as my general attitude is that film is not an intellectual medium, it exists to pass a couple of hours on a Saturday pleasantly, and if it does that, fine.

","Danny Ocean has a problem. The casino boss that he and his band of thieves stole from wants his money back. Worse of all he wants it with interest, and all in two weeks. If Danny and his team want to stay alive, they have to come up with a way of getting the money to him fast, or they will be dead. Flying to Amsterdam, Rome, and Paris, Danny, Rusty and the rest of the team have to commit a series of robberies to raise the money and outdo not only their own high standards, but also their competition while all the time being watched by a sexy Interpol agent who is determined to bring them down. After the success of Oceans 11, the knives seem to have come out for Oceans 12 but I for one loved it.. This is a movie with more stars than an astrologist's convention, and with a sharp script and a glamorous location the film is always silky smooth .There is something about being a movie fan that lets you dismiss any stretch of a storyline or any leap of credibility as long as there is another celebrity guest appearance. You are simply along for a ride with some of the hottest and coolest movie stars going, and if you don't feel like a star struck groupie by the end than you are probably not putting enough salt on your popcorn. What Clooney is doing with Oceans 12 is much the same that another actor in the early eighties did when he was at the top of the Hollywood tree. Burt Reynolds was the number one movie star in the world when he made Cannonball Run. The film was not meant to win awards, but instead break box office records and let fans take in Dean Martin, Burt Reynolds, Roger Moore, Jackie Chan and Farrah Fawcett all in the same frame. This is what Clooney is doing, letting you in on a fun picture that is so wrapped up in a Hollywood sixties style that it just needed Burt Bacharach to throw a melody to it. In a film filled with movie stars none look more quintessentially iconic than Brad Pitt, whose clothes and sunglasses say more about his characters state of mind than any dialogue falling from his lips. Matt Damon, fresh from his Bourne Supremacy, here plays the much less intense Linus, who just wants to take leadership, while Catherine Zeta Jones is drop dead gorgeous as a Interpol agent whose interrogation you would be happy to surrender to. Unfortunately the critics have rounded on the film attacking it for the very thing that seems to set it out for, it's intense style, and blatant use of star power. True, having Julia Roberts play a woman named Tess who in turn pretends to be Julia Roberts may be a tad smug, but by then you've bought into the whole Hollywood tours vibe and the next famous face is one more to tick off on your list. Even Albert Finney makes an appearance, although Bruce Willis moonlighting as himself may have given the critics added venom to their rage. But so what? Oceans 12 is a cool film for all star struck fans amongst us, ,those that aren't, please leave quietly"

I don't pretend to be a critic (like many on this site seem to think they are) but I cannot believe from what I have read that some people actually think this is a good film. As for the argument that you need to be intelligent to watch this film, that is absolutely rubbish, this film insults my intelligence!! This film was just an excuse for Clooney and his gang to rake in a few more millions for their retirement funds and to have a nice vacation in Europe! The first film was awful but this one was beyond belief at least the first film had a decent structure to it and that was only because it was a remake.<br/><br/>So much of this film was nonsense, why did Ocean's 11 have to pay the money back within 2 weeks? Was Benedict who is a casino owner going to have them all killed? Why would he care anyway he is supposedly rich beyond belief and claimed all the money he lost through insurance anyway? How could someone get through a secure area with laser beams that move randomly? Why would a woman in charge of ""Europol"" suddenly start mixing with criminals at the end? What was with the ending anyway? Bottom line, the script was useless, the plot was ridiculous, the film is full of flaws, the constant close ups were a joke.

","I have to admit to having heard a very negative review before watching this film so although my expectations weren't high, I was prepared to put it to the back of my mind and watch it objectively. Like the first, the film was quite good fun (Ocean's Eleven was excellent). However, I have four major gripes that ruined this film for me:<br/><br/>1. What the hell were they thinking of with the Julia Roberts thing? Can't find a better way out of a problem with the plot? No problem, resort to the most crass and smug solution and everyone will think how clever we are. Wrong. 2. Gaping plot holes. Was the laser alarm system random or wasn't it? If it was as they said (i.e. random), how can Vincent Cassel have planned his little dance through it? And, how does Matt Damon's mum actually get them out at the end? 3. Camera-work. Is it me, or have film-makers resorted to camera-work designed to make the audience feel as nauseated as possible? 4. The plot. Ultra-confusing. Far too much going on. No doubt it will make a little more sense after repeated viewings but I don't think many people will feel that inclined to watch it again.<br/><br/>Oh, and why did they choose Arsenal?<br/><br/>On the plus side, I had to completely switch my opinion of three actors.<br/><br/>Catherine Zeta Jones. I thought she was excellent in this although her welsh accent peeped out a few times. Boy, did she look good! Matt Damon. Because he wasn't playing Golden Boy and showing us how white his teeth were, I ended up rather liking him. Brad Pitt. Spent the whole movie trying giving everyone mouth half-open, sultry looks. What a waste of a good actor. <br/><br/>Anyway it was quite good fun with great locations and a host of stars but is a very poor follow-up to an excellent original. Stephen Soderbergh should have donated this one to Alan Smithee. For God's sake, don't make Ocean's Thirteen."

","12 is the new 11. What kind of tagline is that? While this movie may have one of the worst taglines ever, it was a sequel to a fun little heist flick called Ocean's 11. While it could have been done a little bit better, Ocean's 11 was a very fun caper movie with a great cast. Ocean's 12 got an even bigger cast, but I did have some skepticism as to the plot. Regardless, it had been three weeks since I had seen a movie in the theatre (as neither Alexander nor Closer was playing and nothing good was out the first week). So is 12 the new 11?<br/><br/>Plot: .8/2: Terry Benedict (Garcia) is angry. Since mastermind Danny Ocean (Clooney), problem solver Rusty Ryan (Pitt), rookie Linus Caldwell (Damon), explosives expert Basher Tarr (Chealde), brothers Virgil (Affleck) and Turk Malloy (Caan), millionaire Reuben Tishkoff (Gould), computer nerd Livingston Dell (Jemison), inside man Frank Catton (Mac), grease man Yen (Qin) and old pro Saul Bloom (Reiner) robbed his three casinos out of $160 million in one night, he has been looking for an opportunity to get back, regardless of the fact that he got paid back from insurance. When rival French thief the Nightfox (Cassel), who wants to prove he is a better thief than the 11, gives him their locations, he pays each of them a visit and tells them they have two weeks to pay him back with interest. Tishkoff is the only one who can afford to pay back his share, so they decide to go to Amsterdam to find an opportunity to make some cash quick. Unfortunately, Saul bows out. They meet with Matsui (Coltrane), who gives them a job worth 2.5 million euro and chances to make more if they succeed. Unfortunately, the Nightfox beats them to the punch and Europol gets involved, with the case led by Rusty's former squeeze Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones). Frank, who left a boot print, is quickly arrested and Matsui tells Isabel that Rusty and Ocean are involved. Ocean meets with Nightfox, who tells him that if he can get an Italian Fabergé egg before the Nightfox does, he'll pay off Benedict for him. For all necessary purposes, the plot works well, but there are problems. Much of the plot is easily predictable, aside from a few key points. Most of the 11 get painfully little to do, especially Frank who gets taken out of the movie barely a quarter into it. Linus is the only one who does more than he did in the original. Tess Ocean (Roberts) is left out for a while, but her part in the plot twist near the end is both good for the plot and the comedy. The Nightfox rivalry seems to be right out of Heist Movie 101. There is also a bit about Isabel's father that anyone with half a brain can successfully predict right off the bat. The plot is OK for a sequel, but by making half the cast seem to be there for the sake of being there, it loses some credit.<br/><br/>Comedy: 1.2/2: Ocean's Twelve is mediocre as a comedy. It has it's share of good moments, such as the opening sequence, Topher Grace's cameo and Tess' disguise, and really doesn't have any bad jokes, but it fails to use opportunities often. For example, Bernie Mac is a wasted opportunity. He is a great stand-up comic, but they never use him for anything funny. On the other hand, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan are still funny. It does have some good moments and thankfully doesn't do anything here badly, it just doesn't try often enough here.<br/><br/>Heist: 1.8/2: The actual thefts are great. The only complaint is that not everyone was used. While they may have had another purpose somewhere, Cheadle, Mac, Jemison, Reiner, Gould and Qin are not used to do their areas of expertise in any of the actual thefts. That's 6/11 that don't get to do their job. A little high, huh? Still, the thefts are interesting if not enthralling.<br/><br/>Acting: 1.9/2: While having an all-star cast does reduce the believability, it does increase the fun. Damon (The Bourne Identity) is the only one that shines here, playing the wide-eyed rookie Linus. Pitt (Se7en) is still as slick as he was in the original, and Affleck (Chasing Amy) and Caan (Sonny) are good, even though they get few scenes to shine in. Clooney (Solaris) is not nearly as witty as in the first, but he is still the best choice possible for Danny Ocean. Garcia (Godfather III) is menacing in his first few scenes, but disappears through the rest of the movie. Cheadle (Swordfish) still has the funny voice. Zeta-Jones (The Mask of Zorro) is good, but nothing spectacular. Bruce Willis has a hilarious cameo as himself. The cast isn't here to make you believe the characters, but it does add to the fun factor greatly.<br/><br/>Entertainment: 2/2: Ocean's Twelve is the kind of movie anyone can enjoy. It's audience encompasses just about everyone. While it won't gain quite as much acclaim as 11, it still is a fun caper flick.<br/><br/>Total: 77%: Ocean's Twelve is overall a good movie, but falls short of being as cool or fun as the original. It owes it's credibility thanks to a great cast and a couple smart heists. While I won't say to go see it in theatres unless you really liked the first, this is definitely worth a rental."

I've never like movies that rely too much in plot twists. I eventually don't care about what happens anymore. Plot twists are good when they make sense, they are not predictable and when there's not many of them. Well, I didn't think the twists were predictable, but nonsensical and too many they were. With so many things going on, the great cast doesn't really have a chance to really shine. The cameos... well, I did like Bruce Willis' cameo, but the other one... it was completely unnecessary. It's a real shame because I really LOVED Ocean's Eleven, not a masterpiece, but a greatly entertaining movie. In this sequel, the cast isn't really going for the golden egg or the safe box...

","My wife and I found the Oceans 11 remake entertaining. This evening we saw the sequel, which is called Oceans 12. This is hyped as a movie where the cast are all having a lot of fun and the audience experiences their fun. They must have been totally bored having this fun as it was one of the most boring films I have ever seen. And - to be honest - I generally can find SOMETHING redeeming in most films.<br/><br/>My wife first said she didn't find it as boring as I said it was but then she admitted that she had spent a long time thinking about a meal at home for some guests in great detail. You don't do this if you find the film interesting.<br/><br/>I saw Matt Damon on Leno (I think it was) and he made a comment about the ""all having fun"" thing. He said that Cannonball Run II was likely the film that the cast most enjoyed making. Implicit here was ""and what was that worth?"" <br/><br/>Leno kept referring to the film as an ""art house film"" and my impresion was that he meant that it was far from being one of these. But, now that I have seen it, I understand that he actually meant that the camera-work etc. do resemble what he might associate with that type of film.<br/><br/>I think Damon and Leno might have been telling us what they actually thought about Oceans 12.<br/><br/>I must admit that this film was worse than Cannonball Run II as the plot was total confusion and the film was made as if it were an early Danish ""Dogma"" film with intentionally shaky camera and bad lighting and awful sound.<br/><br/>With such a ""star studded"" cast - you would expect that the villain was also someone ""worthy"" ie well known rather than the man who usually does the voice-over for Hugh Grant in French dubbed films.<br/><br/>One little note about the ""surprise guest"". I really wonder how many of this film's target group know this elder actor."

Funny thing is that the plot seemed all wonderful and elaborate but when you really think about it, what was actually going on? None of it really makes sense to me. That thing with the egg... that was just so confusing. Well I didn't understand what was going on, but maybe I was just too busy throwing popcorn at people (teehhe), maybe that gives you a clue as to how much entertainment value this film actually gives you.

","This was a tremendous disappointment. After the wonderful Ocean's 11 I was really looking forward to this, the sequel; instead the first hour at least was totally disjointed and largely incomprehensible. It was impossible to 'get into' the film and empathise with the characters. We seemed to be with no character long enough to either like or dislike them, and certainly not long enough to understand them. The plot, if there was one, was flimsy and I really got to the couldn't care less stage pretty early on. The second hour was somewhat better but it was still very disjointed with an awful lot remaining unclear. Whereas Ocean's 11 got everyone involved in the plot, in this one it was simply a matter of wondering what was happening and not really caring about the answer in any case. A big disappointment. I am not looking forward to Ocean's 13, 14 and 15."

Skip to when Andy Garcia tracks down all of the gang. Basher who was known in oceans 11 for his funny phrases(were in barney) starts off swearing more than 50 cents . The amazing Yen is suddenly the amazing Chinese ""ganster"" and Livngston is doing god knows what in another kill its self scene. You expect the story to pick up and when they're announcing they are going to steal 3 highly valued products you get prepared for them planning then at the end somehow using the grace they did in oceans 11 pull it off. instead you get Julia Roberts playing the worst actress...herself, random OVERstreatched Bruce Willis moments, barely any Bernie mack(Frank Catton), Elliott Gould(Reuben Tishkoff) and Carl Reiner(Saul bloom). Then we get hit with some random gay acrobat from Euorpe who ""challenges the gang to a rob off and the winner gets the coveted title of BEST Thief. after that oceans 12 just takes off towards a spiraling black hole. the movie drifts so far from crime that you end up thinking you accidentally walked into 13 going on 30(or 50 in Clooney's case). it was cute in oceans 11 where you saw how well Rusty and Danny knew each other but in oceans 12 you have no friggin clue whats going on when they speak to one another. Matt Damon's character of Linus Caldwell stayed the same from oceans 11 to 12 and this movie saw a lot more of his but his role crashed and burned with a random escape with his mother. The actual robbery in this film is basically told by Danny and Tess when they visit with the euro thief man. in oceans 11 they start with the idea for the crime in the beginning, planning in the middle, and BAM great crime finish leaving you to fill in the blanks. in oceans 12 they start with the crime, completely lose sight of it, then ends leaving you thinking of what you could've bought at McDonald's with the money you just wasted. The whole i stole you stole it but i stole it first idea was poorly placed in this film. it lead you to believe that this movie was going to end big and great like oceans 11 but instead the real crime in switching bags with random man on a bus.

Throughout the movie, you could see them desperately trying to be cool and slick (which is another way of saying they ended up being neither). The following are only some reasons why I hated this movie:<br/><br/><ul><li>No story!

"Robert_duder","5","1","2","4 January 2005"," What can one expect?
","If you read my review for Ocean's 11 you'll much better understand this review for it's follow up. You can understand why they would all want to make a sequel and hats off to them for bringing back the entire cast including director Stephen Soderbergh, how often is that doable? As expected, or at least as I expected the follow up to a great movie in 2001 falls short in many ways. The 2001 remake was made to bring together some of Hollywood's actors and have a great time. They lost this magic doing the sequel, in fact for most of the film the cast seems downright depressed.<br/><br/>The story picks up three years after the original. Terry Benedict has finally tracked down Danny Ocean and his eleven accomplices who robbed him of 160 million dollars. Now that he's found them he wants every penny back plus interest to the tune of about 198 million dollars or he's going to kill every last one of them. So Danny and Rusty hatch a new scheme (no pun intended.) The twelve of them go to Europe in order to find a big heist to pay back Benedict. They find two of the world's master thieves and get into a competition with the one they call Nightfox. If Ocean and his men can boost a precious egg from high security before Nightfox does, Nightfox will pay their debt to Benedict.<br/><br/>I think Soderbergh attempted to not recreate the first film and simply redo scenes using the same style but by doing that he actually lost what the original movie had. The plot was not nearly as good and much of the film was just very pointless. In the original, everyone and everything had a purpose. Every thing we as the audience saw happen, even if we thought it was an error turned out to be part of a clever and elaborate plan. In Ocean's 12 we don't even see them pull the heist and nothing they do has anything to do with the plot or plan. In the original each character had his own purpose, his own job and in the sequel, none of them had any reason to be there whatsoever. The first robbery they pull in Europe has no bearing or reason behind it. Clooney's character seems bored and rushed. The addition of Hollywood heavyweight Catherine Zeta Jones was a brilliant addition of the ex-girlfriend of Pitt's character who happens to work for Europol as a detective. She's always hot on their trails but that part of the plot is badly underused. The one thing Soderbergh did reuse and try and capture was the blend of on screen/off screen and having Julia Roberts' character Tess Ocean sneak in the museum portraying someone she looked a lot like (Julia Roberts) was a good laugh and very cheeky although rather unbelievable. Cameo's were no less brilliant in this one having the amazing Bruce Willis join in briefly, Albert Finney in a small role, and bringing back Scott Schwartz for his role as Bruiser, however briefly was humorous. The film is not an entire write off but that's mostly because it's fun to see the whole entire cast back, not letting anyone go. The plot and writing is where this film loses out but I'm not sure they could have done it any better for a film that didn't really warrant a sequel. I love sequels and I would see the next 20 Oceans film no matter how bad they were so let's hope they STOP making them here so I don't have to subject myself to that. 5/10"

Instead of a clever script we get 2 hours of cameos, in-jokes, George Clooney and Brad Pitt smirking, some impossible to follow story about cat burglars and interpol, and beautiful shots of Europe ruined by an overuse of hand-held camera, and a god awful sequence about Julia Roberts worshiping her own celebrity status.<br/><br/>It may have been fun for the cast and crew, but not for the audience"

I found it to be somewhat entertaining toward the end, but still, not as good as the first. I'd rather have just seen Ocean's Eleven again and be able to forget Ocean's Twelve came out. The plan just isn't as smart, and the camera work just isn't that great. Especially when they show a shot of every single character one by one, which is done at least three times. It's like they were adding it to kill time. A very wonderful cast, and director, but not a wonderful film.

It was like trying to watch 'Down with Love' mixed in with a generic 'we have to steal something but there is a catch' movie, except the badness factor was cumulative. If you want entertainment of similar quality, watch the Simpsons 'Cat Burglar' episode about 5 times in succession. But at least that was funny. However, in its defence, many movies have produced substandard sequels and this only follows the trends. SPOILER TO FOLLOW...

"Halfwaytoheaven","5","1","2","27 December 2004"," At least it isn't formulaic
","Ocean's Twelve departed from sequel tradition by completely abandoning everything that worked from the original(or, the remake of the original, as it is). This time, the smooth, professional cast of thieves comes back to stumble around like amateurs. In addition, we get Catherine Zeta-Jones as the most confidently inept corrupt detective in cinema history, and Vincent Cassel as a rival thief with incomprehensible abilities of stealth and acrobatics to rival any martial arts master, and the wounded pride of a school boy. Oh, and Julia Roberts returns in what surely must have been the most challenging role of her career. The plot from the original (remake) was full of holes, but they were forgivable holes. This time, even the motives are questionable. Would a professional thief really break the ""code"" and reveal his colleagues to one of their victims because his mentor snubbed him? Would the sinister Terry Benedict really settle for a monetary settlement from said thieves when the last time someone cheated in his casino he, ""had the bank seize his house and bankrupted his brother-in-law's tractor dealership""? The heist itself isn't nearly as fascinating this time around, mainly because there isn't one, unless you count a brief scuffle on a bus. So what is there to watch in this heist film without a heist? Well, there is the struggle of lovable young Linus as he attempts to become a criminal mastermind in his own right and move out of the shadow of both his father and Danny Ocean. There is the slightly amusing sub-plot of the Amazing Yen getting lost in a suitcase. And a goofy French thief hangs around, pestering the beleaguered gang, sort of like Katherine Hepburn in ""Bringing Up Baby"". Oh, and there's this Darth Vader sort of moment at the end that I suppose was intended to be emotionally significant, but failed utterly. When Ocean's Eleven came out, I figured Steven Soderbergh had made some pretty important films lately, and was taking a well-deserved diversion. Playtime, however, is over; his remarkable skills should be better spent than this."

","If you haven't seen the previous installment ( Ocean's 11 ), this sequel is actually decent entertainment. For those of us who enjoyed the brilliantly conceived casino heist in Ocean's 11, and who were hoping for an encore, Ocean's 12 is a disappointment, like most recent sequels. This franchise main theme, as enunciated in the first installment, is spectacularly clever heists by a crew of world class robbers. Moviegoers expect sequels to live up to the established theme. Ocean's 12 fails to abide by this principle. There is no substantive heist in Ocean's 12 to speak of. Robbery scenes, if any at all, are rushed, and hardly completed by even more rushed retrospective/flashback sequences. The folks who produced this flick just couldn't muster the patience requisite to achieve a comprehensive heist scene which made Ocean's 11 so compeling. The Break dancing inspired Yoga job, against a security laser barrier, by the French master robber, is so not believable as to be galactically pathetic. You actually feel robbed after watching that sub-moronic scene. This is an hackneyed sequel, probably rushed to the screen to ensure that the all star cast here is retained to capitalize on the success of Ocean's 11, and what we get is pure cinematic platitude. If you'd like to moderately enjoy this film, you must forget about the previous installment."

I think if you enjoyed the first part because of the sharpness with which the team carries out the heist and the smoothness with which everything gels together, then you just might be disappointed by the sequel. On the other hand, if you found it brilliant more because of the actors, then Ocean's Twelve might work for you. I belong to the former category and I couldn't help feeling exasperated at times while watching this movie. The zing's just not there!<br/><br/>**Might contain spoilers ahead** There are some really great scenes, with my favorite being the whole Bruce Willis cameo. The Julia Roberts as Julia Roberts thing was really funny. The story in itself is great. Brad Pitt gets more screen space at the expense of Mr Clooney. Catherine Zeta Jones does a competent job. Matt Damon is hilarious as the nervous guy. The rest of the cast is fairly decent too. But the screenplay misses. And that costs the movie a lot.

I was so disappointed when I got home that evening. I half hope that Steven will make an Ocean's 13 to make up for this disaster. The camera angles were horrible; I mean what was up with the sideways thing when the airplane was coming into the airport? In addition, it kept shaking too; I had to look away from the screen to prevent getting a headache. The music was pretty bad. I know it's supposed to go with the whole ""we're in Europe thing"" but it's not crime/caper music really, and I think that's more important than the setting. And the plot. The plot wasn't as strong as it should have been. It felt more like the producers were just trying to make some more money, but they ran out of good ideas. Paying Benedict back? I don't think a gang of thieves would really want to do that. And bringing ""The Night Fox"" and Isabel Lahiri into the picture doesn't help it much; it just complicates things and makes it hard to follow. Like in the beginning, scenes just flashed before your eyes, and the only thing that's flashing through your head is ""Huh???"" And because it's confusing, you don't figure out how they actually did the job. In 11, their plan was clearer even if they didn't actually tell you. In 12, even with the flashback at the end, it's hard to comprehend. Did I mention how dull it was yet? You find your mind wandering, thinking about dinner and what you're going to do when you get home that night. The only good thing I found about this movie was the cast, but even Brad didn't look his sharpest. Yeah, it's a caper film, but for some reason, even through some funny lines here and there, Ocean's 12 lacks the charm and entertaining spark that viewers loved in Ocean's 11. In short, don't bother to go and see it, it'll just ruin your day. 6/10 Stars"

","First of all, let me make it clear that I really liked Ocean's Eleven. I liked the cleverness of the script, most of the characters involved (even Julia Roberts), and the crafty workmanship of the movie that left me with ""aha"" and ""wow"" at the end.<br/><br/>So having said that, I really didn't like Ocean's Twelve at all. I got tired about half an hour into it, and I would have fallen asleep had I been sitting on my couch instead of a theater seat in the last 30 minutes. The plot was way too convoluted and unfocused that even after all of the explanation (quite a lengthy one at that), I was still confused. When later I thought about it more and got around to understanding it, I couldn't help but question why certain things had to be done in a certain way, and no answer I could come up with was good. That's when I became angry for paying $8 to watch the damn movie.<br/><br/>Some movies you can predict the twist in the middle of it and still enjoy (as many movies do this). Some movies you have no idea what's going on, and still have no clue far afterwards but nevertheless enjoy (see Mulhallond Drive). This is a movie that does none of that, and in the end I really didn't care whether Ocean's Twelve became Ocean's Zero (and remember, I like these characters). And what I couldn't stand throughout the movie is the smugness that saturates the writing and direction, as if the cast was constantly reminding itself and letting the audience know that they are cool. It's like hearing an inside joke that you have no idea what it means, and then when you are let in on it, it's not really funny at all."

","I watched Ocean's 11 a day before I went to see Ocean's 12 and think the latter is quite frankly rather confusing - not to say boring. Let me explain: 11 started with the introduction of characters that Ocean brings together to plan a heist. The potential lies in the curiosity of the viewer to see how everything (and everyone) comes together to tackle the job - robbing a sleazy and unsympathetic casino owner. The team plans and executes like a swiss watch mechanism, and the outcome is stunningly refreshing. The way everything played together - the technically refined procedure and the witty remarks along the job was simply exciting, suspenseful, and humorous. Not so 12. Twelve seems as if the actors voices are overdubbed a pointless alignment of film sequences. The plot never unfolds, and the music unsuccessfully attempts to fill in the gaps. Why? Because the idea is weak to begin with. Benedict wants his money back --- BIG DEAL (NOT). With the intelligence and team integrity of 11 it seems like a farce that Benedict would snuff them all out. It's plain and simply unrealistic. A better movie would have been for Ocean's 11 to reunite to plan something outrageously different. Without Benedict (by the way and no pun intended: Sauce Hollandaise in the ""Egg Benedict"" recipe is voluntary and not recommended for the health conscious movie goer.) All in all a weak sequel. Too many details, no coherent plot, a real sleeping-pill using a James Bond motif as main feature = Egg. Way uncool, a real waste of time and money..."

","No one's ever going to accuse ""Ocean's Eleven"" of aspiring to greatness - that's what made it great. It was mild-mannered, lighthearted fun with great performances, a fun soundtrack, and one hell of a heist. In other words, it worked because no one tried too hard to make it work. ""Ocean's Twelve"" sadly, seems to be the opposite: a bunch of storytellers working too hard to make something look effortless.<br/><br/>I keep reading all these interviews with the stars of ""Ocean's Twelve"" who talk about what a great time they had making the movie. It definitely looks that way. They're funny and charming - I mean, c'mon, it's Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. These people BLEED charm. To say nothing of Matt Damon, Bernie Mac and Elliot Gould (who actually invented charm sometime before the birth of Christ). But all the charm in the world, all the winking and giggling and joking and fun you can possibly have isn't going to make up for a crappy script. Which is really what ""Ocean's Twelve"" is.<br/><br/>So basically the guy that Danny Ocean's gang ripped off last time, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia, with little to do but fume) has tracked them all down and demanded they get him his money back or he'll have them all killed. Ocean (George Clooney) and partner in crime Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) get everyone back together to go pull a heist in Europe to pay what they owe, plus interest.<br/><br/>The plan, at first, is to rip off an antique collector of the first-ever stock certificate. The plan goes perfectly until they get there and find that another thief, the legendary Night Fox, has gotten there ahead of them. The Night Fox leaves a note in its place challenging Ocean to a thieves' duel of sorts. If Ocean's gang wins, the Night Fox will pay their debt to Benedict. If the Night Fox wins, Ocean's gang dies.<br/><br/>Ocean, with little choice, accepts. Meanwhile, Isabel Lahiri of Interpol (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a former lover of Rusty's and the current pursuer of the Night Fox, catches wind of the contest and resolves to catch everyone in the same net. Let the confusion begin.<br/><br/>The brilliance of the twist in the first film was what made it great. It was genuinely unexpected, at least to me. All the fun stuff that came before that was icing - the twist was the cake. Here, there's plenty of icing, but no cake. There's a twist of course, one you see coming a mile away. It's not the same. It's like a one-night stand that was really terrific, but you try it again, and it's just not clicking.<br/><br/>There was, however, an inspired bit involving Danny's wife Tess (Julia Roberts) and the part she ends up having to play in the proceedings. It's very amusing and very charming. Completely unbelievable, but it gets you a bearable twenty minutes closer to the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Don't bother with it. It'll just make you wish for what might have been."

","i read from an article that soderbergh made a conscious effort to not make 12 the same as 11. well he did a good job. instead of making a clever, well working ensemble cast, witty film, he made this movie that unfortunately share's the same name as 11. all the best parts about 11 have been removed. andy garcia's big role as the suave villain terry benedict, is now replaced by some french guy who's really good at break dancing past lasers and just happens to have $192 million on hand. everyone's role from 11 is gone or completely diminished. the reason 11 worked was because everyone had a specific role and expertise. in 12, everyone seems to just be a button man, a crony. there is no need for a money man, an acrobat, a demolitionist, a hacker. the only thing that was truly skill needed in the final heist (the 3d egg) wasn't even provided by one of the 12! unfortunately, this was one of the few movies where i wanted it to be over even before the halfway mark. even the Julia Roberts playing Julia Roberts was only mildly amusing. a sad blemish on the name of Ocean. 3/10"

The beginning is kind of fun and cool as we revisit the ""Ocean's Eleven"" and see where they are in their lives. Yet as the plot thickens, it weakens, into a horrible twist that they throw in at the end which I saw coming a mile away. Of course everything at the end is sweet and great, and I about gagged.

A few of these moments for effect are fine, but Soderbergh overused the technique, much to the detriment of the film. The absolutely ridiculous ""dance"" through the laser beam sequence made the audience at my screen just break out in laughter.

The pace was just off. I needed to see the main characters jumping ship from their current living situations within the first 10 minutes. I don't think I needed to see Benedict visiting every thief in the beginning. We already know they are caught.

The story line plot holes, inconsistencies and ultimate unbelievable coincidences and explanations all contributed to a feeling of not so much a light hearted romp, but rather a muddling mess. ----SPOILER ALERT---. This was summed up at the films end, with not only a very confusing and under explained outcome of the movies central heist, but the way Catherine Zeta Jones' character decided to throw her whole career away (and indeed her whole characters purpose in the film) based on one quick conversation at an airfield was for me just plain silly.<br/><br/>On the positive side there were few funny moments in it (particular from Matt Damon) and the cast looked great, especially Catherine Zeta Jones who was simply stunning  I'd love to see sequel just to look at her again.

Banking on the mound of talent they have with Iceans 12 is that almost everyone involved forgets to try.

And a wonderful as always turn out from Ms. Roberts. the films lies still as a conceited homage to improvised humor and directionless direction. Even the score, and supposedly raw and realistic cinematograpghy seem manufactured and tailor made to fit a certain Hollywood damn. all the finesse and fun of the first movie are gone leaving it only with a monstrous helping of tedious style and substance. The plot or lack there of, of this one concerns the man they formerly robbed finding them and wanting his money back in two weeks. Now as always in these movies you can expect some twists but these are short on originality and long on predicatability. Take from me they should have stopped at 11.

Instead of adding another ""let's get quickly into the next casino or bank"" story like Rififi, Topkapi, Mission Impossible and, of course, Ocean's Eleven (old and new), Soderbergh's film rather pays tribute to Norman Jewison stylish luxury crime comedy ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" (1968), that was rather focusing on flashbacks, split screen action and a stylish surrounding instead of an extended plot.<br/><br/>The story itself is not that important for the movie, but instead the film is battered with great scenes, witty dialogues, funny encounters, stylish settings, creative editing and camera ankles (check out the great sideway shot of an incoming airplane). The pacing is fast, and if you get lost within the sometimes illogical storyline you won't miss it, as there is always much going on here.<br/><br/>The main actors Clooney, Damon, Pitt and Co. have much funny playing their roles, and even the rather boring and dull Julia Roberts has one really great scene when her character Tess is pretending to be.. guess... Julia Roberts in a hotel and museum scene. Bruce Willis (who has turned down Andy Garcia's role as casino owner in the first part) has a nice cameo in that scene, playing himself. Really funny! The supporting actors are also well-chosen. Catherine Zeta-Jones, playing a successful Europole inspector with leather coat, high heels and sexy hairstyle, is always bright and elegant. European actors Robbie Coltrane and Jerome Krabbe have also witty supporting appearances, and another big highlight is French actor Vincent Cassel, playing the elegant and arrogant master thief Night Fox (check out his great ""laser beam dance"" in the museum robbery!).<br/><br/>The settings of Amsterdam, Paris, Rome and the Lake Come in Italy are also well-chosen and add weight to Danny Ocean's stylish gang. Pay attention to the score, too - David Holmes, who also provided the scores for Ocean's Eleven and Out Of Sight, has composed the definite ""sixties retro easy listening lounge sound track"" - just like an acid version of Ennio Morricone or Lalo Schifrin in 1969... great stuff and very original so that you don't realize when some of the older compositions of John Schroeder, Piero Umiliani or Roland Vincent can be heard in between!<br/><br/>Enough for now, Ocean's Twelve is big fun to watch and one of my cinema highlights of 2004! I just wonder why it got so many bad reviews in the U.S.A. while the critics and audiences in Europe were much more positive and even enthusiastic about the film. Maybe they are more familiar with the settings, the style and the way of film making that Soderbergh chose for Ocean's Twelve... It's not just another conventional gangster movie rip-off, but a class of its own. I can't get enough of that... thank you, Mr Soderbergh!"

Also, the thing I liked about it was that it pretty much had an indy feel to it for me.

Off the bat Garcia solidifies himself as a hilariously droll comic actor; the sequences of him recruiting the team again shows not only his humour but also his imposing and powerful nature given how delicately he handles every encounter as if he knows how to get to them, he hasn't broken character from Eleven, he's still cool, he's the Twelfth member.
I don't have the time to explain why I love this European Crime Caper Con movie. Where 11 was a finely tuned machine of a movie, 12 had been designed to feel real, magical, but completely real. When Soderbergh does his one for the studio to make up for the (beautiful) bomb Solaris, he really still imbues it with his wit and verve and spirit and unique charm and skills. Another of it's greatest strengths is it's fourth wall bursting, winking script and cast. It's a film that knows itself, and entertains in a way that maybe no other film could ever do quite like this ever again."

","Ocean's 11 was a slick movie, ultra cool and up there with the best as regards superior remakes. Ocean's Twelve is a waste, a film coasting on star appeal, a picture desperately trying to cram as much into its screenplay for fear of failing.<br/><br/>The plot shoots off in a number of directions, yet incredibly it still wastes most of the cast who have all been held over from Ocean's 11. This time Catherine Zeta-Jones joins in for some weighty dressage and Vincent Cassel is along as some sort of break-dancing Raffles dude. There's the odd in-joke that works, while the by-play between the principal players (Clooney/Pitt/Damon) holds a modicum of entertainment value. However, once the dust settles on the myriad of schemes and scrapes, you are left with a sequel of a remake that is almost everything the other film was not. Boo. 4/10"
"Bruce722","3","1","3","23 July 2013"," Such a disappointing sequel.
","Ocean's Twelve gives ammunition to those who are against the concept of sequels. It started out ridiculous, dragged quite a bit, became mildly interesting, became even more ridiculous, then was stupid, and then finally even more ridiculous. The acting was once again fantastic but outside of a few main characters, none of the side characters seemed to get any further development or decent screen time. Bernie Mac and Don Cheadle especially seemed like almost wasted roles because they were both so underutilized. Yes, George Clooney and Brad Pitt got more screen time and Catherine Zeta-Jones got quite a bit as well but still, it felt like the great cast just wasn't used properly. The writing was the worst part though. It's almost like they said ""hey, let's make a movie and then if the ending doesn't work, let's just make some stupid stuff up and if it doesn't really make sense or seem plausible, who cares, at least we get the ending we want."""

","This one is just not as good as ""Ocean's Eleven"" but it's still a watchable movie just not all that good. All that cast and crew are back and although they all seemed to be having fun at what they are doing and having a good time that is mainly it. The cool characters tries uber hard to be cool, ""Ocean's Eleven"" just had the right amount of coolness when it comes to the characters. This one seemed to go a bit overboard. The story this time around is about the crew trying to get the amount of money they stole from Benedict or else it's their head. Which was bound to happen since they didn't focus on covering their tracks enough. Although Benedict got all his money back because of insurance. But there is also a rival thief and a female detective on their tail. Steven Soderbergh really did try to incorporate a good story in this one but it just isn't as exciting, entertaining and cool as ""Ocean's Eleven"". I know I am making references to ""Ocean's Eleven"" a lot but this is just not as good. This one mostly focuses in on the characters which is fine but it's just not that interesting. And the end when it all comes together is probably more absurd than ""Ocean's Eleven"". It's a watchable movie but I doubt I will be seeing this one again.<br/><br/>6.4/10"

","Oceans Twelve is not half bad but not that great either, but by the time you get to the end of the movie you feel so angry and bad as you have just come to realize that all the action and all the buildup that occurred in the middle was just a waste of your time.<br/><br/>The movie added a twist that made it look like you the viewer should have just fast forwarded to the end of the movie to see what the movie was all about. The Ocean's crew again was at it again, but this time the Terry Benedict (Andy García) is in on their game as he locates all eleven members of Danny Ocean's (George Clooney) gang, and demanded that they return the $160 million they stole from his casinos plus $38 million interest.<br/><br/>The Ocean's crew now short the money that they stole from Benedict, have to come up with another heist to be able to make up for the money that they stole from him. The movie is called Ocean's Twelve because of the inclusion of one more person to the crew, Julia Roberts joined in the gang, so as to be able to help make up the money for the crew.<br/><br/>The Ocean's Eleven still remained the same from the first movie: 1. George Clooney as Danny Ocean 2. Bernie Mac as Frank Catton 3. Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan 4. lliott Gould as Reuben Tishkoff 5. Casey Affleck as Virgil Malloy 6. Scott Caan as Turk Malloy 7. Eddie Jemison as Livingston Dell 8. Don Cheadle as Basher Tarr 9. Shaobo Qin as ""The Amazing"" Yen 10. Carl Reiner as Saul Bloom 11. Matt Damon as Linus Caldwell And then 12. Julia Roberts as Tess<br/><br/>The movie also has Julia Roberts as Tess playing herself in the movie, as part of the plot to get the money they needed back. The movie lacks the grace that made the first film a masterpiece and here the crew also get to go up against another thief called The Night Fox, who wants to prove to Ocean that he is the best thief that there is.<br/><br/>The movie was a box office success, making 3 times its production cost.<br/><br/>Ocean's Twelve is not that good, but the thing that gets me is that Ocean's Thirteen that was done 3 years after and it was magnificent, making both the first and the last the only ones in the trilogy worth seeing.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","This movie annoyed me to no end. A middling script is one thing, a middling script with a fancy director and 10 A-List actors is truly something else.<br/><br/>At times, I felt like I was watching a private hobby project, an inside joke movie, a pet farce Soderbergh put together as a gift for a friend getting married. I'm pretty sure none of the stars REALLY cared - after all, none of them had to carry the movie! It was like an NBA All-Star game without anything on the line. They probably did enjoy their European vacation, their relaxing getaway from the responsibilities of having to be The Man. (Or The Woman, in the case of Julia R.)<br/><br/>And Soderbergh... He is at the point in his career where he can direct in his sleep, and it shows. I used to think of him as a genius, now I think of him as a caricature of himself. Dud."

COMPLETE TRASH FROM START TO FINISH.. Clooney,Pitt and co.seemed a bunch of ordinary clowns. I wont give this movie a 1 out of 10.

"roryboo","5","1","3","7 July 2010"," As Expected
","It's a well-known fact that a sequel to an ultimate success usually turns out to be an ultimate failure. That's certainly the case with Ocean's Twelve. I felt as if I'd been thrown down the stairs after the movie ended: from Ocean's Eleven, a witty, exciting film with a well-balanced plot, to a complete mess. The characters seemed to be failing all the time, up from when Andy Garcia comes and says he wants his money back down to the moment when Julia Roberts is jailed (by the way, was she Ocean's twelfth? I thought there's no one else fit for the role but still that wasn't emphasized enough in the movie). Such a string of failures isn't good for a movie of that genre: a question pops up: what's this for if they can't do anything? Their deal with LeMarque, revealed in the end, can't match all those tricks and sophisticated schemes we enjoyed in Ocean's Eleven. And something went wrong with the humor: you can laugh three or four times, and later start wondering what was so funny. It could've been FAR better."

","Compared to Ocean's Eleven and Thirteen, Twelve fails abysmally in my book.<br/><br/>The film started out well enough, but it seems as though the writers were killed midway and the actors had to wing it. <br/><br/>The end of this film is so bad that I almost threw my shoe at the TV. <br/><br/>Worth watching at least once, just to appreciate bad film making, bad screenplay writing, bad improvisation... well, you get the idea.<br/><br/>One good thing - this film gave birth to the much improved Ocean's Thirteen.

And, not with a mysterious someone stalking Danny and crew. It's time to pull off another stunner of a plan - or plans"" according to the sleeve's synopsis.<br/><br/>The first problem with ""Ocean's Twelve"" is that the main plot involves the original team's effort to RETURN the money from the first film, or DIE. ""Ocean's Eleven"" involved viewers is rooting for the superstar team to GET the money; and, none of them were killed. This film stabs the earlier one in the back. Perhaps, George Clooney (as Ocean) and his all-star team weren't so smart, after all. Probably, they should they have killed Andy Garcia's ""Benedict"".

"Cosmoeticadotcom","7","1","3","15 September 2008"," Underrated fluff
","A lack of pretension can cover a multitude of sins- even the lack of a plausible script. Such is the premise that Ocean's Twelve, the sequel to Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven remake of the Rat pack classic 1960s caper film, must have been pitched at studio executives with. Simply put, never has a film about less, with less characterization and more smug mugging for the camera ever worked better. There were a plethora of such films in the 1960s, both American and European, and even Japanese, but none with the star power this film has. Style, on very rare occasions, can trump substance, and this film is that exceptional one that proves that substance usually is king.<br/><br/>OK, what of the plot? In the first film Danny Ocean (George Clooney)and his crew stole $160 million from the casino of a big time casino owning mobster named Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). This film opens three years later, with all eleven thrives hunted down and given a deadline with which to pay back the money with interest, or die. Of course, there are plot holes galore. The whole set up is untenable, and the fact that such smooth operators would so easily expose themselves is ridiculous. Still, there are some really funny scenes of Bernie Mac in a massage, Rusty (Matt Damon) as a lap dog, and assorted other funny scenes. Only Ocean manages to escape such a threat- but not for long, as he re-teams with the others to make things right.What I find amazing is how many reviewers panned this film. It reminded me of the roasting the 1998 Hollywood version of Godzilla got; as if a film about a big lizard stomping on New York would or should have been Oscar caliber? This is why I started off talking about pretense, and its ability to salvage potentially bad films. In this case, it works, and so does the film. Now, if Ocean's Thirteen were smart it would just focus all on Ms. Jones. Sometimes pretense has its charms!"

","I would like to know where did Kurland get the wardrobe for Andy Garcia in the movie, I checked some websites for the movie no luck. If someone could find out if its a store in Vegas or could they find out from Kurland. I'm interested in where to purchase and the stores his clothing came from. Andy gave an great performance and the wardrobe brought out his best. I thought to myself, as one who can dress, the clothing was remarkable from a movie watcher. Kurland and Messina really did their homework to design the wardrobe and the set.Also Brad Pitts wardrobe was very slick. There could not be any bad reviews to the movie because some characters you could identify with. When Andy walked through the casino, I got the feeling that his confidence level was very high, the clothes. Brad gave strong confidence as well, I would like to me them both. Not to get autographs but as a movie watcher to say I enjoy their work. That is probably impossible, I'm just another average guy. George Clooney is a great man, his thought process is amazing."

","Ocean's Twelve isn't so much a movie as it is an opportunity for the majority of the actors involved to mirror their own predominant personal behavior: pretentiousness. The ""coolness"" of Ocean's Eleven, prevalently displayed in the previews for the movie, turned me off to it, but I saw it at a friend's after it was released on video and ended up liking it very much. This brand of ""coolness"" is irritating and confusing, and though the movie can be entertaining, there are far too many subplots for us to care (or most times understand) what is occurring. The major heist involved here is clever and the dialog can be very entertaining at times, but the majority of the movie still feels like a stranger's conversation in which we are just observers. The backstories of many events are shown after the scene in which it would be essential to comprehend, and while this may seem like an original cinematic twist, it just doesn't flow.<br/><br/>Simply put, the movie has little of the original, tightly packed feel of Ocean's Eleven. Most everything goes wrong for the crew this time around, whereas they had an almost perfect heist in the first movie. It's an interesting switch, but it dramatically hurts the pace of the movie. I didn't dislike the movie as a whole, but I didn't particularly enjoy it either."

","I've put Ocean's Twelve on my ""must see"" list immediately after seeing Ocean's Eleven. Today, I have to regret it.

Matt Damon as a silly thief-n00b, George Clooney and Brad Pitt with no style and elegance of professional thieves which were the things I liked most in the first movie. Yes, Catherine Zeta-Jones and her godlike-instincts were just another cliché in the film, but it was Julia Roberts who seemed absolutely worst to me - Especially in the part involving Bruce Willis. I only watched the TV and thought for myself: ""Oh my god! The woman CAN'T act!"" The plot itself is messy, many times leaving the viewer to ask himself: ""WTF is going on there?"". And the end? OMG didn't you all see this stupid happy-end hundred, thousand, million time before? Didn't you find the ""surprise"" in the end predictable? If you have seen Ocean's Eleven, avoid this film because you will start to dislike even it when you see O's Twelve. If you haven't seen O's Eleven, go and watch it, but every time your hands will be approaching O's Twelve in the DVD lender's store, remember me and take anything else instead.

","The people who are slating this film are truly missing the joke. Ocean's Twelve is beautifully and cleverly shot and shows Soderbergh's true style. The comedy within the film is superb and the cast truly know how to make fun of themselves and their real life celebrity. The film does not have the slick style of the first but has now more of the mark of a Soderbergh film with many of his signature style shots, an example being when the film comes together and goes from black and white into colour, which is reminiscent of a great scene in Kafka. As most film-goers, I expected the film to look and feel the same as the first but the film far exceeded my expectations. Soderbergh has truly put his own mark on the film, far more so than the first. The combinations of different filming styles are excellent and suit their scenes perfectly, the music is spot on and the humour exceeds the first. To all the people who are disappointed purely because they expected the film to be exactly the same as the first should be more open minded and embrace the freshness of this film that retains a great plot, acting, and humour with a new visual style."

You are also wondering if the Night Fox, who is the gang's rival stealer, is going to get the real or the fake.<br/><br/>In preparation, Danny and the guys create a holographic image of the object, so you would suspect that they are going to take the egg and replace it with the holograph.

Tess Ocean, impersonating JULIA ROBERTS, is inside with a fake baby under her blouse. The confusion of it all prevents me from revealing what happened inside. But it turns out that the REAL EGG WAS TAKEN BEFORE ALL THE PREPARATION AND ALL OF THE SCHEEMING, AND THE ""HEIST WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!<br/><br/>This is the grand daddy of all the confusion, and the other moments that compare to it are nearly as confusing.

","I really looked forward to a sequel for Ocean's Eleven. I had heard that Ocean's Tweleve was bad, but I thought surely I would enjoy the plot.<br/><br/>Well, there is no detectable plot. For all the lead up to this movie, this film has got to be the biggest let down in the film industry. Benedict wants his money back and Ocean's twelve are supposed to get it back for him.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>You can see that Benedict does get his money back, because at the end he is given a check for the amount. But for the life of me I couldn't detect how or where it was done. There is just no plot in this movie. The sole redeeming feature was the comical moment when Julia Roberts plays a character who plays Julia Roberts to fool Bruce Willis who is playing Bruce Willis. That was a comical moment, though it didn't seem to have anything to do with the rest of the movie. But then again, since the film has no plot, I suppose it makes no difference. The rest of the film is totally confusing. Those comical moments brought my vote up from a 1 to a 2."

It could be a family film, except the f word is used 3 times in conversations. This movie focuses on Brad Pitt falling back in love with his ex girlfriend(Jones). The only problem is she's a detective that will arrest him and they are trying to pull off a crime. George Clooney had been banished to a backup character and so has Julia. She is at the beginning for about five minutes and comes in again at about 85 minutes in. Her part is best in the movie. All of the heisters go to jail except Scott Caan, Matt Damon(Who becomes leader of the gang), and Don Cheadle. They get Tess(Roberts) to be the 12th member. She pretends to be Julia Roberts(Tess does)and meets up with Bruce Willis(who plays himself.) Bruce is uncredited and has about ten minutes of screen time. The little Chinese guy has no part at all and Bernie Mac is only at the beginning and a little at the end. Zeta Jones is good as an (extremely) sexy cop and Pitt, Clooney, Damon(Especially him), Caan, Affleck, Roberts, and Willis deliver perfect roles. Very good. My rating:8 out of 10"

From the moment the film starts the viewer is left in total confusion. There are no clues as to what the plot is about,so the viewer does not recover from the disorientation.

"colettesplace","6","1","3","22 December 2004"," Despite the non-linear structure, funky soundtrack and A-list cast, there are better caper flicks out there - but it's engaging nevertheless
","Ocean's Twelve reunites an A-list cast with powerhouse director Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brockovitch) for another caper film with even more twists and turns than Soderbergh Ocean's 11 (2001), and a decidedly non-linear structure.<br/><br/>It's been three years since the original Benedict casino heist. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is married to Tess (Julia Roberts), Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) is an embattled hotelier, and the others are living separate lives. Unfortunately Benedict (Andy Garcia) has tracked the 11 down  he wants his money back, with interest, in 14 days or they're dead.<br/><br/>While on reconnaissance in Amsterdam, Rusty catches up with an old flame, Europol detective Isabel (Catherine Zeta Jones), while the team's targeted by a snarky French cat burglar (Vincent Cassel). Ocean's Twelve transcends a relatively formulaic plot by re-structuring the way events are played out  no surprise considering screenwriter George Nolfi's previous offering was the non-linear indie film Timeline. On several occasions we see the results of the crime before it is carried out. As in Run, Lola, Run and, more recently, Hero, a scene often needs re-telling to arrive at the truth of the situation. And several scenes which initially seem designed only to showcase the actors' talents are later shown to have significance. All this sleight of hand might seem confusing, but the film doesn't play that way. It just reinforces how cheeky these aristocrats of the crime world really are. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is excellent, full of Tarantino-inspired toe-tapping numbers, enough to make anyone want to turn to crime. Although the final scene is ordinary, and you may have forgotten the entire experience the following day, you'll enjoy watching Ocean's Twelve. ***/*****stars."

","What a stinker. It was almost as bad as Undertow, and it stank like a pickle in a pope's butt. Tons of plot holes. And no imagination used at all in crafting the ""twist"". There were a few lines worthy of a chuckle, but most of the attempts at comedy were just dumb. I didn't expect much from the film, but I did expect it to be somewhat entertaining, and actually, it was just painful. The film lost my audience about 30 minutes in, and at one point (when a holographic egg was shown as part of a plan) my audience actually groaned. All these fine actors and one of the best helmers in the game, and they couldn't get a writer? I could go on all night, but I'll sum it up to by saying wrong, just so wrong. Save your money."
"christopher-conklin","8","1","3","18 December 2004"," Too much movie for two hours!
","Soderberg's second go-round at the sequel of a remake seems to be just a bit much. The ending of ""Ocean's Eleven"" left the viewer in suspense, alluding to a sequel. Fast forward to the time present and here we are, with a sequel too good to be true. ""Ocean's Twelve"" takes us throughout Europe in an attempt to outdo the masterpiece heist seen previously. The scenery is amazing and true to life. We see Amsterdam's famous canals and Rome's narrow streets. However, just as the scenes are foreign, as is the viewer's comprehension of this movie.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that it's simply too much movie. The plot moves excessively fast for two hours give or take a few minutes, and it does not move along evenly per se. Some parts of ""Ocean's Twelve"" move too fast for the viewer to grasp, yet other sequences escalate painfully slow. <br/><br/>In all, the superb acting and cinematic effects are overshadowed by the plot. Yes, it's intricate, surpentine, and edge-of-your-seat, but, therein lies the problem. Twist after twist upon twist leaves the average viewer dumbfounded. Only those possessing Einstein like intelligence can grasp such plot specifics. For those fitting this category, it's an excellent movie. For the less fortunate, however, it might be best to watch the first one and leave it at that. In the end, you wonder: ""who's taking advantage of who?"" Whereas Eleven left us with a clear victor with the spoils, Twelves leaves you in suspense. Not the suspense seen at the end of the former, but a spiteful, incomplete suspense.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the all-star cast of actors boosts the movie's star quality. Bruce Willis' womanizing cameo is delightful, as is the special double entrendre cameo of Julia Roberts. Clooney and Pitt are excellent, and the rest of the cast hold up their end quite well. In the end, it is unfortunate that the plot and its twists are simply incomprehensible to many on the second, even third and subsequent attempt to understand it.<br/><br/>My advice is to save your money and definitely rent it when it comes out on DVD, or hits the second chance theaters.<br/><br/>Shall we see another sequel? Perhaps an ""Ocean's Thirteen?"" Even with such success as has been seen, it is doubtful Carl Reiner will live that long. But given the director's talent, and the feel good, high chemistry mood of the actors on set, I wouldn't put it out of the question. In all, 8 out of 10 from me."
"TheMovieMark","8","1","3","16 December 2004"," I may be in the minority, but I thought it was slightly better than Ocean's 11...
","Stylish. Original. Full of personality. All words used to describe Johnny Betts' hair. But, interestingly enough, they also form an accurate description of Ocean's 12.<br/><br/>This sequel has much of the same feel as Ocean's 11, but it takes a slightly different approach. Rather than focus on the heist, it gives more attention to the characters and their attempts at getting out of the trouble they're facing. In the first one, the movie starts off by introducing us to each of the main characters. Here, we watch as Andy Garcia tracks each one down and issues his threat - pay him his money within two weeks or suffer the consequences.<br/><br/>Also, in Ocean's 11, everything seemed to fall into place for our beloved thieves. Not anymore. Now everything seems to go wrong, and the crew finds itself face-to-face with one obstacle after another. I'm just curious, is it bad to cheer for thieves and wish them the best? It's OK if it's just a movie, right? I sure hope so.<br/><br/>You're dying to know which movie I preferred, right? No? Well I'll tell you anyway. I know I'll probably be in the minority here, but I enjoyed Ocean's 12 a little more than Ocean's 11. Why? Well, since you asked:<br/><br/>* Catherine Zeta-Jones! Finally, some eye candy for the guys! And no, Julia Roberts is NOT eye candy, except for people with a skeleton fetish. Plus, CZJ (as I like to call her) does a good job in her role as a detective with a father who was a thief. Her character adds another element of mystery.<br/><br/>* It's funnier than the first. Two great sources of comedy are the cameos of Bruce Willis and Topher Grace as themselves. Topher whines about how his Kabbalah bracelet isn't working, and when talking about the efforts he took to try to win the love of a girl he claims, ""I totally phoned in that Dennis Quaid movie."" I won't say anything about Bruce's cameo, but it's great. The humor is mainly a reflection of how much everybody obviously enjoyed making this movie.<br/><br/>* I do not like Julia Roberts. I have NEVER understood her appeal. And not to be shallow, but I don't find her the least bit attractive. So how is that relevant to why I prefer Ocean's 12? Well, Julia was a distraction in Ocean's 11, but here she has one enjoyable scene that made me not think about how much I can't stand her! When a movie can do that, then it has really accomplished something.<br/><br/>* The story is a little smarter, a little more clever than the first one. Some people might not like the fact that everything isn't spelled out along the way, but I enjoyed being kept in the dark a bit. <br/><br/>The important thing is that all is revealed at the end. I know a couple of people complained that they didn't understand everything because the story wasn't told in a linear fashion. One complaint was that the big revelation was ""unfair"" because it prevented the viewer from being able to figure everything out on his own. Fine with me. What's wrong with surprises?<br/><br/>One guy even complained that the ending was the movie's attempt to make you pay to go see the movie again just to understand it. I would have to disagree. I had no problem following the story, and you don't really have to watch it again to figure it all out, but it's one I *do* want to watch again so I can approach it with a different perspective.<br/><br/>I recommend watching Ocean's 11 first. If you've already seen it, then it wouldn't hurt to watch it again just as a refresher. Once you've done that you'll be ready to enjoy Ocean's 12. Just don't yell and scream at me if *you* end up not liking it as much Ocean's 11. After all, it's just a movie, and the fact that we have a different preference won't prevent a cure for cancer. If it does, then that'll sure be weird and I pledge to never see another movie again because man, it's just not worth stopping a cure for cancer.<br/><br/>THE GIST<br/><br/>A little more clever, and a little funnier than its predecessor, Ocean's 12 presents itself as yet another slick and stylish movie in the heist genre. If you can handle a little style over substance, then you should be entertained. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you. <br/><br/>Rating: 4 (out of 5)"

","Horrible, horrible, horrible, shall I continue?<br/><br/>Firstly, I want to start by saying I really enjoyed the Oceans 11 movie. It was a witty, funny and well thought out movie that was very suspenseful in the right places and had a great ending. <br/><br/>This one was an attempt to bring back Oceans 11 by following a similar plot only messing it up entirely. I'm being very generous giving this movie 2 stars but here are the reasons why I disliked this movie:<br/><br/>1) Trying to be non-linear but not giving any background or at least enough to understand the plot. I know the other movie was like this too but it gave you enough information to understand what the f*** is going on. <br/><br/>● How did Brad Pitt know Catherine Zeta (the characters I mean)? Was he stalking her and just liked her in a creepy way from afar? She see's him being chased by police and yet still falls in love with him? <br/><br/>● Between when and when did that opening scene fall under, right before she figured out he's a thief? <br/><br/>● How did the fox thief guy know they all were somehow connected to the robbery? Is there like a social media for thieves so when any big thieves commit robberies the whole thieving community knows about it? Was it the other big thief guy who told him that and how did he know if it was him? Like couldn't they have explained that part a little more?? <br/><br/>● Besides that just how many cut scenes there were bouncing from one place to the other, like with Clooney and Brad Pitt. It's like all chaotic and no explanation or back story like that's horrible...<br/><br/>2) OK, this one really was like OK but why put this in? The ""let's be edgy and make Julia Roberts character play Julia Roberts!!"" So cool right? No... They were so out of ideas they had to include that and while you're at it throw in a random character Bruce Willis to make an awfully boring and long scene of him trying to flatter her, ugh...<br/><br/>3) Dancing through the lasers...really?! Come on was that really necessary to put in? That is like nearly impossible to do and he was doing it as though he knew the movement of the RANDOMIZED lasers...<br/><br/>Seriously I tried enjoying this movie but it was a complete flop, can't imagine what the Oceans 13 is like..."

","Soderbergh springs a surprise. It's not a pleasant one. 'Ocean's 12' has an awful screenplay and the director seems clueless at times. Seriously, to even think that Soderbergh was behind this is still a little difficult to digest. The film has some cool gizmos and gadgets, none of which manage to sustain our attention for long. There are some very nice shots of Europe and the soundtrack is quite awesome. It actually drags a lot in the beginning until Catherine Zeta-Jones appears in the fake Interpol (which was actually shot in the City Hall of the Hague). Perhaps it's the glamour portion of Ms. Zeta-Jones that grabs the attention and she does reasonably well until her character is messed up towards the end. Sadly, she and Pitt do not have chemistry. Actually, all the actors from 'Ocean's 11' are terribly wasted in this one. Clooney looks uninterested and lost. Pitt looks as though he could care less. Damon tries to bring some comic relief but fails (what could he have done anyway, if his co-stars were so uninterested?). Cheadle is given nothing but a few lines and the rest are all relegated to the background for the most part. However, I thought Vincent Cassel performed the best. His amazing Capoeira demonstration is in my opinion the best thing to come out of the film. As I myself have practiced capoeira for a while, I was impressed by Cassel's skill. Julia Roberts is whining in the beginning but she the Julia Roberts playing Tess playing Julia Roberts sequence is ridiculously funny. It made me chuckle and made the film worse. Thus, in spite of all the hi-tech, 'Ocean's 12' is quite a wasted effort. the film lacks a heart."

It is a crime comedy film, the sequel to 2001's Ocean's Eleven. Like its predecessor,the film used a celebrity ensemble cast that features George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Andy García, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac,Julia Roberts,Casey Affleck,Scott Caan, Vincent Cassel,Eddie Jemison,Shaobo Qin,Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould.It was written by George Nolfi and directed by Steven Soderbergh.<br/><br/>After robbing a cool $160 million from the Bellaggio Hotel Casino and winning back his former wife, Tess, from Bellagio owner Terry Benedict, Danny Ocean is living quietly on the lam in Connecticut when he's unexpectedly approached by Benedict. It seems Benedict has tracked down Danny and the ten men who helped him pull off the seemingly impossible robbery, and Benedict offers them a proposal -- if they can repay the $160 million in two weeks, he won't have them killed. As it turns out, both Danny and his best friend, Rusty Ryan, haven't been doing so well in terms of money management and could use some cash, so they set out to plan a robbery to recover the loot, with the same crew helping out -- Linus Caldwell, Frank Catton, Basher Tarr, Saul Bloom, Reuben Tishkoff, Livingston Dell, Yen, Virgil Malloy, and his brother Turk. Danny and Rusty discover that an incredibly rare Fabergé egg is being displayed at a museum in Rome which would fetch the price they need, but they soon discover a notorious cat burglar, François Toulour, is also after the egg, and it turns into a race to see who can claim it first. Adding to the intrigue is Isabel Lahiri, a woman Rusty used to be involved with who is now a top agent with Interpol and is after both Toulour and Ocean's crew.<br/><br/>Shot on location in both the United States and Europe,it had excellent production design and visuals. But the positives end there.The latest star-studded heist flick is lazy, self-satisfied and illogical.It has a thin plot and tries to capitalize basically on the success of the previous movie,Ocean's Eleven. Even with the addition of Catherine Zeta- Jones makes no difference in the movie.While it has its hysterical moments,it basically falls flat as a poor sequel and an interesting heist film."

","Alright, Ocean's Eleven was fun. A lot of money has been made with the original movie, a great and funny cast/team, an amazing heist, decent music and a few great action scenes. And then it went wrong. I'll never understand why Ocean's Eleven had to have a part 2. First off the lack of ideas becomes painfully clear with it's title. Then the lack of a script slowly starts to show off. The action scenes look familiar, I'd expect them in some B-movie, not in a digital masterpiece. I have been lucky, all I've been robbed from is a free evening as it was on TV, do not waste any money on this one, it contains all what can possibly go wrong with a movie full of top actors. Clooney got some lines forced down his throat that have probably been supposed to be funny. They weren't. The double role of Julia Roberts just makes this abomination of a movie even worse.

","This movie is middling in almost every way. It provides a couple laughs, every so often. The plot is interesting, occasionally. It is the second of a three movie trilogy. And of those three it is only mediocre one in the bunch. The only part that remains consistently strong is the original cast. The newcomers, are Surprise! Only so-so. Catherine Zeta-Jones is okay, but she's not funny! And isn't that the point of these movies?<br/><br/>By itself, the film is nothing special, but at least it's watchable, hence 6 stars. It disappointed me more than a lot of 6s, though, because it's part of a series. And such, it's just the nature of the beast that movies in a series are compared to each other. This, unfortunately, is not nearly as good as Ocean's Elven or Ocean's Thirteen.<br/><br/>The story isn't great. The stuff about rival robbers I really disliked. One of the things I loved about Ocean's Eleven was the easy, if occasionally tense, camaraderie. And then they throw in the crap about the Night Fox. That was probably the worst part in this movie. I still enjoyed it when they cut back to a simple revenge story, however. This part is well-written and makes the script worth watching.<br/><br/>Ocean's Twelve does have some really, really funny jokes in it, primarily one involving celebrity ""mix-ups"" and Bruce Willis. These jokes aren't throughout the entire picture. They are more like oases, funny pieces in a sea of middle-of-the-road humor that's cliché and really not that funny.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was easily the best part of this movie. George Clooney was very good in the previous outing, but he seemed a bit listless in this installment. Bernie Mac's character Frank is a riot, but he, unfortunately has a much smaller part to do something with.<br/><br/>Yes, Buddha may say to take the middle way, but I still prefer the high road.

","Of all the things this film is, ""disappointing"" is probably the most poignant. It's also boring, confusing, pointless, and a lot of other things, but given its promise in terms of cast, budget, lineage, and just about everything else, ""disappointing"" is the most apt description.<br/><br/>I have watched Japanese art films (without subtitles, and my Japanese is limited to terms involving raw fish and flavoured rice) that have made more sense than this. Neither script nor photography does anything to convey a story, and what else is the purpose of a film? Fine, if you wanted great footage of Amsterdam (loved to see that, lived there for six years) and other picturesque places, wonderful, but this is hardly the purpose of a Hollywood blockbuster. An art student with a mobile telephone can do that better than this film.<br/><br/>I can't get away from the ""disapponting"" aspect. Everything that Ocean's Eleven was, Ocean's Twelve isn't. Where Eleven was fast-paced, Twelve is hurried; where Eleven had surprise, Twelve has confusion; where Eleven was elegant, Twelve is gaudy; where Eleven had intelligent twists, Twelve has convoluted contortions.

","Ocean's 12 is on par with Ocean's 11. Both movies jump around on the emotional level. The viewer finds parts of the movie boring and would rate Ocean's a 3. Then other parts of Ocean's become a 10. Once the viewer averages Ocean's 12 out the overall rating is a 6 or 7 out of 10. The story is weak in parts, and strong in others. The Julia Roberts bit is the highlight. Bruce Willis is great. The director's 70's or late 60's European feel is too much. Looks like a cheesy film they show on the showcase network with a low budget feel. The use of camera angles, and trickery takes the focus off the film. If a film lacks budget they use these tricks, and Ocean's 12 has no reason to use this. The acting is excellent considering the script. Brad Pitt was misused, could have added more for his character. My dad felt the same about Ocean's 12. I would rather go see Flight of the Phoneix. Wait for video or on demand. 7 or 6 out of 10."

The acting was seamless, the jokes funny, and overall it was a well-executed tight sort of film. I especially appreciated the fact that Rusty Ryan had a lot of time and character development. Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones had great chemistry. Also, Julia Roberts was simply delightful.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the problem is because I didn't think there was one.

","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""Ocean's Twelve"" reunites Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his previously assembled gang of peculiar thieves, by the name of Ocean's Eleven. It seems that their ruthless victim Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) uncovered their doings and somehow all of their identities, and has a grudge against them along with an urgent threat: pay up or ship out. Thus ensues yet another ingenious scheme by Ocean's Eleven (this time around, as the title suggests, a ""twelfth member"", Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) plays a somewhat dominant (and amusing) role in the plot), to rob a prized ""golden egg"" from a European museum, once again, a seemingly infeasible task which can only be perpetrated by the most cunning, collected, suave, and industrial of minds, as this gang has proved itself to be. A romantic interest for Rusty (Brad Pitt) with the luscious, yet officious Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), as well as a new nemesis known as the Night Fox, are just some of the new developments of this splendid crime caper franchise. With a less engineered and more liberated plot structure than its predecessor, ""Ocean's Twelve"" is not quite as sensational and rewarding, lacking much of the energy and originality, as well as character structure, where the original triumphed. Whereas the first heist was an elaborate, critical operation, the museum heist is more of an intricate game, a jigsaw (even in its logic) and practically a charade with the cunning and elusive Night Fox, and there is significantly less attention devoted to the actual heist than its perplexing, yet engaging, design. Although a few of ""Ocean's Eleven"" (now Twelve) play a more ""central role"" in the action (e.g. Linus (Damon) and Tess (Roberts), many of the characters are merely around for show and hardly serve a purpose in the actual heist. And speaking of the heist, the details to the ""surprise ending"" couldn't be detected by the keenest of observers, at least until the end, which can be either be a baffling and illogical excuse for a resolution, or an exceedingly clever plot structure, that marvelously pieces together every ""invisible"" detail of the heist as an explanation to how the gang ""outfoxed"" the Night Fox. Featuring the usual industrial, meticulous, and prudent direction of Steven Soderberg, whose gritty editing translates as pure energy to an exceedingly exciting premise, some fine and jovial acting from all of the leads, adept and subtle plot structure, and a very awesome and stimulating score, ""Ocean's Twelve"", while not quite equaling its excellent predecessor, is definitely a solid piece of high octane, feel-good, debonair entertainment, and it's enticing, exhilarating, and sexy- a must-see for fans of crime caper films and great escapist fare for the holiday season! ***1/2 out of ****"
"noralee","5","1","4","11 December 2004"," Amusing Fluffy Nonsense
","""Ocean's 12"" may not represent the end of American civilization that so much money is spent on such a trifle, but can be seen as a profitable export of the U.S. No animals were harmed in the making of the film, people were employed around Europe, no acting skills were taxed but most of them are American citizens so presumably pay U.S. taxes so the Treasury benefits. I just hope everyone involved from Steve Soderbergh to George Clooney et al do some indie or charitable work so their karma makes up for this lighter than air romp.<br/><br/>Soderbergh's exceptional directorial,editing and cinematographic skills were put to such better use in ""Traffic."" The actors basically have to just show up, which George Nolfi's script even makes fun of, as each character pretty much plays self-referential satires of themselves and their personas-including Brad Pitt preening in tight silk shirts and expensive cars, Matt Damon spoofing his all-competent Bourne by being a bumbling apprentice, Clooney's age vanity, climaxing in making an explicit joke of Julia Roberts, but heck it's breezily funny.<br/><br/>At one point the characters ask each other if they have a moral objection to the nonsense going on and there's a funny moment's hesitation before they and we enjoying the showthink, nah.<br/><br/>Best are the even shorter cameos, Topher Grace, Albert Finney, Robbie Coltrane, Cherry Jones who add some ballast as otherwise the story is so light weight that a couple of times it threatens to blow away. The Bruce Willis cameo adds to the silliness but it does work.<br/><br/>It is hard to watch all the energy Catherine Zeta-Jones's ""Europol"" cop puts into catching thieves when one hopes that in real life Interpol is working on catching terrorists. I suppose we can all rest easy that Osama's folks don't have these thieves' skills so that therefore we can sit back and enjoy this 007 for civilians, a world where master thieves are so bored they pretty much have to keep occupied by stealing from each other. Too bad real life is showing us that thievery is really so much easier than it's shown here, from Enron to the Tate Gallery.<br/><br/>It is staggering the number of assistants each actor required, let alone hair dressers, so I think it worth noting that I really don't like Damon and Pitt with buzz cuts and Zeta's long wig in one scene is really bad.<br/><br/>The charming score keeps things moving right along. Was it another self-referential joke, perhaps in the Utah moments, that one of the many incidental songs was written by Senator Orin Hatch so that he'll financially benefit from this silly export?"
"oshram-3","7","1","4","11 December 2004"," Second verse pretty much same as the first
","I thought Ocean's Eleven (the 2001 version) was a nice piece of star-studded fluff, basically lighthearted fun. I didn't really get into the movie until I had been to Vegas, however, and now I enjoy it quite a bit. I've also become fonder of some of the actors involved in the film (most notably Mssrs Pitt and Damon), so I looked forward to this heist film a little more than I did the first.<br/><br/>Ocean's Twelve is pretty much second verse, same as the first  which is fine, if that's what you're in the market for. The same easy camaraderie, the same joking between pals, the same clever set ups and the same bit with fooling the audience toward the middle of the film. It all follows the first film with some minor variations, which is exactly what most people want and indeed expect in a sequel.<br/><br/>Clooney is back as the charismatic leader of the group of thieves (who balk in a very funny scene at being referred to as 'Ocean's Eleven') who find themselves with not one nemesis in this film, but three; not only is Andy Garcia back as Terry Benedict (in a far smaller role), but Danny and the gang must contend with a 'Europol' officer out to get them, one Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones) as well as competing with a fellow thief, the Nightfox (Vincent Cassel, playing, as he usually does, another smarmy prick). The entire crew returns  Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Elliot Gould, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, etc., and there's even a sort of extended cameo for Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>The good times roll with the gang as we get to see how each of them is spending his part of the fortune pilfered in the first movie as, one by one, Benedict tracks them down. The reunion happens fairly quickly and most of the best scenes in the film involves the group all gathered together, where everyone is bitching at one another playfully, jibing one another, and throwing out ideas. These scenes have a wonderful ad-libbed quality to them, and they carry the first hour or so of the picture, from the moment everyone realizes they're in trouble to the time they pull off their first heist together. The first hour is a pure fun treat.<br/><br/>It's in the second hour that Ocean's Twelve wanders a bit astray. Not content with another heist, the plot puts them in competition with uber-Europrick Nightfox, who is rich, well connected, an amazing thief, etc. This whole part felt a tad contrived, and while the planning of the second heist is fun, the actual execution of it is painful. Julia Roberts comes in for a subplot so stupid and silly it seems lifted from a Wayans Brothers spoof of the genre, complete with ham-handed acting and a wholly unnecessary cameo by Bruce Willis (Pitt, Clooney, Roberts, Damon, Zeta-Jones  you don't have enough star power already?). The movie temporarily descends into pratfall comedy, away from the clever verbal jabs and situational shorthand it employed so effectively until then. It sort of recovers, but not entirely, and the movie feels a little shabby afterward (not a help that Roberts and Clooney come off as smarmy in the final confrontation with Cassel).<br/><br/>The acting is by and large fine. Clooney takes a smaller role but he's still good. Pitt's character is deepened a little even though he too seems to have less screen time than the first one. Elliot Gould is exceedingly sharp; a lot of his one-liners are incredibly funny. Carl Reiner isn't around enough, but when he is, he's hysterical. Damon has to shoulder a lot of the load and he does so very well, playing the nervous rookie perfectly. Roberts is okay, but I so thoroughly disliked what they did with her toward the end that it's hard for me to judge. A big surprise was how sharp Catherine Zeta-Jones was, and yet how well she fit in with this established group. Isabel was a welcome addition to the movie and is give a surprising amount of backstory and depth. She really stands out, which, even though she's the only woman in the bulk of the film, is still a real feat with this cast.<br/><br/>By and large the film is light fun, easy on the brain and the eyes, and a good fun time. Nothing especially deep, but that's never the intent. Aside from the one extended SNL-bad gig with Roberts, I would highly recommend it; that bad part was enough to make me say that it's still worth seeing, but you could maybe wait for the DVD. I don't care to be jarred out of a film so blatantly, especially one where a nice warm feeling of clever companionship had been so craftily composed in the first leg of the movie. But your mileage may vary. It's probably worth at least a matinée to see some of the biggest movie stars of the day having fun with one another."

","Ocean's 12 is the continuation of the saga of a group of robbers, directed with finesse by Steven Soderberg. Despite being overlong, Ocean's Twelve is enjoyable, and will likely appeal to anyone who appreciated the 2001 film. Not only are the actors the same, but the men behind the scenes, including Soderbergh, producer Jerry Weintraub, and composer David Holmes, have returned for another round. The screenplay, by George Nolfi, starts out a little slow, but, by the end of the first hour, it has hit its stride with the movie building momentum. The complicated details of the final heist are entertaining to unravel, and there's also a wonderfully wry bit of fourth wall-breaking fun that Soderbergh has at Julia Roberts' expense. Soderbergh peppers the print with occasional directorial flourishes (freeze-frames, the use of colored filters, etc.), but, for the most part, he presents the film straight."

It's so incredibly similar to the first film-which is itself a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film-that after you've seen both of them, you'll find yourself getting scenes confused with each other. The memorable and expensive cast returns-George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Andy Garcia, and Julia Roberts-and are joined by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Eddie Izzard, Robbie Coltrane, and Jared Harris. Once again, they're all involved in a heist that's complicated beyond belief and fraught with plans going awry, but this time, the expensive cast are all flown abroad, enjoying scenes in Italy, France, the Netherlands, and Monaco.<br/><br/>If you liked the first one-the remake, not the original-you'll like the sequel. I did not, so I didn't care for the sequel either. Just as the original is a two-hour spectacle of ""Look how cool me and my friends are"", the remakes of the Ocean films have the same feel to them. Everyone in the audience knows the actors who take the top billings are friends in real life, and while they have their little smirks and giggles over inside jokes, unfinished sentences, and awkward pauses, the audience either feels ""cool"" to be a part of it or wishes they'd just had a get-together without filming it."

","This film is a sequel to ""Ocean's Eleven"" and reports how the group of thieves from the first film was forced to regroup and commit an assault on Europe. A predictable sequel, given the box office hit. The first movie was light and funny, but this sequel is only light and boring. The clever jokes that I have observed before have never happened here, and the attempts to make it were so meager and thin that I cannot even say I found it funny. The script is another problem: the story lacks logic and coherence as if it were a collection of film parts without direct relation to each other. Steven Soderbergh assured the direction and, apparently, the accident as well. After all, he tried to hold the movie's steering wheel, but he had no strength to hold it. Natural consequence: A good part of the film is a disaster. The film has a lot of the cast of ""Ocean's Eleven"", which is to say that its filled with stars like George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Julia Roberts. But the overwhelming majority got lost in the middle of the script's confusion and probably regretted having entered the film (if they take their careers seriously, of course). Julia Roberts, who had already gone bad in the first film, was totally devastated here, and the same can be said of Bruce Willis in one of the worst performances of his long film career. Catherine Zeta Jones was not too bad but this movie didn't give her room to shine. Everything else has no relevance: the scenarios have gone unnoticed, the soundtrack has no quality etc. Everything has been relegated to the background and the public virtually notices any positive point. Far from having the interest of the first film, this sequel was run only to get box-office money."

After the casino heist in the first film the thieves are sought out and forced to repay back what they owe with added interest. This lands them in a competition against another thief who boasts that he is the greatest thief in the world. Structure is so more detailed and characters developed more strongly with an intelligent ending as oppose to the cheap clichés. Director Steven Soderbergh returns with the action taking place in Amsterdam. He worked with Clooney in the wretched Ocean's Eleven as well as Out of Sight. George Clooney heads the operation and struggles to outsmart his competition and remain on top. Brad Pitt also returns as his best friend who is evidently involved with an investigator played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. She is new casting and her appearance works as she struggles to expose the plot yet falls deeper into danger, and wrestles with her past relationship with Pitt. Julia Roberts as Clooney's wife gives a great performance where she must play herself. This provides the single funniest scenes that is backed with another familiar cameo. The players seem stronger in their self parody as oppose to just being a roll call walk of fame. The result is a pointless yet amusing entertainment. Score: 8 / 10"

","The thefts to build a certain paycheck (with interest) to pay back what Danny Ocean and his crew stole from Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) are not as important in the second film of Soderbergh's ""Ocean Three"" as the interactions of the cast (packed with star power in both big and small roles) and the elaborate chicanery the screenplay pulls on the audience (and Vincent Cassel's egotistical, self-assured, bored-in-his-affluence French aristocratic thief, François Toulour, AKA The Night Fox). The Fabergé egg is what Toulour challenges Danny over to determine who is the best among them regarding thievery. Set in Europe, with Danny and company seemingly up against insurmountable odds (there is an eventual imprisonment where the whole team is sitting in a cell together, and The Night Fox actually beats them to a heist after they extend exhaustive efforts to get to the safe), while an intelligent detective (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) is nipping at their heels on every turn (she is a former flame of Pitt's). This sequel just feels like the band got back together to have a good time, while this popcorn plot of ever-present implausibility ultimately features a twist that pulls the rug on all that we watched the previous 120 minutes. I do think it is questionable to basically jerk us around and stage such complex development just to say it was all for naught because the whole time the eleven had the upper hand on Toulour due to ""an ace in their sleeve"" involving someone close to Zeta-Jones (Pitt always seems to offer this aura of confidence, and a Cheshire Cat smile that indicates he has a firm grasp on how his boys will survive their ordeal unscathed). I think the next film fixes what this film lacks: an initiative behind ""the big heist"", giving the team a common goal to seek retribution against a foe (Al Pacino, whereas, Garcia was their target in the first film). Still, I'd lie if I didn't admit that the trick involving how Matt Damon succeeds in getting his team out of a jam thanks to a swerve regarding ""the FBI"" left me amused, as does Bruce Willis' appearance as it related to a ""Julia Roberts scam"". While Damon and Carl Reiner have spirited moments in the film, the rest of the cast, besides stars Clooney and Pitt (and, especially, Zeta-Jones, who gets the same star treatment), never quite get the same chances to shine as they did in the first, or would in the final film, of the series. The scene between Damon (who so desperately wants to be one of the ""top guys"" of the team) and Coltrane, as Clooney and Pitt look on in somewhat closeted embarrassment, in regards to ""absurd poetic jargon"", I thought was hilarious. I think, considering all the locations utilized and the names in the production involved, you can see all the money spent...maybe just not as well as it could have been."

","Ocean's Twelve can also be expressed as ""what happens when good actors are not discriminating about which roles they play,"" or ""How to abuse your privileged position as an actor with a modicum of effort."" The cinematography is inexcusably unfocused; the viewer gets the feeling that the crew are in some kind of fugue, or must be, because there's a distinct impression that many of these scenes were done impromptu, or without so much as a double-take. Seriously. It feels like the mise-en-scene was picked out of a hat. Sometimes in cinema this is acceptable, but here it doesn't feel intended. In fact that's a recurring theme: almost every element of the film feels like a mistake. In summary, this is will-of-the-wisp, trivial film-making to the detriment of all involved. Ocean's Twelve is a pot-boiler that thoroughly humiliates the ""Ocean's"" string of films. For shame!"

","Where the first movie was fun, this sequel was mildly entertaining. It went on a little long, but was never boring. It's watchable (as all crime movies like these should be), but not really entertaining. I wasn't having fun while watching a lot of Ocean's Twelve. I wasn't bored, either. I was in Limbo of the movie world. All of the Vegas glitz added to the first, and here it's drab European backgrounds. Steven Soderbergh's directing also makes the film harder to enjoy. The film's choppy-we don't see events that happened until after the fact (if that makes any sense), and there are so many subplots and characters with similar sounding names that eventually we stop caring. Whenever a movie makes me do that, I usually focus more in on the fun aspects of the movie. And sure, the movie had its fun moments, and never left me bored, but overall, it just lacked that ultra-cool style that the first one had.<br/><br/>Then again, every actor's back in cool form. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the newbie here, and although her character is barely defined, she still manages to be cool. George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt (being on screen probably more than anyone else), Matt Damon-they're all cool. But it's obvious that this isn't the best sequel that could have been made for Ocean's Eleven-the movie was originally written for a completely different movie, and then readapted to a sequel. Because of that, there aren't really any reminders on who these people were. I remembered Clooney, Roberts, Garcia, and a few character names and quirks (such as Pitt's obsessive eating), but, really, who were these people? Did Soderbergh think that we would all rush out to see the first one before seeing this? I'll bet as many people did that as the number who went to see the Russian Solyaris after Soderbergh made Solaris."

","From director Steven Soderbergh (Sex, Lies, and Videotape, Out of Sight, Eric Brockovich, Traffic), the first film was a great fast paced remake with an all star cast, I was wondering if this sequel would be just as good, despite being rated two stars out of five. Basically it has been three years since Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his team of ten cohort expert thieves stole $160 million from ruthless Las Vegas casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), and this money has been split between the crew, but they are not free of the crime yet, as the man they stole from wants it all back. Benedict tells him they have two weeks to get all the money they stole back, and with Danny bringing back Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) and Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) to get the ball rolling, they know they cannot risk a job in the U.S., so they travel to Europe. Specifically they head for Amswetrdam, and after searching for the most valuable job they are given the task to steal the priceless Coronation Egg that is going on display. So all the original team are brought back, Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle), Frank Catton (Bernie Mac), Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), Virgil Malloy (Casey Affleck), Turk Malloy (Scott Caan), Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison) and 'The Amazing' Yen (Shaobo Qin). Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) says no to the job, but he possibly does a little something, so they are joined instead by Danny's wife Tess (Julia Roberts), who uses her striking resemblance to actress Julia Roberts (yes, they really do that) to help out. The job is made a little difficult though because Europol Detective Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is hanging around, she once had a a relationship with Rusty, and also there is a a thief stealing things at the same time called 'The Night Fox', later revealed as Baron François Toulour (Black Swan's Vincent Cassel). It comes to the robbery, and they do manage to steal the valuable egg, with the help of some hologram technology, as well as distraction and stalling towards the security, they pay back promising Benedict no more heists in Las Vegas, Danny gets his debt from Toulour back, and Rusty and Isabel rekindle their relationship. Also starring Albert Finney as Gaspar LeMarque, Eddie Izzard as Roman Nagel, The Living Daylights' Jeroen Krabbé as Van Der Woude, Robbie Coltrane as Matsui, Topher Grace and Bruce Willis. It is reasonably good to see all the stars brought together again, as well as the new additions, but it is just this sequel is just an excuse to see near same old same old with big stars, not even relatively amusing cameos from Willis can save it, the story is tedious, there is hardly any fast pace in the editing, and nowhere near enough cool to watch planning and thievery, it is a boring and near pointless action crime caper. Adequate!"
"JamesHitchcock","4","0","1","26 July 2011"," Not So Much a Movie, More an Excuse for a Holiday
","There are certain types of film which do not seem to lend themselves to sequels. Romantic comedies are one such genre, and heist movies another. No sequel, for example, was ever made to the original 1960 ""Ocean's Eleven"". The cliffhanging ending to the original ""Italian Job"" seemed to be paving the way for a second film, but in the event it was never made because the first, despite immense success in Britain, under-performed at the American box office. Modern caper movies, which generally end with the crooks getting away with a huge stack of loot, do not generate many sequels, the logic presumably being that, having made a fortune from one dishonest scheme, the perpetrators are now so immensely wealthy that they do not need to take the risk of pulling off a second.<br/><br/>The 2001 remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"", however, was an exception. That film ended with Danny Ocean and his accomplices waltzing off with $160 million stolen from three Las Vegas casinos. The sequel opens with Terry Benedict, the owner of the casinos, discovering who was responsible for the theft. Benedict is not content to let the matter rest there, even though he has been compensated by his insurers for his losses, and contacts the eleven members of Ocean's gang, demanding they return the stolen money with interest, of face the consequences. As Benedict is a vicious gangster, those consequences are likely to be serious, but unfortunately the gang discover they do not have enough ready cash to meet his demands.<br/><br/>The rest of the film tells the story of how the gang (now increased from eleven to twelve by the addition of Ocean's wife Tess as an extra member) revert to their criminal ways in order to raise the money. I won't set out the storyline in any further detail, as it is not only complicated to the point of incomprehensibility but also extremely silly. I will, however, say that much of the plot involves the rivalry between Ocean and a French master-criminal named ""The Night Fox"", both determined to prove himself the world's greatest thief. As in ""The Italian Job"", robbery is seen as a competitive international sport, this time USA v France rather than Britain v Italy. This was one of a number of American films from the mid-2000s to feature a French villain; is it any coincidence that this was the period when, following their refusal to participate in the Iraq war, the French were being lampooned in the US as ""cheese-eating surrender monkeys""? (If only Blair had been as much of a surrender monkey as Chirac!).<br/><br/>Unlike her husband and his associates, Tess does not have any advanced lawbreaking talents; her part in his schemes is to impersonate Julia Roberts, to whom she bears a remarkable resemblance- which is not surprising, as Roberts is, of course, the actress playing her. This is playing games with the normal convention that films take place in a parallel universe in which actors playing roles in the film, unless they appear as ""themselves"" as Bruce Willis does in a cameo here, do not exist. (For example, it would seem odd if Erin Brockovitch was constantly being told ""Miss Brockovitch, has anyone ever told you how much you look like Julia Roberts?"") Other films which play the same game include ""The Front Page"", in which Cary Grant refers to his co-star Ralph Bellamy, and ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" in which the character played by Lauren Bacall refers to Bacall's real-life marriage to Humphrey Bogart.<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, the film features an inordinately large cast of big names. Indeed, the cast is even larger than in the first film, with the likes of Brad, George, Matt and Julia being joined by newcomers Vincent Cassel (as the Night Fox) and Catherine Zeta Jones as a glamorous detective on the trail of Ocean's gang. (As in ""Entrapment"", the luscious Catherine plays a criminal investigator who decides that participating in crimes is more fun than investigating them).<br/><br/>There are, in fact, so many major stars here that some of them become almost invisible, either because their parts are minor ones or because they put so little effort into them. George Clooney frequently adopts a laid-back, nonchalant style of acting- his left-wing political projects like ""Good Night and Good Luck"" are something of an exception- but here he is so laid back that he passes through the horizontal stage and ends up with his feet higher than his head. To make matters worse, most of his co-stars also seem to be graduates of the Clooney Cool School of Acting. Everyone looks as though they are enjoying themselves- as well they might, given that the film was shot in a series of agreeable European locations including Amsterdam, Lake Como, Rome and Paris. Nobody, however, looks as if they are doing any serious acting. ""Oceans Eleven"" had its faults, but at least it was a superior sort of popcorn movie. ""Ocean's Twelve"", by contrast, is not so much a movie as an excuse for a large group of Hollywood A-listers to take an enjoyable European holiday. 4/10"
"Boba_Fett1138","6","0","2","26 May 2011"," Overdone sequel but still good and enjoyable enough.
","The first ""Ocean's Eleven"" was probably one of the most entertaining and clever heist movies that I had ever seen, so in that light ""Ocean's Twelve"" is a disappointment but does that also make this a bad movie? Of course not! <br/><br/>The movie uses basically all of the same ingredients and all of the same characters, with added this time even more characters. Also the stories get more complicated but complicated in this case doesn't mean more clever. No, actually the story this time isn't much special and also nothing too spectacular to be honest. The movie is really lacking one clear main point, or heist in this case, that it is build up to.<br/><br/>It's not necessarily that much of a confusing movie to watch but it is one that feels a bit messy and disjointed, since its set in multiple different countries this time and not all of the characters are always together as a team. On top of that, the story also isn't always told chronologically and features quite some flashbacks in it. They were perhaps just trying too hard to top the first movie, which instead backfired at them.<br/><br/>To be honest the movie to me was a perfectly fun and watchable one for its first hour or so but after that things start to go downhill with its story, which also really goes eventually at the expense of the movie its entertainment value. It makes the movie even feel overlong, while it actually is only just a normal average 2 hours long.<br/><br/>They also perhaps too desperately tried to shoehorn in every character from the first movie into this one. In the first movie Danny Ocean's eleven each served a purpose within the story because of their special skills, while in this movie their skills really aren't that relevant for them, since they don't put them to use. No, half of the characters could had easily been cut from its script but in that case we wouldn't had had a ""Ocean's Twelve"" of course. But it also makes it all the more unnecessary that new characters, played by well known actors, get introduced in this movie.<br/><br/>Sure, it's all still good fun seeing all of these big names acting together in one movie, also since they themselves obviously were having fun with it, which make it all the more pleasant for the viewer as well. Especially George Clooney and Brad Pitt remain great in this movie. Also the newly added Catherine Zeta-Jones does a great job. It still are foremost the actors and all of their chemistry together that make this still a good and enjoyable enough watch. Just imaging this movie without any of them and you would have a pretty bad and maybe even boring movie. Same goes for Steven Soderbergh directing approach.<br/><br/>Besides all of the familiar names, all of the Ocean's movies also have a familiar style to them. They are all hip, stylish movies to watch, which also still really helps to make these movies better than the average ones within the genre.<br/><br/>It's also good to see how they had really learned from their mistakes with this movie, since the third movie, of course named ""Ocean's Thirteen"", is a much better one again, that also is being more like the first movie with its story, fun and characters.<br/><br/>They really tried too hard with this movie and truly overdid it this time but all in all this movie remains a good and enjoyable enough watch.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","I enjoyed Oceans 11, I thought it was quite enjoyable, helped by the performances and the direction. However, I was disappointed with this film. Don't get me wrong, it is not a complete dud, thanks to the stellar performances from Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Matt Damon especially and the efficient direction from Steven Soderbergh. However, the film really does suffer from truly lethargic pacing, some of the film was so slow I almost fell asleep between one key twist. Second, the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up. The camera work wasn't as innovative as it was in the first movie either. Whereas in the first movie, it was smooth and professional, it was jerky and awkward here, and the music wasn't particularly memorable. The screenplay also wasn't as witty or as fun, and the film felt anti-climatic. At the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy, despite the expert playing and direction. So much potential, but really a missed opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

The twist at the end, which was the first movie's strong point, isn't worth mentioning, and will leave you disappointed.<br/><br/>If you loved the chemistry between the characters in Oceans Eleven, you'll probably be disappointed. Although it has its moments, the clever details of the first movie is lost, and the characters don't change at all throughout the film.

","This is the perfect example of the Hollywood machine doing their best to simply cash in on a bankable sequel without putting any work or thought into the story. It's immensely clear to me that the reason for the chop-tastic editing and disorienting camera-work is to distract the viewer that there's nothing actually going on. The whole plot rolls on disappointing rails from the first frame until the whole movie hits it's cheap, cop-out, excuse for a surprise ending with a wet thud.<br/><br/>Ordinarily, I'd be loath to give away the ending, but this one is so poor, I feel I'm doing you a favor. After the entire plot dully tromps up to the obvious 'we're doomed' false sunset, the deus ex machina ladle scoops up the entire plot and deposits the viewer in a series of barely thought out flashback scenes referring to characters who were barely brushed upon throughout the story, reporting a caper that's both implausible and dull. A priceless art masterpiece transported by a dude in a backpack with two bodyguards, in lieu of an armored convoy? Even if such an implausible situation where to occur, the courier in question would be blanketed in high tech surveillance, instead of two losers on radios to each other.<br/><br/>What's more, once you've gotten the goods, why go through the dumbshow of 'pretending' to be caught? Are these super-thieves so eager to be processed, photographed, fingerprinted and strip-searched just for the sake of putting on a show for their inept tormentor? I don't think so.<br/><br/>Leaving aside the implausibility of the heist, the execution is just sad. Their plan is to board the train, distract the courier and switch out his bag?

","Oceans' 12, the sequel to Ocean's 11 was released back in December of 2004. The first movie is a great fun film that had great acting, a good plot, fun and interesting characters, crisp and humours dialogue, along with a cool style with how the movie was thrown together. Ocean's 12 brings back what was good about the first film, but it ends up failing short of being the perfect sequel.<br/><br/>Oceans' 12 sees the return of Oceans' 11 (the group of characters) whom have all lived happy lives spending away their stolen money. Unfortunately for Oceans' 11 Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) wants his money back and unless he receives it in two weeks Oceans' 11 will be appearing in the obituaries. The group meets and decides to head of to Amsterdam to steal their way to paying off their debt. The group is quickly tagged by Rusty's (Brad Pitt) former girlfriend and elite Europol detective, Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Things get worse for the crew when they find that they will have to compete with master thief Francois Toulour (Vincent Cassel) so that they can repay their debts.<br/><br/>Well I have no problem with the story as a whole it is the events that occur that make what should have been a good film and a great sequel. My first problem is with certain characters being excluded from the whole movie. Two of the eleven are quickly removed from the story, only to make short appearances later on. My second grip is with the overly ridiculous and pointless conversations between group members. Though they seem to develop character, for example the argument over if stealing from a handicapped man is wrong, in the end they really don't do anything for the average movie watcher, who will either get a couple of laughs with them or who will dismiss them quickly as useless wastes of precious runtime. I think a note worthy part of the film that is so ridiculous it really ruins the mood and really collapses the whole fantasy of these thieves in the real world is when Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) pretends to be her real self, Julia Roberts. The hints through out the film that Tess looked like Julia were ruined when you find out what they were for. It was just a wow what the hell were they thinking moment.<br/><br/>My second biggest complaint with the film is that for about 40-50 minutes you are watching something that has no point at all. With out ruining it for the people who haven't watched the Oceans' 12 yet, the film practically laughs in the viewers face as it shows you what really happened instead of what you are lead to believe what was going on. If you've seen the film you will know what I'm talking about and what a big waste of time the 40-50 minutes was.<br/><br/>Now the biggest problem with the film is the title. Oceans' 12. Makes sense doesn't it? They just add a new member to the team. Well they really don't, though you could debate that there are actually a few characters they add to make the 11 a 12. Eventually after countless hours of debating with yourself on which character made the cut you will just figure out that Oceans' 12 was just a clever way of saying Ocean's 11 2 without having two numbers in the title.<br/><br/>Oceans' 12 is a decent movie and sequel, though it really takes away from the greatness of the first film. It brings a lot of what was good in the first film, but ends up wasting huge amounts of your time just to get a laugh or to actually have a plot. Would I recommend Oceans' 12? No I wouldn't say I would. I think the series is much better if it is just Oceans' 11 and Oceans' 13."

","While watching Ocean's Eleven I could not avoid to make a comparison with films like Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch.<br/><br/>Just replace the fresh, tight and engaging script with a wannabe-smart, well polished but ultimately soulless script that incidentally is also the based on some 40 year old original idea; the mostly unknown but captivating cast with a bunch of assorted Hollywood stars who, for the most part, have made better things; last but not least, replace a stylish, snazzy but functional work of Ritchie with Hollywood's idea of an 'alternative' director (the vacuous Soderbergh) In Ocean's Eleven all of this just works because the script is not exceedingly preposterous, and most importantly, it was directed with a steady pace which did not give too the viewer too much time to think about it.<br/><br/>Such a long introduction to explain why 12 is such a failure: the good things which made 11 a decent film are completely gone in 12. The attempt at tongue-in-cheek humor has gone so bad that the tongue sticks out of the cheek, there are even MORE stars, but the entertainment value has completely vanished: to be fair, the plot is built uphill, depicting the 100%-coolness heroes of the first film as clueless lads which have run out of both luck and money; it was really a sorry and miserable viewing, since the all-stars cast (and the cardboard-thick characters) does not make it easy to sympathize with the gang misfortunes. To add insult to injury, the final twist is so much stretched and overblown, that the rest of the film look almost believable in comparison.<br/><br/>Soderbergh's direction not only lacks tightness but occasionally even manages to become annoying, like one sequence when he does repeated close-ins on the faces of the main characters. A trick that works two or three times before it starts upsetting my stomach (a sensation previously felt only once, while watching the second Bourne).<br/><br/>Also deserving a mention is the metafilmic turn it takes towards the end when one of the characters pretends to be the actor it is interpreted by. However the idea had the potential to amuse, this trick is pulled off in such a campy and hollow manner that, short of being funny, it actually succeeds in representing how distorted the idea of self-irony may be in a bunch of overcelebrated mediocre blockbuster stars and writers.<br/><br/>Unless you are a hardcore fan of the first film or the cast, this is one to steer clear of."

This illustrates the artistry of LeMarc, and why he is regarded so highly amongst those who perform the long con. This is the reason LeMarc is so apologetic to Danny and Rusty, and he claims ""I'm still getting the better of you"" at the end of their meeting.

","Ocean's Twelve (2004, Dir. Steven Soderbergh) <br/><br/>They pulled off one of the biggest heists ever and now they have another job to complete. Ocean's Eleven, which consisted off Danny Ocean, Rusty Ryan and Linus Caldwell and others, all thought they would be able to enjoy their money, but someone has other plans. Terry Benedict is still fuming after losing his money and wants it back. The team now have the job of getting all the money they spent back, or risk being thrown in jail. How are they going to get it all back? By pulling off another amazing plan.<br/><br/>The first film of the trilogy was very enjoyable and i looked forward to the idea of a sequel. Unfortunately, the sequel has many problems. All the characters are back and are great as usual, and although the jokes do seem to lack in amount since the first film, they are still fun to hear. The big problem the movie has is storytelling. I don't know what they could read on paper, but what i saw on film, i just could not understand what was happening. The different story lines featured for each character just seemed to appear from all over the place. Even though i could not understand what was happening, i did enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>""Gee Topher, you didn't have to go all Frankie Muniz on me."" - Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt)"

","This was a shambles, a terrible follow on from the first film which is far superior. Most of the team members do nothing in this and are just twiddling their thumbs throughout the whole movie! Danny Ocean plays second fiddle to Brad Pitt's character, Andy Garcia is there to make up the numbers along with Julia Roberts, who turns up at the end in a disgraceful and ridiculous ego-massaging scene with Bruce Willis!!! Catherine Zeta Jones? - get out! I hated the fact her character was made out to be cleverer than everybody else. I started losing interest in the difficult-to-follow bizarre plot after about 40 minutes. The original film had a simple idea - rob the casino vault, with everyone doing their part in the outrageous heist... this however, is just a mess. My advice is to avoid this completely."

","As many of you know, this movie's cast includes many of Hollywood's big name stars. Julia Roberts, Brad Pit, George Cloony, Bernie Mac, Matt Damon and many more famous actors have all been in this unsatisfactory movie. After the first movie, I expected a decent sequel which would not, although it kind of did, make my face go ""(-__-).""<br/><br/>The overall plot seemed like an unsuccessful imitation of the first's. The movie included many aspects of the first movie including a ""suspense' built up before a job was pulled off, and a ""surprising twist"" at the end, which didn't make much sense to me. To avoid spoiling the movie for those unfortunate souls who have decided to watch this movie before seeing the third in the series, which I have yet to watch, I will not say what this ""twist"" is. However, I will say that after seeing what happened I couldn't help but wonder why the gang did certain things if that was so.<br/><br/>Anyways, this movie did not meet my expectations, but I ill say it wasn't complete trash because there still were some funny parts in it and i certainly enjoyed the part where Toulour listens to music while... you know. That part was totally awesome and I watched that part a couple times over because it was that awesome.

Great actors, nice scenery, great shooting, and even a plan of revenge. What ended up happening was that the writers couldn't pen a suitable solution for the problems they created. I think the writers outsmarted themselves by creating scenarios they simply could not feasibly resolve. The result was a disaster.<br/><br/>Downright boredom pervades Twelve. I had to force myself to finish it because there was no hook. I kept asking myself, 'what the heck am I hoping for'? I couldn't even answer my own question at the end of the movie. Granted, some parts were excellent. A few made me want to throw things at my television. The acting scheme was all wrong. Andy Garcia was barely around, and Matt Damon got a lot more screen time.

"zardoz-13","4","0","1","21 June 2007"," Woefully Short on White-Knuckled Thrills and Chills
","Hi-tech heist thrillers about criminal masterminds out to crack ultra-sophisticated security systems to filch a fortune in either millions of dollars or objets d'art thrive or dive based on the gadgetry our heroes resort to and the suspense their efforts generate. While ""Traffic"" director Steven Soderbergh's new caper movie ""Ocean's Twelve"" (** out of ****) boasts an array of gadgets, this slick, stylist, but superficial sequel to Soderbergh's own remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"" comes up woefully short on white-knuckled thrills and chills. In other words, the protagonists get off far too easy. Indeed, as the film's ads aver, the entire ""Ocean's Twelve"" cast reprise their respective roles, but this time around they perform with considerably less charm and individuality. In ""Ocean's Eleven,"" each participant possessed a unique talent that lent itself to their efforts to knock over three Las Vegas casinos in one night. Now, in ""Ocean's Twelve,"" Soderbergh gives their talents short-shrift and has them behave like a herd. Lushly produced and beautifully lensed in exotic Continental locales, principally Amsterdam and Rome, ""Ocean's Twelve"" supplements its contrived, already overcrowded narrative nonsense with two new characters. An arrogant but wily French cat burglar named ""The Night Fox"" (Vincent Cassel of ""Jefferson in Paris"") and a curvy, overzealous European female investigator (Catherine Zeta-Jones of ""Intolerable Cruelty"") make things tougher this time for George Clooney, Brad Pit, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Carl Reiner, Julia Roberts and Elliot Gould as they try to pinch a priceless Faberge egg. Overlong by about twenty minutes with endless wrap-up details, ""Ocean's Eleven"" isn't half as entertaining as Soderbergh's ""Eleven."" This plodding potboiler packs in too many false alarms, too many conveniently-staged, last-minute surprise reversals, and a shamelessly absurd celebrity cameo subplot to its rambling, improvised plot about revenge and rivalry among thieves. Ultimately, for all its glossy production values and star-laden talent, ""Ocean's Twelve"" is bland to the point of anonymity, with our heroes rarely breaking a sweat. Meaning, if you want to see a bunch of Americans loafing in Europe with no chance of anybody getting killed for their criminal ambitions, ""Ocean's Twelve"" qualifies as a leisurely way to let two hours and ten minutes elapse.<br/><br/>""Ocean's Twelve"" starts well, immediately putting our ensemble of protagonists together behind the proverbial 8-ball. Vegas magnate Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia of ""Confidence"") has blood in his eye after Danny Ocean (George Clooney of ""Solaris"") and his chums stole $160 million from three of his casinos. Benedict and his hostile-looking hoods catch up with the boys individually and warm them that they have two weeks to pay back the entire amount with interest. No, it doesn't matter to Benedict that the insurance companies have already made good his enormous losses. Instead, as far as Benedict is concerned, it amounts to a point of honor in the underworld. Benedict will look like an easy mark if he doesn't retaliate for what Ocean's Eleven did to him on his own turf. Initially, our heroes decide to pull their next job overseas because they are too hot stateside, so they head off to Amsterdam. Meanwhile, Ocean's second-in-command Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt of ""Troy"") has gotten himself hopelessly entangled with a skirt, undercover Europol agent Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and she refuses to let anything or anyone stop her from busting Rusty. Again, the original cast doesn't get to do what they do best. Meanwhile, Soderbergh tries to pull off a gag involving Julia Roberts impersonating herself. You'll either be amused (I wasn't) or exasperated (I was) with this shoddy writing. One thing that Soderbergh and co-scenarist George Nolfi of ""Timeline"" do well is getting the heroes behind the 8-ball. They throw more obstacles at them than they did in the original. Once they have the odds totally stacked against them, Soderbergh comes up with a less than credible payoff that anybody with one eye could see through in a New York second. Good try, but no cigar. ""Ocean's Twelve"" garnered a PG-13 rating for its profanity, because nobody gets shot, smashed-up, or sexually assaulted in this so-so saga. Clearly, the tide has turned the wrong way with ""Ocean's Twelve."""

For some reason the writers and producers of this group figured they had enough substance to do a sequel. WRONG !! Most of the characters are NOT likable. They try to make it interesting by constantly changing countries. They try to make it interesting with a plot that might be hard for most to follow. George Kloony and Brad Pitt are in the mix again to try and make things slick and flamboyant. No help. Matt Damen makes it worse with his character. The supporting cast has NO likable characters either. If you can see this at a friends house that is fine, but DON'T waste your money on this one folks.

","This is one of those cases where the law of diminishing returns unfortunately applies.<br/><br/>Three years after the Bellagio heist in Vegas, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his mates are tracked down by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), who wants his money back. With interest. In two weeks. Or he'll kill every last one of them. Therefore the team decides to move to Europe, so that they can steal some valuable stuff. They only have two problems: one is Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an Interpol agent on their trail, who also happens to be Rusty's (Brad Pitt) former girlfriend; the other one is a French con-man (Vincent Cassel) who seems to be ahead of them all the time.<br/><br/>Original crime caper Ocean's Eleven is a very good film, mainly because of the script. The same can't be said about this sequel: the screenplay was originally written for a John Woo flick, and sadly, people can notice that: it's SO obvious the plot was altered just to let Clooney and the others go fooling around in France and Italy. Also, why call the movie Ocean's Twelve and make Rusty the team-leader? OK, so this time HIS love interest is causing trouble, but why didn't the writer just name the film Ryan's Twelve in that case?<br/><br/>Anyway, Twelve still has some appeal, thanks to one of its predecessor's key elements: great actors. Despite the discontinuous script, all the cast-members obviously enjoyed shooting this film, and I enjoyed watching their work. Matt Damon, in particular, steals the show as the insecure Linus, who would like ""a more central role this time"". The new entries (Zeta-Jones, Cassel) are quite good too, but the real treat is Bruce Willis'uncredited cameo as himself: Albert Finney, Robbie Coltrane and Eddie Izzard's brief appearances impress as well, but Bruno's presence is, along with Clooney asking people ""How old do you think I am?"", the funniest, and probably best sequence in the entire film. You might not like all of it, but that scene really is worth watching.<br/><br/>Altogether, a bit disappointing but still enjoyable.

","Who needs twelve drummers drumming when you've got twelve con artists and thieves vying for ways to steal $190 million in two weeks? Why $190 million? That's the amount stolen from Las Vegas casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) in Ocean's Elevenand he wants his money backwith interest! Set three years after the end of the Eleven escapades, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) reassembles his eleven con artists and thieves, adding one new team member, to appease an angry Benedict who only gives the team two weeks to return all of the cash. Meanwhile, Ocean's Twelve tries to avoid confrontations with an inexplicable French rival called the ""Night Fox"" and dodge Europol agent Isabel Lehiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones). All bets are off. Directed by Steven Soderbergh proves something. With eleven announced production jobs currently, Soderbergh has it in for himself. Not only did he direct Ocean's Eleven, but he has also directed other magnificent films such as Traffic, Erin Brockovich, and The Limey. One large incentive to seeing Ocean's Twelve is the acting. This movie definitely screams big names. Co-stars George Clooney (Intolerable Cruelty, O Brother, Where Art Thou?) and Brad Pitt (Troy, Meet Joe Black) really complement each other. Other stars of Ocean's Twelve include Matt Damon (The Bourne Identity), Catherine Zeta-Jones (The Terminal), Andy Garcia (Night Falls On Manhattan), and Julia Roberts (Closer). The difference between this original and its sequel is the dialogue. When watching Ocean's Eleven, one is on the edge of the seat, but in Ocean's Twelve one finds himself laughing more. The excess humor in the sequel gives it a different taste than the original. The cinematography in this film is definitely accentuated by the variety. The many different camera angles and transitions in this motion picture truly amazed me. The storyline adds its spice, allowing this movie to shine. Musically, the mood was well conveyed through the music. There were times when I could notice the disposition being expressed by simple music. As an apparent success, Ocean's Twelve was number one at the Box-Office its first weekend. Competing with Blade: Trinity, which came out Wednesday December 8, wasn't a hard task. Ocean's Twelve took in $39.2 million right away, leaving Blade: Trinity to $24.5 million gross and National Treasure to third place in the dust. With a mild PG-13 rating for brief language, the film is peppered with language but doesn't take over the movie. Overall, Ocean's Twelve was to my liking. Without a seat available in the theatre, the success of this movie was outstanding. I'm glad that Clooney was more appealing than Wesley Snipes, otherwise, I'd be frightened with the world I'm living in."

Never mind the fact that the lasers keep passing through his body, it still ranks as one of the sheer stupidest scenes in movie history.<br/><br/>This film is smug, flashy, soulless and far, FAR too knowing for its own good. If you want a decent heist movie, watch the original Italian Job. Not this."

","It can be said that I am addicted to movies, and 7 is a pretty high rating in the scheme of things. I thurougly enjoyed the movie, although it seemed like it was badly sequenced, it felt like the director decided to begin the movie with a ""flashback"" and than couldn't stop himself from continuing to use the technique. As far as I'm concerned this was the worst aspect of the movie, the acting was great not spectacular but great. I especially like the french actor, Vincent Cassel. The overall film and storyline was great, some of it was predictable some of it wasn't. There were great sequences like Vincent Cassel's laser beam part. I particularly didn't like that part about Julia Roberts, it obviously wasn't a part of the original story. Overall 1. I recommend that if you have seen Oceans Eleven, wait until you do before you see this movie because it might be confusing with out knowing some of the story. 2. If you did like Oceans Eleven, its worth seeing"

","I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times I've walked out of a movie in the middle or turned off the video/DVD. Ocean's Twelve belongs to that undistinguished group. Unlike Ocean's Eleven (the modern remake, not the original), this movie has remarkably little going for it despite the presence of a gifted, star-quality cast. Since I gave up after half an hour, thoroughly uninvolved in the story's premise and in its execution, I can only say that this film has the worst beginning of any movie I've seen in the past decade. It may have improved at later stages but I wasn't willing to stay around to see if it did."

","in the ocean's eleven sequel, ocean's twelve, terry Benedict (andy Garcia) comes back to haunt ocean ( George cloony) and his gang. he tells each and every one of them they have one week to come up with all of the cash they stole from him in the previous film plus interest or die. there's a little bit of a twist. will that stop ocean from success? with an estimated budget of one hundred ten million dollars, ocean's twelve made more than thirty nine-million dollars just on opening weekend. a whopping overall gross of more than one hundred twenty million dollars made this a popular film. ocean's twelve is not one of those predictable movies. the movie is full of surprises.just when you think ocean has a plan you find out someone named the white fox who is hired by Benedict is plotting the same heist.ocean's eleven and twelve is a version of a crime movie from the criminal's point of view. viewers find themselves rooting for the bad guys in ocean's twelve because the writers set up in ocean's eleven for everyone to hate the good guy. however you don't have to see the first film to enjoy the sequel. this movie is funny, surprising and entertaining on it's own. the characters may be cought up in a heist but they still have time for love. what's a movie without a little romance? i also liked the movie because it was one of those fast paste movies where they get straight to the plot. they don't drag out the beginning and keep you clueless as to what is going on and why it is important. This is a good movie to see just for the laughs. the characters use compassion and friendship to reel you in. ocean's twelve will suite any kind of audience with funny lines, and a captivating plot with an even more thrilling action of a robbery than the first."

I think you could almost call this a tastefull spoof of Oceans Eleven only with the same cast, spoofing themselves.

I have to admit being disappointed with the film but I really like Ocean 11 its on of my guilty pleasures. I want to start out with the flaws, the story no one like a movie that has a hard to follow story. i mean its not suppose to be confusing the story was originally written for John Woo. What really got me angry was the fact that it seemed all over the place and seemed to shift focus away from the movie the first movie had a pretty simple story o follow and I really wished they had come up with a better why to portray the life of the Chinese acrobat. Besides the obvious flay their is a savory in this film its the fact that the cast seems to have a chemistry that cannot be foiled by the story. I mean everyone seems ready for action however I wish we got to see more of Bernie mac he really stills the film in the first one. the thing that really got me mad was the fact that the chemistry in the first movie was predominately seen between the guys not Tess, Tess was more of secondary character and she really faded into the background in the first film in this film they attempt to give her a dimension in the story that seems to take away from the film. I didn't want to be disappointed with Ocean 12 but when you have too much fun on set thats what happens. If you want to see a movie that fun then go see the first one. Ocean 12 has one thing going for it that most movie will never have the ability to draw you in if you just were to see one scene see the break dancing scenes the cuts of break dancing and the scene in which Cassels break dances through the lasers one of the b boy scenes I have seen in years and the song is awesome something you could bust a wind mill to then smoke some hookah.<br/><br/>Ocean's 12 gets C (average not bad or good)"

","Starring: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones I found Ocean's Eleven to be a highly entertaining crime caper of a movie.<br/><br/>I didn't like the ending because it left everything hanging out, saying one of two things. First, we don't know how to properly end a movie. Second, there's a sequel underway.<br/><br/>Fortunately, it was the latter.<br/><br/>At the end of Eleven, Danny and the boys get away with their heist, but Terry Benedict's goons are watching them and following them.<br/><br/>Enter Ocean's Twelve. Benedict is still a little less than thrilled about being robbed and insulted by Danny and the crew, and he wants his money back. Plus interest. This presents a slight problem, as most of the guys have squandered their ""hard earned"" dollars on God only knows what. Hence the premise of the movie; Danny and his fellow ten thieves have fourteen days to come up with the money they took from Terry.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is not terribly difficult to follow if you have more than three quarters of your brain functioning. Translation, it's a good popcorn flick. Nothing wrong with those in my opinion.<br/><br/>One drawback to Twelve when compared to Eleven is that there isn't a big, masterful, detailed heist to watch. This may be a slight disappointment to some, but I found it to work just fine, as it gave the director the opportunity to zoom the lens in on the characters and focus on the individuals behind the crimes.<br/><br/>The movie does have some very cool scenes and some highly amusing ones as well. For example, there is an amusing segment where Tess has to pretend to be Julia Roberts. This is hardly a perfect film by any stretch, but I would still rank it as a worthy sequel.<br/><br/>On a somewhat unrelated note, Julia Roberts is thirty eight. It is not natural for someone to still be that fine when they're pushin' forty.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a look)"

In this convoluted mess, our hero not only has to outwit the police but also pit himself against the world's greatest thief. A messy conglomeration of the same elements which made the 2001 flick entertaining, ""Ocean's Twelve"" simply tries too hard to do too much with too little time resulting a bad case of sequelitis.

"EijnarAmadeus","3","0","1","18 April 2005"," Soderbergh makes this movie good, but in the same time tries a bit too much
","OCEAN'S ELEVEN is without doubt one of the best remakes ever, and with the awaited sequel everybody expects the same charm, cool and entertainment that we got in the first - after all, the director and actors are all the same! So we have all the reason to have some great expectations going around. Wrapped up with the fabulous cast of the previous and this time Catherine Zeta-Jones ducks up, together with great cameos as Bruce Willis, Robbie Coltrane and Vincent Cassel. Steven Soderbergh making Ocean's Eleven dangerously sexy and cool, have a lot to loose here but in the same time; didn't he simply show that he was a top-notch director back then, and that this guy wouldn't mess such a thing up? Well, Soderbergh struggles and gives an enormous effort to make this movie look as good as it does, and only that makes OCEAN'S TWELVE quickly a very amusing movie to watch. And with all of the beautiful stars the movie leaps off into a very slick entertainment now! Three years after the Las Vegas heist were the eleven cons stole 160,000,000 dollars from casino tycoon Benedict, Danny Ocean and his fab. 10 cons are living peacefully spending their share of the money. Then, one day Terry Benedict shows up, finally hunted them down and wants his money, with interest back. Now, the eleven has to team up again, including a new female member, to start picking up the money all across Europe.<br/><br/>The movie starts off better than anything else, a great watch. As a soaking wet Brad Pitt enters the room and kisses Zeta-Jones laying in the bed, only problem being that he is a thief - and she's a agent hunting on exactly guys like him. As the screen freezes, we see Pitt / Rusty jumping out of the window and OCEAN'S TWELVE kicks off. It's just as entertaining and cool watching, especially with the fantastic letters of A-M-S-T-E-R-D-A-M brilliantly smacks upon us and others. And the still very amusing half telepathic dialogs between Pitt and Clooney fills the between greatly, and so with the Soderbergh director knowledges. As he here makes it all more wild with great hand-held camera jogging around, making a fine support to the whole movie's super stylish image. But there are also targets that this movie misses pity enough - as Vincent Cassel's super-thief ""Night-Fox"" when he looks simply silly jumping around and between the bad CGI-animated laser-beams, or when Julia Roberts has to pretend as she is, Julia Roberts - well, it's not that charming or funny! And with those effects, the movie has a way of taking everything so very un-serious to the level that it all gets a bit uninteresting. The laughs and amusement are still there, Soderbergh does a good job though he maybe tries a bit too hard here.<br/><br/>OCEAN'S TWELVE is a worthy sequel by all means, but it doesn't have the cool and charming edge of brilliant movie making that the first made so perfectly."

"irmddj","8","0","2","13 March 2005"," Entertaining simplicity with lots of little twists
","After seeing this movie, which had me leaving the theatre in a very happy mood, I thought about writing a review for this site. So first I looked at the opinions of other people. And those caused me to scratch my head a lot. 'Drab European scenery'. 'All star cast just there to show off they're an all star cast'. 'Weird camera shots'. 'No plot'. 'The biggest heist is the fact that they've stolen my money'. 'Sequel, whaddayaexpect?' 'Horrible'. Etcetera.<br/><br/>Erk. Are we talking about the same movie here? Somehow I get the impression people were thinking: well, Ocean's Eleven was about a masterful heist, so Ocean's Twelve must be about an even bigger one. Or perhaps they were expecting another Ocean's Eleven. But then it would have been called Ocean's Eleven 2, wouldn't it? Fact is, Ocean's Twelve is called Ocean's Twelve, and that might have been a subtle hint. Now, for the record, I have not seen Ocean's Eleven, so perhaps my view is a bit skewed. On the other hand, I am not burdened by the knowledge 'what happened before' and could just concentrate on the current installment instead.<br/><br/>Short outline of the plot: somehow the victim (shady owner of a casino) of the Ocean's Eleven heist manages to locate the members of the team and threatens to kill them if they don't pay up the money they stole. With a fat interest, of course. No one has that kind money of money laying around, so the team needs another heist. But in the backs of their minds there is the nagging question: how did the owner of the casino find them all? As it turns out, while executing a small-paying robbery in Amsterdam to secure a big, fat-paying assignment (which would still not cover for the entire amount they owned, hinthint!), they were outsmarted by someone called the Night Fox, the most infamous crook alive. And it is precisely this Night Fox who, thanks to his conceited ego and careless remarks made by his mentor about who the biggest crook alive is, wants to take on Ocean's Eleven/Twelve team in a duel. Their goal: stealing a FabergÃ© egg. If the Night Fox wins, he will go down as the greatest crook alive. If Ocean's team wins, the Night Fox will pay the debt. Now of course the Night Fox is outfoxed, but how and where is something I'm not going to tell.<br/><br/>If your first response to reading the above is 'Bweeach, been there, seen it', my response: ah, but have you seen how that tale is *told*? There's where the fun comes in. It's, just like the title of the movie, subtle. (And you honestly didn't expect the script to be about an even bigger heist, did you?) It's full of little plots to keep your mind occupied. The director dared to use flashbacks without a single word of explanation---you, the viewer, have to figure them out. Despite their vast technical skills, the team finds it tough to deal with the powers of the weaker sex. Despite the fact that they're thieves, they have a sort-of code of honour which they will not break; the morals of the detective out to get them all behind bars are questioned when she's shown to not be above a little two-timing herself. Quite hilarious are the scenes where Bruce Willis playing himself meets 'Tess' played by Julia Roberts who is faking to be Julia Roberts. It is not often you get to see stars taking themselves not-entirely-too-seriously, but still serious enough to realise they are playing a role in a movie. And there's lots more.<br/><br/>All-star cast? Well, yeah. People more or less expect to see stars on the screen, don't they? Are there moments where, as one reviewer put it, a sign with 'applaud now' appears? Err, no. Except for Mrs. Zeta-Jones, who is dressed way too smartly for the detective role she is playing, they play their role, with no one really being singled out. They function as a well-oiled team with two leaders. There is no room for in-depth character development and long wow-look-at-me shots. And Mrs. Zeta-Jones is forgiven, because she is up against a team of bad guys on her own. <br/><br/>In the end, when the Night Fox despite his masterful aerobics is shown for the pompous ass he really is, you realise the main gist of the movie: sometimes daring heists, no matter why they are performed, are not about complex intrusions, masterful computer hacks and other tomcruisery, but about simple, sneaky plots executed to perfection leaving the other parties involved none the wiser. (Not convinced? Well, it sure made three or four men at the end of February 2005 multi-millionaires when they drove away with $70 million dollars' worth in diamonds, without a single shot being fired, from, how ironically, the airport of Amsterdam.) The story may not be one of the best ever written, but it was told with style, flair and rhythm. I was quite po'ed that I had to watch it in a crummy little theatre with chairs which were too small for me, but the movie managed to capture me sufficiently to forget about cramped arms, legs and an aching back. That, by definition, makes it 'good' to 'very good' in my book."

At the beginning of the film i found it quite confusing to keep up with the plot. As the film goes on you understand the plot a bit better. In the beginning of the film you are automatically introduced to a new character who is Catherine Zeta-Jones. Personally i found this part of the plot confusing as i did not know it was a long time on from when they robbed the casinos in Oceans eleven. Overall i think Oceans twelve will get many votes and many people will want to go and see this film because it is the sequel to Oceans eleven and that was such a big hit.

The acting was spot on, the direction and camera-work brilliant and the old story as smooth as before.<br/><br/>So when I heard Oceans Twelve was poor beyond belief from Jonny Ross (BBC Film 2005) I was disappointed but not devastated. Finding myself in a Cardiff cinema with my funky Free Movies card and nothing else to see, my cousin and I took the leap and stepped into the darkened theatre awaiting with interest to see exactly where they went wrong.<br/><br/>At first it seemed equally as good as it's predecessor.

"mnm17","7","0","2","22 February 2005"," Come on, it wasn't that bad!
","After reading a couple of the user summaries and having a look at most of the titles, I am quite disappointed to see how much people gave negative comments towards Ocean's Twelve. Personally, I think that the plot was well thought of. I was a bit confused at the end, but it didn't take away to my enjoyment of the movie as a whole. And after discussing it with others or seeing it a second time, you get the point (it's not pointless). It is really important to discuss these kind of movies with others after the viewing, it's inevitable! Cause others may have noticed things you haven't! Of course, if we compare it to Ocean's Eleven, we must take in consideration that sequels aren't normally as good as the first one. Also, the last time I saw Ocean's 11 is a while back, and at that time had no actual knowledge of movie-making. Now that I've had film study and had to watch Ocean's Twelve twice to analyze it, I've come to enjoy it a lot. Everything in it is so well organized and thought out. From camera angles, to camera shots and the interaction of these shots, as well as the scenes themselves, the mise-en-scene and the montage... all is in accordance to make that movie beautiful.<br/><br/>I must say that I'm not personally a huge fan of the Oceans movies, but nonetheless I loved these movies, and I don't think that Ocean's 12 was a bad sequel. It followed the idea of the first movie, and it was brilliantly done; a different story was introduced so as not to repeat anything from Ocean's 11. I think that involving a new character added to the intrigue, and we could obviously see that the cast worked well together. It's amazing how all these great celebrities worked well together with no one in particular who stole the show.<br/><br/>All in all, I don't think that it was justified to criticize Ocean's 12 that much, because on a technical point of view, it wasn't the best, but it was still brilliantly done. Everything in the movie fit except for the scene with Matsui, which was quite disturbing but in the end I guess it all makes sense! (Still haven't discussed that one yet). Anyways, watching this movie or any movie with high expectations ruins it, so please save those negative comments for some movies that really deserve it! =P"

They must have known he would threaten them and if they knew that then if they were going to give in to the threats and give the money back why did they rob him in the first place? And thinking about it they didn't even steal anything in the movie, they just cheated and asked the other thief here it was. The Nightfox was actually better than them. But the characters are great, especially Brad Pitt who i actually went to see the movie for. He is just so HOT in that film, and the one before it. It was a bit too complicated though because they did stuff and i didn't know why and when and how. But you know, Brad Pitt kinda makes up for it. I still think he shouldn't have cut his hair so short though and kept it like it was in the first movie. I really don't understand who Linus's dad is though. I thought it was Rusty, cos my friend told me that and the script gave the impression it was him. But then it wasn't. Weird. I would give it a watch if i were you though, it's good."

Sadly however he was unable to duplicate it here. It seemed like that only a few characters that were getting substantial screen time. Yes, they were all back but it seemed like it wasn't necessary. All that top billing for guys like Garcia and Mac for bit parts.<br/><br/>I also found the story not as enthralling as the first. Whereas the story of the first felt original and exciting this was more bland. It just didn't have the same punch as the first.

As it turned out, I didn't enjoy as much as I estimated I would've.<br/><br/>The film has quite a large cast and many of the actors/actresses are back from the first film I discovered so in terms of presenting the characters and all round acting in general, I thought that it wouldn't have been very different to that of the first film. As it was, the acting was good with a fine nervous performance from Damon's character and Clooney and Pitt also do their best.<br/><br/>The humour is also just about up to standard. It's thrown in there amongst the pretty dismal plot where they try to make something relatively simple, uncontrollably difficult which not only falls on it's face but leaves bruise marks for all to see when it try's to get back up again. That saying, the jokes do roll along rather nicely and just manage to crop up at the right times giving the film a nice 'timed' feel to it. The Julia Robert's 'sketch' was quite a breath of fresh air in amongst all the confusion. It slowed everything right down and gave me not only a chance to catch my breath but to enjoy a rather surreal scene involving both real, fake and fake-real actors/actresses. Good stuff.<br/><br/>Of course with all the good acting, funny jokes and such aside; film's rely on plots and this one, as mentioned above, didn't really impress me. As I say, it try's to make something difficult when it was quite simple to start off with. It starts off all well and good with the 're-aquiring' of the gang but generally starts to fall away as it looses ground on people. They've obviously gone for the bold option here and credit to them for trying but it just didn't float my boat.<br/><br/>If decimals were a part of IMDb's voting system, then it would've been slightly higher than a six out of ten but in this case, the film deserves to be rounded down."

I suppose credit should be given for reuniting the original eleven actors from the first movie. The story does contain plot twists and ingenious planning for the heists. But some points are had to swallow. Like the Faberge egg hologram, for instance. And having Julia Roberts playing Tess playing Julia Roberts was a wrong turn in the script.

It did not hit the cinematic supreme jackpot that its predecessor was able to reach. At times ""Ocean's Twelve"" seemed indolent, fatiguing, and unpolished. Hey, maybe the porn version of ""Ocean's Twelve"" called ""The Dirty Dozen"" will be better. OK, I lost track of this review.

Maybe you've heard of them: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Casey Affleck, James Caan, and on and on and on. Andy Garcia is also back as the vengeful Casino Owner who wants his money back from the Oceanographers. To do that, the crew must execute a challenging European heist. Oh, who cares about the plot! You chicks just want to check out these dudes, while us guys have our dial set for ""Zeta 4"" for the voluptuous Catherine Zeta-Jones who here plays a European detective who tries to be the heist ballbreaker. Again, it is Catherine's physical and not artistic presence that did it for me. Clooney and the rest of the gang seemed that they were having too much fun here and maybe did not take the project too seriously.

The movie is only saved of being totally disgraceful by an excellent sound and music track and a good performance of all actors involved. It's a poor sequel of Ocean's Eleven but modern movie directors seem not to be able to escape the temptation of making sequels of famous movies thus trying to revive their success almost always without good results.

","So here it is, another sequel to a well-done first part. First things first: Can it compete with Ocean's Eleven? No way, not at all.<br/><br/>Danny Ocean and his partners in crime are at it again, they're planning another high-profile heist (two actually, as the movie evolves). This time they really need the money to pay back what they stole from Danny Ocean's arch-rival in the first movie. They have ten days, or they'll be dead. So much for the premise.<br/><br/>While Ocean's Eleven was uniquely done as a sleek, glitzy, somewhat smart and really amusing tall-tale gangster story, Ocean's Twelve is really just your average gangster flick that doesn't even live up to its own promises. Plus, it is really confusing and I, for one, was lost. Too much stuff on the side, side plots that really have little to do with the storyline pop up throughout the movie. There are also many flashbacks and twists, so it skips back and forth and you really wonder what the heck is going on. Ocean's eleven was done in a similar way, but it all sort of worked well and only added to the film's ingenuity.<br/><br/>Plus, during the first half hour of Ocean's 12, there's really nothing much happening. We meet the cast, they find out that the guy they stole the money from in the first movie wants it back... and that's basically it. The movie picks up speed after that just a little bit, but only to become really confusing.<br/><br/>Of course it must have been difficult for the writers to come up with a similarly brilliant heist scene as the vault thing in Ocean's Eleven, but in the end, this time around they downright failed. The actual steal takes maybe thirty seconds, plus this time they do get caught on the spot. The biggest disappointment however is the stupid idea of distracting attention from the ""object of desire"" during the steal by letting Julia Roberts' Tess character play a real-life Julia Roberts. What were the writers thinking? <br/><br/>So, all in all, Ocean's Twelve is still a stylish movie in its own right, but for the most part, it is definitely more style than substance, plus, the makers of the sequel deeply misjudged the elements of the first movie that made it such a big box office hit. You don't impress audiences just by throwing glitzy, stylish characters at them as well as a nice scenery backdrop, side plots, flashbacks and whatnot. It takes a little more than that to blend those elements and turn them into a comprehensive work of art. Hopefully there won't be an Ocean's 13 as bad as this movie. (what's with that anyway? Who was the 12th guy in Ocean's Twelve?! Did I miss even more than I thought?) <br/><br/>My vote: 5.5 out of 10"

","Who needs twelve drummers drumming when you've got twelve con artists and thieves vying for ways to steal $190 million in two weeks? Why $190 million? That's the amount stolen from Las Vegas casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) in Ocean's Elevenand he wants his money backwith interest! Set three years after the end of the Eleven escapades, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) reassembles his eleven con artists and thieves, adding one new team member, to appease an angry Benedict who only gives the team two weeks to return all of the cash. Meanwhile, Ocean's Twelve tries to avoid confrontations with an inexplicable French rival called the ""Night Fox"" and dodge Europol agent Isabel Lehiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones). All bets are off. Directed by Steven Soderbergh proves something. With eleven announced production jobs currently, Soderbergh has it in for himself. Not only did he direct Ocean's Eleven, but he has also directed other magnificent films such as Traffic, Erin Brockovich, and The Limey. One large incentive to seeing Ocean's Twelve is the acting. This movie definitely screams big names. Co-stars George Clooney (Intolerable Cruelty, O Brother, Where Art Thou?) and Brad Pitt (Troy, Meet Joe Black) really complement each other. Other stars of Ocean's Twelve include Matt Damon (The Bourne Identity), Catherine Zeta-Jones (The Terminal), Andy Garcia (Night Falls On Manhattan), and Julia Roberts (Closer). The difference between this original and its sequel is the dialogue. When watching Ocean's Eleven, one is on the edge of the seat, but in Ocean's Twelve one finds himself laughing more. The excess humor in the sequel gives it a different taste than the original. The cinematography in this film is definitely accentuated by the variety. The many different camera angles and transitions in this motion picture truly amazed me. The storyline adds its spice, allowing this movie to shine. Musically, the mood was well conveyed through the music. There were times when I could notice the disposition being expressed by simple music. As an apparent success, Ocean's Twelve was number one at the Box-Office its first weekend. Competing with Blade: Trinity, which came out Wednesday December 8, wasn't a hard task. Ocean's Twelve took in $39.2 million right away, leaving Blade: Trinity to $24.5 million gross and National Treasure to third place in the dust. With a mild PG-13 rating for brief language, the film is peppered with language but doesn't take over the movie. Overall, Ocean's Twelve was to my liking. Without a seat available in the theater, the success of this movie was outstanding. I'm glad that Clooney was more appealing than Wesley Snipes, otherwise, I'd be frightened with the world I'm living in."

","Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, right? Good, because here's mine. I thoroughly enjoyed Ocean's 12!! I was wary to see it after reading so many negative comments here at IMDb, but am I ever glad we went to see it. Some of the negative's I take exception to, were the one's that said ""nothing was stolen in this movie"" and ""the whole plot of the movie was a kid's backpack being stolen"". With much respect I would like to ask these people: Were you paying attention AT ALL? Yes, something is stolen - two very valuable something's are stolen! Were you nay sayers, per chance, a)in the bathroom, b)getting a refill on your popcorn, or c)yakking on your cell that you apparently missed some crucial moments while they were happening? The cast is superb - yes, you can tell they are friends in real life and yes, the arrogance, silliness and comfort level comes across on the screen. So what? You'd rather see a movie where you can tell the actors can't stand one another? Yes, ""Tess"" portrays ""Julia Roberts"" - but what makes it funny and tolerable is that her portrayal didn't work. Yes, there is a ""lost in translation"" moment that you wonder, what the heck? - but towards the end, you see what the point to that was; ""Danny"" and ""Rusty"" didn't want ""Linus"" to have much of a role in the big heist. Yes, there is a Frenchman who does a break dancing scene - but the break dancing is pivotal to what he is attempting to do, and the Frenchman is one of the main characters! And personally, I liked the flashback scenes. Yes, the plot is tricky, and oh my gosh, you have to actually pay attention (what a concept, huh?) to keep up with the story. The nerve of this director, to actually expect movie goers to THINK ON THEIR OWN! Are there slow moments in the movie? Yes. Are there plot twists? Yes. Are there funky camera angles? Yes. Is this a worthwhile movie to spend two hours with? Absolutely. But that's my opinion. Best advice I can give to anyone is go see the movie for yourself. Don't plan your movie watching activities on the comments of others - not even mine! If YOU think it looks interesting or fun - go see it!"

","Oceans Twelve is without doubt a very nice movie. Not a single murder finds place  just the threat of it. There is even almost no violence at all. It is old-fashioned thieving, not a robbery. Another thing that feels old fashioned is the amount of Hollywood movie stars playing in the movie. Some people got aggravated because of the number of Brad Pitts and Julie Robberts, but this couldn't bother me at all: They all do what their good at: acting. If you think this is annoying, you are probably the kind of person who hates pretty people. Old-fashioned is also certainly the charming atmosphere, one of the best things of Oceans Twelve, the interaction between the characters. The Oceans club feels nice, like a family you want to be part of. The younger ones behave like boys you can't refuse to like. Danny Ocean himself is a bit like a nice uncle: the one that always makes jokes and buys the ticket for the first time in a roller coaster. But the best thing is the way the story keeps changing. This may happen one time to often, it's still a very nice surprise. Especially compared to all the predictable Hollywood blockbusters of the past years. Concluding is Oceans Twelve a really nice movie, made to surprise you with more nice things every minute. Everyone who's not charmed by this one had probably a very bad Christmas and can't stand looking to people who oblivious having fun. If you like looking to something nice with a lot of surprises, this movie is yours."

However, my rating is relatively high since it is a movie that I'd like to see again, perhaps it would work well as a movie to put on in the background during a session of poker."

","Ocean's 12 ***/****<br/><br/>""Ocean's Twelve"" is a heist/comedy/action film about twelve thieves who must pay back casino owner, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) the 160 million dollars that they stole from him in the prequel, ""Ocean's Eleven."" Although Benedict's stolen money was fully compensated by insurance, he seeks revenge and his 160 million dollars back from Danny Ocean, (George Clooney) and his eleven friends. <br/><br/>The plot takes off right away when Benedict comes to Ocean's house demanding his 160 million dollars back in two weeks. The eleven thieves, led by Danny immediately assemble and discuss how they will come up with the 160 million dollars in two weeks. The funny thing is that at no time did any person suggest the idea of not paying Benedict back his money. After all they are thieves, and thieves steal things. But after the victim they stole from requests his money back, it is instantly assumed by all eleven thieves that they must pay him back? ""Ocean's Twelve"" has many plot holes and problems such as the one described above. But ""Ocean's Twelve"" isn't about a strong plot. What makes ""Ocean's Twelve"" worth watching is the star power, ""cool style,"" plot twists, and funny witty lines, and characters. <br/><br/>Director Steven Soderbergh does a remarkable job of developing and portraying all of the twelve thieves (and several others) throughout the film. Each thief has a specialized area of expertise and a unique and often exaggerated and humorous character. For example Linus (Matt Damon) is the uptight, ambitious, nerdy but cool character who makes several funny and ironic comments in the film. At one point Linus comments to the other ten thieves, ""I don't think we have to be the kind of organization that labels people."" This statement is later followed up by a humorous discussion where Linus defends his morals and the rest of the group ridicules him. <br/><br/>As the film progresses many subplots and plot twists unwind. Some are very clever and interesting, but each plot twist and subplot drags the film further away from a strong working plot. <br/><br/>If you can put aside the complicated shaky plot and go with the flow of the movie, you will be able to enjoy the charm of the characters and the ""cool"" atmosphere of the entire film as a whole.<br/><br/>To get the most entertainment out of ""Ocean's Twelve,"" focus not on what the character's are doing and stealing, but how they steal things and what they say and do in the process. ""Ocean's Twelve"" is not a masterpiece, however it is fun and entertaining if you play along with it and let it be."
"griff-46","6","0","1","29 December 2004"," Much more enjoyable if you've seen Ocean's 11 already
","I enjoyed this not quite as much as the first one, but this was good on its' own right. They didn't try to remake the first one, but still had a similar slick caper/hidden twist sort of ending the first one had.<br/><br/>If you've seen the first one, (as I did) it would rate an 8. However, I voted on it as if I hadn't seen the first movie, and I came up with a 6, which I posted. The reason for the downgrade is that a lot of this movie relies on things you would known by having seen the first one. Bernie Mac's character has very little to do in this movie, but the jokes made about his character relate to a scene in the first movie. (a scene that was very funny) The ""Livingston Dell"" character also has much less to do, and you don't get much of an idea what his skills are in this film.<br/><br/>A lot of the fun with Matt Damon's character had in this movie was laid out with groundwork done in the first movie.<br/><br/>I did really enjoy what they did with Julia Roberts in this film (her character had a bit more to do in this film), especially in the credits at the end. (at least stay around through the cast credits at the end) Catherine Zeta-Jones adds some to the film. Her character seemed suited to a more serious film, and in a more serious film would've have been interesting to expand and explore. Her character was, I think, a little too serious for this film.<br/><br/>The motivation for the new ""villian"" in this movie was silly and felt very contrived, a knock of at least half a point. The first movie made everyone's motivations feel realistic and added the charm of it.<br/><br/>If you have seen the first one you will enjoy this, although not as much. If you haven't seen the first one, watch it before you go to this one and you will enjoy it much more."
"Mooderator","7","0","2","28 December 2004"," Problem!
","Problem is a lot of who the people who hated this movie may just be missing the boat. If the Ocean thing could be called a series it's a series about style. The Rat Pack was about style. The heists are almost secondary. I suspect Soderbergh was consciously trying to make a very ""Euro"" style movie. Like 60's Euro, when down and out American actors flooded Europe to make tedious intrigue dramas. The shots, the music, even the graininess of the early scenes in Rome--it all came together for me as such. It was big laugh to me.<br/><br/>But surely the best laugh of all was the ""Introducing Tess as Julia Roberts"", bit with Bruce Willis. It was excellent. It may not be as good as the first one there was little or no suspense to this one but it didn't matter. It was good, pretty fun. If you really think it was terrible, you may have missed the boat."

","I am in no way comparing 12 to 11. Because... well... there *is* no comparison. Which is really quite sad because Ocean's 11 was one of those rare cinematic treats that refused to condescend to the cinema-goer by treating them with respect and commanding their intelligence. It was fun. It was chic. It was sexy as hell. And we had every right to expect that same sort of experience with the much anticipated sequel.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Sonderbergh's sequel doesn't match up to all the eager expectations.<br/><br/>However, I *am* going to say, that I *will* give Ocean's 12 credit for simply being what it is: two hours of a shamelessly whimsical ride. Yes, the plot is ridiculous (though not as confusing as some here have claimed) and the film does indeed hang itself by its' own rope. BUT, if you clear your memory of that wonderful first movie, then I think it is still possible to enjoy this film as a cheeky romp that actually *doesn't* take itself seriously (as some here have claimed) and doesn't make any attempts to dig deeper than its admittedly shallow and glossy surface of quick-witted one-liners and slapstick pranks.<br/><br/>Ocean's 12 is a ride that unfortunately, judging by the sprinkled laughter in the theater when I saw the film, much of the audience isn't going to catch on to. But if you *do* catch the ride, well, it *does* make for a pretty damn fun time. (If for no other reason than getting to hear Matt Damon use the opening lines of Led Zepplin's 'Kashmir' in an effort to 'speak code' which I thought was downright hilarious. Of course the kid sitting next to me at the theater had *no* clue what was going on...)"

I like the movie overall because I really liked the first and this movie seemed like Steven Soderberg wanted to take all of his buddies to Europe and get drunk, oh and while they were at it, make a movie. They were having fun, which is what film-making should be. If you go to see it, don't go in thinking it will be god's gift to heist movies. the thing that I love about this movie and the last is that the movie moves so fast that you can't stop and think about how improbable the situations are so you have to believe that they could break into the Belaggio vault or raise a building off the ground so it is at the right height to shoot something into it. It's just fun."

","I thought this movie was fine, if fun and eye-candy are what you had in mind. I much prefer the first - Ocean's Eleven - with it's great plot, great characters, and slick camera-work. This one brings together the characters, but doesn't delve into them as the first one did. It has an okay plot, and if you're just in it for the entertainment value, it is fine. And of course, the actors and actresses in it are beautiful. But my largest complaint in this is the camera-work. Most of the film looks like it was filmed using a regular camcorder, not a steady-cam. This type of filming is usually reserved for documentaries or 'Cops'. I thought it was only going to be used a short amount, in the beginning when they were reintroducing the characters. However, that was not the case, and it actually gave me a headache. In summary, fine movie for fun, but doesn't hold up to the original."

"movito72","7","0","1","19 December 2004"," Good film, but aloofness to audience sets it at a distance from being great
","Director Steven Soderbergh and his all-star cast are back for another round of fun and thievery, although this time the audience is left annoyingly out of the loop for most of the film. None of the actors slack off, slipping back into their roles with the ease of a pickpocket. They all seem to be having fun; the only trouble is the audience is not informed of their game. We are left on the side of enemies Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) and the Night Fox (Vincent Cassel), and it would have been nice to be in on the con.<br/><br/>This time around, Benedict wants his money back, threatens Ocean's crew with death, and they all get together to pull some quick heists to raise the dough. One problem: expert thief the Night Fox is playing a game of his own to steal the items before the Eleven can. All sorts of trouble ensues, with backstabbing, failing, and character flaws that are always part of a sequel. However, Soderbergh tries to use subtitles and freeze-frames with his usual stylishness, but this time they make no real sense and only seem a flashy gimmick to distract the audience from figuring anything out, which there is really no time for anyway due to the beautiful locations and lightning-quick pace of the plot. As mentioned before, the cast is back in top form, with new additions Cassel, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and uncredited cameos by Topher Grace, Brian Cox, and a special surprise Hollywood guest (in a tongue-in-cheek jab at one of the film's main characters, among many other Hollywood inside jokes most viewers will not understand.) Overall, this film is just as good as the other one, only disappointing because of its refusal to befriend the audience. We are left only to watch from behind the ropes as the stars play their tricks on the red carpet."
"solomonadam","6","0","2","18 December 2004"," It's different, not bad.
","Alright, here is the inside scoop. Clearly Oceans Eleven is a better movie. The first movie was great because the characters had style and class. Everyone moved around with a certain confidence and a purpose. There was a plan from the get go and the audience was hooked. The sequel was just different. Ocean's Twelve was a separate movie, not to be compared to Ocean's Eleven. I agree that the plot was a little hard to follow sometimes, but after the first movie, we were all expecting to not know how this movie would end. Despite being lost from time to time, I was thoroughly entertained...especially with Julia Roberts' part in the story. The plot twists were so ridiculous that there was no way to predict them. At least in the first, an intelligent movie watcher could see the twists as something they should have noticed from earlier in the film (air freshener). In the second one, the audience was just too lost to even notice when there was a twist in the plot. The sequel did not have the same elegance as the first, but it was not too shabby. Matt Damon surprised me by having more to do in this sequel, and he did a much better job. The dialog was not as witty as a revived rat pack crew from Ocean's Eleven, but the sequel still had some good qualities. With an ending that leaves me a little unsettled, I still came out of that movie entertained. At the same time, I was thinking to myself... ""I know lots of people that won't like this movie."" Just go into it with an open mind, and try not to hold it up to the same standards as the first."
"rafavallina","3","0","2","17 December 2004"," A good cast is not enough
","Thinking about this movie, I would say that the biggest problem they had with it is believing that everything was already done because of having so many great actors and actresses and being sop funny with dialogues and situations. From my point of view, Ocean's Eleven was a great movie. Funny, interesting, with great cast and originally directed. In this movie, Soderbergh (is it written this way?) tries to give us more of that that we wanted, but he forgets making the same efforts as he did on the first one to make a great film. I'm not saying I didn't like it. I really had a great time, and I recommend it to everybody. But it's a pity they didn't take the chance to make another great movie, such as the prequel. They just took what (I think) everybody liked most before (dialogues and situations between George Clooney and Brad Pitt, and also Matt Damon) and based all the movie in that, so that it results a little one-sided, I would say. Anyway, nice movie. I recommend it again to everybody, you'll have a lot of fun watching it. It's worth the money, doubtlessly."

","Be prepared for a very different movie from the first.<br/><br/>I've read some of the other user comments, and with all due respect, I don't think that there are any guarantees that someone who liked the first will like the second. <br/><br/>On the heels of that, I also want to say that I think the movie was very well done - especially if you follow the angles. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, so I'm not going to ruin any plot. What I can say is that what most people have mistaken for ""rampant style"" is really the placing of ""Ocean's 12"" as players on a much larger gameboard. <br/><br/>What the movie does particularly well is introduce the major players from the first movie into the larger context of the criminal world and the world at large. Everything about the movie feels expansive as the characters really prove themselves as masters of the long con.<br/><br/>In some ways, the movie is even more intense than the original, because as most people can surmise from the preview, the crew is already (in)famous from the Bellagio heist three years prior. Though the Bellagio job was a major play by Danny to get Tess back in the first film, we see that for the remaining guys on the crew it was just . . . Tuesday. Now though, the pressure is on in a really big way, and the stakes are much higher. Each member of the crew seems to be in very real physical danger at one time or another. While the first one banked on the idea that the whole plan could go south because each character had a particular flaw that could cause them to botch the plan, this one rides on the idea that though they're all consummate professionals, the very nature of the job means that they're always gambling against the house - the odds don't look very good. <br/><br/>For what it's worth, I think that they movie is really worth seeing. This time, the crew isn't sitting in the driver's seats, so I wouldn't walk in expecting them to be the main force for the action. However, as players in the game, the entire crew performs a first-rate job. The cameos are amusing, and the heists are cleverly executed.<br/><br/>Thumbs up.<br/><br/>analyst12"

","I've seen both versions of Ocean's Eleven and now Ocean's Twelve and I loved them all. My favorite is 2004's Ocean's Eleven. <br/><br/>For simplicity I'll call Clooney's version the first. Ocean's Twelve does not have a better storyline or 'hook' than the 'first'. In fact it may not have a story at all..........................................<br/><br/>But unlike ALL recent sequels that copy or repeat scenes that were fresh in the first film, slams it at the audience and demands that they react as if they're seeing it for the first time, this movie subtly maintains the ambiance and style of the first in an almost understated manner. <br/><br/>I did not leave the movie feeling irritated all the way home as I did with Spiderman or Matrix 2 and 3. The bantering tones, similar musical score, cinematography and luxurious surroundings gave it a feeling of seamless continuation. And it was not overdone to the point that I had to resist the urge to pelt my shoes at the screen and vow never to see another movie with those actors or by that director.<br/><br/>The plot line is confusing and at the end, not clearly explained. <br/><br/>It is really a movie that showcases beautiful people, but it's done to my liking. Zeta-Jones, Damon, Clooney, Willis and Brad Pitt could not look any better!!. (Julia could not look any worse!)<br/><br/>Brad Pitt isn't overly handsome as he was in 'A River Runs Through It'. He's gained facial character now that he's older. (Actually, he appeared anorexic to me!!!). But Lord, he sure knows how to undulate that long lean frame and<br/><br/>flirt!!!. I wanted to be in scenes with him and Zeta-Jones!!!. They looked good together. <br/><br/>All in all it was good and enjoyable escapism on a Sunday evening. I can hardly wait for Ocean's 13."

The overall plot and most of the twists don't stand up to scrutiny. But it's all just used to string together very nicely done set pieces from caper movies. The fact that they are separate vignettes not connected into a completely coherent thread doesn't detract from the craft.

","This movie never had a chance of living up to its hype. First off, Ocean's Eleven was about as perfect as a Hollywood movie with big names can be these days. It would be darn near impossible for a sequel to get that close to perfection. Soderbergh would have to catch lightning in a bottle twice. And despite his awesome talents as a director, and despite the greatness of the actors who took pay cuts to make it simply because they love working with Steven and each other, it just couldn't be done.<br/><br/>The movie was hip, fun and entertaining - just like the first one. But during the second half of the movie, it simply gets too cute and too clever for its own good. I thought the last half-hour was nothing short of ludicrous. I just couldn't buy it, as much as I wanted to.<br/><br/>An amazing thing about the first movie was that despite all of the big names, EVERY actor stole a scene. There was Bernie Mac yelling ""Cracker,"" Don Cheadle protecting his genitals while firing off the pinch, the Mormom twins racing in Provo, etc. With Zeta-Jones, Bruce Willis (yes, Bruce Willis) and a new villain added to the mix, there just aren't enough scenes to go around. Cheadle and Mac are pretty much entirely forgotten, which is a shame because they were great in the first one.<br/><br/>Anyhow, the movie was certainly entertaining. It just got too clever towards the end, and left me counting the number of ways they could have ended it in more believable ways. Still good, though, and with such a great director in charge of such a great cast, it's still worth going to see in the theaters. That's what Hollywood is all about. 6/10."

","Okay, I'll admit that I'm a big fan of star studded movies like Ocean's 12, especially since Catherine Zeeta-Jones makes an appearance. All she had to do is smile and she would get good reviews. George, Brad, Matt, Julia, Don, Casey, Caan, Bernie and co. come back for the long awaited sequel. Let's just say if you weren't a fan of the first movie, you'll be disappointed. They use the same kind of Hollywood wit and humor in this one. Andy Garcia's role has been cut down, which i think was a mistake, unless they are planning on a third movie, which is highly unlikely at this stage since they would end up repeating the same stuff. As expected, they finally find Rusty(Brad Pitt) a girl and of course she's the cop investigating the heist, making things more complicated. They use different angle shots for effect, which i don't think was achieved and there are more outdoor scenes this time which is a good change, but as we all know Europe doesn't quite look as glamorous as Vegas. It is good to see that there is more stealing in the sequel, but Terry Benedict wants his money back. I mean nobody's just going to let 150 million go. Which I think is the only realistic part about the movie. The cast overall did a great job on their part but were let down by a script with too many loopholes."
"ferguson-6","6","0","3","12 December 2004"," Looking for Col Tom Parker
","Greetings again from the darkness. Best to walk into the theatre knowing that this is Hollywood fluff and meant to be nothing but a light movie watching experience. Think Elvis movies from the 60's with hot shot director Soderberg behind the camera. Preening and posing are the norm and style over substance is required for camera time (count how many times Brad Pitt smirks). Wonderkind Soderberg uses a bit more of his ""Traffic"" style this time around with our desperate band of thieves. The hand held shots and strange angles are an attempt to provide interest to an otherwise boring project. I firmly believe Soderberg makes these movies to keep his friendships and power so that he can make the films he really wants to make. At least I hope that is why. Twelve tosses in a few more cute cameos than Eleven with Topher Grace, Albert Finney, Bruce Willis and even Jerry Weintraub making appearances. However, watching Julia Roberts play Julia Roberts is more painful than silly. The only interesting character is Vincent Cassel as Toulour, who wants to be known as the best thief. The scene in the museum is a Hip-Hop version of Catherine Zeta-Jones from ""Entrapment"". This is our second story line behind Andy Garcia seeking payback and revenge for the gang's successful hit on his casino in Eleven. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the new addition, but provides little more than another perfect face and wardrobe. Otherwise same old, same old and if you enjoyed the first, you will enjoy this one. Just remember, Elvis would have fit right in."

The entire first hour felt like wading through poorly thought-out plot exposition. The overall plot is confusing, though thin, because it has large holes. Too much time is spent on developing irrelevant aspects, and then it's like the viewer is just supposed to know the stuff in between. I left feeling confused and disappointed. Now I'm not saying I wanted a heist film just like Ocean's 11, in fact I would be disappointed if that's all they did. But they tried to make this too many things that it shouldn't be. A heist film, a comedy, a revenge flick, a drama, all rolled into one. And I'm sure that sometime there's going to be a movie with all these elements that does a superb job. But this wasn't it. In addition, a lot changed in the way each actor portrayed their character. Some of that can be attributed to the effect money has on a person (maybe, like Yen's newfound exuberance and sassiness) but overall less of the real material was discernible. Instead, everyone seemed to play more of their caricature-esque aspects, making them seem less like actual people (one of the reasons the first was so appealing).

My joy knew no bounds when I heard it was going to have an international release and will be released on 10th December itself in India.<br/><br/>To many of the fans of the first movie, that is the biggest problem. When we walk into the movie hall, the expectation is to have some thing similar to Ocean's XI. Its a sequel. But if you do every thing similar, where lies the fun?<br/><br/>Ocean's XII has much comedy, many special scenes specially involving Matt Damon who doesn't disappoint in the movie and a fast track which can be too fast for some at times. Ocean's XI was much simpler in the sense that it had one robbery and one villain in Benedict. The goal was clear.<br/><br/>Here, we have various characters who 'think' for themselves a lot more and are very real. If you forget the minor supposedly intelligent aspects like some viewer questioned how Zeta Jones found Pitt and walked straight into his door and think about the motives of the characters more and stress on the plot, the movie becomes a classic.<br/><br/>There is the character of Roberts who was totally underplayed in Ocean XI, Benedict revealing he wants the money and interest and isn't concerned with any thing else, the Blue Fox, and practically all characters had suffiecient air time and interesting cameos.<br/><br/>You laugh more watching this movie. It makes you feel awed with scenes such as Damon, Clooney and Pitt walking on the road and talking. I liked their combination a lot. The comic moments like the short guy getting deported to a completely different city because of a mistake is hilarious.<br/><br/>The only reason many people feel or will feel disappointed is they don't actually see the final 'stealing of the egg' as it were. Or maybe like me you had a hugh expectation from the movie.<br/><br/>Had I not seen Ocean's XI, I am sure I would have given this movie a 9/10<br/><br/>I felt a wee bit disappointed there wasn't a more dramatic ending which i also a reason I sadly ended up giving it just a 7/10."

Terry Benedict is helping as the twelfth'. <br/><br/>The fact of the matter is, whether you are an Ocean's 11/ 12 hater or lover, the developments leave you a little surprised, if not confused. I'd say just keep the basics of Ocean's 11 in mind, but do not compare the two. The heist this time is more complicated, and they do not have as much time to plan or even think. They're on the run from the start. Obviously, end of the day you expect and get the group to pull of the heist, but credit must be given to the writers and director for keeping everyone in suspense, which at times frustrates also. Like, you want Julia Roberts to pull off the thing; (btw, her sequence sounds ridiculous, but when you see it, it's very neatly done!) you want the group to not be arrested, you want Zeta-Jones to be a thief; you want Danny and Rusty to be in control of the situation like in the first part- and all of this does not happen! Though, it's revealed in the end how they were 2 steps ahead of the brilliant Vincent Cassel.<br/><br/>Must admit was disappointed with the usage of some characters- thought that Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia and Elliot Gould could have been given more footage. At times it looks like they could not accommodate roles for everyone and have compromised a lot. I generally do not like him, but loved Matt Damon as the 'wannabe' kid! Very funny. Seasoned performers like Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts sail through their roles very efficiently. Catherine Zeta-Jones is adequate, and looks good. The director in Steven Soderbergh scores, but the efficient story teller is missing. Very slick, most of the scenes look classy. <br/><br/>The film is very easy on the eyes, and like some people have been pointing out, looks like the cast had a lot of fun doing it. In fact, the last shot when the party is on, it looks like it was a real party, and there were cameras rolling. <br/><br/>Do not be fooled by the negative publicity generated by certain sections of the media. If you are comparing this movie to a Citizen Kane- well, can't do much about it! Leave your brains at home, and enjoy this entertainer.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 and Â½ on 5"
