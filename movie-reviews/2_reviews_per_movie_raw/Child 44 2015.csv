"reallaplaine","8","113","156","3 October 2015"," A tough watch but a brilliant job by all concerned
","Child 44 isn't the movie you watch for light entertainment. It is gritty and tough, and I found myself feeling a sense of absolute disgust for anyone and anything connected with the old school communist state in the USSR. It really makes you look at just how bad that system was and how monstrous the people were who enforced it on the general populace. Nonetheless, the story is compelling, although sometimes the thread jumps around a bit. Tom Hardy's performance was his best ever. I think he warrants an Academy for it. Noomi Rapace was excellent - very authentic in her role. Child 44 is a dark thriller - and without giving anything away, the build up and hatred toward the serial killer really sticks you to this movie - you simply want the killer to get the most gruesome death conceivable for what he does. Apart from the Hollywood aspect, this film depicts reality. This is how life existed under Communism and I think that message is just as compelling and important as the rest of the story - because it really depicted the terror and the suppression that millions of people lived under in the name of some douche bag's idea of ""ideology"". May Stalin forever lay dead and remembered for only one thing - he was a murdering asshole. Watch the film folks - I notice that the ratings were low, and I think that is an unfair assessment about the quality of this production."

","Excellent opportunity to lose yourself in a brilliantly multifaceted, deftly crafted story about love, war, politics, serial-killers, violence, loyalty, betrayal, tenderness, and back again. And again. New every time. Fresh, like running water, the story keeps you guessing throughout, and yet at the same time it feels oddly familiar, a bit like seeing your own reflection in the mirror for the very first time. Acting? Seamless. The entire cast, not just the ever so captivating leads. Not one false note amongst the lot. I vote Child 44 should receive the much coveted Collective Oscar Award 2016. Direction? What direction? Surely, the story just went and told its spellbinding self. By itself. Daniel who? And as for the cinematography, the look and feel of this film was authentic and distinctive enough for me to actually look up the DP's name: Oliver Wood. Who's probably just another genius on board of Child 44. Could go on, but think this more than covers the IMDb's suspiciously lofty demand for a mini-essay. Hope you enjoy watching Child 44 as much as I did."

","Excellent, excellent film. How ""Furious 7"" received such great reviews and this film did not is beyond me. Definitely pay to watch it. Do a great film justice and don't let it die with Furious pissing on its grave.<br/><br/>44 Child makes you actually feel as if you were transported back to soviet Russia and gives you the feeling of helpless in an unjust government. It was banned from Russia for a reason. Tom Hardy gives an excellent performance and you find yourself feeling sympathy yet cheering for the success of this man who appears emotionless towards acts of monstrous brutalities and a moral compass."
"lnvicta","5","65","97","16 September 2016"," There is greatness here, muddled by inconsistency and superfluous subplots.
","This is a movie I've kept my eye on ever since it was revealed. Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman are two of my favorite working actors, and having them co-lead a Russian serial killer film seemed like a slam dunk. Unfortunately, Child 44 is not the slam dunk it could have been. It has the talent, it has the story (based on the best-selling novel); all the ingredients necessary for greatness are there. But it also has a plethora of baggage that bogs it down to mediocrity. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy is the star of the film through and through. It's a story about his family life and professional life clashing over the case of a dead child. The officials want to pass it off as a train accident, but witnesses swear that it was a homicide. As more and more bodies start turning up and the higher-ups continue to look away, it's up to Hardy to find the killer and bring him to justice. Again, the acting in this film is great, as is the story. The problem is the way it's presented. Half of the movie is focused on the serial killer angle and Hardy's character going through the loops of finding the right person to help him on the case, and the other half is about Soviet officials exiling his family and stripping him of power for his disobedience. The way these stories intertwine is messy and confusing, for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>For starters, the tone is all over the place. What should be a dark, gloomy mystery among the cold streets of Soviet Russia ends up as a haphazardly arranged domestic dispute due to political interference with a child murderer lurking around somewhere. There's no time for momentum to build when it's constantly changing course. Gary Oldman being billed a co-lead is a huge stretch. He's in the movie for about 20 minutes total and his character doesn't do much to further the story. Mind you, it's Gary Oldman so he gives a fine performance, but as someone who was looking forward to Hardy and Oldman sharing the scene for two plus hours, I was disappointed to say the least. <br/><br/>And then there's the practical aspect. Hardy and Oldman are accent chameleons, there's no doubt about that. I didn't even know Oldman was British until I saw him in an interview. But why on earth are these Russian soldiers speaking to each other in English? For a wider audience no doubt, but it's such a basic matter of common sense that it bugged me continuously throughout the film. It's also far too long. A serial killer hunt stretched over the course of two hours and 15 minutes is exhausting. The tension becomes less and less dire as the movie progresses until you're just waiting for it to end. <br/><br/>Child 44 isn't a bad movie, but its flaws are glaring. It's not the dark, edgy thriller you'd expect. In fact, to call it a thriller would be a misnomer. Child 44 is a tone-deaf political drama filled to the brim with wasted potential."
"wanbliwinyan","10","88","142","4 May 2015"," Extraordinary Movie
","We went to see Child 44 opening weekend. We were sent to a theatre in the back of the cinema. There were four people in the entire theatre. What a shame ~ and shame on whomever was in charge of promoting this movie. They truly fell on their face/faces. Child 44 was beautifully filmed ~ the scenery was breath taking ~ Sets were exceptionally well done...Tom Hardy was at his best as always...Another favorite of mine Joel Kinneman (sp?)was exceptional...as was Gary Oldman, though his screen presence was limited. All of the actors and actresses did a splendid job. I have little understanding as to why the promotion of this movie was so neglected. I seldom read reviews, but I read a couple and wonder if the reviewers actually watched this movie. Everyone did a splendid job ~ I highly recommend Child 44"
"lukefairbrother","10","144","240","19 April 2015"," Great from hardy once again
","Good film, great acting from the two leads, what more can you ask for. It's not a great book to film adaptation but if you forget the book it's worth a watch. I've seen a lot of criticism on the political and historical accuracy, it's a film not a documentary you wouldn't say gladiator isn't good because it's not accurate it's not meant to be it's purely fiction with the exception of the fact it's based on a serial killer from the same country. Summing up it's a good watch for those who like thrillers and tom hardy. The film itself is probably a 7/10 but tom hardy and noomi rapice were so convincing as the leads that I upped it to a 10. I was disappointed we didn't see much of Gary oldman as he is also one of my favourite actors but the small part he played was played very well. Everyone played there part to make an exciting story with a rather weird ending but oh well it was worth the watch anyway. :)"
"claudio_carvalho","6","24","35","28 July 2016"," There is no Murder in Paradise
","The Ukranian orphan Leo is raised by a Russian family and becomes national hero during the World War II. In the 50's, Captain Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy), his best friend Alexei Andreyev (Fares Fares) and the coward Vasili Nikitin (Joel Kinnaman) join the Ministry of State Security (MGB) during the political regime of Stalin and Leo marries Raisa Demidov (Noomi Rapace). When Alexei's son is found murdered completely naked near the railway, the official explanation is that the boy was hit by a train since there is no murder in paradise since it is a capitalist disease. But Leo finds other similar cases and proceeds investigating, falling in disgrace with the Party. He loses his rank and is transferred with Raisa to Volsk to work with General Mikhail Nesterov (Gary Oldman). When a body of another boy is found near the railway in the same conditions of Alexei's son, Leo convinces Nesterov that there is a serial-killer and he agrees that Leo conducts a further investigation. Meanwhile the ambitious Vasili tries to persuade Raisa to leave Leo and move to Moscow to stay with him. What will happen to Leo and Raisa?<br/><br/>""Child 44"" is a film with a promising storyline, great performances but not engaging. The political subplot is weird and raises the doubt whether it is true the premise that ""there is no murder in paradise"" or it is an anti-soviet propaganda as mentioned in the previous review. In a controlled political society by a dictatorship, it is expected low crime rates as consequence. But why not secretly investigate a serial-killer? My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Crimes Ocultos"" (""Hidden Crimes"")"
"omnitek-94362","10","207","366","17 April 2015"," Just to counter the ones who downvoted out of pure grief.
","I'd say amusement-wise this movie is worth 7.5 out of 10. The story holds his own and apart from the accents that might perhaps now and then throw of some authentic feel the movie is certainly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Since the book in itself is superb, and by no means historically 100% accurate as the writer Tom Rob Smith also wrote in the last pages of the book, so no need for anyone to get their panties in a twist.<br/><br/>Of course the same goes for me, so I will try to be as little judgmental as possible. <br/><br/>That Stalin is responsible for the deaths of millions of Russians, is still today for many Russians a form of western propaganda.<br/><br/>Having had a Russian girlfriend a couple of years ago at her hometown somewhere in Russia (It's precise town is irrelevant) me, a few friends of mine and her sister were having a drink and a laugh in her apartment.<br/><br/>At some point we all had to name a historic person who was important to our country and someone we saw as role model, hero or whatever.<br/><br/>When my girlfriend's (19 year old) sister named Stalin I first assumed she began to develop a sense of sarcasm and I laughed at what I expected to be a joke. This infuriated her and so the game was suddenly over. Any arguments made in my defense by me and my friends mentioning some of Stalin's gruesome crimes committed upon his own people were received as US propaganda/Western lies.<br/><br/>What some people also here fail to realize is that this is no Hollywood propaganda. The sequel of the book is called Kolyma, are those gulag camps western propaganda also? For the purpose of exaggeration: I wonder if Nazi Germany had not been defeated during world war 2, would we see many people here at IMDb (in a post-NAZI Germany) 70+ years later commenting on movies like Schindler's List or The Grey Zone, only to paint them with the same brush of Western propaganda?<br/><br/>For some: please don't watch this movie if you have font memories of the Soviet Era.<br/><br/>For everyone else: It's a nice flick with a great cast, go watch it!"

"SteveResin","4","56","93","29 July 2015"," A Massive Disappointment & Wasted Opportunity
","I was really looking forward to seeing Child 44. Being a fan of the extraordinary Citizen X I was pumped that such a disturbing and riveting story such as Chikatilo's was getting the big budget treatment with a stellar cast.<br/><br/>The bubble burst within the first few minutes, as I realised for some god-forsaken reason they'd decided to reinvent the story. The timeframe is completely wrong, the characters have newly invented pasts and worse of all Chikatilo's capture and fate is completely fabricated. Not only do they fail to arrest him and bring him to trial, he's assassinated in a forest by some tiresome agent with a grudge against the detective hunting the killer down. Utterly ridiculous and pointless.<br/><br/>Pointless because if ever there was a story that didn't need reinvention to make it more interesting than reality it's this one. Chikatilo's story is so macabre, absurd and fantastical it doesn't need ridiculous embellishments.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, the acting is of a high standard, Hardy and Rapace in particular shine, but the faux-Russian accents of the whole cast are grating and another pointless decision. Why not just have them speak in their own accents, and credit the audience with enough intelligence to realise this is Russia and these are russians we're watching despite the accents.<br/><br/>Stick with Citizen X, it's far superior and more rewarding."
"valleyjohn","4","59","100","30 July 2015"," An absolute mess.
","Child 44 is the story of an ex member of the Russian military police who investigates a series of child murders during the Stalin-era Soviet Union. I am struggling to think of a bad film that Tom Hardy has made . He is currently flavour of the month and quite rightly so but Child 44 is probably the worst thing he has done but it's not his fault. This film is all over the place. It can't decide whether it is a serial-killer thriller or an old-school anti-Soviet propaganda movie and just ends up failing miserably on both fronts. The editing is disastrous. It feels like a bunch of scenes all put together and not always in the correct order . I honestly thought there had been scenes accidentally deleted at one stage it was so bad and at 137 minutes you can't wait for the end credits to roll. <br/><br/>4 out of 10"

","This is a stellar movie with a stellar cast. I've thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It's a 2 hour and 17 minutes movie but I've totally forgotten about the time, caught up in the suspense. It's not the typical historical drama. This film is really precious in my opinion. I've always had this negative impression on the Russians or the Soviet Union, formed from the Cold War period. But this film is wonderful in showing that these Russians, they're just human like us. They would love to protect their loved ones. Amid their fierce madness, there is love and kindness too. Amid this crazy times, every single person's life is in danger. Everyone is trying, in their own way, to survive. Story wise, I really love how it all flows and ties in together. No random scenes, everything has it purpose and connection. It's a really beautiful story. And honestly, I didn't know much about Tom Hardy before but boy was he awesome as the lead! I won't forget him and this film at all, it'll be in one of my best seen films list. Oh and seriously, the cast is British, Swedish, none Russian by the way, but look at how convincing and real their Russian accent is! I was throughly impressed. <br/><br/>In my knowledge, there are not many Hollywood films that would show the Russians in a positive manner, but this film does and I really love that fact. It changed my opinion on them. Everyone, just watch the film now and be impressed, I don't wanna give any spoilers ;)"

"inspiredbystuff","1","97","181","24 May 2015"," Has NO ONE read the book? Pile of W**K.
","The writers of this film owe Tom Rob Smith money and a heartfelt apology. If you have not read the book, this film will be any other crime film with some brutal violence and a bit of naked Tom Hardy.<br/><br/>If you have read the book? You will be presented with a film that is NOTHING like the book, but still manages to send the odd 'f*ck you' to remind you it is MEANT to be based on it. <br/><br/>The whole incredible twisting ins and outs of the book with the separate stories that begin to come together are completely ignored. Vasili, who in the book was a twisted cruel jealous protégé, is for some reason now an underdog younger brother we're meant to root for. WHAT? The traumatic past Raisa based on true events is non existent, and her coin that causes so much internal struggle for Leo and is a key part of the story is forgotten. As a special f*ck you to any audience members who have read the book, the opening scene is of 12 year old Leo playing with the coin. No explanation is given throughout the film. The past of Leo/Paval is also completely ignored. Instead they just show him running from an orphanage and getting adopted by his new father (Gary Oldman) who just happens to be a military general who is willing to adopt a child. (Yep, that heart wrenching story about the dead Leo is also gone.)<br/><br/>Remember the awesome plan Leo and Raisa have to do to escape the gulag transport train? With the thousands of hooks under the train forcing them to use a dead mans tooth to break a floor board, jump under the train and use the dead body to protect them? the way they had to convince all the other prisoners to help them because they were going to stop a serial killer? F*CK IT! Instead, they just OPEN A DOOR AND JUMP OUT. Yep. The selfless help of the prisoners aboard is ignored, and the following scene in the village which explains their escape properly is yet again non existent.<br/><br/>Oh, did I mention the serial killer has NO REAL MOTIVE? The twisted logic of the book that creates an understanding of the serial killer trying to reach Leo because it is his brother, rooted in childhood experience and mental instability is scrapped. The only explanation of the mans crimes in the film? ""I can't stop.""<br/><br/>Overall, this festering turd of a film does not do the author or the actors justice. Avoid at all costs"
"paulmcuomo","2","55","99","17 May 2015"," The two stars is for the only two performances in this thing.
","OK. As someone who'd known about this movie for a solid 9 months before its release - namely due to the powerhouse of acting talent involved - I saw despite the somewhat mixed reviews on it. Rotten Tomatoes didn't look great BUT critics gave good reviews. Those critics smegging lied to my face! The only two people who come out of this thing without a blemish on them are Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace; not only is the relationship between Leo and Raisia an ever-evolving, three-dimension thing and literally the only good characterisation to movie offers, but on their own they give performances that give depth and nuance beyond the surface. But I'm going to target the three things in this movie that are god awful.<br/><br/>DIRECTING: The action scenes in this movie combine many things that action-movies do too much of: shoot too close to the action, cut away at moments that should be held, shaky cam for days AND a hero who gets a beaten silly and shrugs it off like it was nothing. This makes the film completely fail as an action movie, especially when some of the stuntwork is laughable. There's a scene where a guy of average build and fairly short sature throws Tom Hardy over his head like he was throwing a sleeping bag; you can just imagine the audience reaction. The final fight scene is Leo, his arch-nemesis Vasili and Raisia fighting in a mud-pit, with shaky-cam, too many cuts and shooting too close...who hired this guy? VILLAIN: I have to talk about this because this movie does something unbelievable. The titular murder of 44 children makes up the B-plot of the movie, and the actual child-murderer is the secondary villain. I'm not joking; the child murderer played by Paddy Considine is not well developed, characterised or shot and once he actually comes face-to-face with Leo, the film drops him like a bag of s**t and instead replaces him with Joel Kinnaman's Vasili, who is by far the most stupid, predictable, unlikeable, 1D villain I've seen in a while. This guy does stuff for literally no reason other than to be a villain. His only reason to be nasty to Leo is at the beginning of the film, Leo and his gang (which Vasili's) part of, try and find a fugitive, and after the aforementioned fight scene where Leo is chucked around, Vasili shoots the owners of the farm WHO WEREN'T EVEN HIDING HIM in front of their children, so Leo punches him and calls him a prick. Following this, he goes to insane levels to get back at him, including having him shamed and expelled from the secret police, trying to force his wife to sleep with him, killing and terrorising his friends FOR NO REASON. This is not a good villain in anyway; the only thing he could be is threatening, but he's too stupid to outsmart the heroes and not strong enough in combat to match Leo physically.<br/><br/>WRITING: The complete failure of this film is the script. Even at 2 hours 17 minutes, it does not come close to fitting anything in well, with the poorly characterised characters other than Leo and Raisia, the insulting motives of the child murderer, the bad pacing. Basically it all sucks.<br/><br/>Part of my anger is the fact I wasted a lot of time watching this AND I paid to see it - yes, out of the 3.3 million it grossed, some of that was me. I wish I got a refund. If you do still want to see this, see it if its on TV."

","A dark and brooding tale about Soviet Russia circa 1953 with outstanding performances by Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, Fares Fares, and Joel Kinnaman. The direction is taut and the production values make you feel as if you are in Russia. Few films have conveyed the despair, depression, and paranoia of this era, yet the film itself is so much more. <br/><br/>Fans of Tom Hardy (and who isn't) will find this film is another in a line of marvelous characters. Fans of Noomi Rapace will find her disappearing into the character while capturing the Russian persona to perfection.<br/><br/>Among my favorite actors - Gary Oldman does a good job but he is only in a few scenes. Charles Dance similarly does a good job, but he has only one brief cameo at the end. And Vincent Cassel is ominous but also has only a few scenes."

","A crime thriller, set in the Soviet Union during the Stalin era: it sounds like a good idea. And it probably is, but unfortunately 'Child 44' doesn't have what it takes to be a really good film. Some things are well done: the oppressing atmosphere of living in a police state, and the courage it takes to go against of the powers that be, are very convincing. That's partly because of the excellent cinematography, full of grey colours conveying the joyless society that Soviet Russia must have been; and partly because of Tom Hardy's convincing lead. <br/><br/>Hardy shows exactly the right amount of tenacity to make him believable as the Russian war hero who becomes an outcast because he refuses to denounce his innocent wife, against the will of the regime. Only after he exposes the incompetence of the police force in a series of child killings, he gets rehabilitated. <br/><br/>The weak point of the film is the script. It takes a long while before all elements of the story are clear, and the quick succession of events at the start is a bit confusing. Moreover, the story is spiced up with some action scenes that are not well executed and unnecessary. Also, the tear jerking scene at the end is at odds with the hard-boiled story. <br/><br/>What really annoyed me (and I think I'm not alone) is the language. The actors speak English with a mock Russian accent. This half-hearted way of solving a language problem makes some dialogue almost ridiculous. Just let them speak normal English. I know, that makes the film a bit less authentic. But nobody spoke English with mock Russian accents in Soviet Russia."

"megalomanchik","1","60","123","17 April 2015"," The Cold War 2.0
","Rather than adequately show the real negative features of the Stalinist regime, this film shows us the primitive and delusional set of propaganda clichés, which many directors in Hollywood would have refused to use even during the Cold War. For example, in the Soviet Union no one has ever claimed that criminal offenses is a product of the capitalist world and that in the SU can not be criminals. It reminded me of ""The Venus Project"" by Jacque Fresco, American engineer and Utopian, who seriously considering the possibility of creating society without criminal offenses. It seems, the author of the book ""Child 44"" instead of studying history of Soviet Union just watched conspiracy film ""Zeitgeist "". Also very remarkable moment with the execution without trial, because it is well known that even in the Stalin era there was a judicial system, which although has been simplified to fight with the so-called ""enemies of the people"", but to shoot the parents in front of their children - this is complete nonsense. The plot is so crazy and uninteresting that even such actors like Gary Oldman and Vincent Cassel can not save this film. Such movies only awakens Russian rage against the West (especially in such a difficult period of bilateral relations), instead of helping them to overcome their historical past.

","In the years of war strictly punished for marauding of soldiers and officers. For rescue of street children special services were created. The set of children's shelters for children who remained without parents during war was organized. Moscow was never similar to the small poor European city. In the 30s in Moscow wide streets and high-rise buildings were cost. For fight against bandits in all cities the militia was organized. Anybody never denied that bandits existed. The Soviet ideology was based on a brotherhood and mutual aid of people. In the years of the most rigid repressions in the Soviet prisons was less condemned, than today in all prisons of the USA. Problems were but where they weren't? I think that the author of this history specially distorted historic facts. Today someone very much wants to show Russia resident evil. These attempts are ridiculous as modern Russia refused socialism. However, refusal of socialism happened at all not because in the USSR to live was intolerable. On a referendum in 1991 the Soviet people voted for preservation of the USSR, but the elite was against. Today Russians have an opportunity to compare capitalism and socialism. Sociological polls say that more than a half of Russians consider the public relations in the USSR better, than present: free education, free medicine, cheap transport, cheap access to culture.

The child murders, which are supposed to be the story's catalyst, end up feeling brushed over and tacked on, while the real-life bureaucracy and just plain pigheadedness of the government-in-denial that was almost complicit in many of the deaths due to inaction, becomes a confused and unreal spy/love story/rivalry conundrum that ends up feeling contrived and unfocused.<br/><br/>In recommending Citizen X to people, as I often have over the years, as possibly the best movie about a serial killer ever made, it is for precisely all the reasons where Child 44 goes wrong.

It seems some see themselves as screen writers, directors, cinematographers, editors and professional critics.

"CleveMan66","7","28","61","19 April 2015"," ""Child 44"" is a grim but fascinating police procedural that peaks behind the Iron Curtain into the paranoia and dysfunction of the U.S.S.R. under Stalin.
","Sometimes it's tough to stand on the side of right. That's especially true when all those around you are more interested in perception than reality. And I don't just mean your family and your friends or your social circle. I'm talking about fighting against the abuses of power, corruption and cover-ups of an entire society. That's what Moscow-based secret police (MGB) agent Leo Demidov faces in the Soviet Union of the 1950s in British writer Tom Rob Smith's trilogy. The first book in that trilogy lends its title to the film ""Child 44"" (R, 1:37) and focuses on the real-life crimes of a Russian named Andrei Chikatilo.<br/><br/>Demidov is played by underrated British actor Tom Hardy. Hardy's character is a tough, but good man who wants to do what's right, but runs into a brick wall every time he tries. He's a cop in Stalin's U.S.S.R., a government that whisks away any citizen who expresses a point of view contrary to that of the authorities and holds fast to its denial of the existence of crime in their communist utopia. When the young son of fellow agent Alexi (Fares Fares) is murdered, Demidov is reminded that, according to Stalin, ""murder is a capitalist disease."" Or, as Vasili (Joel Kinnaman), Demidov's bitter rival within their secret police unit says, ""There is no crime in paradise."" As Alexi's friend and superior, Demidov is assigned to present the police report to the family. ""Railway accident"" is listed as the cause of death. Everyone, including Demidov, knows that this is a lie, but when the family argues with him about the official version of events all he can do is half-heartedly insist that they read the report. He pulls aside Alexi to tell him repeatedly that his son was not murdered. You can see how difficult it is for this talented investigator to deny his friend any hope of justice, but it's for Alexi's own good. Demidov knows that pursuing the matter any further would mean the end of both of their careers, or worse.<br/><br/>Demidov soon gets to experience an example of that ""worse"" for himself. When he finally takes an unyielding stand and refuses to toe the party line on another issue, he is demoted, and he and his wife, Raisa (Noomi Rapace), are basically exiled to a small town that is even bleaker than Moscow was for them. When Demidov is helping investigate the murder of another young boy, he encourages his new supervisor, General Nesterov (Gary Oldman), to investigate further. Nesterov soon discovers that there have been a total of 43 similar murders in the region. ""44,"" Demidov corrects him. ""My friend's son was murdered too."" Nesterov does what he can within the confines of the Soviet legal system, while Demidov and his wife go well outside normal procedures in an effort to catch the killer. Vasili gets wind of what the Demidovs are up to and tries to use this to get his former boss out of the way for good.<br/><br/>""Child 44"" is grim, but effective. The story is a disturbing but fascinating peek into life in the U.S.S.R. late in the Stalinist era. We get a look at the state of schools, orphanages, mental hospitals and even the treatment of homosexuals, but this film is mainly about the paranoia of a broken system which victimized its own people and allowed many criminals to go unpunished. The script is strong, but the acting is even stronger. Hardy plays Demidov as a confident and dedicated public servant who is barely holding the cork in the bottle of his righteous anger. Rapace comes off as proud and strong, but with a barely concealed vulnerability just beneath the surface. Oldman has been (and remains) one of the most talented actors of his generation and, anyone who remembers him as the terrorist leader in ""Air Force One"" (1997) can attest that the man knows his way around a Russian accent. Basically, this is the kind of movie you want to see if you're in the mood for a serious crime thriller which has the courage to approach the sub-genre of police procedural from a little-understood place in a nearly forgotten time.

This comes from someone that has been on the Tom Hardy train before it even existed, I have been saying ever since last April that he deserved to win the best actor Oscar for ""Locke"". Same thing for Gary Oldman, I am a maniac of his work as an actor. But not even my love for these two actors could save the waste of time ""Child 44"" was.<br/><br/>I do not ever give ""1s"" or ""2s"", It really has to be a wreck for me to go that low, yet that's what this film is. There aren't really any positives I can talk about with the exception that Hardy, Considine and Oldman are genuinely watchable. I generally give ""4s"" or ""3s"" to movies I hate because despite the fact that I totally disliked them I found that my seat didn't get uncomfortable. But man, this is a whole other level of bad. I despised this film. Espinosa goes deep into taking every possible wrong choice and leaves you wondering what the heck was he thinking when he put this together in the editing room? There must have been embarrassing silence in there for the whole process. This film looks like the product of amateurs. I am surprised that someone like Pietro Scalia edited this film together, he is actually a great editor. Yet here he was probably editing while being drunk. The cinematography definitely doesn't help. Calling it horrible would be a favor. There is some of the worst cinematography and lighting I have ever seen in my life and I wonder how the FU*K did this make it to a professional level. From the second scene in the movie you take it that you won't ever understand what is going on in an action sequence because the shaky cam is preposterous, but man not even understanding what's going on in a dialogue scene?? How is that even possible, you managed to mess up fu**king dialogue scenes?? The photography of this film is so bad my eyes were hurting 20 minutes in. How the hell do you go from shooting the masterpiece that ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is to shooting this incomprehensible chaos? Joel Kinnaman gives another irritatingly bad performance. Don't get me even started on screenplay, story coherence or character development because there isn't any single one of those elements present in the film. <br/><br/>I could go on ranting about ""Child 44"" for pages, but it isn't even worth it.

","I watched this film with a definite unease, having read the description of the film I didn't find it hugely appealing, just because of the subject matter, which is particularly dark, but because Mr Hardy is in it, I had to watch it. They managed to take us back to Stalin's Russia, we see a brief glimpse of how tough life was for people back then, those poor people were living in horrendous conditions. The story in brief, The State have turned Russia into a Paradise, crime simply isn't possible, and the thought of a child killer unthinkable, but when young boys are being found murdered along the train tracks the unthinkable is happening. Security Officer Leo Demidov is disgraced, but believes a Serial killer is to blame, and despite the vast obstacles the state puts in place, he sets out to find the killer. Tom Hardy (of course) and Gary Oldman are particularly brilliant, and there are also wonderful performances from Paddy Considine and Petr Vanek and many others. As I've mentioned it is quite harrowing matter, but it's not overly done, mercifully the scenes aren't that gory, it could have been dreadfully overdone. I eagerly anticipate the next instalment. 9/10"

","I went to see this film yesterday and... well... it could've been better. When I say better however, i'm not saying the film bad. It's pretty good but there are many small faults that pulled the film down.If you think about it, not many films have been made by Hollywood set in Stalin's Russia, I went into the cinema hoping this would be good through being set somewhere new to Hollywood that personally haven't seen in a film before. However the director of the film did a poor job to a film that was set up well and had an excellent leading actor in Tom Hardy. <br/><br/>What pulled the film down was its directing most of all, many of fight scenes were done in a poorly executed shaky cam which made it impossible to tel who was shooting or hitting who. This was made further difficult by the final scene with the fight in the mud, that you could tell which was was Tom Hardy. The poor directing was further evident with an overly long running, and after a 2 hour wait to see the killer, the last 15 minutes roughly are very rushed and full of plot holes including the Russian soldiers finding Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace in the forest at the end after not being in Moscow in the shot before.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the dodgy Russian accents take the realism of the film away and the film doesn't capture the true brutality in Stalin's Russia which could of been explored.<br/><br/>However the film is saved y Tom Hardy's excellent performance which was unconventional to a movie antagonist through showing traits of the bad guy in film. Plus although the setting could of been explored more, the originality of it compared to most Hollywood films makes the film interesting to watch.<br/><br/>To of made this film better,more time should of been taken in using the platform the cast and setting could of given, but were restricted in poor directing. As the film carries so many small flaws i give it 6 out of 10. This film we be forgotten in 10 years sadly and no trilogy will be made from the books meaning this will be the last time we will see this again."

Read their angry reviews on this site, and you'll understand that we are dealing here with a national psychosis that overwhelmed Russia. Political issues aside, the movie shows no brilliancy at all. It's very average in quality, and has many factual errors. However, it's worth watching since it shows the Soviet human tragedy and helps American moviegoers to understand it.

","Child 44 has an intriguing plot and takes place in such an interesting era in soviet history. The film's not very straight forward because they really set it up, the era, the back stories, the relationship between the characters are all set up before they hit the ground running with the selling point of story. So you sort of know your characters - who they are, how they see themselves, and how other people see them - when you get in the thick of it. <br/><br/>The set up in Child 44 makes for a lot of tense relationships and subplots in the film that only adds to the realistic feel of the situation. The sheer fear, paranoia, and despair is palpable. The cast did a great job as to giving us an insight of what's going on in these character's heads. There is a lot more going on than just the investigation, Agent Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy) has all these hurdles that he has to overcome to reach his goal, to potentially catch this serial killer. <br/><br/>As interesting as the investigation is, the relationship between the characters is as captivating, but Raissa (Noomi Rapace) and Leo's is quite the unconventional love story. A great attention to details was put in the film but I gotta say, the contacts on some of the actors looked cheap as hell and sort of threw me off whenever I looked at them. And as good as I think the movie is, there is no doubt in my mind that the book is infinitely better because the film lacks a certain finesse that experiencing a book has. <br/><br/>Child 44 is a dark thriller with an intriguing and riveting plot with great dramatic tension. @wornoutspines"

","Firstly, as I said don't be fooled by negative opinions. I will tell you about it later. Movie is good. It has interesting, engrossing story and is well played. Tom Hardy is as good as he always is. It was pleasure to watch him portraying Leo Demidov. The same the others. Well done! However, in my opinion the murderer identity was revealed to quickly. There are some other imperfections but on the whole it is this kind of film that you can spend you money and time one without regret.<br/><br/>Now, about negative opinions. You may hear and read that the movie is US anti-Russian propaganda, lie etc. I suggest you to not listen it . In most of the cases these opinions are written by Russians who are brainwashed by communist/bolshevik/putinazi propaganda and THIS is the real propaganda. Of course, this is not historical movie, it's only a thriller, a criminal drama with fictitious characters but it can give you a glimpse into what USSR was under the rule of bolsheviks and Stalin himself. It was a country where fingering and distrust were almost a normal state. You could be denounced by your wife/husband, brother or son and be sentenced years in GULAG or be killed as an ""enemy of the state"" just for telling jokes about Stalin or expressing loudly your negative opinion about the party ideology or the country. This is true. I studied in Moscow, I have visited Russia many times and for ten years I have lived in one of the former USSR country in Central Asia. I met people many of whom are descendants of exiled ""enemies of the state"". Some of them, now in the age of 90, still remember that horrible time. I have heard a lot of stories, sad stories about late 30s, 40s under Stalin's regime. Remember, communists in USSR made a boy who denounced his father to the political police a hero and role model for all young people and children. Now Russian are trying to excuse and justify an oppressive system built on terror by murderer Lenin and his followers. Bolsheviks to keep the power, which was taken by force, killed millions of Russians and rest of them kept in fear but Russians still honor Lenin in his mausoleum in the heart of Moscow. Probably most of the negative reviewers haven't even watched this movie, they just follow the same pattern as was used in case of Solzhenitsyn's books: ""I haven't read Solzhenitsyn but I reckon that ...""(blah, blah, blah about how bad is he and his books).

As an exceptionally well acted, well crafted examination of the human condition, brought to its various extremes under extraordinarily challenging circumstances, this is an example of applied filmcraft well worth its time.<br/><br/>Noomi Rapace and Tom Hardy could not have possibly delivered their characters any better. If anything, they propelled this production beyond what it's initial limitations might have been. That's not to detract from the other actors in this production, all of whom were well cast and credibly delivered their ensemble of characters.<br/><br/>Though the primary plot line of this story centers around a serial child killer and his eventual fate, this evolving thread is woven into the fabric of a multi-layered, complex examination of life in post WWII Stalinist Russia, the Soviet Union in its darkest days. <br/><br/>There is a reason why this film was banned in current day Russia.<br/><br/>Yes, it is true that many contemporary Russians have difficulty understanding or believing the contextual background as depicted in this production, but as one who has personally known various Russians over the years who were there at that time, or who had relatives who lived through this era, the general depictions are chillingly close to the actual experiences familiar to many from that time. Much more time could be spent here trying to explain this in detail for those who are not familiar, but elaborating on such descriptions may be beyond the context of this film review. <br/><br/>As for the production quality of this film, the attention to detail and cinema photography is remarkably well done. To watch this film really does transport the viewer into an experience of that era. I freely admit this film may not be for everyone, but for those who can resonate with this elaborate study of the human condition, as extruded through the mandrel of this cultural and historical motif, it is a remarkable production well worth its time."

","On the face of it this is actually a well made film. The plot is that Hardy playing Leo Demidov is a State Security officer in Stalin's Russia, he has a chequered past and was supposedly at the fall of the Reichstag in Berlin at the close of WW II- the historical inaccuracies around this part are woeful – but in the need for a good story – thoroughly acceptable. For example -one soldier is too scared to fire his machine gun – now they have just fought across half a continent to have gotten the colly wobbles at this point is a bit disingenuous and that is no matter how much it helps to contrive the plot later. The flag bit is also completely made up.<br/><br/>Then we move on to the present day and he sort of uncovers a child murderer serial killer – but as the political wheel turns he is forced to denounce his wife as some sort of spy. Refusing to do so he is demoted and sent to some arse end of nowhere place where he meets Gary Oldman and decides to carry on the search for the killer.<br/><br/>Now this is from the trilogy by Tom Rob-Smith and out of necessity they have missed a lot out in this 132 minute film; but you still get the basic gist. The period detail is great, the acting all passable – the false Russian accents are OK in places. A word in defence of the actors – they at least try to do the accents but like many I prefer the original language. Also people are a bit too emotional in places – this was Stalinist Russia you were only allowed to get emotional when either tractor production targets were exceeded or there was a bumper turnip harvest – fact!<br/><br/>That aside it is watchable it has a fair bit of plot but not a lot of chemistry and there are times when you wonder what their motivation is or what the point is. This could be down to direction or editing, but this ends up being a film where it is lesser than the sum of its parts. It is still an OK watch – hence my rating."

No suspense whatsoever.<br/><br/>The main thrust of the ""plot"" is just as silly: a policeman (Tom Hardy) is a hero, is then disgraced and demoted (for dubious reasons), becomes a hero again and is promoted.

So, it is completely unrealistic. <br/><br/>b) The phrase ""... like Stalin teach us"" used by KGB officer in a movie is a fake - such stupid appliance of communism ideology was never used in KGB business! KGB officers were especially trained to have cold reason and excerpt. Especially in 1953 when Stalin's control style were still strong there.<br/><br/>And there are lot, lot more complains on fakes and mistakes in this movie.<br/><br/>However, by watching this movie you can study a ""black propaganda"" style - it is interesting to see what techniques were used by movie producer to play with feelings of audience.<br/><br/>PS.

Hardy plays a security officer, that's investigating a child murderer, in 1950s (Stalin era) Soviet Union. The film was directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Richard Price; it's based on the novel, of the same name, by Tom Rob Smith (the first of a trilogy of books). It also costars Joel Kinnaman, Vincent Cassel and Jason Clarke. The movie was a bomb at the box office, and got mostly negative reviews from critics, but I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Leo Demidov (Hardy) is a former war hero, that now works as an MGB agent, in the 1950s Soviet Union. He's a strong supporter of Stalin, and his country's ideals, but when a series of children start turning up dead, his loyalty is put to the test; being that murder is not supposed to exist there (it's believed to be only a capitalism crime). When his partner's son is killed, he refuses to go along with the government's cover-up (of the crime), and he's exiled; along with his wife (Rapace). Despite their treatment, Leo continues to pursue the killer, and justice. <br/><br/>The movie is well directed, written and full of great performances; especially Tom Hardy (my favorite male actor). Some people have a problem with the fact that the actors all speak English, in the film, but with Russian accents; that didn't bother me. I actually like the characters (especially Hardy's) and the insightful political commentary of those times; I found the movie to be quite involving as well. Maybe one of the main problems, with the film, is that the first cut was 5.5 hours long; and now it's less than 2.5 hours. It's a lot of story, and character development, crammed into one movie. The film is actually pretty fast paced too, it just doesn't quite come together right. I still enjoyed it though.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/5zwAFiaOqq4"

Not only winter and snow!<br/><br/>Also the Russian people are not beasts, neither monsters, as they are ""delivered"" to us from the Anglo-Saxon's propaganda garbage-movies. Russian people and Russia have never made genocides and crimes against humanity, like the WASP civilization did it (See the Nazi-German genocide in WW2 and the colonialist British genocide against India for example AND NOT ONLY!!).<br/><br/>Stalin compared to Hitler, who brought bloodshed in Europe to more than 80 million people, compared to Churchill and all the British elites, who massacred millions in the anti-colonialist revolutions around the world, compared to Truman, who in one day exterminated hundreds of thousands of people in Nagasaki and Hiroshima (and the US crimes against humanity are continuing until today, with millions of victims around the world), WAS A ""SAINT"". <br/><br/>The only crimes (executions after obviously rigged trials) that he committed, were against his own comrades from the politburo and especially the elite of the party, but also against simple party members and thousands of officers of NKVD and Red Army, in the dark years of 1936-1938, but not against soviet people in general. Yes, millions of people went to the GULAG camps, not only for political reasons, but also for criminal reasons. But anyway, millions of them returned, after their conviction. <br/><br/>The foolish and totally idiotic, western-propaganda conception, that Stalin killed as much soviets as Hitler killed (28 millions) and it is in use now, by the West against Russia, in its confrontation for Ukraine, was fully rejected since 1991, in the Yeltsin (a totally Western puppet!) period from the Official State Archives of the Russian Federation, which clearly confirmed that:<br/><br/>"" after the end of the Civil War in Russia (1922-1923) and until the death of Stalin (1953), the convicted to death and executed citizens in Soviet Union were 918.000 !""<br/><br/>I have nothing more to say except that, the cynicism, the double-speaking, the falsification of History will not stop the fall of the WASP, globalist, capitalistic, Imperialist Civilization! Fascism and Racism are your own deadly babies!! You build up an un-human world only for the bankers and the capitalists AND NOT FOR THE PEOPLE! Your time is up!"

","Movie is actually a bit toned down compared the anti-soviet imaginations presented in the book. Unfortunately movie is not much better than the source. As a person who is familiar with what communism in USSR was (parents/relatives), nothing which is accented on in the movie is true. <br/><br/>USSR had low crime rates, not because simply ignoring the crime, but due to overall mindset. When there were actually cases, they would be immediately investigated. Soviet Union could not afford eliminating people in such rates as shown in movie. If this was true, population of USSR would decline rapidly. Control was strict, surveillance was there, KGB and so on, but they did whatever FBI/CIA are doing these days in USA. <br/><br/>Hunger was not only Ukrainian problem prior to WW2, it was problem of USSR as whole due to many reasons, including poor decision making in critical times. Ukrainians love to speculate that it was something set against them, somewhat of a holocaust. Ignorance and stupidity of undereducated people who think like that. I'd love them to investigate on this problem.<br/><br/>It makes me sad when movies like this are shown to people, who are not familiar with history of Russian Empire/USSR. This heresy ruins future image of russians. I am not surprised we are presented/seen as a global threat. When you learn more about our culture, you will understand how laughable movies like this are, when casted actors can't even pronounce simple Russian words. Cluelessly or intentionally they are digging a hole between World and Russia, as future generations will form opinion based on this movie. <br/><br/>Writer of this book wanted to show a system trying to prevent crime investigation.

","Forget the low ratings,as this is an excellent movie. It's kind of like Film Noir with the flavor of historical Russia. It was set in 1953 and that is interesting as that is the year Stalin died. So, eventually, after his death, this is when the USSR began to loosen up a little bit without Stalin's craziness ruling over everybody and ruining many people's lives. So the characters change as in all drama, and the country is going to be in the throes of change as well.<br/><br/>The combination of a detective thriller with the political repression of that period is brilliant, I think. It really gives you a two-track story. It has been said that all drama is about how a character changes as the story moves along. Truly Dickensonian in that sense.(I like Dickens)<br/><br/>OK, the acting is great. Tom Hardy, of course. He is the new Gary Oldman as he can play anything. It is ironic, or is it?, that Gary Oldman is also in the movie. Noomi Rapace. Can't beat the Dragon Tattoo lady. She says very little and says so much.

","When you see the impressive trailer, you start thinking Child 44 could be a really good film. Not just a nice thriller, but an impressive commentary on the Soviet Union in the '50s. The presence of Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Noomi Rapace, Charles Dance and Vincent Cassell only serve to bolster the notion that Child 44 could be something special. Unfortunately, the film fails to deliver on these fronts. Simple as that.<br/><br/>Leo Demidov is an assumedly pro-Stalin security officer whose job is to hunt down traitors, a bit like a non-deranged version of Hans Landa. A recurring tagline is that there's no murder in paradise. Indeed, such is Stalin's influence on his people that murder isn't even considered a possibility. Instead, if such a thing were to occur, it could only have been instigated by westerners. When the son of a friend of Leo's is found dead, Leo is told to hand them a report stating it was a tragic accident, but the father won't have it. He pleads with Leo to believe him, stating there was a witness who saw the boy walk away with a man. Eventually, after a nasty bit of intrigue, Leo is demoted and relocated to another city that seems to resemble Mordor. After more and more children are found dead under similar circumstances, he finds himself obsessed with solving the case, while mostly everyone's more willing to sweep it under the rug for fear of the inevitable repercussions.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Child 44 suffers not so much from pacing issues as too many story lines all competing for attention. The identity of the serial killer is the big mystery, that is until his identity is revealed midway and he loses all potency. From that point on, you're just awaiting his inevitable ending monologue where he explains why he does what he does and why he 'just can't help it.' There's also Leo and Raisa's troubled marriage which is less than ideal. Over the course of the film, they grow closer as they attempt to catch the serial killer. There's also the matter of Leo's colleague, another antagonist who feels constantly belittled by Leo and seizes his chances for revenge when Leo is demoted and he's promoted. While interesting at first, he soon becomes little more than a typical bad guy whose only real function is to drop dead at the end. There's also Gen. Nesterov (Oldman) who has his own little subplot before being almost entirely written out of the rest of the proceedings.<br/><br/>I could go on. As a thriller, Child 44 does enough things right. The acting is pretty good and there are quite a few tense action scenes that are unfortunately only hampered by a severe case of Shaky Cam. I'm not usually the first to complain about this familiar modern trope, but here it's pretty bad. There's a fight in the mud where the combatants naturally become smeared with mud. This, combined with the shaky cam, makes it literally impossible to see who's winning, Undercut no. 1 or Undercut no. 2.<br/><br/>But in the end it feels like Child 44 aims to be so much more with its commentary on various facets of the Stalinist regime, but so little actually works. Whether it's the various subplots, the abandoned subplots, the lackluster attention devoted to character development, the over-the-top bad guy colleague, or even the occasionally distracting Russian accents, there's always something preventing you from losing yourself in the story. Decent, but could've been so much more."

","In 1950s Russia, a serial killer is killing children. However, as Stalin has declared murder to be a ""capitalist disease"", these killings are explained away as accidents. War hero secret police officer Leo finds himself drawn in to the killings but, in a culture of paranoia and people informing on each other, he is not without his own problems.<br/><br/>This suspense thriller very effectively conjures up a grim, grey society where everyone is looking over his shoulder, and with good reason – life is very cheap if you happen to come up against the wrong person. The principal players - Tom Hardy as Leo, Noomi Rapace as his wife Raisa, Gary Oldman as General Nesterov, and Joel Kinnaman as Vasili – are all very good.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's not enough. The film is very long – two and a quarter hours – and the murder investigation gets somewhat overlooked as the film concentrates on the political implications of work carried out in Leo's department, and the consequences of in-fighting and crossing the wrong person. The film is slow-moving and somewhat depressing.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film, but it's not one I shall be eagerly seeking to watch a second time."

","I was really looking forward to Child 44, a movie starring Tom Hardy, with Gary Oldman supporting, does the content even matter? The answer yes, the content still matters. I'm not big on reading the book that a movie is adapted from, but in this circumstance I may have to pick it up and give it a read. Since I'm not sure whether it was poorly adapted or somehow the idea of murder in the soviet union, at a time when murder 'wasn't possible' in a communist state, turned into a boring film.<br/><br/>The performances of Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace were uninspired and very bland, with the one bright spot of Gary Oldman turning in a solid role, as has come to be expected from him. The movie felt like 3/4 propaganda and 1/4 thriller.<br/><br/>The child murders are brought up randomly throughout the first hour of the movie, while a picture is painted of a unstable husband wife relationship, and then a conflict thrown in to move the story along slowly. By the time the murders come to the for front of the film, and a loose connection is drawn to give an idea of who the murderer could be. By the time it all comes to a conclusion you're just hoping the movie will end given its two hour plus run time.<br/><br/>All an all they're probably worse uses of your time, but there are certainly better options. They certainly could have done a better job of bringing the thriller aspect more and leaving everything else out."

","Every once in a while a movie comes along which reminds the world of a place long forgotten, an unsettling piece of our history. This is what 'Child 44' does as it portrays the brutality of the communist regime of the Soviet Union post second world war. The film is based on a disgraced military officer's search for a serial killer who the authorities fail to accept actually exists. The film is not based on the manhunt but more on the communist values of the USSR and the plight of the poor victims. Tom Hardy and Naomi Rapace deliver towering performances as they face their own struggles as well as a desperate search for the truth.

"estebangonzalez10","5","7","17","13 August 2015"," Anti-Soviet Propaganda
","""There is no murder in paradise.""<br/><br/>Another of my most anticipated films of the year that failed to live up to my expectations. I usually tend to look forward to films based solely on the director, but this time I was excited about the cast: Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Jason Clarke, and Noomi Rapace. Child 44 is an adaptation of Tom Rob Smith's best selling novel directed by Daniel Espinosa (Safe House) set in Stalin-era Soviet Union. Of course it is easily going to be labelled as anti-Soviet propaganda considering it is based on a novel written by a British author and directed by a Swedish director. The screenwriter, Richard Price (The Color of Money), is American and despite being set in Russia no one in the cast is Russian. Child 44 feels like one of those movies that came out during the Cold War trying to prove to the Western world how awful the Soviet communist regime was. You have British and Swedish actors playing Russian characters, but speaking in English with Russian accents because it wouldn't be as accessible to us if they had them speaking Russian. I'm not a fan of this style of film making and would much rather them stick with the original language, but we probably would miss out on seeing such a talented cast like this if that were so. The accent issue isn't the greatest problem with this film however, the tone of the movie is inconsistent and there are several tonal shifts that simply make the story drag at times. Child 44 is 135 minutes long and you feel every minute of it. <br/><br/>Tom Hardy is Leo Demidov, a Soviet military police officer who was adopted at an early age after the death of his parents. By chance he became a war hero thanks to a picture taken of him waving the Soviet flag over Berlin after their victory. Now in the early 50's he has an important rank working in Moscow as a military officer married to Raisa (Noomi Rapace) and he enjoys sharing the story of how they met with his fellow officers. He's idealistic and pursues anyone who is against the Stalin regime labelled as traitors. When a young boy is found dead near a train station the officials dismiss the cause of death as simply an accident, but it is evident that the kid was brutally murdered. But of course under the Soviet regime there can't be any murders because they're supposedly living in a perfect society. The kid happened to be the son of one of Leo's friends, Alexei (Fares Fares), and so he begins having his doubts about the cause of death. However that doesn't go well with Major Kuzmin (Vincent Cassel) who warns him to leave it at that. After successfully capturing a traitor named Anatoly (Jason Clarke), the officers get a list of names of other suspects from him. Raisa happens to be on that list and Leo is asked to testify against his wife and bring her in, which seemed to be a way of testing his commitment to the regime. He refuses to turn her in and is disgraced, demoted, and exiled to a small town near Moscow to serve under General Mikhail Nesterov (Gary Oldman). When another child victim is found there in similar conditions, Leo convinces Mikhail to look into it and they secretly begin investigating the case.<br/><br/>The premise of the story is very interesting, but unfortunately this period piece takes its time to introduce each character. I've read that the first cut of the film was over 5 hours long and you can tell here that it hasn't been edited in the best way because there are several tonal shifts throughout the film. Price was given the almost impossible task of adapting the screenplay of this novel without trying to leave any of the subplots out. There are several elements of the story that could've been ignored and which would've allowed for a much better pacing, but unfortunately every time the thrills began to draw me back to the story they introduced another narrative arc that drowned the pacing once again. If the film focused exclusively on the search for this mysterious serial killer it could've been a strong thriller because the performances in this film were all solid. Tom Hardy is great in his role and he alone almost makes the film worth recommending. Gary Oldman, Joel Kinnaman, Noomi Rapace, Fares Fares, Paddy Cnsidine, Vincent Cassel are all convincing as well, but they don't get as much screen time and some of their narrative arcs aren't as interesting. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"jkbonner1","7","7","17","11 May 2015"," Paradise lost
","The Soviet Union (1930s to 1953)<br/><br/>The movie opens with a starving, desperate boy escaping from a Ukrainian orphanage in the early 1930s during the great famine which ultimately killed millions in Ukraine. The killings are now known as the Holodomor and were Joseph Stalin's doing as he used draconian measures to force the Ukrainian kulaks to give up their independent farms and adopt collectivization on state-controlled collective farms. Stalin was also responsible for the systematic deportations and murders of prominent Ukrainians. Approximately ten million perished in this great purge. In the US during the Second World War people fondly referred to Stalin as Uncle Joe, but Stalin was no kindly uncle. He was directly responsible for the deaths of millions of human beings as was Adolph Hitler. Both were monsters. And although the two political systems of Nazism and Communism were at the opposite ends of the political spectrum, both used the same methods: leader adulation, brutal force, rampant devastation, and mass murder. And both totally despised each other to the last core of their being.<br/><br/>The boy is rescued by Soviet troops and adopted by a Russian officer, who renames him Leo. He becomes Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy). And the next scene we see him and his wartime buddy, Alexei Andreyev (Fares Fares), storming the German Reichstag in Berlin and hoisting the bright red Soviet flag flapping in the wind on the roof of the Reichstag, showing to what was left of the battered German forces that the Soviets had taken their capital, Berlin.* This was on 2 May 1945 and the photo taken of this event became as symbolic in the Soviet Union as the photo of the four US Marines hoisting the flag on Iwo Jima. The war in Europe ended May 8 with the unconditional surrender of Germany to the Allied Forces of the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>There are no murders in paradise. Paradise being the Soviet Union, which was considered a paradise for the workers. So, there could be no murders committed there by loyal Soviet citizens. Any murder was considered the work of capitalist spies who were out to destroy the Soviet Union. We now see Leo Demidov in 1953 where he is a high-level MGB investigator who has been smitten with Raisa (Noomi Rapace) and soon they are married, although we learn later her motive for marriage was far different from what Leo could ever have imagined.<br/><br/>We see Leo at work tracking down people believed to be spies against the Soviet Union. We see torture and killings. We see mass arrests and harassment of ordinary Soviet citizens by MGB police. The ""spy"" taken captive by Leo's staff under torture reveals names of seven others, and among them is Raisa. In the midst of all this Alexei's son is brutally murdered, but the MGB authorities label his death as an accident because officially there are no murders. Soon Leo and Raisa are transported to Volsk, Siberia as a demotion and Leo must report to the general of the militia there, General Mikhail Nesterov (Gary Oldman). Another child is murdered in Volsk, and Leo convinces General Nesterov that someone is purposefully and systematically murdering children. Eventually Leo and Raisa track down the murderer with the help of Nesterov. The murderer makes a stunning confession to Leo before being shot by Leo's adversary and Bete Noire, Vasili (Joel Kennaman). Leo triumphs over Vasili and Raisa realizes she's married a good man. <br/><br/>The movie has many good points. The acting is very good and the scenery and costumes struck me as being very convincing in their depiction of the Soviet Union in 1953 and the kind of living that must have prevailed there in those times. The chief problem with the movie is that it tackles as many flaws of the Soviet system as it can, and the theme of the title, Child 44, seemed to get lost in the many comings and goings. Of what I've read, the book does the same thing. Since I've never read it, I can't comment on how successful, or unsuccessful, the book was following this approach. But following this approach in the movie means the movie's focus keeps shifting and the one-thing-right-after-another introduces too many subthemes for the audience to readily relate to. Too many things to chew on, so to speak. Some serious editing was required and it didn't happen.<br/><br/>I can only give this movie a 7 out of 10. Good try though. And I'd still recommend it as a good historical drama set in one of the US's most tenacious adversaries at the height of its power and influence.<br/><br/>* It's not exactly clear who the actual Soviet soldier was who hoisted the flag on the roof of the Reichstag. Suggesting his name was Leo Demidov is artistic license on the part of the movie."

","""There can be no murder in paradise."" After WWII Russia is doing everything it can to show that their country is perfect and nothing bad ever happens. When military policeman Leo Demidov (Hardy) begins to see a pattern between the ""accidental"" deaths of children his reward is to be demoted and sent away. Now with his wife (Rapace) and General Nesterov (Oldman) he investigates on his own and what he finds is worse than he imagined. This is a hard movie to review. The acting is amazing. Tom Hardy is becoming one of the best actors working today and I think it is only a matter of time before he wins an Oscar. Watching him and Rapace play off each other is very intriguing and worth watching for that. On the other hand the subject matter is very intense and a little hard to watch if you have children. Nothing graphic is shown only discussed but that is enough. Overall, this is a movie that is very much worth seeing and I do recommend it, but it would be hard to watch more than once. I give this a B."

","What a disappointment, just two point for Tom Hardy, as he truly IS Leo Demidov, I had him in mind when I read the book. But now to the movie itself: First of all, they tore the gripping story of the book apart and succeeded in emphasizing unimportant parts of the book while the real interesting part like Leos change from an Apparatschik to a human being with a conscience was totally left aside. They spend probably vast sums of money filming a totally useless war scene in Berlin where Leo in fact never was as he as in a special unit defending his country in the war, it was gruesome, what a waste. Anyway, read the book, be thrilled by the story, be touched by Leos inner fights, and imagine just Tom Hardy.<br/><br/>By the way, Noomie Rapace looked like Leos frigid mother, there was never a hint that they finally found each other and gave their new love a chance, she is just an old hag what a terrible cast.<br/><br/>Wassily also was a total miscast....the character was not developed at all, just a flat villain.<br/><br/>This movie would have need a narrator I guess in order to cover all the shades of the story, just plain acting did not do the job.<br/><br/>Do not waste your time, read the book (the books actually, because there are three of them with Leo)."

","This movie proves worth and creates an interesting moral dilemma, making the movie more metaphorical and layered. It is attractively shot and passionately acted, furthermore the plot scheme of Child 44 provides an interesting insight into the grim period of Soviet Union history. The set design is more than impressive, it is almost tangible, physical. On the other hand, the film can often prove disorienting and uneven, as there are too many significantly introduced – then left aside – protagonists. It's easy to think how lost can feel someone from outside of the region (for whom these facts are not at all evident) and how the viewer can feel when confronting this dense tissue. Overall when it comes to entertainment and storytelling value, Daniel Espinosa's film Child 44 is just acceptable, though the ambitious director got crushed by the complexity of the material."

","Man, I managed to avoid watching this movie for a year. I read some bad reviews and I kept thinking, I don't want to watch it, it's gonna be bad. Finally, because I had nothing else to watch, I decided to kill some time with this movie and I'm so glad I did. I haven't read the original book, and I try not to compare books and films because I will always get upset about what they did with the source material. Maybe if I'd read it, I'd be furious like some other reviewers out there. <br/><br/>I really don't understand why people would call this movie boring and give it so little credit. Perhaps it's because they didn't understand that it was a movie about more than just the murders. I actually liked this concept a lot - the idea that there are several stories to it rather than just one story-line going smoothly from A to Z. Honestly, scene after scene I was wondering where the story would lead the characters, how it would end. <br/><br/>The movie kept me hooked till the end. It was very intense, and quite scary too because the regime of the USSR was brilliantly portrayed and you can just sense that there must be something bad waiting to happen round every corner. If you imagine what life would've been like back in the day, you can feel what the director and screenwriter wanted to achieve. <br/><br/>There were issues that should've been developed more. Some characters should've been given more attention and some things weren't explained so you have to figure stuff on your own - and maybe sometimes it's OK, but in this movie I think we should've been given a little more. For example, I didn't quite get why the whole operation was such a secret, why some people would kill some people and try to cover up the investigation. As much as I get that 'there's no murder in paradise' so you can't let anyone run around digging for some killer, I think that someone should've been interested in this guy. After all, 44 kids is kind of a big deal and why would you want to sweep that under the carpet? <br/><br/>All in all, though, the story is coherent, the acting is great, the mood is dark and heavy just as it should be, and all the extra stuff that some people found unnecessary, in my opinion really adds to the movie and makes it multidimensional rather than a one-dimensional thriller-by-numbers. Such stories are about the people, not about the plot. Once you accept that this is this kind of movie, maybe it will be easier to watch it with an open mind. <br/><br/>I loved it."

The movie managed to paint an intense picture of a very special era. Disturbing, and in its authenticity and accuracy plain awful to watch. Fear and paranoia washes out even the smallest bit of kindness.

","A compelling story, and I sense the screenplay has stuck very close to the novel (I can almost detect specific lines from the book in this). I'm going to read it right away!
Excellent turns from the always honest, complex Tom Hardy, and mercurial Gary Oldman. Joel Kinnaman (I'd only seen him in House of Cards, up to now), Paddy Constantine (can he just be in everything? Playing wonderfully well against type, here), and Noomi Rapace are all compelling ambiguous, and all actors convey excellent depth, subtly communicating the back stories of their characters with deft show-don't-tell. Good, also, to see Jason Clarke. Pretty much my favourite lineup of character actors! All they needed was Jared Harris, but the always wonderful Mark Lewis Jones fills that gap with no problems!
The end is particularly worth the journey, but I can't help but think this storyline would've been better served by a mini-series, allowing more time and pace to develop the themes and context (aspects the thoughtful, experienced and utterly believable cast manage to do, nonetheless). Beautiful production design and sense of culture/society/place. Again, another reason to read the novel."

After all, it might have negative implications for the fake 'paradise' they've created.<br/><br/>The authorities blame everything to make the problems go away... first they put the murder down to train accidents, then they pin the blame on some poor mentally disabled guy who can't argue back.<br/><br/>As the grisly murders continue apace though and whispers of dissent start getting louder, one courageous officer is willing to ignore the party line to try cracking the case himself... even at the cost of his career and possibly, his own life. Are you excited yet?!<br/><br/>Tom Hardy tries his hand at a Russian accent and at creating a sympathetic hero, succeeding on both counts. The actress playing his wife also does a fine job, strong, determined and with secrets of her own. Finally, if Joel Kinnaman's main brief was for us to despise him as the villain, then mission successful I'd say.<br/><br/>It shines a light on a particularly brutal period in history, where the Russian state demanded absolute loyalty in all circumstances (and due to a combination of violence & murder, usually got it).

","Despite the multitude of negative reviews floating around the Internet, I thought CHILD 44 was a solid mix of the drama and thriller genres. The post-war Russian setting alone makes it worth watching and there's nothing wrong at all with the Russian accents which some commentators seem to moan on and on about. I'd rather this than seeing certain actors playing roles and not even attempting the accent, like Tom Cruise in VALKYRIE.<br/><br/>The story is based on a novel about a series of child killings taking place in Soviet Russia and the efforts of a top-ranking policeman to track down the serial killer responsible. The real star of the show is Daniel Espinosa, who previously made EASY MONEY and who brings the same level of stark beauty to his production here. The cinematography is excellent and brings the various action and dramatic set-pieces to life in a unique way. In addition, CHILD 44 boasts a fine ensemble cast to be enjoyed. Tom Hardy is the solid lead and the likes of Gary Oldman, Vincent Cassel, Jason Clarke, and Noomi Rapace bring fine support, with the scene-stealing Joel Kinnaman re-teaming with Espinosa after EASY MONEY."

There were no ""sirs"". Just ""comrades"". If you place movie in Russia, let it at least look like Russia at that period. Not so many cars on the streets, not so nice buildings (as in Prague, where the filming took place). Let actors speak plain English (or Russian) and, for God's sake!, DO NOT spoil everything with some fake Russian accent. This is not the first time that Hollywood uses English with some foreign accent (Book Thief?). Why? What's the message? You do not have any idea how irritating this is. Also, in one scene, when Leo and Raisa change clothes, Tom Hardy is clearly seen wearing jeans. Jesus! So many stupid (producers'?) acts and yet the movie is very good, well told.

I understand that it is difficult to make a film out of a book and you have to condense it and give it more impact. However, you don't need to take away the main essence of the story in doing so.<br/><br/>My main gripes are these: Why do they insist on talking with awful fake Russian accents throughout? It would have been better spoken naturally or even in Russian with subtitles...<br/><br/>The entire story about Leo and the killer's past has been removed. The hunting of the cat, Leo's disappearance and the killer's clues which tie back in to this are all gone. Leo's entire history is rewritten as a shallow backstory with no meaning to the story-line. As a result, the killer has no real motive in this film. It makes absolutely no sense.<br/><br/>What happened to the main plot of the book about Leo's internal struggle and changing from a unquestioning tool of the state into someone with a conscience? As for Vasili, the character in the film shows little resemblance to the character in the book. The film version is very shallow and there is not really the impression of his personal hatred for Leo.<br/><br/>All in all, this was such a wasted opportunity. Essential parts of the story were discarded and story-line changed to be so simplistic that it no longer makes sense. I have to wonder whether this is a result of the editing process or the screenplay itself? They maximised action (jumping from the train, fight in the forest etc) and at the same time removed any thought provoking aspects of the story. Why would you make a film of a book and take out the main aspects of the story that make it great? On the plus side (and the reason for 2 stars) some of the scenes were well acted (if you can ignore the accents) and the photography was quite impressive at times."

Had I not read the novel I would have probably scored it higher. Tom Hardy without a doubt was the best element of the film, it's no surprise he's getting the volume of work that he is.

With his flawless Russian accent to perfect body language, Hardy proves that he's the best in the business today, among his contemporaries. Noomi Rapace is competent, as always. Gary Oldman is adequate. Joel Kinnaman isn't menacing enough, while Vincent Cassel seems to have done his bit in a massive hurry.

","Child 44 is a crime investigation with the backdrop of treason and espionage in post-World War II Russia. It's a bizarre take on detective flick and leaning more towards social commentary and the psychological repercussion of the time. It may be a bit slow as subplots are overlapping, but the great acting from the leading actors present an engaging spectacle.<br/><br/>Leo Demidova (Tom Hardy) is an upstanding officer of Russia. During the cold era of Stalin, he presides over many investigations to uproot treachery. His life and carrier would change drastically as a serial child killer emerges. He's soon demoted for chasing the truth, and with only his estranged wife Raisa (Noomi Rapace) at his side, he adamantly pursues the killer.<br/><br/>This is a complex setting for crime thriller, and it still works mostly due to the actors' capable performance. Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace are both splendid on creating the human drama, audience would root for his character who is idealistic almost to a fault and in expense of personal relationship. Tom Hardy looks believable as an officer, more importantly a man, trying to do right despite the oppressive nature he must deal with.<br/><br/>Noomi Rapace looks confident as a survivor, she wears a tough front and confidently strong yet has a fragile side as well. These two are not the usual spouse as their issues are pretty dysfunctional and sadly deep-rooted, occasionally they might even resemble partners than husband and wife. Gary Oldman is versatile and certainly impressive here, he pulls off the magnetic general in stoic manner, yet still seemingly combative at times.<br/><br/>The narrative covers a great deal of subjects. This in turn creates a longer runtime as well as more subplots. Granted, it may be too slow for some audience. Its mix on the crime and social aspects take time to bear fruit. It is rewarding in the end, although the first half might feel plodding and not every angles work. The action could be better too, since the camera shakes violently in a few of the action sequences.<br/><br/>This is a different kind of thriller, it traverses through not only one but many touchy subjects. However, the acting prowess and adequate material present a fascinating look on the time and the cruelty it harbors."
"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","6","3","6","24 August 2015"," False advertising lead to high hopes
","Child 44, a movie that is centered around a small group of military ""detectives"" trying to find a child killer in the USSR in 1953. That was what the trailer suggested. The story is also based on a book, so the script had a background to rely on. All in all, high hopes were in play, and almost none of them were satisfied. To start form the obvious problems:<br/><br/>1) The story. The baseline presented in the trailer is just a small part of the whole story this movie has to offer. At first, it gave an idea that this would be a multi layered storyline with powerful characters and subplots. The only thing actually presented was one powerful character. It is unclear if this problem is related to the script or to the directing, but after watching Espinosa's ""Safe house"" the answer becomes vivid. The basic problem is the inability to convince the audience of the time-line (it is still unclear weather the entire movie took place in a few days or years) and the subplots. The story should have been approached more seriously and all aspects should have been directed better and presented in the same amount. The final product gave us an unfinished general storyline and unfinished subplots. In the editing process all that was mixed up and Child 44 was born. As you can imagine, a lot of elements seemed underdeveloped and way too linear for a movie of this kind.<br/><br/>2) The acting. An all-star cast generally gives a peace of mind because actors of this profile (Hardy, Oldman, Rapace, Cassel...) can turn mud into gold. Still, the director has to give actors screen time to pull that off. Oldman, Cassel, Dance, Clarke were used for cameo roles and all together had less than 20 minutes of screen time. Restraining these actors to one liners and 5 minutes of screen time is almost criminal. Hardy was, as usual, great, but as the movie progressed one can't help noticing the fall of enthusiasm he had. It felt that he just wanted to get all that over with and go do something else. Rapace was supposed to be the support Hardy had, but she failed at that. Her character suffered most from poor directing and a bad script, so even her acting couldn't save her character. Kinnaman was a surprise to see, and his career is rising like the tide, but in this movie, where he actually had to show us his acting abilities, he failed. Robocop was good, Run all night also, but there he had one or two emotions and a steady character. Here he needed to be treacherous, despicable and unlikeable. He managed to be unlikable. <br/><br/>3) The atmosphere. This is the only thing that saves this movie. It is vividly shown how the Stalin era functioned and how fear was the key element of everyday life. The problem is, at one point that becomes so overwhelming that it takes over the whole movie and one has to shake the feeling that the movie is just a criticism of that time. The production did a good job there but all in all, this is one element that was overdone so it clouded other underdeveloped elements.<br/><br/>All in all, not an experience worth while. Hardy saves it form a void it should fall into, and the atmosphere keeps it from falling. In better directorial hands and with a better script, this would have been a masterpiece."

","I haven't read Tom Smiths book Child 44 but the topic of this movie was interesting so I gave it a shot. It is a solid movie with fine performances from the actors but the most interesting thing of the movie is of course a portrayal of Stalin-Era Soviet Union and the treatment of criminals and citizens in it. In this story we see a series of child-murders in an indoctrinated society where there can't be such sick individuals like serial killers. The society's dogma prevents an efficient investigation of the case and it all happens in the time of paranoid hunt for foreign agents and counter-revolutionary elements. The strongest part of the story is the analysis of unjust society, where anything can be declared a treason no matter how powerful a single individual in this system is (as a matter of fact, the only person never accused in any crime in Soviet Union was a General Secretary of the Party. All others were at some time find guilty of something, regardless if this person is a WW2 hero, Army general, MGB general etc). The weak part of the movie is the Holiwoodesque battle of a lonely hero (well in this case he has a wife) against impossible odds. I will not go into detail, but I will say that the killer is killed, the main antagonist in a form of a corrupt MGB officer is also killed and our hero is redeemed in the eyes of the state, which I believe never happened in Stalins SU. Those declared guilty by society have been punished – sent into imprisonment in some camp or executed, because the state was never wrong. All in all, the movie is not bad but if you would like to know more about Stalins State I can recommend two excellent books: Arthur Koestlers Eclipse at Noon"" and from Danilo Ki A Tomb for Boris Davidovich""."

The story also has good twists and turns, and also all those predictable and suspicious moments of opportune revenges among colleagues. Yet the story part where it has the movie's own title, the one about the child murders, instead only has a little and less meaningful part to the movie as a whole. It's only used as a bridging part to set Leo's life story in continuance. Also the story doesn't really close or solve all those plot holes left at the movie's end. The acting overall feels nicely suiting to the described time period and location. Although the bad part is that all the cast really over used accentuation on their dialog that they sounded mumbling almost all the time, even including Tom Hardy's performance. But Tom Hardy really grasps his character well and his performance is nicely gripping. Noomi Rapace nicely worked out her role and so did the antagonist in Joel Kinnaman. Gary Oldman nicely completes the angles for the story's continuance."

","I don't know what to say to be honest. I was so looking forward to this film that when I saw the trailer I up and bought the entire Trilogy of the book series. I'm not a big reader at all but I read the entire first book in five days which for me is Impressive. I absolutely loved the book it is a Masterpiece and the best book I have ever read and I plan to read the other two sequels. I have now got that out of the way I shall continue on with the movie review. The cast was Superb I will say there is no denying that in any way shape or form though they weren't utilized properly besides Tom Hardy as Leo because he is the main protagonist. I also felt the story moved extremely slow which in the book it was a roller coaster of a ride. The thing that upset me the most was that they changed key plot points and since I just finished the book the day I saw the film it was fresh in my mind. I feel that the points they changed just killed it for me and as for anyone who hasn't read the book they might enjoy this film more so then I did. I would recommend skipping this and buying the book series and reading that instead which is painful for me to say because I was so stoked for this film and it was such a let down. I will say as for the action it was there in a few key points which was a hell of a lot less then the book had and also one last thing to add is most of the reviews from critics were correct which is rare. I bid you a great day."

","Oh yes, there is a saying that history repeats itself twice, the first time as tragedy, the second time - as a comedy. I am far from thinking that this film is a comedy (on the contrary), but I'm curious how after the phenomenal success of ""Citizen X"" there were so courageous filmmakers who dare to do something like remake of it?<br/><br/>Obviously, the wave of anti-Russian hysteria is fruitful opportunity for any sort of performances from literary and filmmakers, but in this particular case - unsuccessfully realized. Maybe Ridley Scott must find the courage to engage with directing instead of acting only as a producer? Perhaps the Russians had to let this film widely in Russian cinemas to show the audience a failed attempt to paraphrase the story of Chikatilo, inspired by ideological premises?<br/><br/>Actually it does not matter, just the efforts of a great cast are wasted due to propaganda exertions and ad hoc political-ideological campaign. There is nothing more annoying than stupid propaganda. I can not say that this is a very poorly made film by itself, however, certainly looks that way after ""Citizen X"". I would recommend to the audience instead of wasting time with ""Child 44"", just to look back and view again cinema masterpiece ""Citizen X""."

","While it has been many years since the varying interest (money men & tax experts, liberal ideologues, and the ever present legions of pure sycophants who's only wish is to ""be"" with whomever they have a crush on this week) all have an epiphany regarding a single ""project,"" they never say movie when they know so many PC and other criteria mist be met before even the script is finished, upon which each investor (the money-bags for sure but also others who will invest time and talent to make everything work) must be satisfied that, on the surface, at least, you get a good (not likely) movie, which is the case here. However, there are numerous problems connected with the pure waste of film that Child 44 represents, as follows: A. The movie is a direct ripoff of Citizen X (1995) which was a loosely based story of Russia's first serial killer Andrei Chikatillled of over 50 who killed over 50 people in the old Soviet Union. B. The story was rearranged-written to pander to the current whitehouse attitude toward the Russian Confederacy so now it puts the evil government against other Russian police-type good-guys. C. The victims were gratuitously changed from mainly women to all boys so as to pander to yet one more of hollywoods numerous pressure groups D. And to add insult injury hired the current hot (sexy yet respectable) Swedish actress Noomi Rapace (to guarantee at least a few ticket sales) and topped off with the veteran (for those who care about acting) actor Gary Oldman in order to have a slid lead for the story to demonstrate requisite conflict that MUST be (even if it has to be manufactured) in all Hollywood productions. So what does everyone else know that the bobble-heads here do not--quite simple actually, i.e., the film was made to advertise a message (needlessly set in 1953 ultra dreary Russia when this dog could have been set at any time or place), i.e., us-good-Russia-bad, he socially correct message that no one has it as hard, no put intended, as gay's do these days. All in all I thought this dog was dreary and interminably over-long despite some good acting by Rapace and Oldman, to say nothing of the films heavy handed, group-think, approach to delivering messages pro-anything the current administration thinks we commoners need to learn (yeah, yeah we get it, Putin bad, liberal opinion good). So if you don't mind wasting time, money and a few brain cells in the process, see the film and form your own opinion... Or, stay home and feed your dog, Fido will appreciate it and you'll have done something productive too boot."

"davidmvining","2","2","4","4 February 2020"," Obviously cut down heavily
","I was very unsurprised by the information that the first cut of this film was over five hours long. The final product of Child 44 is the exact right mix of overstuffed and underdeveloped that would come with shaving three hours out of a five hour movie while trying to keep as much in as possible. The big moments are still there, but so much of the connective tissue is gone.<br/><br/>There are really two interrelated stories at play in this film. The first is what's on the posters and what was made into the television movie Citizen X, the story of a child murdered in the Soviet Union. Murders don't happen in the Soviet Union. Murder, according to Stalin, is a purely capitalistic disease and murders, as gets said several times, do not happen in paradise.<br/><br/>This story gets sidelined for long stretches by the second story, which is a more expansive view of life in Soviet Russia as seen through the eyes of Leo Demidov, an MGB agent, and his wife Raisa. This tries to capture the horror of daily life in the Soviet police state, where every word could be reported to authorities and your entire life ended by mere suspicion. That's dramatized early when Leo himself tracks down a veterinarian who immediately starts running when he sees MGB agents on his tail. He's not guilty of anything, but he knows that if he gets caught then his life is over.<br/><br/>The movie starts both of these stories pretty well, giving us time to appreciate the slow horror of both of them, but by about the halfway point, once Leo gets demoted to the militia and sent to the country, things begin to skip and speed up. Gary Oldman is prominently featured in the marketing, but he has about a scene and a half. We skip through the investigation of further child murders to suddenly get a complete list and Leo and Raisa have to go back to Moscow for unclear reasons. There they interact with one of Raisa's former fellow teachers who ends up being an MGB spy trying to entrap people at the school, and it gets revealing while Leo is killing the man with a phone cord. The two end up on the run, but it's unclear why. Is it because they killed the man without anyone witnessing the murder? Is it because they got into Moscow on faked papers?<br/><br/>And why does Leo continue this investigation, especially after he's been released from the police. He ends up taking Raisa around to a manufacturing plant where they track down the killer before getting into a fistfight with a former fellow MGB agent who's tracked them down. The connective tissue between all of these scenes is gone.<br/><br/>Mentioning Citizen X is instructive. It strives to tell only half the story that Child 44 does, and it does it much better because it has over 100 minutes to dedicate only to that. It's not a great film, but it's a solid procedural from another world. Looking at the similar story of Child 44, they only dedicated about sixty minutes to the crime and investigation itself, and it's lost in a bunch of other shortened stuff along with it.<br/><br/>The action of the film ends when Leo and the antagonistic MGB agent get into a fistfight in the mud. Now, a second for an aesthetic comment. When you make your film aesthetically unpleasant, you build a handicap for yourself because your film is simply unpleasant to look at. You can still make a great film, but you're making the job harder for yourself. This may be appropriate considering the material at hand, but it doesn't change the reality that making a movie that is ugly to look at will not help you with most audiences. Child 44 is, from beginning to end, hard to simply look at. On top of that, it's about a child murderer and the oppressive life under Stalin. There are levels of ugly to this film that extend deep into the subtext, and it never lets up, culminating in the fistfight that ends with one man getting his head violently thrown against a rock. I'm not saying this movie is bad because it's ugly (I think I've listed the reasons clearly enough), but the ugliness simply put up a barrier between artist and audience that may not have been completely necessary. As a counterpoint, I think of Tarkovsky's Stalker, which was filmed in a Soviet state, in a region of industrial decline and nuclear radiation, but it's gorgeous to look at despite all that.<br/><br/>It's ugly, about difficult material, and it shortchanges every aspect of its storytelling because they never found a way to write a screenplay condensed enough to tell the story they wanted to tell. They filmed it all and ended up having to shorten it significantly in editing to disastrous results. Perhaps the full five hour version is a better film, but we'll never see it because the movie ended up losing so much money that the studio will never touch it again."

","Child 44 follows a man who, after learning of the deaths of several children, begins a search for the man who murdered them, despite the fact that they were written off as accidents. <br/><br/>I love me a good crime thriller, really I do. And when I see a plot like this where the movie is brave enough to deal with a subject like murdering children, then it casts Tom Hardy, then color me interested. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the actual plot doesn't start until the last forty minutes of this 137 minutes film. And even then, none of it is really all that interesting or even easy to follow. In fact by the time the plot starts rolling the script just stops trying to make sense. There's a scene that, under normal circumstances, would sound pretty awesome where a bunch of people start fighting and killing each other on a train cart, but in context there isn't actually any. The scene begins when some random expendable character pulls out a knife and tries to attack the protagonists. Somehow said protagonists know exactly what he's planning the second he stands up, and this big fight ensues. Sure, it's cool, but it doesn't make any sense. At that point I gave up on trying to understand the movie. The actual finding of the killer ends up being super anti- climatic and watered down, and it's just not engaging at all. <br/><br/>What about the 100 minutes leading up to the actual plot you may ask? Nothing happens. It's 'character development' where none of the characters are interesting and nothing that pulls, or more drags, the oncoming plot along are anything special. It's just a whole lot of nothing.<br/><br/>Overall Child 44 is kind of boring and dumb for the vast majority of it, yet somehow worse when the actual plot starts.

","""Child 44"" has a stellar cast and a classic premise: A tough, gritty cop on the hunt for a gruesome serial child killer. The twist is that the ""cop"" is a Stalin-era MGB agent, Leo (Tom Hardy). He's a former orphan who became a war hero, and now lives in a spacious apartment with his beautiful schoolteacher wife, Raisa (Noomi Rapace). The plot, based on an award-winning novel, is convoluted, but mainly hinges on Leo's growing interest in a mysterious string of deaths of young boys, and his dogged determination to crack the case as his privileged status in the Soviet hierarchy unravels. Yet the film is weighed down by too many side plots, and hits you over the head with endless examples of how horrible it was to live under the Stalin regime. <br/><br/>""Child 44"" is a relentlessly grim movie, with heaps of gratuitous violence (even when it doesn't really advance the story). Many of the scenes are dimly lit, everything colored in browns and grays. Leo and Raisa have a strange, uneven relationship, and it's very hard to grasp her motivation for doing anything she does in this film, other than that she was living in a constant state of fear because she's in a totalitarian state. Her character makes no sense, even though she's in most of the scenes. A waste of a great actress like Rapace (the original ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"").<br/><br/>The serial killer plot feels stale. ""Child 44"" seems less focused on the mystery solving and more on all the suspicion, backstabbing, blackmail, ratting out on your friends, police state brutality and bureaucratic oppression of the old USSR. I love Tom Hardy, and he does infuse his portrayal of Leo with pathos, longing, pain and gritty determination to do the right thing in a corrupt system. But this film's script and direction are just muddled. <br/><br/>Kids, if you want to watch a far superior, engaging movie with a similar premise, opt for ""Gorky Park"" instead. Sorry!

The result is generalised fear and a perfect breeding ground for cowardly monsters. Fortunately, there are always some with the character and courage to resist.
The acting is perfect, making the film feel very real (if one can ignore the fact that all the Russians are speaking heavily accented English - but to be fair, what sort of a cinema audience would one attract with a film in Russian with English subtitles; it is a business looking for a market, after all)."

The entire treatment is dark and grotty and while this can sometimes be an atmospheric plus, here it's so unrelenting it becomes tiresome. Overly convoluted 'style' and heavy violence tend to be used as substitutes for quality story elements - this could leave some viewers unsatisfied - forced dialects are also off-putting and quickly become annoying.

"Irie212","6","0","0","23 August 2017"," Strong story, flawed in the telling
","A serial murderer is at large in Stalinist USSR (1945). The victims are young boys. That is the background to what is really an attack on Stalinist tactics. We don't see much of the crime or even the investigation. Mostly we see a Western take on Soviet suppression. Don't get me wrong, Stalin was a mass murderer on a historic scale, and deserves vilification. But his minions were individuals. ""Child 44"" doesn't recognize such complexity. Instead, it reduces almost every character to good or evil. <br/><br/>The exception is Raisa (Noomi Rapace in a beautiful performance), the wife of a captain in Soviet intelligence, Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy, in what may be his best performance to date). The arc of the story takes her from feeling forced into a marriage to a powerful gendarme to the dawning realization that Leo is a good man struggling with his brutal role and reputation in society.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the two principal bad guys-- the child murderer (Paddy Considine) and Leo's colleague and nemesis (Joel Kinnaman)-- are nothing more than plot devices to deliver scenes of brutality, including a protracted beating of Leo. I saw the film streaming on TV, so I could fast-forward through scenes that made me suspect sadistic tendencies in the director, Daniel Espinosa. The only other film of his that I saw, ""Safe House,"" showed the same tendencies ( and his 2017 movie ""Life"" has no shortage of pain and gore, according to reviews I read.) <br/><br/>I'm not squeamish; there is a place for violence in cinema. But Espinosa indulged in it well beyond the needs of the story. The running time of 137 minutes is a tell. And the power of the story is not about the Soviet purges and gulags, where violence occurred. The story, at its heart, is about one spouse finding the true moral character in another-- a wife learning to trust her husband's love, and coming to love him in return. It's too bad such sensitivity didn't inform all the characters in the story, or spare the audience the excessive bloodthirst."

","Set in Stalin's post-war Soviet Union, this story of serial child killings runs parallel with that of the strained relations between Hardy and Rapace's lead characters, Leo and Raisa. In Moscow, the discovery of a friend's son's body and the state's denial of such crimes and subsequent cover up provoke something in Leo. He uses his powers as a senior Soviet police officer to pursue the perpetrator, against orders. This, combined with an embarrassing clash with a fellow comrade sees him stripped of rank and dispatched to a dystopian, remote industrial town as punishment. Dismissed from her teaching job, Raisa goes with him. As forces conspire against Leo, they must make a stand together. So, a different town but yet, another murder. What is their connection? Desperate to find answers, especially for his friend, Leo must persuade the local police chief that there is a connection between here and Moscow, where his case started. This film depicts the daily grind and harshness endured by the Soviet people together with the political paranoia prevalent during this era. All of this portrayed convincingly by a quality cast."

","It is a strange title. In the narration as well it does not properly reveals, more like an approximate count of something. It is a Russian story, I mean the Russian characters and the locations. It begins after the world war two, in Moscow, a top police officer caught between the departmental politics and a case. After the his investigation ended without a result, the sacked officer gets a lifeline to begin again life in another town. But the trouble follows him when he started to investigate the children's deaths. The result of the case brings the end to the tale with a tiny small twist.<br/><br/>The actors were decent, not very impressive. Especially I understand since it was internationally produced, they preferred English language, but I would have liked it in the original language to get best appeal. It was too long film, the first half was very boring. Because it was most unrelated to what comes in the later part of the film. When the narration shifts its base out of the Moscow, that's where it really gets very interesting. So after first 60 minutes, the real story begins.<br/><br/>This where the actors got better. Noomi Rapace and Tom Hardy, both were like the kicked off with full of energy. So the second half of the film makes it watchable. Directed by a 'Easy Money' filmmaker who also brought in his Swedish actors to play the smaller roles. It was not good as I expected, but ended well. I don't think it is worth a watch, but who knows what you like. So I neither recommend nor reject it. But it was an average film to me.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Based on the acclaimed novel by British writer Tom Rob Smith, this is a thriller about the tracking down of a serial killer of young children, but what gives it a special atmosphere is that it is set in Stalin's Soviet Union (actually just before the dictator dies). <br/><br/>Shot largely in Prague, the film certainly manages to convey both the drabness and the terror of living at this Kafkaesque time and the work boasts an impressive cast list, including Tom Hardy as MGB investigator Leo Demidov, Noomi Rapace as his wife Raisa whom he is told to denounce, and Gary Oldman as General Nesterov in the provincial town to which Leo and Raisa are exiled. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the treatment is clunky and the accents distracting in what should have been a better transposition of the book."
"pfgpowell-1","Null","0","0","31 December 2015"," Confused? You will be. There's a good film struggling to get out, but sadly this isn't it
","Other reviews assure us that the film isn't a patch on the novel on which it is based, but as I haven't read the novel, I have no idea whether or not that is true. As it stands the film version of Child 44 has a lot going for it, though unfortunately it loses on points. It tries to do too much, doesn't quite know what kind of film it wants to be and ends up being none of them. It's a confused production, well-filmed, great direction, but at the end of the day so bloody confusing you might well - as I did - ask yourself: well, what was that all about.<br/><br/>Set in Stalinist Russia it is great on atmosphere, great on conveying the sheer terror that existed while Stalin was still alive where husband could not talk openly to wife and more or less anything might - bad luck and chance being the major factors - get you killed or even worse.<br/><br/>The setting is the film's strong point (though I think it might well have done better without the cod Russian accents). And the soundtrack - at least when I watched it on Amazon - was quite simply abysmal: I struggled to understand what had been said and even re-spooling the film a few minutes to watch a scene two or three times again - possible when watching a streaming or a DVD - didn't help. That is a technical failing for which there can be no excuse.<br/><br/>Ostensibly it is all about one man's hunt to track down a serial killer in a paranoid, totalitarian state which proclaims itself to be such a paradise to live in that murder cannot exist. But there is so much more going on that it is bloody difficult to know what actually is going on. And that has to be down to the script and then the producers who should have called a halt to proceedings while the film script was sorted out. Sadly, they didn't.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is as good as any you might see which has Ridley Scott as a producer. But there's a lot more to films than just what it looks like - story for one thing, and that is where the major confusion lies. In fact, it is all so confusing that I shan't event try to convey what it might - note might - be about.<br/><br/>Where the whole thing really falls down is what is conventionally called the 'denouement'. Here Child 44 simply resorts to standard schlock western happy ending values, producing an 'ending' which is wholly ridiculous. Utterly, utterly ridiculous.<br/><br/>So there you have it. My final comment will be this: at its heart there is here a great film to be made, but this simply isn't it. That great film, with a better, more focused story, must be made by an Eastern European film-making with a cynical heart - to reflect the utterly horrific times it portrays - and a clearer idea of just what it intends to convey.<br/><br/>However, and possibly quite surprisingly, if you have half a mind to watch it, go ahead: the atmosphere of Stalinist terror is conveyed perfectly and, it has to be said, what the film shows is quite possibly not half as bad as what really happened. But bear in mind the overall experience is rather frustrating, if you want more than just atmosphere.<br/><br/>Confused? I was and you might well be, too.<br/><br/>PS Ask yourself why a high-value production made in 2015 is already available on Amazon. Well?"
"JohnRayPeterson","8","0","0","28 November 2015"," Not for casual viewing or simple entertainment; tragedies aren't.
","This movie has a story to tell and it's a tragedy, so don't expect a thriller or suspense or simple drama. I was somewhat familiar with the theme because I remember vividly the 1995 Citizen X movie starring Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. I liked it and some did not. The same criticism was written about both movies; it's to be expected but it doesn't mean it's correct. Those who can't stand tragedies shouldn't watch them and ought not write reviews about them because they'll never be satisfied.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the synopsis for both movies, do; I'll not copy it, you surely can read it if you haven't already.<br/><br/>Daniel Espinosa did a fine job with this story. As I mentioned before it's virtually the same story as Citizen X(1995) insofar as the fact based serial killing goes as well as the political and law enforcement system is depicted. But in this 2015 version we are offered more background on the principal characters and instead of the solitary Lt. Viktor Burakov played by Stephen Rea and his wife played by Imelda Staunton we have Leo and Raisa played by Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace, the later figuring much more as the 2015 version gives us a sub-story right there and one that helps the ending tremendously. The counter to Donald Sutherland's Col. Mikhail Fetisov would be Gary Oldman's character if I can stretch the comparisons.<br/><br/>Child 44 simply has more characters and all have dark personalities. Tragedies don't have levity, there's not one bit of it in Child 44. I loved the cast, a virtual who's who of dramatic performers. Even the musical score sounded tragic in just the right measure. In order for this story to deliver, the pace is generally slow, slow works better because there's much to absorb from the characters and what ties them together; thus slow works best. <br/><br/>The movie is not a political condemnation of the system; history has taken care of that well enough thank you very much. The struggle to bring to light what the system tried so hard to burry could be told just as well in other countries and systems during that period, but the serial killing is one in particular so the Stalin era is a good choice, but that's just my opinion. The opening line 'There's no murder in Paradise' is something between irony and sarcasm but dramatically gets us off in a judgemental mode, one hard to leave. I think this was deliberate but I could be wrong.<br/><br/>I am a big Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace fan so my review can't be expected to be entirely objective. A Ridley Scott production also carries some positive weight for me. There are fine, I say fine supporting actors in this movie as well. I was not disappointed in the least. If you usually enjoy the genre you will undoubtedly like this film."

","The user ""mattrose"" obviously did not see the movie ""Citizen X"" and hence does not know that this ""Child 44"" is a horrible remake which I overrated it at a 5.<br/><br/>This movie may have been based upon a book, but the whole plot most of the time was very confusing and leaves one guessing at what the whole story is about until about the last 30 minutes or so. The Soviet system during the time of Stalin was a lot of back stabbing in order for one to gain favor and move up in the ranks.<br/><br/>The real truth of this movie is that it is actually a horrid remake of the 1995 movie ""Citizen X"" which was about a search for one of Russia's most prolific serial killers; Andrei Chikatilo. In April 1992 Chikatilo confessed to a total of 56 murders from 1978 to 1990 and in October 1992 was convicted and sentenced to death for 52 murders, then In February 1994 he was executed.<br/><br/>The clues that led me to the fact that this movie was a remake, was the mention of the town of Rostov and that most of murders occurred near two railway lines which where most of the murders actually did occur! If you haven't seen ""Citizen X"", I highly recommend it! It stars Donald Sutherland, Stephen Rea, Max Von Sydow, Joss Ackland, and Jeffrey DeMunn (as the killer); and all of their performances were just superb!

At the end I was confused, didn't know how to connect the events into the plot. At first seemed we search for a murders done by Soviet system, then ups!-it's not, there is somebody, a single killer, but seems protected by government (why?who knows!), then we have some stupid short story about drugged nazidivisions which are inserted into the Soviet-system to revenge their defeat in war. At the end- No,again! It is all about a sick ex-soviet officer from the WW2 who is crying at the end end being shot just 2 minutes after showing up in the movie.

Performances were good overall, but nowhere were they brilliant. And the story for me was very muddled, but I guess that's also to do with the period in Russia in which this film plays out. For me the heart of the story, the childmurderer case, felt rushed (despite of the 2 hours+ running time) because of the slow and really slightly tedious first part of the movie.<br/><br/>I've seen ""Citizen X"" more than a couple of times and Stephen Rea's performance brings a tear to my eye again and again, not to mention the maybe even more emotional wonderfully understated role by Max von Sydow.

","Child 44 is a retelling of the story of the serial murders of Andrei Chikatilo. The cast is very much A-level (and the reason I saw this flick) with Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, Gary Oldman, Vincent Cassel and Charles Dance. But none of this matters much coz the movie is slow, drags on, has sideplots that make the story less streamlined and more convoluted. There are scenes that are meant to build the characters but only slow down the pace to a grinding halt and feel like they serve no essential purpose. There is almost no build of tension and it feels aimless. It's just crawls on for 137 mins till it reaches the end which feels very trivial and anticlimactic. So I'm not recommending this flick. I do recommend you check out 'Citizen X', a 1995 TV movie with Donald Sutherland and Stephen Rea which is about the same murders but done SO much better. The acting alone is just exquisite."

Leo could find nothing to implicate her. Leo is also currently investigating child murders, but his superiors don't buy homicide because ""there is no murder in Paradise"" and label everything as accidents. Leo and Raisa are exiled to an out-of-the-way military base under General Nesterov (Oldman) who has no love for Leo. <br/><br/>This is kind of complicated, but if you keep in mind that Leo needs to complete the child killings, catch the serial killer and hopefully get reinstated, you'll be fine. There are a lot of sub plots to distract you. In time, he gets the help from General Nesterov when Raisa tells the General's wife that the same killings could happen to her two boys who walk to school every day through the woods. <br/><br/>Everyone in here has Russian accents and they are fine, and there are no sub-titles. (that's a break)<br/><br/>The other thing you might keep in mind is there is a love story between Leo and Raisa. Leo is fully committed, Raisa not so much. (here we go) You will enjoy the banter between them as they try to work things out. Okay as Leo tries to work things out. Some scenes are pure gold. Good chemistry between them. <br/><br/>The movie gets to be good when Leo and Raisa work together and this is where the movie really starts.

""It's not the book"" is almost an unfair criticism. But this movie didn't just take liberties with the story, it rewrote the damn thing. Almost like the scriptwriters overheard a broken conversation between two drunks talking about the book on an airplane flight, scribbled down some notes and pitched it to some money guy in Hollywood and bingo! got themselves a movie and a good bit of change too!. <br/><br/>The second problem is the totally unsatisfying ending where the perp is I.D. and caught. Whoever the person was who thought of this ending should be banned from film forever. Don't assume the movie has a plot with a resolution, just watch it for the overall tone. Otherwise you'll be disappointed. The ending was abrupt, cartoonish, out of the logical sequence of events and obviously glued on because, well, why not? Deadline, y'know. Gotta meet that deadline. <br/><br/>Still, with all of its flaws, taken in chunks that don't necessarily have to hang together at the end of the film (they don't) its a fascinating movie.

","This film is ""propaganda"", it does not serve anti-Russian or pro- Russian propaganda it describes propaganda itself, it describes how propaganda works on the people- how it affects society..I love that somebody decided do to give that much money to fund an movie that stands for art rather than box-office. <br/><br/>This movie is not about Russia it is not about criminals it is not about regime, it is not about history..it is about society, about people, about now. This film is about what society is and what makes it run. The latter is projected all over the place. The plot and the quasi-historical events are just a tool- a cover for the magic of the seventh art. If you abstract yourself from the names of the actors, from the prejudices. If you watch the movie not simply rate it, you will experience the art not simply consume it.<br/><br/>The society(the paradise) is developed really well here, people that read the books point out the the movie is a pale adaptation on them, because it lacks the in-depth development of the characters, but the movie is not about the characters it is about what ties them together, about the pressure that builds up the bonds- and this is how you describe society. This bond is described in most environments- the army, the police, the family, the friend circle, and the neighborhood. All those environments are put under pressure- the pressure resulting from the ""paradise"" itself. In the opening scenes you are shown that you can't have stolen watches on the photo with the flag, but everybody knows about that even though the truth gets twisted over time. Later in the movie this is shown and that is where the regime metaphor and the cold-war-mentality break apart for me...there are no crimes in paradise, but paradise is never about truth. Paradise is what ones tricks him/herself believing in, denying the truth about the surrounding, because you know if I live in the paradise everything else must be bad, right?<br/><br/>I can write a lot more for this movie, I watched it yesterday, and it took me some time to realize the depth, the scale, the complexity and the beauty of it. There are no heroes, there are no villains, there are different people, some of them abuse the ""paradise"", some of them threaten it, some of them simply need it, and some protect it. There is always a bond however, there is always the weak that is driven by the fear of staying behind, thus abusing that bond and the strong that is driven by the responsibility that comes with the understanding of the bond. It is interesting how the bad and the good gets diffused in multiple characters- both the killer and the coward officer are driven by their weakness, the main character and the police chief are driven by their strength, their responsibility. I actually made involuntary relation between the main character and an Italian mobster.<br/><br/>The movie is so deep so complex, so real as a society can be. It is art and again you do not consume it, you do experience it. So to all that haven't watched it- do it, experience it. I believe it was never meant to be experienced on a big screen, but at home..for me it is too intimate- it explores truths that are being suppressed by society itself, turned into propaganda, a fictional paradise at the cost of the others. The characters are showing so much control over themselves but at the same time there are so many feelings, so strong bonds between them. It all feels so down to earth, so up to the questions forwarded to the viewer instead of a flashy marketing trick. <br/><br/>It is a rare bird nowadays when the movies are more a consumer product than art. Unlike a product that is flashy, loud and entertaining, a product that lasts for half an hour, this movie starts happening after you watch it, it develops in you, within the surrounding. The last 15 minutes that are crucial for the impression one gets from any movie, are not encoded in the movie itself, they are passed on to the viewer. Those same lasting 15 minutes are replaces with simple questions. Those questions are not new, we are experiencing forms of those in our everyday life reading/commenting on topics like government surveillance, leaked secret document, political and geopolitical conflicts etc. Questions that this piece of art boils down to the existence of/in a paradise- I am living in one? Is it real? What is the cost of it? Who pays that cost? Who forces them to pay?"

Also if an officer would execute some like that he should of been extremely well connected with someone very high ranked the communist party to stay alive or keep his job. For sure, he would be send away for a while until everyone ""forgets"" the incident. The military and police ranks are a complete mess in this movie. 1) No way someone carries an army sergeant rank in 1945 (Tom Hardy, Joel Kinnaman, Fares Fares) becomes an MGB captain (Tom Hardy) or lieutenant (Joel Kinnaman, Fares Fares) within 8 years. 2) Gary Oldman carries a colonel rank on his shoulder straps, but everyone address to him as a general, this is especially wrong because there was no general rank in USSR police force until October 23, 1974.

Set design was great. At running time 2 h 6 min this movie drags a bit here and there but i was involved into story from start till finish. I liked the very realistic approach to Stalin era Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Child 44"" has big story, which sometimes felt like to big for one movie.

","Not sure how accurate some of the things are (this is based on a novel which is based on real events) we get to see in this movie. But you could believe that some of the things would have been possible to happen. It's no wonder that Russia was not really happy about the book of course (not the best depiction of authority or anything else going on there). Haven't looked up how the movie was received, but I can't imagine they welcomed it with open arms.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy is as straight an arrow as you can get in this one, but he gets major support by Noomi and Gary to name but two. The incidents occurring that the movie is about apart from the human side of it, are despicable, not that anyone was actually confirming them.

","There was an interesting story here about a hunt for a grotesque child killer. Too often the main plot goes off the rails and is more to do with an unhinged subordinate with a grudge.<br/><br/>Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy) is orphan turned war hero. Now in the early 1950s he is a high flying secret service officer in Stalin's Soviet Union. A state where murder does not exist in paradise. Murder is a capitalist disease. When they come across a murder it tends to be reclassified as an unfortunate accident.<br/><br/>Leo comes across the death of a child near a train line. His father is a fellow friend and comrade. The father believes it was murder but Leo persuades him to forget about it.<br/><br/>However deranged underling Vasili (Joel Kinnaman) has nefarious plans for Leo because Leo challenged him when he killed two people for harbouring a fugitive. He also has desires for Leo's wife Raisa (Noomi Rapace) who is accused of unpatriotic activities and Leo fails to denounce her.<br/><br/>Leo is demoted and exiled to the remote town of Volsk. Leo works under General Mikhail Nesterov (Gary Oldman) who is at first suspicious of Leo, especially when a child's body is discovered along the rail line. However both reluctantly team up when they discover there have been a spate of similar killings over the years.<br/><br/>There are several plot strands that compete for attention and the film never properly gels. In fact it is a dour stodgy mess that neglects the important part of the movie so it can have a go at the nightmare of Stalinism."

What hope for justice in this environment where justice is whatever 'the authorities' want it to be? The real monsters are everywhere, have free reign and are unpunished whilst the innocents suffer repression. This fine film might chill the heart of anyone purporting to romanticise life under socialism.<br/><br/>This tale is also a chilling glimpse of a dystopian future.

The script is precise and the main character has the gravitas, integrity and virtue that a viewer can admire in a hero. <br/><br/>I thought this movie was a thousand times better than the ridiculous Dunkirk supposedly depicting war and madness.

"Ed-Shullivan","7","1","2","4 April 2016"," I love a good ending and was rewarded for staying with this film
","It is progressively rarer to have Hollywood films storyline take place in a foreign countries war time era in the first half of the 20th century. Child 44 is one of those exceptions which combined the Stalin era of fear and propaganda (Example: The Soviet Union has no murderers and no homosexuals) in a totalitarian state with a purported child serial killer on the loose. Unless you have a fondness for reading up on your history of the World War 1 & 2 era, the first 30 minutes of this film may not relate with the audience as it depicts how millions of people were being starved to death and if they were lucky to live, they would be terrorized by the Russian militia. <br/><br/>Child 44 stars Tom Hardy as Leo Demidov a security officer whose job it is to weed out protesters and anti Joseph Stalin revolutionaries. Leo recently married the beautiful Raisa (played by Noomi Rapace) who early in the film explains to Leo that she married her security officer husband out of fear and not because she loved him. I think the film's director Daniel Espinosa could have created a more personal film for his audience if he had effectively explained why Raisa feared for her life and so she chose to marry Leo just to survive thinking she had no choice in the marriage to a Russian security officer. As the movie progresses we see that Leo is not the hard ass he appears to be, and his love for Raisa is beyond reproach. <br/><br/>As in any military regime there are men with egos, and who aspire to greater military roles. The scumbag who holds down this role is actor Joel Kinnaman who plays Vasili who continually tries to undermine his commander Leo by engaging in acts of terror against the people which include cold blooded murder and executions by military shootings against a compound wall which is plastered with bullet holes and his selected victims blood splatters. Vasili also has eyes on destroying Leo by taking away his job in the military as well as convincing his wife Raisa to leave Leo and come live with him. Through time Raisa finds out just what type of man she has married. Leo is a man who is very tough, persistent, focused on finding a child serial killer which his government emphatically denies even exists. Leo is also a man who truly loves his wife Raisa and would rather lose her by allowing her to make her own decision to stay with him or leave him without any repercussions. Two other good performances are presented by Gary Oldman playing General Mikhail Nesterov who Leo is assigned to report to in the slum town of Rostov as part of his banishment for pursuing a serial killer. <br/><br/>The other good performance is that of Paddy Considine who plays the sly child sexual predator named Vladimir Malevich who picks up children at various train stations by offering them food and candy. Loosely based on the real life Soviet child serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. Chikatilo was born in 1936, who himself experienced between 1941 and 1944, witnessed some of the effects of the Nazi occupation of Ukraine. Chikatilo was a constant child bed wetter living in fear as a child of wartime strife and in his latter adult years was responsible for at least 52 children's murders which took place between 1978 and 1990. <br/><br/>Child 44 focuses on the relationship between Russian military officer Leo Demidov and his wife Raisa, and how the slimy military officer Vasili uses his painful interrogation tactics to lie about his superiors (Leo Demidov) knowledge of his wife's involvement in the anti Stalins sentiments. <br/><br/>The downside to the film for me was the difficulty of the Russian dialect for Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman in particular to achieve, and the use of a sub par grainy brownish colorization utilized by director Daniel Espinosa to influence the film being in the World War II era. I think the film editing should have been able to enhance the films end product with both the dialogue and cinematography but overall the film was both painful to watch due to the real suffering a world war is responsible for, as well as for a wonderful ending which I don't want to spoil for any potential first time film viewers. The excellent performances by both Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace will continue to keep them in good stead with their followers. I give Child 44 a sound 7 out of 10 rating. Child 44 will be on my ""TO PURCHASE"" list."

","I sincerely doubt that the author of original Child 44 novel, Tom Rob Smith, had a chance to read the script for this movie, as this movie adaptation of the plot is just beyond the definition of bad. <br/><br/>Not only the movie has very little resemblance to the novel itself, it actually seems that the script writers have zero understanding of the Soviet history, upon which the events unravel. <br/><br/>All events in the movie are not coherent, the motivation of characters is the mystery, and the thriller part gets lost in a seriously dubious attempt to portray the ugliness of ""the Soviet Russia"". And what did they do to Tom Hardy, why every sentence he says sounds like he's seriously drunk. Is that supposed to mean ""Russian accent""? So Russian language sounds like English, but after drinking half bottle of vodka? <br/><br/>This movie is just so very bad, it's not even worth a review. The movie which was supposed to be about the mystery, is a mystery in itself - the mystery of how some good actors, including Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman, agreed to be in it. However, just to warn others, I must warn ya: better read the book, it's really good and don't waste time watching this movie. It really has nothing to do with the book, apart from the name itself."

"ginocox-206-336968","7","2","7","25 July 2015"," More of a docudrama about Soviet history than a detective story
","""Child 44"" is a highly fictionalized account of the investigation into the murders by Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. The actual crimes occurred 1978 and 1990, during Brezhnev's rule. The award-winning book recasts the events into Stalin's Russia, but the movie is set in the early years of Khrushchev's rule. <br/><br/>The only reason to change the time period seems to be to make heavy-handed statements about Communist rule in Russia, which was dreary, depressing, arbitrary, paranoid, brutal, unfair and generally not much fun. But it begs the question of why change the time frame to Khrushchev's era, which reportedly wasn't nearly as bad as Stalin's. <br/><br/>HBO produced an excellent film about the case called ""Citizen X,"" starring Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland, which depicted the actual events fairly accurately, as described in a detailed Wikipedia article. There was a very active investigation between 1984 and Chikatilo 's arrest in 1990. He was tried, convicted and executed. The trial was a media circus. While the investigation was hindered by some party hacks, there was a major effort to find the killer. <br/><br/>The movie asks the question, what might have happened if a serial killer like Chikatilo had operated during post-war communist rule and the authorities refused to acknowledge the possibility that a serial killer could operate in their workers' paradise. Rather than focusing on the investigation or the crimes, it concentrates on the extreme measures the bureaucrats might have taken to avoid challenging the party line. <br/><br/>Along the way, it throws in war orphans, persecution of homosexuals, economic deprivation, the Communist Party's prioritization of children's education, sexual harassment by party members, professional rivalries, and other social issues. It also devotes considerable attention to the protagonist's background and his relationship with his wife and suggests it is impossible to be loyal to ones wife and family and also have unequivocal loyalty to the party. <br/><br/>His wife improbably becomes his sidekick in an unsanctioned, independent investigation and, as all Hollywood sidekicks must rescue the protagonist at some point, she participates in a donnybrook. <br/><br/>Chikatilo's victims were about 60% females and 80% children. His early victims were predominately girls, while his later victims were mostly boys. Vladimir Malevich, the movie's villain is given surgical training and removes organs from his victims, who are all male children. There is a very strange scene where the villain does to himself what he does to his victims, which detracts from the heinous nature of his crimes. They can't be that bad if he undergoes the same treatment and survives. <br/><br/>People are dragged from their beds in the middle of the night by state security forces, there are executions, mock executions, extrajudicial executions and summary executions, banishments to remote districts, train rides, travelling baggage class, endless betrayals, duplicity and much more. In true Russian cinematic tradition, the first cut of the movie was reportedly five and a half hours long. <br/><br/>The result is a stark condemnation of communist rule, but a muddled detective story. As a docudrama about life and politics in Soviet Russia, the story is meticulously detailed and offers fascinating visuals and performances for any student of Russian history. As a detective story, it is less than compelling and uneasily segues into an unlikely action story before wrapping with an implausible Hollywood ending that seems to have leapt forward in time to Brezhnev's policies of glasnost. <br/><br/>The movie bears the title of the book, which is misleading. Perhaps a fifth of the movie deals with the actual crimes, the victims and the investigation. The movie is really about the need for unquestioning loyalty in a totalitarian system. <br/><br/>The cinematography is wonderfully dreary and depressing. The costumes and largely Czech settings are more than adequate. As usual, Tom Hardy delivers a very intense performance."

","IT'S NOT THE BOOK people !! It's not the book ?!!<br/><br/>I won't put any spoilers here folks, but I just have one thing to say. Read the book first.<br/><br/>The movie is excellent, very enjoyable overall with incredible performances BUT IT'S NOT THE BOOk ! And by this I mean I still cannot believe they took out the greatest thing about the story ! The bit in the book that was like a punch in the stomach when we find the truth about the child 44 killer ! The best twist in the story is totally absent from this screenplay and this means that the psychopath in the movie version has no motive at all to do what he does. His reasons are presented in such a generic manner at the end that it almost destroys the entire movie and makes the killer character feel totally like a character that does not belong to this story after all. After the spectators spend two hours glued to all that is happening in the story at the end , the killer bit is totally irrelevant to the story !!<br/><br/>Contrary to what happens in the book, where the killer is very well rooted in all the plot which connects the characters in unique ways. Not on the movie ! What ?! Why ?! Who thought that taking out the best twist in the book which is actually what gives meaning to the original story, a good idea ?!<br/><br/>Why bother buying the rights to a book with such a great story and then remove all that was supposed to be the central twist of the mystery out of the screenplay ?! Somebody explain this to me because I'm absolutely puzzled here !<br/><br/>So yet again people. READ THE BOOk FIRST ! Trust me , it won't ruin the movie for you because the writers in the movie took out the most important bits which are fundamental to the plot in the original story. The book also goes much in-depth into the characters past, even the secondary characters have a life of their own and everything feels like a thriller version of The Shadow of the Wind , if you know and loved the type of characters in that book, you'll find the same feel when you read the original Child 44 novel which is brilliant.<br/><br/>The book is not the novel in so many aspects that it hurts. I got suspicious right at the start when I noticed that the structure didn't seemed to follow the most important bits in the novel and that really made me wonder what would happen after that regarding the characters. For example in the movie Vassilli is almost a cardboard villain, while in the novel the reader even has some empathy with him at many points of the story. And the killer is even a much deeper character than we see it in the movie. I need to shut up so I wont spoil a great book. Read the book first. The book has lots of parallel stories that are totally absent from the movie and which there's no reason for them not to be included.<br/><br/>The movie , on its own is actually very good, some of the best scenes from the more dramatic bits in the novel are there, but even on this the movie downplays and simplifies everything. Nervetheless it's a very entertaining movie, with a great cast and brilliant acting and lots of atmosphere. It feels a bit fragmented sometimes but that is because of what gave some of the characters a soul was mysteriously removed from the screenplay.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest mystery in the Child 44 movie version is why they did almost everything right except leaving out the great twist on the book regarding the killer mystery.<br/><br/>But i need to give it a 8 out of 10 nevertheless because it's a great drama set on Russia and even from an historical point of view deserves to be seen.<br/><br/>Just...read the book first.

","""Child 44"" is a different kind of movie that takes place in the 1950's, (1930's in early flashbacks) & in USSR, among the communism & reign of The famous brutal Dictator, Stalin.<br/><br/>As Stalin says ""There are no murderers in Paradise ,"" and in a communist society - if you even mention it - you die. Hardy, a high-ranking Russian officer is given a decision among claims that his wife is a traitor ( played by Noomi Rapace, who has been a personal favorite of mine since 2011's 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.')<br/><br/>It's different but I really loved it; it's a mystery and a period piece of a time when any mention against Stalin's beliefs or even accusation of being a traitor gets you killed. I really like this take on the 'other side' of Russia, which teaches the brutal history of the USSR & times.<br/><br/>This movie flew under the radar and had harsh reviews from so-called professional 'critics,' but it seems many movies they look down upon are ones that become my favorite. I was sick when I began watching this & didn't think I could watch much of anything that night. However, this film drew me in immediately; I was hooked for the entire time (a very nice surprise and a rarity.)<br/><br/>It's based on the 'top selling' book in 2008 that won numerous awards & rated much more favorably than this film. Yet, I can't figure out why. I know, despite the critics who gave it negative ratings, there's been many who've countered with positive reviews of their own. I decided the same but it's far from the only reason. <br/><br/>I TRULY enjoyed the performance of every actor in this film. While Hardy continues to stand out, Noomi Rapace is just as impressive (if not more,) as they take on this case of murdered children in an 'Us-vs-the-world' mentality. Gary Oldman also delivers a solid performance, as usual. Yet it really is the 'on-screen' relationship & energy between Hardy and Rapace that leaves a great, lasting impression.<br/><br/>If you're Tom Hardy fan - it's definitely worth seeing. Even if you're not - if you enjoy mystery, period movies, crime/drama, history, action etc. - you'll love 'Child 44.' For all of those reasons - as well as a great deal more (that would give away spoilers) - I gave it a 10."

"rjwilton","3","1","3","30 July 2017"," Thriller plot forgets thrills and plot
","What a bizarrely dull waste. The successful Child 44 book had three or four things going for it: a stunningly atmospheric opening in a winter of starvation (here rushed over and its relevance weakened), a big reveal (cut), the evolving relationship between Demidov and his wife as they first realize the emptiness of what they thought they had and then build anew (next to Noomi Rapace's pained wisdom Tom Hardy's Leo is a nice picture of inarticulate bewildered loyalty, war hero as premiership footballer out of his depth, but it doesn't go anywhere) and a reasonable cat-and-mouse/chase plot. Trying to squeeze in most of the narrative of the book, but still dropping a couple of significant facts and incidents, the film manages somehow to be both too long and too rushed. The Demidovs hurry back and forth across Russia having unpleasant train incidents, the commuter experience from hell, and then the mystery gets addressed in a couple of brisk and largely unrelated bits of business at the end. Espinosa worthily films most of the book, but loses its sense and its drama. Child 44 has some vivid styling and performances (largely for decoration – Cassel is intimidating because he's Cassel, nothing more; Oldman has to resort to maximum shouting-and-spitting to get any drama into his scenes; Dance, as so often, is paraded as a token of film gravity), but it's otherwise as empty and lifeless as its Siberian wilderness.<br/><br/>The Script Hack (https://thescripthack.wordpress.com/): if we're skipping the plot relevance of the starvation opening, we can skip the whole scene; if we're dropping the key bits of information gained from the mid-story return to Moscow, we can drop that whole sequence; and we could trim some of the secondary scenes (the last, for example, nicely true to the book, could be 30 seconds instead of five minutes). That would create much more time and space to pace and build the mystery and anticipation and drama of the hunt, and the relationships at its heart, and still leave a tighter more powerful film."
"winopaul","Null","1","3","17 April 2017"," Fractally inept
","This movie was fractally inept, from the smallest detail to the biggest concept. The script and director must think its an accomplishment to keep the audience confused. No, confusion is the natural human condition. What is rare is clarity. I despised this movie from the beginning, when it was obvious that they used the Law and Order: Criminal Intent opening. This is where you string as many completely unrelated vignettes together because you are too incompetent to tell a story. Lets torture the audience, like some teen-tease. I remember checking the progress bar at 18 minutes, thinking that at least the movie had begun. I was wrong, it was more like three movies.<br/><br/>While USSR was no paradise in 1953, I have to believe the portrait painted by the book author of total repression represented his homosexual orientation. Yeah, USSR was probably pretty repressive if you were gay. That is wrong and bad, but don't portray every aspect of society as that repressive to everyone from farmers to MGB officers. As the Russian commentator noted here, even by 1953 the USSR was getting less totalitarian. Stalin died in 1953.<br/><br/>The movie was like a dramatization of Truman Capote's In Cold Blood but mixed in with portraits of Waco, Ruby Ridge, the McCarthy hearings, and the Mi Lai massacre. Its as if the movie cherry-picked every horror and excess of the USSR and then painted it as everyday life.<br/><br/>Confusion. Boy oh boy will you be confused. There is a reviewers here that thinks Gary Oldman was the father that adopted Tom Hardy. Another does not think the assassinated farmers were hiding the political prisoner. I have never watched a movie where the editing was so inept that I would be expecting the resolution of some vignette, and pop, I was in a completely different place with different characters maybe at a different place in the timeline. This may have been because the self-indulgent director shot a 4-hour movie and the editor had to smoosh it into a still-too-long 2 hours and 17 minutes.<br/><br/>And the director delights in confusion. Hey, lets have the big mano-a-mano climax be mud wrestling where we can't tell anybody apart. And lets use a lot of Jason Bourne shaky-cam so it is really impossible to know what is going on. Its just the feelings we convey, to show all the characters are confused too. Watch the director commentary of Amadeus where Milos Forman agonizes if his opening scene is clear enough for the audience to know what is going on.<br/><br/>In addition to the incompetent editing and script and direction, the fake accents do grate a little. Otherwise the actors were A-list, as you would expect. That fakeness was not helped by wild implausibility. Even in 1953 USSR, heck, especially in 1953 USSR, does anyone really think a mid-level MGB officer can shoot a subordinate in the back, in his office no-less? I know the book author hated the USSR, but do we really believe that the law enforcement apparatus would suppress murders because its the hallmark of an ""imperfect society? Read the Wikipedia entry on Andrei Chikatilo, the real serial killer this movie appropriates. The Russians had 15 prosecutors and 29 detectives on the case. The investigation did implicate innocent people, but that happens in the US every single day. The investigation also solved 1000 unrelated crimes, including rapes and murders. Sure, you could say that was in 1985 USSR, but its not like the 1950s could have been that much different in the attitude towards crime.<br/><br/>Another major implausibility is the relationship to the wife. She loves you, she hates you, she cons you, she betrays you, she stands by you. Its like being married to the Magic 8-Ball. You never know what's going to turn up. Sorry, not based on any reality I have ever seen. Sneaky snarky scumbags stay that way. Oh, and back to confusion, how about when Hardy shows up at some parent's apartment. I thought they were her parents, since, ta da, he was an orphan. But no, the Amazing Kreskin tapped us on the forehead and with no warning or foreshadowing, we are expected to know they are his adoptive parents.<br/><br/>The main conflict here is really office politics. Spy agencies are full of passive-aggressives. they don't go around shooting each other or defenseless Kulaks at the drop of a hat.<br/><br/>Sadly there is no way to fix this mess. Its what economists call a dead-weight loss. You could give the book to the Russians that made Stalingrad (1990), and even they could not coax a good believable story out of this.<br/><br/>OK, who can resist? First, when writing about a mass murderer and serial killer, lets make the main conflict being with him (or her if you want an Oscar). Sure keep it in 1953 USSR, but factually show the hope for the future and changes as Stalin dies. Rather than some goofy spy agency fallen angel, lets have it be a prosecutor, like actually happened in real-life. Lets have Hardy be glad that the totalitarian state is in decline, but the only way he gets closer to solving the crime is by going all Andy Sipowicz NYPD Blue on the suspects. This will let us wonder why humans always resort to violence and repression to get what we really really want.<br/><br/>A nice art-house film disguised as a police procedural. The society gets less repressive as the hero gets more repressive. The crazy killer goes down, so how do we really feel about that? Easy 85 million domestic gross, with great foreign box office. There will always be the action figures and product placements to make this a real home run. People that read the book will be appalled, but there are so few of them, it really does not matter."

","""I would rather spend a lifetime in a sh*t-hole like this with you, than spend one minute in Moscow without you.""<br/><br/>First let me clarify something. I'm not an anti-communist or supporter of anti-Russian propaganda. Neither am I an anti-capitalist or against the other superpower on the other side of the planet. I'm a tiny little person who leads a modest life in probably one of the smallest countries in the world. To label this film as propaganda against the USSR, sounds to me in the present world situation quite exaggerated. Who the hell would benefit from that? Isn't this movie trying to visualize the circumstances in which ordinary people had to live and survive in the post-war period? I can't tell if the shown images are truthful or not. But I'm glad I'm not living in such harsh conditions these days.<br/><br/>What a depressing and frightening regime this must have been with repression and blind obedience as main values. Turning in others as a resort. Those who are your blood brothers today, could become your worst enemies the next day. Regardless of your status or rank. Before you know it, you're deported to the farthest corner of Mother Russia to do some filthy work in deplorable conditions. Downgraded to a meaningless and insignificant person. And that's the strong point of this film. The portrait of a society under control of a police institution, in this case the Russian State Security (MGB, forerunner of the KGB) in a post-war, post-Stalin regime. The MGB was the security apparatus of the USSR that made sure that loyalty to the communist regime, remained intact. Dissidents, anti-communist and political opponents (and annoying individuals) were carefully chased down and removed. The MGB wasn't perhaps as violent as the NKVD, but they weren't choirboys either, I guess.<br/><br/>""Child 44"" is grayish, dirty and confrontational. The misery, the poverty, the paranoia, the hopelessness and the ruthless repression are portrayed in an impressive way. It's certainly not a film that makes you happy. Unfortunately the main topic (a topic the whole movie actually revolves around) was pushed a bit into the background. The serial killer theme is rather poorly developed. The only interesting thing was the way they dealt with these crimes. The existence of a serial killer was unthinkable (""There's no murder in paradise""). Only a capitalist regime can produce a killer. That's what the Soviet doctrine claims. The actual murders are scanty visualized. The final denouement and unmasking was a bit too simple. So don't expect a ""Silence of the Lambs Made in Russia"", but a kind of docu-drama about this chilly Russia.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, there's really nothing to wrong, though most characters were stereotypical portrayed. Many will criticize the use of a fake Russian accent. Perhaps it's for some very annoying, but personally I thought this contributed to the overall atmosphere of the film. A Russian speaking perfect English would be unnatural to me. And it would make me really nervous if all conversations would be held purely in Russian. Tom Hardy plays an outstanding role as the war hero Leo Demidov who slowly but surely sees his status breaking down. Noomi Rapace (I thought she was magnificent as Lisbeth Salander in ""Män som hatar kvinnor"") stands her ground as the embittered wife of Leo. And Joel ""Run all night"" Kinnaman wasn't so bad as the vengeful Vasili (a coward who becomes threatening due to his acquired dominant position). Maybe it's because I haven't read the book this film is based on, since I thought this was an excellent film. But there's this golden rule when it's about book adaptations. In most cases they disappoint. Da?<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
"jacob2i","6","1","3","12 February 2016"," Good story, good acting, not a great movie however
","First off, if you want to see a movie about the actual story Child 44 is extremely loosely based on, see Citizen X. That movie is far more graphic in the detail it shows of the murdered children and follows the story and timeline of the actual events.<br/><br/>Child 44 actually at times seems to forget that at essence it was supposed to be about a sick serial murderer in the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>What this movie did very well was show the fear and moral bankruptcy in the communist regime in the Soviet Union. I think for that reason, everyone should consider watching this movie. Liberals and feminists probably will not like such a raw display of what life would be like if they were given free reign to destroy traditional American values and replace with theirs.<br/><br/>That said, the ending is just ridiculous, really detracted from what could have been a strong movie. <br/><br/>Spoiler - Don't read this part if you don't want the movie spoiled!<br/><br/>So at the end of the movie, the literally just had this horrific monster get shot in the middle of a personal dispute between to rivals in a clandestine secret police force who now wanted to kill each other.<br/><br/>That left the audience disappointed, to say the least. We wanted to see this guy tried and then executed for his crimes.<br/><br/>Finally, I don't believe this movie knew exactly what story it was trying to tell. Was it a story of a frustrated secret cop who struggled with what he was regularly forced to do? Was it a story of a terrible series of crimes and the effects on those who weren't allowed to investigate it?<br/><br/>Was it a story of a man and a woman who come to understand each other and salvage real love where there was no love before?<br/><br/>Sadly, this movie does do a great job in any of these areas."
"MLDinTN","6","1","3","5 January 2016"," story should have been written better
","The biggest distraction in this movie is that it is set in Russia, yet everyone speaks English. It just takes away from the storyline because these are supposed to be Russians. Any way, Leo whom was an orphan turned war hero turned military policeman is given a case of someone he knows. This man's son has been murdered; however, he must declare it an accident because Stalling says there can't be murder in paradise. He does some digging and finds other boys that have been killed in a similar manner. but his wife is named as a traitor so they are sent to ""Siberia or some such place."" Leo continues to look into the murders and narrows down where the killer may live and work and soon he's solved the mystery and survived the political gauntlet.<br/><br/>The ending is OK with everything solved and it was a pretty good mystery.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: The story was OK but having everyone speak English just made it seem out of place. I recommend it if you can catch if for free on cable."
"t-mestdag","7","1","3","28 August 2015"," Soviet Union and Cold War Made Interesting
","This is what this movie did for me, it made a subject which had never caught my eye before and through a more than common one(a serial killer) made it interesting, not to mention the stellar cast, especially Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace.<br/><br/>I learned to respect what the common people of Russia went through back in those days and this, in my case anyway, was only made possible because of the thriller element in the movie, which is a sort of movie I've always loved.<br/><br/>So, if you've never been particularly interested in what took place in that era in that part of the world, now you have a good 'excuse' to be."
"Badwolf681","7","1","3","15 August 2015"," There are no murders in paradise....
","I remember picking up a copy of Child 44 (the novel) in a local bookstore and after a quick review of the subject on the back, I thought: Seems like a heavy read - but if they ever make it into a movie.... <br/><br/>Well, I guess I should of read the book. <br/><br/>The story has an intriguing premise of hunting a serial killer during the Stalin years of Kafka-esque USSR.<br/><br/>As a film, it doesn't fall flat but it seems like its pulling you in two directions at once. I found that I wanted to see more of the ""killer"" and understand all of his desires/tendencies - I was quite surprised to have his explanation for his actions whittled down to two inane sentences. <br/><br/>It's a good movie. It is not a masterful piece of art in any sense, but you will learn something from it. It is just unfortunate that it leaves you wanting... wanting more information, wanting more connections, wanting more evidence and wanting more detail. <br/><br/>and wanting to read the book."
"fdbjr","7","1","3","9 August 2015"," Well Done
","There are plenty of fair reviews on this movie, some that liked it, some that did not. I liked it, as my rating indicates. <br/><br/>I'm mostly writing to express my disagreement with all those who viewed the movie as a betrayal of the novel. In my view, the novel was just awful - turgid, overwritten, with some action scenes that strained credibility, and a coincidence at the center of the plot that was beyond ridiculous. I detested the erstwhile Soviet Union, and the Stalinist years were hypocritical and vicious beyond Western understanding - but even at that, some of the descriptions of Soviet judicial processes in the book were extended to the border of caricature.<br/><br/>In my view, one of the strengths of the movie was the craftsmanship of the screenwriter in transforming the mess of the novel into a workable two hour screenplay. The alterations in the plot were all to the good. The only concession to reality was the demonization of one of the villains. All in all, it became a pretty good melodrama, which did not unduly strain credibility, and to which the British cast (Tom Hardy in particular) gave the usual good service."
"julesfdelorme","9","1","4","9 March 2017"," Almost perfect...
","Let me begin with a confession: As far as I know I am heterosexual, but I have a very non-heterosexual fixation on Tom Hardy. And Idris Elba. And Carey Price. And Benedict Cumberbatch... But most of all, on Tom Hardy, particularly of late. Since I first discovered him... (That's right, I discovered him. At least that's how it works in my mind...) In the film Warrior, which I and a few friends only went to see as a kind of joke. I mean, none of us was expecting a movie around Mixed Martial Arts to actually be any good, and none of us had ever heard of the two leads, Hardy and Joel Edgerton. (Oh, yeah, him too...) So we were expecting it to be awful in that way that you can sarcastically make fun of for years to come. I have an extensive background in boxing and Mixed Martial Arts, so I was expecting to find that amusing and worthy of ridicule as well. (Since then there has been the brilliant television series, Kingdom and the hilarious Here Comes the Boom, so apparently you can make good things around MMA.) We were all particularly shocked by the intense and powerful performance of Tom Hardy. Of course we all assumed he had to be American and must be an experienced Mixed Martial Artist. I had no idea that I had already seen Hardy in RocknRolla and Inception then. Aside from having quickly become one of the finest actors on the planet, Hardy has an ability to physically disappear into roles in a way that we haven't seen since Gary Oldman's early work. Since then I've seen Hardy carry an entire film just driving in a car and talking on the phone in Locke, make you forget that you're watching the same actor playing twins in Legend, give powerhouse performances in films like The Drop, The Revenant and Bronson, audience thrilling performances in The Dark Knight Rises and Mad Max, Fury Road, and most recently give one of the best performances seen in a television series since James Gandolfini, his co-star in The Drop, in the stunningly good British production, Taboo. Hardy, as an actor is quite simply as good as it gets. So I found myself looking for anything else that Hardy has done which I somehow might have missed. And a friend told me about Child 44, which I had never even heard of. The film itself stretches believability a bit with the murder mystery aspect, asking us to buy into the idea that a Stalin era MGB (forerunner of the KGB) agent becomes obsessed with a child serial killer while his life is being torn to bits by the agency that he once worked for. The latter part has been written about extensively by writers like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. It truly was a kind of inevitability that these ""Blue Hats"" would find themselves the subject of the same brutal paranoia and torture which helped them rise to power. Hardy sells the former aspect brilliantly, but even then, it feels a bit thin at times that a man in such an environment would be able to, let alone could become fixated on solving murders in a world where Stalin himself had declared that murder did not exist, that it was a product of corrupt western capitalism. This is a very small, negligible problem with the film because of its brilliant cast, which includes the aforementioned Gary Oldman, Hardy's co-star from The Drop, Noomi Rapace, and Joel Kinnaman, who was so brilliant in the TV series The Killing, as well as films like Suicide Squad, as the villain (Yeah, okay, he's another one...). There is also a wonderful sub textual underpinning of the paranoia of that time and place and how that can lead to a world where nothing is what you think it is. Hardy's lumbering stoic presence is yet one more remarkable physical transformation. As is almost always the case with Hardy, and with so many great British actors, there is never a moment of self indulgence or sentimentality about his character, which is dead on for this particular character. Rapace, who is no stranger to strange European murder mystery, having risen to wide public acclaim in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, is wonderfully guarded and unreadable as Hardy's perhaps not so willing wife. Kinnaman, also having a background in Swedish film, is disturbingly calloused and unfeeling as Hardy's nemesis. And of course there's Gary Oldman, who, like Hardy, seems incapable of giving anything less than great performances. In this film, we see some vintage almost impossibly textured Gary Oldman moments, though his role is only slightly more than a kind of cameo. The rest of the cast is equally superb and the filmmaking is perfectly dark and brooding. That previously mentioned thin premise is almost entirely overpowered by the strength of the whole and is made only a minor blemish on an otherwise very close to perfect canvas. If you love Tom Hardy, even in a non-heterosexual way, you will definitely love this movie. Not quite as much as you may have loved Taboo, Locke, The Drop or Warrior. But probably as much as you loved Bronson or Legend."
"lesleyharris30","6","1","4","11 October 2015"," A Thriller that's Small on Thrills
","Child 44 is a decent movie with a reasonably developed storyline and a very talented cast. As far as the flaws in this film goes, the performances are the least of their worries, Tom Hardy shines in the lead role, proving his versatility as an actor once again and showing that he is currently one of the best actors in Hollywood, the best scenes are certainly the ones between him and Gary Oldman, as we watch them both shine in a movie that they're both too good for, even the small parts have brilliant casting, with top class actors such as Jason Clarke and Vincent Cassel all delivering brief, well acted cameos. For a thriller, the film is very tight on actual thrills, and it's a shame because the storyline alone made this sound like an ""edge of your seat"" type of movie, but there just aren't any big moments, no parts that shock and terrify its audience and give us a clear sense of the dangerous situation the character is in, the most thrilling moments are the ones that are mentioned, but are never actually shown, and if you're expecting an exciting finale that makes up for the slow moving two hours, don't get your hopes up. The film also seemed to have had a major issue with tone, it was never quite sure where it was going, it had moments that played like a thriller, others like a compelling drama, then some psychological scenes, it was never really sure what genre of film it actually wanted to be, and I think if the film had stuck with being a drama then it could have been much better, the slow moving story arc would have been appreciated more and audiences wouldn't be left disappointed because of it being advertised as a straight up thriller, which it definitely wasn't. For the performances, it's worth the watch, but you shouldn't go out of your way to see it, Child 44 simply isn't worth it. <br/><br/>During the reign of Joseph Stalin, a Russian police officer investigates a series of child murders. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Tom Hardy Worst Performance: Noomi Rapace"

","Wow! Where to begin? I had skipped this movie earlier when it was available for buying but after watching recent performances of Tom Hardy, I thought to give this movie a go and judge it for myself.

It's totally beyond my understanding what could've been the possible reason for this movie to get such a hammering from critics. Everything in the movie was top notch, right from the layered story, the mood of the time in which this takes place, the performances, I mean everything! Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace, the two leads were just perfect. It's disheartening to see why this movie wasn't considered for any awards or a positive genuine review.

"leonblackwood","4","1","5","31 August 2015"," Disappointing! 4/10
","Review: I quite enjoyed this movie, mostly because of Tom Hardy's performance but it does take a long time to get going. It also dragged in parts and the investigation about the murdered children was weak and not that detailed. Anyway, it's about a highly ranked officer (Hardy) in Moscow who is demoted because he won't denounce his wife as a traitor. He then gets sent to a Volsk to join the Militsiya as a low ranked officer alongside general Mikhail Nesterov, played by Gary Oldman, while his wife, who used to be a elementary teacher, cleans in a school. Hardy struggles through a troubled relationship with his wife whilst trying to investigate these dead kids bodies that keep on turning up in random areas. His best friend lost his child to the serial killer so the case is close to his heart but none of the officers want to admit that there is a problem in Moscow so it's hard for him to get any help. He finally convinces Oldman that there is a serial killer on the loose so they get together enough information to track down the brutal killer. There wasn't much depth to the investigation and there wasn't an conclusion to his troubled marriage. He does give her a ultimatum to leave him but I don't know if she stayed with him out of love or the fact that her life was in danger because she was branded a traitor. Although the performances were brilliant from all of the cast, the movie seemed to drag and it seemed like it was going round in circles. There is a sense of intensity throughout the film because they are on the run from officers most of the time but there isn't that much action and I was left feeling empty when the movie had finished. I did like the chemistry between Oldman and Hardy but for a two hour movie, they seemed to crack the case with ease, even though they were the only two people investigating the murders. Judging by the box office takings, it didn't really go down with audiences that well but you can't fault Hardy's performance. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Tom Hardy, 37, has really made a name for himself since his role as Bronson in 2008 but he did star in some top films like Layer Cake,  Black Hawk Down, Star Trek: Nemesis and RocknRolla before that leading role. Since Bronson he has starred in the lead in big movies like Mad Max, which I heard was quite good, Inception, brilliant but bloody confusing, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Lawless, This Means War, Dark Knight Rises and Warrior so he has to be happy with his career so far. He first hit the screens in 2001 in the Band of Brothers series and his 30 movies to date have grossed over a billion dollars worldwide, which isn't bad going for a late bloomer. I personal think that he's going to be one to watch because he doesn't play safe by picking the easy roles and he has proved that he can take on any genre. This movie was directed by Swedish born Daniel Espinosa who also made Safe House with Denzel and Ryan Reynolds but thats about it. He also made an ""unheard of"" movie called Easy Money which starred Joel Kinnaman in the lead but that seemed to have slipped under the radar. Joel Kinnaman also played the villain officer in this movie so that explains why he was picked for that role. He really reminded me of Hayden Christensen for some unknown reason! Anyway, I did have high expectations for this movie because I am a Tom Hardy/Gary Oldman fan but I didn't find the movie that brilliant. Noomi Rapace was a good choice as Hardy's wife but she just had to put up and shut up through most of the movie so you don't get that much input from her. There are a couple of emotional scenes with the couple but there relationship was in turmoil right from the beginning. With all of these elements going on through the film, it should have been much better than it was but I just wasn't that impressed. <br/><br/>Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $3.3million (Terrible!)<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/thrillers about an highly ranked officer in Moscow whose on the hunt for a serial killer who is brutal killing young kids. 4/10"
"MattBirk","4","1","5","25 August 2015"," Wasted Potential
","The main problem with Child 44 is the narrative is split into two stories. On one hand, it's the serial killer mystery (the one the trailer promised) and the other is the Russian government hunting down Tom Hardy's character (the one the trailer kept hidden). The problem being the serial killer storyline is hardly established/relevant to the movie, and the other storyline gets too much attention. From what the trailer gives us about the movie, I expected a tense mystery thriller with a pretty frightening story (a killer running rampant in Russia).<br/><br/>Instead, the movie skimps over this story by basically using it as a backdrop for the other story of Tom Hardy's accent vs Russia. And when we finally come to a close as to who and why the killer does what he does, it makes little to no sense and couldn't be more disappointing. And before you know it that plot point is over and we're back to Tom Hardy dodging the back MGB.<br/><br/>And like I said, the serial killer mystery is second string while the government/spy story is the main force. And that's too bad because this story just isn't at all interesting, especially when you keep waiting for the other story to take over. To put it simply, there was just too much going on for the movie to make it thrilling. The movie is based on a book and like a lot of adaptations, the book didn't translate well to film.<br/><br/>Do not go into this movie expecting it to be anything like the (pretty damn great) trailer, Child 44 is flat out too long and extremely short on thrills. There is almost no tension to speak of (certainly none involving the serial killer storyline). Maybe I went into the movie expecting something different and that could be my fault, but what was put on screen was nothing short of disappointing. It's unfortunate, but this type of story had so much potential and completely falls flat."

It also depicts the horrors of Soviet era; and how people were forced to toe the party line. Even when they knew the truth was something else totally. The fact that the film is banded in Russia says more than required. <br/><br/>Anyways back to the film. Tom Hardy, plays the character to the bone. Rapace is equally good.

"brchthethird","7","1","6","13 September 2015"," ""In a time of universal deceit, speaking the truth is a revolutionary act""
","Directed by Daniel Espinosa (SAFE HOUSE), and starring Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace (among others), CHILD 44 tells the story of one man's effort to bring a serial child murderer to justice in a society where the mere existence of murder is denied. The society in question was Soviet Russia, ca. 1953, and the existence of such evil things was basically unthinkable/untenable in what was ostensibly a ""worker's paradise."" In a general sense, based on the lackluster reception from both audiences and critics, I wasn't expecting too much from this. I didn't too much care for Daniel Espinosa's previous film, SAFE HOUSE, but he does have a gritty style that I appreciate. What interested me more was the incredible cast he assembled for what I thought was going to be a rather simple, if protracted (at 137 minutes), crime procedural. What I got actually spent more time on the human drama, which I didn't mind at all, although more time could have been spent on moving the plot forward in what was a film with a rather languid pace. I also took some issue initially with a non-Russian cast putting on their best Russian accents. Some do better than others (Noomi Rapace, in particular), but for the most part I got used it and it never really bothered me after about 20-30 minutes. What the film does really well is examine Soviet Russian society in the 1950's, with all of the paranoia, backstabbing and low standard of living for the common person. In that respect, the milieu the film portrays and the way in which it is portrayed create an atmosphere that all but chokes out any sense of justice or hope. That's what makes the central characters' journey so compelling, aside from being well-written. You feel for them because the odds are not in their favor, and yet they continue to pursue a goal that puts their lives at risk. Also, in a more general sense the film explores the degree to which people will lie to themselves and others in order to avoid an inconvenient truth. When looked at from this perspective, the quote which opens the film (""There is no murder in paradise"") becomes, not a statement of fact, but a mantra repeated to stave off the knowledge that the world we live in is anything but a paradise. Although the film does take its time getting into gear, the journey it takes you on is well worth the wait and, despite the downbeat tone, it does have a fitting ending. Also, to the film's credit there were a few moments of violence that made me flinch. With the way movie audiences have become desensitized to violence, it was refreshing to have a film where it serves a purpose and has real impact. Overall, this isn't really a film that I'd soon watch again (due to the depressing subject matter), but is something that should be seen by more than have already. Don't believe the negative buzz and just give it a try."

In my opinion the only lacking thing in the story was a forcibly fabricated ending, some of the dialogue towards the conclusion was what i felt, unrealistic and very fictional. It is definitely worth a watch and i think a lot of thriller junkies would love this movie. Almost thought it was perfect. but failed a tiny bit towards the climax in my eyes."

","The idea of a thriller/murder mystery set in the 1950's Soviet Union, where to be accused is to be found guilty and the majority of the population live in state of constant paranoia, starring such acting powerhouses as Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, Gary Oldman, Paddy Considine and Jason Clarke, who have all starred in some damn fine movies over the past few years, would make one assume they were in for a guaranteed masterpiece. Based on Tom Rob Smith's 2008 novel, the first of a trilogy, Child 44 the film is overstuffed with disconnected sub- plots, mud-brown grimness, rushed storytelling. and a smorgasbord of thick Russian accents delivered by a mostly European from a variety of countries apart from Russia.<br/><br/>Beginning in a war-town Ukraine where starvation has wiped out a bulk of the population, young Leo Demidov (Hardy) escapes an orphanage and into the arms of a sympathetic soldier, who adopts him and gives him a home. Years later, and Leo is a war hero, having his picture taken raising the flag of the U.S.S.R. over Berlin, and has a beautiful wife in Raisa (Rapace). While the country lives in fear, Leo and his comrades dine in fine restaurants. He is an obedient soldier, hunting down and capturing suspected traitor Anatoly (Clarke), but also shows restraint and empathy in his work, trying to convince Anatoly to confess to escape his inevitable torture and execution, and dressing down fellow soldier Vasili (Joel Kinnaman), a known coward from the war, when he executes a peasant couple in cold blood.<br/><br/>Vasili, who rises through the ranks to become understudy to Major Kuzmin (Vincent Cassel), becomes Leo's nemesis. When Leo is called in to investigate a gang of citizens suspected of working against the state, Raisa is implicated, possibly by Vasili as a grudge against the man who humiliated him in the field. Leo must face a choice of giving up the woman he genuinely loves, or handing her over and maintaining his social position. Meanwhile, the child of one of Leo's friends is murdered, and may possibly be connected to other murders that have happened in the vicinity. But the higher-ups fails to acknowledge the murders, as serial killers can only be the product of capitalism, and there are no murders in paradise. Leo, refusing to hand his wife over, is sent to take a demeaning position in Volsk, operating under the command of General Nesterov (Oldman), where more bodies are found.<br/><br/>Child 44 has all the ingredients for an intense whodunit and character study from a time and place rarely depicted by mainstream cinema. I haven't read Smith's book, but judging from the critical praise and awards lavished upon it, director Daniel Espinosa, best known for action fare Easy Money (2010) and Safe House (2012), seems to have only skimmed the back cover, forgetting to add anything resembling tension or believable character development. 2006's German masterpiece The Lives of Others created an overwhelming sense of fear and paranoia within its characters, but Espinosa seems to be more invested in rushing his way through the plot to get to an end that is in no way satisfying. The performances, despite being burdened with thick Russian accents (though the cast generally stay on the right side of those Compare the Meerkat adverts), are solid, although Oldman and Considine are wasted. At 137 minutes, the film feels long when it should feel short, and you get the idea that this may have worked better as a mini-series, where better care could have been taken to tell the story with the patience it deserved."

","This weekend's Communist period piece ""Child 44"" has suffered an incriminating fate that even ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2"" avoided: Russia banned it right before its release, stating that the film reflected upon the nation with evocations of Mordor (the evil land from J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings""), and in an equally damning move, the film was not screened for critics in many major cities. But unlike some of Hollywood's stranger tales about film releases, ""Child 44"" doesn't need Hobbit-loving Russian government officials to equate it the land of Orcs, or for no one in other countries to know this movie exists, to earn its legacy as a blotch on the resumes of many talented people. ""Child 44"" is a fiasco by its own free will.<br/><br/>Director Daniel Espinosa's (""Easy Money,"" ""Safe House"") bungled epic, based on the novel from Tom Rob Smith, tells of sons and daughters of Mother Russia who are lost within Communism's inhumanity. They live in a society that claims to be Eden, but a brutal history of orphan-making famine, along with day-to-day dictatorial lunacy, suggests otherwise. Though the quote is never sourced, many of the characters in this world have been programmed to believe in the same motto: ""There is no murder in paradise.""<br/><br/>The USSR's main orphan in ""Child 44"" is Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy). His parents died in the Holodomor famine in the Ukraine in the 1930s, but he found a new family within Russian military, and was deemed a war hero when seen on newspapers brandishing a Soviet flag after the Reichstag in 1945. A few years later, in Moscow, he makes his living hunting traitors (such as Jason Clarke's Anatoly) with comrades Vasili (Joel Kinnaman) and Alexei (Fares Fares), while married to a schoolteacher, Noomi Rapace's Raisa, who could not harbor any less adoration for her husband. ""Child 44"" spends its time following Leo as he leads the way for a society that creates paranoia, in which, as Anatoly declares, ""When you are arrested, you are already guilty.""<br/><br/>The film eventually lumbers to its actual narrative center, when Alexei's young son is found dead. Because murder does not exist in Russia, the government rules that the boy was hit by a train, but Alexei, his family, and even the coroner know that a fellow Russian is to blame. Though a rational man, Leo stands behind the ruling, fearing to be listed as a traitor by his superior Major Kuzmin (Vincent Cassel) if he challenges the government, and he suggests Alexei do the same.<br/><br/>Such efforts prove pointless when Raisa is revealed to be an informant during interrogations on Anatoly. Because Leo did not turn her in himself, the couple are exiled to the industrial town of Volsk, where another boy is found dead, in a similarly gruesome display. Working under his new superior General Mikhail Nesterov (Gary Oldman), Leo begins to accept that this ain't no coincidence, and starts a controversial hunt to find the murderer, in order to prove against his government's delusion about excusing itself from classifications of homicide.<br/><br/>The film is loaded with actors who continue to be reliable. Hardy's charisma is a steal for any production that can get him, and the added support of Rapace, Oldman, and Kinnaman provides particular dramatic security. The story may feel endless, but they do not forfeit. As the cast collectively saturates fictional beings who deserve to be in a better-realized film, they prove to not be the problem of ""Child 44.""<br/><br/>With these performances, it's those pesky Russian accents that many of its Hollywood actors speak. They aren't ruinous due to questions of authenticity, but in how some garble their words. Lost key words spoken by characters pile on the avoidable bugaboos. The most nagging one involves Vincent Cassel describing what murder is considered to be in the Soviet Union. It's such a climactic declaration that the film's trailer treats it prominently. Even there, as I listen over and over, it makes no sense. The line: ""Murder is strictly a ...Capillary's disease? Captaineers disease? Captainese disease? Water on the knee?""<br/><br/>An ancient saying states that a film is written three times - in the screenplay, on set, and in the editing room. The many narrative strands of ""Child 44""could have been tangled in any one of these stages, but it feels most of all to be the result of various editing errors, creating a final product that is equally bloated and scatterbrained. Instead of narrowing in on Hardy's go-getter questioning his blind obedience during this murder investigation, ""Child 44""wants an ensemble character scope that it can't handle. In smaller doses, some scenes are far too choppy, information and cohesion be damned, whether its vicious hand-to-hand scuffles or facile exchanges of dialogue. On the other hand, the film doesn't hesitate to treat other scenes as opportunities for rants about the terrors of Communism, as with a barbaric, homophobic witch-hunt that garners a five-minute narrative diversion (a scene that suggests provoking some Russian moviegoers, indeed). Or, when famished story-lines need to be kicked back into action, the editing never resists helping characters find each other with impeccable timing, or eventually giving in and just showing us the murderer, because everyone else is too slow.<br/><br/>In the end, the strangest mystery of ""Child 44"" involves Espinosa: Where did he lose focus? His previous two films, ""Easy Money"" (which was presented by Martin Scorsese) and ""Safe House"" affirm that the central narrative of ""Child 44"" is right in his crosshairs. (I'd more readily trust him with a Jason Bourne movie than I would a sweeping Russian epic, but I digress.) Instead, he's only able to continue crafting sturdy performances that present a few bursts of curious moral quandaries. The overall tightness that elevated him from ""Easy Money""to ""Safe House,"" however, is lost. While ""Child 44"" now has some strange release date tales, there are none to be heard yet about any vigorous re-writes, re-shoots, or re-edits that would suggest the film was headed down an alternate narrative course. Well, no such mentions that have been admitted to the public, at least."

Clothes, besides some official's uniforms, were worn and faded. It looked very realistic. I would watch a sequel if one was made. The characters of Leo and Raisa Demidov and General Nesterov were portrayed as complex personalities that warrant further investigation. The movie is listed as a thriller but I would disagree with that label. There was not enough action for a thriller.

Doing some pre-viewing research, I discovered that the studio more or less threw the movie away, giving it a small and not well publicized theatrical release. When this kind of thing happens, it usually means the studio feels it has a turkey on its hands and they are cutting their losses. Actually, the movie is some distance from being branded as terrible. The look and feel of the movie, replicating the Stalin-lead Soviet Union is spot on. Insights into how the oppressive government at the time worked are often interesting, helping to make the movie not be boring. The acting is also very good as well. However, the movie also has some major problems. Although the movie is not boring, it's all the same WAY stretched out. It's often rambling about unnecessary details, and reluctant to focus on the heart of the movie, and the movie ends up being much too long (over two hours in length!) Also, the sequence you'll be long waiting for - the climatic confrontation with the killer - ends up being a real letdown. As I said, the movie is not awful, but it is also not satisfying enough. The problems I listed, along with the fact that Americans often don't seem that interested in movies with a strong ""foreign"" element to them, probably explain why the studio was reluctant to put in the expense and work necessary to give it a wider release."

The dark ambiance in the Stalin ages reflects perfectly what it must have been living in the Sovjet Union at that time in Child 44. You had only one thing to do in that time and that was to shut up and look the other way. And never question authority. Certainly worth a watch."

","As a devotee of Soviet history I expected this movie, from what I had read, to be a look at the treatment of orphan children under Stalin's regime. I guess I didn't read closely enough. What begins as a decent portrayal of the cruelty and brutality of Communist Russia evolves, slowly and interminably into a Slavic episode of ""Law and Order,"" except that Law and Order did not have so many gratuitous and drawn out fight scenes. Unlike other viewers, I applaud the Russia accents, as unevenly as they are executed. The dialogue could use some brushing up. I don't think the idiomatic expression ""a complete wash"" was in use in Russia at the time. Basically however, the movie descends from a decent beginning to a mundane murder mystery with too many improbable turns to be convincing. And it's too damn long."
"manaraldoseri","7","0","2","7 February 2016"," Tom Hardy great..the movie not so much.
","I must admit that I was a little disappointed with the film for it's confusing telling of the story. The film is based on a novel which I have never read, and as I was watching it, it was evident that the story had a lot of holes in it and at times the sequence of events just did not make sense. To start with, at the beginning of the film Leo at age 10 or 12 is shown playing with a coin that seemed to be of sentimental value to him but we are never shown the background story of that. Raisa, Leo's wife, at times is shown to hold resentment towards her husband who loves her dearly, and again there is no direct explanation to that. When Leo finally confronts the murderer towards the end, the murderer indicates that he knows Leo or knew him in the past but again there is no explanation for that.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy, as always, delivers great performance, owning the screen every time he shows up, captivating your attention with his characterization of a reluctant Russian soldier haunted by his childhood and the things he had to do in the line of duty. Noomi Rapace also portrays the character of Raisa beautifully and holds her own against Tom Hardy. Gary Oldman, on the other hand, did not do much in the film as his character was not given much space anyway, so I think any actor would be able to fill in his shoes.<br/><br/>The 7/10 that I'm giving this film is only in appreciation for the great performances by the two leads, if I was only rating the film I would give it 5. I don't know if the film was really meant to come out the way it did, but I'm willing to bet that the plot holes were caused by too much editing and cutting that resulted in the omission of important sequential events."
"belindakmn-98819","8","0","2","28 January 2016"," Gut wrenching and well acted. Why did this get such bad ratings/reviews?
","I had never heard of this movie, but when I saw that it starred Tom Hardy, recorded and watched it. I found it to be riveting, and with a depth and beauty rarely seen in movies of these times. The box office failure is very similar to another beautiful film; Cinderella Man, starring Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger, that, (at least), got the reviews/credits it so deserved, unlike this movie. The typical movie going audience does not appreciate depth as much as flash, it seems. I almost stopped watching due to the intensity and utter bleakness of the setting, but then realized that was how damned good of a job they did to suck you into the pit of despair that was Russia of that time. I am so glad I stuck it out. I did not read the book, and NEVER hold a movie to the same expectation of detail in the book. It never works out that way, so why complain? All in all, this was well worth watching, in my opinion."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In the early 1950's, the Ukrainian people are living under a regime of forced starvation under Josef Stalin. Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy) is a dedicated officer in the army, who's suspected of being a traitor for not turning in his fiancÃ© Raisa (Noomi Rapace.) However, he's soon ruffling feathers again when he starts drawing attention to a series of child murders that appear to have been taking place along the train tracks. He finds himself transferred from Moscow to a different area, where he is met with resistance from General Nesterov (Gary Oldman), before a climactic final showdown with the killer.<br/><br/>Serving as a kind of alternative period piece, Child 44 transports us back to a most grim of periods, which is captured in pretty much every aspect of its production, whilst relaying a fairly typical detective story. A film set in the grimmest of times telling an even grimmer tale. Generally speaking, it's not a film to have a laugh with. It's captured most effectively in the drained, gloomy lighting and dark cinematography. The script is equally humourless, which perfectly matches the already established mood.<br/><br/>Since the tone has been captured so perfectly, all that remains to be spoken of is the writing and performances. Spreading out over a long time frame, it's an intelligently written piece if sadly a little dull, without the nail biting suspense consistently injected into the script to make it really effective. Performances wise, Hardy does a decent Russian accent and appears as committed to his role as any other, a feat matched by younger (and now sadly less relevant) version Oldman. A lively supporting cast, including Joel Kinnaman and Vincent Cassel, keep the project charging down the tracks.<br/><br/>It's a decent mystery thriller, then, if a little long and dull, and very little to laugh at. ***"
"giadafallaci","7","0","1","17 January 2016"," Enjoyable movie, glimpses of the Stalin era. It should have been fantastic considering the actors!
","I was looking forward to see this movie and I watched it on my Amazon Prime account. It was an interesting movie with quite a a bit of potential. I enjoyed the acting of the main characters and even though the so called Russian accent was bad, it added something to the movie. There was quite a line up of actors and the acting was very decent. But throughout the movie the accents started bothering me. The accents ofthe main characters were so thick, it became annoying. <br/><br/>It distracted me from the movie, which was a shame. I enjoyed the story and the development of the story and characters. The story was interesting enough to want to see the whole movie even though I was disappointed that we were not given more explanation on the killer. It felt rather rushed. Did I enjoy it? Yes, it was good enough for a lazy Sunday afternoon. <br/><br/>Do I recommend it? Yes, it was decent, enjoyable and interesting to get a bit of feeling of the Stalin era, way of living and politics. It's worth to watch."

","This is going to be one of those movies that will be discovered years later. Because it's fascinating and so wonderfully constructed, I understand why it wasn't a crowd-pleaser up front.<br/><br/>You can read the synopsis for the story, I won't bore you with redundancy.<br/><br/>The movie is something to marvel at. The intricacies of the secret world the Soviet union lived under after the war, is debatable. But, the point was to get the paranoia sense across. Who cares if it were the Soviets. It could've been a future society that police our words and thoughts. Whatever the case, the tale weaves in between who is good and who is bad and what it means to hold the moral high ground when a disturbing crime is committed. How we, as humans, deal with our own government when it does overwhelm us with logic flaws. This beautiful movie will be something like ""Enemies At The Gates"" A tough angry dirty movie, which people will wonder why it didn't do better.<br/><br/>Go seek this movie out on a slow cold night. It's a good one."
"rmax304823","3","0","2","10 January 2016"," Sowiet Union Not Havink Serial Killer!
","A flawed film, more or less based on the case of Chikotilo, the notorious serial killer who notched up several dozen children, some after terrible torture.<br/><br/>It's interesting to compare the HBO docudrama, ""Citizen X"", with this fictional feature film. The first was measured in its pace and splendidly acted by the droopy faced Steven Rhea and his superior, Donald Sutherland. It stuck closely to the historical facts as documented in the well-informed case study, ""The Killer Department,"" by Robert Cullen. The dissolution of the dilatory and obstructionist USSR is clearly shown but with some subtlety.<br/><br/>In my review I described ""Citizen X"" as a serial killer movie made for adults. ""Child 44"" isn't without its moments. It's well-directed and the performance's are adequate, with Tom Hardy's relentless investigator and Joel Kinnaman as the handsome and utterly ruthless NKVD operator outstanding.<br/><br/>Yet ""Child 44"" can't be described as a serial killer movie for adults. It's been alloyed with the current taste for darkness and bone-crushing violence.<br/><br/>The plot is what the real participants might have called ""gloopy."" There is some wild crap introduced showing that the killer spent time in a Nazi prison where he was injected with a serum -- or let's call it a potient -- that rendered him hungry for human flesh. Where did such an explanation come from? Whose was the hand that slanted back that brow? The whole movie is overwrought and lacks verisimilitude. Tom Hardy gets his brains beaten out and two minutes later he's clobbering three bald, armed NKVD goons, each the size of Boulder Dam.<br/><br/>Part of the story has been turned into domestic drama. I don't mind a come-and-go romance being in the story. In ""Citizen X"", the investigator had his plump Russian zhbena, but here he has a lengthy, twisted relationship with his wife who is not (thank Bog) a stunning and glamorous modelesque type.<br/><br/>The film shows the USSR to be a dark, dreary, threatening place. Every scene seems to be filled with grimy warehouses and pipes. It's so ashen that it brings to mind Fitzgerald's phantasmal description of the city of ashes in ""Gatsby."" There's never a ray of sunshine.<br/><br/>It's very plainly anti-Russian propaganda. We will never get over the Cold War, it seems. But, like ""Citizen X"", it does capture the demeaning nature of communism. You're assigned to a particular apartment, for instance, and in both films people are eager to get a larger and more comfortable place to live. What a shabby existence. No wonder it finally fell apart. It ought to give us pause when we call an American public figure a ""communist."" Nobody wants that."
"sickofenjoyingmyself","7","0","1","8 January 2016"," Absorbing but unusual thriller
","I haven't read the book and only just watched the movie. My first thought was that I did enjoy it - but that it was a very unusual movie experience. You really have to get past the actors speaking English in Russian accents. It is a little absurd - however I think it would have been more absurd for them to have spoken in English/American accents. Perhaps it would have been best being made as a Russian movie with English subtitles. But it wasn't so we have to accept it for what is is. As a thriller? It is good. The story line is good, and extremely disturbing. I though Tom Hardy was great, Noomi Rapace wasn't, Paddy Considine was effectively creepy and that we just didn't get enough of Gary Oldman. I think that it lost focus at some point on being a dark thriller and tried to add too much historical background (although I can see why they did this). On this front I think that it lost something and let down some of the performances. I have to say I was very impressed with Joel Kinnaman's performance, who gave serious credentials to his role and was a match for Hardy. Definitely slightly absurd - but focused enough to remain an enjoyable thriller."
"perkypops","8","0","1","1 January 2016"," A compellingly deep and dark hunt for a serial child killer
","Take grim times, the Soviet regime, add in child killings, Party politics, corruption, brutality, betrayal and Nazi leftovers, stir well, add plentiful quality actors, a stupendously good script, superbly dark and atmospheric cinematography and you have a ridiculously good film, whose only failing is it's muddled up language - it could have been subtitled throughout or English throughout but not mixed up in places.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, with a hat full of memorable lines, plot twists and turns, love, hate and deception heaped into each other. The story takes a while to fall into place but, by the end, it all makes perfect sense, a tribute to the way the film is allowed to unfold in real time.<br/><br/>I am going to see it for a second time and I am hoping to look out for things I may have missed first time around. It really is a must see film."
"c_i_grant","8","0","1","1 January 2016"," Not the book, but not a terrible film
","There are a lot of angry reviews because this film is not the book... No, it's a film, and therefore the plot had had to suffer some major editing. Don't get me wrong I love the book, it's brilliant, but this is a different art form and needs to be seen on it's own merits.<br/><br/>The plot of the film runs along well, and the pace of the film is very good. The plot thread (from the book) that the film makers have chosen to focus on is the relationship between Leo (Hardy) and Raisa (Rapace) and although the film doesn't cover the backgrounds of these characters the lead performances are excellent, however due to this constraint many of the supporting roles are rather two dimensional. <br/><br/>Where this film succeeds is in the creation of fear that the Russian Soviet Union bred within it's people. There is the overhanging threat at all times. The performances are excellent and it moves along at a fair rate. The film does have a failing because it is not the book, and therefore it cannot reach the same levels of tension and paranoia, nor the level of detail given to each character.<br/><br/>Watch the film, enjoy it for its great performances and creation of mood and atmosphere. Then go and read the book and be drawn further into the world of Leo. This film is no where near as bad as many people are claiming, it just isn't the book."
"eddie_baggins","4","0","5","28 September 2015"," A true waste of talent and potential
","So many things on paper point to Child 44 being quite the film. The book on which this film is based on by Tom Rob Smith is a hugely popular and well liked novel, we've got a cast here which led by the ever impressive Tom Hardy looks like a sure fire winner, director Daniel Espinosa has shown promise before with his early films Easy Money and Safe House and the material at the heart of this tale could be both thrilling and emotionally resonate. Upon pondering these elements, it makes it even more frustrating that Child 44 is such a downright mediocre film.<br/><br/>I'm sure I'm not alone in saying openly that Child 44 was one of the films I was most looking forward to catching on cinema screens this year. The reuniting of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier ,Spy and Lawless co-stars Hardy and Gary Oldman, mixed with the white knuckle thrills of a serial killer whodunit in the colds of post war Russia, it seemed like a quality movie event but that fact that Child 44 never even screened on Australian cinema screens says all we need to know about how viewers felt about Espinosa's hodgepodge production.<br/><br/>A large portion of Child 44's failings must be placed at the feet of Espinosa who seems unsure of how to utilise his cast, while Hardy is commanding despite a somewhat overplayed Russian accent, the rest of the films main players seem utterly wasted with particular mention of a barely registering Gary Oldman and the complete waste of supports like Paddy Considine and the blink and you'll miss it Jason Clarke. Espinosa clearly had trouble also with a narrative focus that shifts too often between the toils of Hardy's Leo and his troubled wife Raisa (played by Noomi Rapace who once more frustrates in an English language production) and the almost side playing's of brutal child murders that are engulfing the nations impoverished.<br/><br/>It'd be easy to go on at length about how Child 44 fails to capitalise on juicy plot lines and interesting characters traits and arcs, but put simply, Child 44 seems reluctant to back itself in as either a drama, a thriller or a mystery and while there are glimpses of the films possibilities, a messy delivery disallows audience interest beyond mild curiosity.<br/><br/>Easily one of 2015's most disappointingly average movies, Child 44 had all the makings of something special but never becomes anything more than a slightly more polished TV movie that is elevated by the on screen presence of Hardy and a few stand-alone scenes that seem cut from a much better overall product.<br/><br/>2 homemade candy treats out of 5"

","Well as I was looking forward to this I thought I would review this as feature, i'll keep it short though and as I found this film heavily influenced on CITIZEN X filmed in the early 90's I still thoroughly enjoyed it but would state that is the worse of the two by a country mile and that it was less compelling and even swayed from the path of interest, all that said it is still a very decent film and captures the effect of the U.S.S.R. of that time period and the mindset surrounding it, but it should as the way has already been set for it!.<br/><br/>As I have said previously I found the movie citizen x a much superior, better acted and more believable film and especially since it is based upon reality but then I'am just filling lines in here just to make IMDb happy in its minimum requirements."
