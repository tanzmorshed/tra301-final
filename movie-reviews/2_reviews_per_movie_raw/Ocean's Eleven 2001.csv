","There is just something about this movie that makes it so great. There's nothing truly outstanding about any one aspect of the movie; nothing that will blow you away. However, everything is put together perfectly.<br/><br/>Personally, I have a theory that any movie that absolutely blows you away the first time you see it, will lose its entertainment value very quickly. Not necessarily because the movie was not good, but because it just seems to get old too fast. This is NOT one of those movies.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that will be enjoyed countless times. The dialogue is slick, and always to the point. There are few (if any) overdone scenes and/or lines that tend to become annoying over time.<br/><br/>This movie flows exceptionally well. Personally, I couldn't quite figure out why until I watched the ""behind the scenes"" footage on the DVD. I didn't really notice all of the work they put into using as few shots as possible. The extra features on the DVD really explain it all. Almost every scene uses considerably less shots than you would think it takes to convey all of the activity going on. The music punctuates the flow of the movie and the shots extremely well.<br/><br/>The cast is almost all big names. It's great to see actors like Pitt and Clooney and Damon come together in a movie and interact so well, without having to be the pretty boys or bad-ass heroes of the movie."

","Freshly released from jail Danny Ocean begins to recruit key players to put together a job as daring as it is dangerous - the safe that holds the money for 3 casinos belonging to Terry Benedict.  As well as splitting the $150 million between the gang, Danny also plans to steal back his ex-wife Tess who is currently dating Benedict.<br/><br/>The first movie wasn't exactly brilliant - only really interesting because it brought the whole rat pack together onscreen for the first time.  This could have easily fallen into the same trap - trading purely on the stars' names rather than an intrinsic entertainment value.  However it manages to take what worked from the original and give it a great modern shine.  The story is daft of course, but it moves forward with a sort of slick illogical cleverness that appears wonderfully clever but is, of course, highly unlikely!  The story unfolds in an entertaining manner, the build up is great with no dull moments as we meet the characters and find out the details of the job bit by bit.<br/><br/>The job itself is well handled.  It is so slick that you don't mind that it couldn't possibly work in real life, but instead it just appears so clever! The romantic subplot I found to be a little redundant and I didn't think that Clooney and Roberts had good chemistry - compared to Clooney and Lopez in another great Sodenberg film `Out of Sight' where the screen crackled! However it takes up little screen time and compliments the heist quite well. Sodenberg handles the film well and doesn't allow his direction to be slick without substance - the editing is clever and Las Vegas internally and externally looks great.<br/><br/>Clooney is fantastic in the lead - his strength is that he has great charisma which means he doesn't have to ham it up.  Instead he does his stuff but allows others to try and shine while he is comfortable with a constant warm glow.  Pitt does likewise - he doesn't try to hog the glory but hangs around being smooth for most of the time.  This allows Pitt and Clooney to be the two leads without taking away from the ensemble feel - they also have a good relationship going here.  Roberts is OK but didn't convince me that Clooney would risk so much for her.  Affleck and Cann are good in a sort of comedy double act role - they don't have a lot of scenes but they are funny.  Old hands Gould (so good to see him on the big screen) and Carl Riener effortlessly steal all their scenes and Matt Damon seems happy to be on a smaller part than the other stars and has a rookie sort of role.  Andy Garcia has a poor role as the bad guy and doesn't manage to bring him to life - although he does make him unlikeable when next to Clooney.  However, Don Cheadle, a great actor, needs a real kicking for ruining things with a terrible cockney accent that makes Dick Van Dyke sound genuine.  Happily he doesn't actually have that many lines - and he only has two scenes where he has to say more than 2 sentences at a time - but really he is just terrible.  Someone please explain - why his character is English? Then someone explain - why they just didn't get an English star to play it?<br/><br/>Overall any criticisms against this are minor and are missing the point. It's not meant to be a classic or get Sodenberg more Oscar nominations. Instead it's a slick little package that is kept afloat by a starry cast, a cool soundtrack and a nice (if silly) plot.  Sit, watch, chill, enjoy, forget."

","George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Shaobo Qin, Miguel Perez, and Livingston Dell make up ""Ocean's Eleven,"" a 2001 film directed by Steven Soderbergh. The film also stars Andy Garcia and Julia Roberts. This is a remake of the rat pack ""Ocean's Eleven,"" which I've never seen so I can't make comparisons. I suspect that this version has more emphasis on plot and the older one has more emphasis on the pack.<br/><br/>The mastermind of a plot to rob Las Vegas' Bellaggio Hotel vault of $160 million is Danny Ocean, a very recent ex-con who had lots of time on his hands in prison to plan it. With the help of his buddy, Rusty Ryan (Pitt) he recruits 9 people who specialize in a particular expertise to carry out the elaborate heist. Problems come in when Ocean, obsessed with his ex-wife (Roberts), approaches her, to the annoyance of her present boyfriend, the owner of the hotel, Terry Benedict (Garcia). He ""makes"" Danny by sending out a bulletin with Danny's photo to the hotel staff, which puts him out of his own plot at the insistence of Rusty. But Danny isn't one to exit easily, in either marriage or robberies.<br/><br/>This is a fast-paced, tension-filled, exciting movie that's highly entertaining. The plot is completely improbable so you have to take it for what it is - fantastic fun. And you never know whether something is going wrong or if it's part of the plan. The chemistry between the actors, particularly Clooney and Pitt, is great, and there is some wonderful acting. Clooney is solid as Ocean, a passionate man of quiet determination; Damon is terrific as an insecure participant; Don Cheadle, sporting a Cockney accent, is hilarious as an explosives expert; Elliot Gould is outrageous as their financial backer; Carl Reiner is excellent as an older con man who can do accents. Just as they all contribute their different talents to the heist, they do so in this movie. This includes the acting in the smaller roles played by Bernie Mac et al - everyone is perfect. Andy Garcia is fabulous as Benedict - both elegant and scary, he whispers instead of shouts and stays in control for the most part. Megastar Roberts is wasted - she doesn't have much to do.Any actress could have done the role, but I guess the producers wanted an all-star cast.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for blockbuster entertainment value and star power. Just don't look for it to be realistic."
"Buddy-51","Null","72","84","27 July 2002"," a pleasant souffle of a film
","Steven Soderbergh's remake of `Ocean's Eleven' is a stylish heist picture featuring some of the brightest stars in moviemaking today.  The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich'), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works. <br/><br/>Taking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.   In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.<br/><br/>A film like `Ocean's Eleven' stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.   There is even an inspired use of `Clair de Lune' near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance?  After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes.  It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man  and we cheer her for it.   <br/><br/>Unlike in Soderbergh's other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others.  In fact, `Ocean's Eleven' is all ABOUT shining handsome surface and it makes no pretension of being about anything else.  It's cinematic junk food of the highest order, but, then, since when has junk food not been satisfying?"
"Jenny Ho","8","67","80","5 March 2002"," Tasty cast in very cool and slick movie
","What a tasty prospect for a film: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts and for the young at heart amongst us, Joshua Jackson of 'Dawson's Creek' fame in a cameo role -all directed by the Oscar winning Steven Soderbergh!<br/><br/>George Clooney plays Danny Ocean who soon after being released from prison, puts together a team of eleven to undertake a robbery of the three biggest casinos in Las Vegas in an attempt to bring in a reward of $150 million. What soon becomes clear is that it's not the money which will give Danny the ultimate satisfaction, but the opportunity to get revenge on the owner of the three casinos he is robbing -Benedict (Andy Garcia) who just happens to be the new beau of Danny's ex, Tess (Julia Roberts).<br/><br/>Some of the gang of eleven are more memorable than others -especially the Chinese acrobat, the explosives expert with a dodgy cockney accent and the medallion wearing Reuben -aka Monica Gellar's dad!  The cast are brilliant at acting cool -even if all Brad Pitt is doing is snacking on the screen (he does this a lot!), you are still transfixed by him because he looks so good on screen.<br/><br/>What makes the story so intriguing is the fact that Danny's mission seems so impossible: security in the casinos is paramount and the route to the reward is littered with obstacles.  The number of close calls that the gang is faced with is great fun and one can't help but root for these crooks throughout the film.  It is also refreshing to watch a film which is dominated by male stars and is not filled with macho swearing.  Instead, we have a banter between the stars which is indicative of their camaraderie.<br/><br/>'Ocean's Eleven' is a welcome option in the choice of movies available at the moment which is dominated by Oscar nominees that are not going to be everyone's cup of tea.  With this film, it's simply a case of sit back and enjoy the fun!"

","A rarity--a remake that's better than the original. 11 men led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) prepare to rob a vault linked to 3 casinos in Las Vegas. His partners in crime include Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, Matt Damon and Scott Caan. Also, the casinos are owned by Tery Benedict (Andy Garcia) who is romancing Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts). Fun, engrossing, just simply the most enjoyable film of 2001. It moves smoothly, the entire cast plays it cool and easy and Steven Soderbergh directs it with flair and intelligence. Yes, it's light; yes, it's a trifle but it's so FUN! I really loved this film. Affleck and Caan are hilarious as bickering brothers. My only complaint--Julia Roberts (the only woman in the cast) is shot very cruelly. She's beautiful so why does she look so bad? Aside from that this is a fun movie. Just sit back and enjoy."

","Ok, so maybe the original 1960s film was just an excuse for Frank and his buddies to hang out and make some money out of it, but it was still a smash hit. Lets face it, if they had all just been sitting there doing nothing it would still have been a highly successful film. People would have paid to see them organise their sock draws. However, this time around with a brand new script and an immensely prosperous cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original.<br/><br/>In the case of this adaption we are safe in the knowledge that the actors at least wanted to be there and that they all had fun making it. Firstly because of the fact that they all took pay cuts so that it could happen and secondly because it comes across on screen. The easy friendship between Clooney, Pitt, Roberts et al shines throughout the film and seems to draw the audience in to their inner circle. We know they had a good time filming it just as we are having a good time watching it.<br/><br/>It is easy to say that this is THE coolest film of the year. From the phenomenal script and direction from Steven Soderbergh to the impeccable easy going performances of the 'stars' - yes every single one of them! With so many big names you would expect some rivalry yet there is no scene hogging in sight. It is clear to see that they are all willing to share the limelight. The fact is that there is no main character or personality. They are all in it together - reflecting the sense of the film in real life. This is the first concept the audience sees from the poster. The names are printed in alphabetical order. Nobody is given priority. Clooney plays Danny Ocean with the same self - confidence, composure and unmistakable coll that hasn't been seen since Sinatra himself. All the other characters are brand new, that is except for the character of Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts). In the 60s original Tess, played by Angie Dickinson, is Ocean's defender (to some extent). However, Roberts' re-vamped character is more self assured and unmoved by Ocean's charm. Rusty (Pitt) is rarely seen without snack in hand and the suit are certainly something to look at. He may be a new character but he is still played in the carefree manner typical of the Rat Pack.<br/><br/>It is refreshing to sit and watch a film such as this and not have to suffer the usual barrage of swearing and violence. The lack of such profanities only increases its wide appeal. It just goes to show that it can be done and that films do not neccessarily need it.<br/><br/>Ocean's Eleven is not your typical heist movie. To start with there are eleven people working together all with specific, indispensable jobs to do. Yet the mood is still light hearted which makes it even more compelling to watch. The inspired direction and flowing script assure that there is never a dull moment and that every scene is important, as is every character. There are also a couple of cameo appearances from some other big names to look out for.<br/><br/>Admittedly there is a bad side as there is in every film. In this instance it is Don Cheadles's cockney accent. Nice try but not quite right!<br/><br/>This is a film that will keep you fascinated the entire time you are watching. It does not conform to the conventional values of the genre that we have come to expect. The twists and turns guarantee that by the end you will be sitting there thinking 'that was really clever'. Perhaps it isn't quite what you would expect from such a star studded cast and an Oscar winning director. But that is why it is so much better than the archetypal Hollywood blockbusters that we have come to expect.<br/><br/>This is no run of the mill film. It was not about money or self promotion. It was about having fun and enjoying the job. Ocean's Eleven is not a film that will be forgotten seconds after you have seen it. It will live forever as the epitome of cool for years to come."
"giancarlorocks","Null","44","53","8 December 2001"," Soderbergh returns to his Suave and Sophisticatedroots...
","Throughout the past 6 months, heist films have been protruding our screens at a sporadic rate.  'The Score' starring Robert De Niro was one of the first out the gate last July, while David Mamet's highly praised 'Heist' was just released last month. Now, the Holiday season plays host to one of the most enjoyable films this year 'Ocean's 11'. Steven 'Do No Harm' Soderbergh's latest opus in a nutshell is absolutely fantastic. Watching the film I could see Warner Bros. tagging the lines for upcoming promos from all the reviews such as 'the most fun you'll have at the movies' and 'the year's best film'. For once, I would agree with those promos.  This is an absolute great piece of film. That is not to say that Soderbergh has not included a couple of clichéd crowd pleasing segments, but that takes hardly anything away from a superbly acted, written and directed film. George Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, who after just released from prison plans to concoct a daring caper to rob 3 Casinos for more than 150$ Million in cold cash. He therefore sets out to recruit, train and execute the plan which these three verbs respectively describing each of the film's three acts. First for recruitment is Brad Pitt who plays Dusty Ryan, a food-obsessed criminal who leads the plan with Clooney as they recruit Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck and many more. Hence the title; 'Ocean's 11'. With his newest film, Soderbergh seems to return to his roots with his 'Out Of Sight' style he created when Jennifer Lopez and Clooney collaborated on that film in 1998. From the opening sequence when the camera tracks Clooney out of the prison gates, to the cutthroat dialogue in the same vein as 'out of Sight', I knew Soderbergh was onto something. The result is a great, fun, fast paced film that moves so fast at some parts that if you blink, you'll miss it. The opening 20 minutes have Danny and Rusty recruiting all over the U.S. with great scenes that prove to be the some of most memorable. Who can forget Elliot Gould's character Rubin Tischikoff as he tries to talk the men out of the heist by providing examples of the most successful Casino heists ever achieved - which turned out all to be unsuccessful. Those who saw the film know that the aforementioned scene is just one of the many scenes that work. If we look at the film in a dissecting fashion, we can clearly see that the film works on many levels. The first act quickly, easily and 'non-challantly' introduces us to our characters in a subtle detailed manner while simultaneously mocking the teen cover boys acting industry. Pitt is first approached from Clooney while he teaches teen stars on how to play cards. None other than Joshua Jackson, Holly Marie Combs and Topher Grace appear in this scene.  While the stars' presence can actually detract from what is another great scene in the film, just when you finish digesting that memorable scene, the film takes off a mere minutes after it starts with the recruitment of the Danny's 11 man-crew.<br/><br/>The 'training' act explores several sub plots including the introduction of the Julia Roberts character Tess Ocean. She plays Ocean's ex-wife who is currently dating one of the Casino owners they are trying to rob. The incredibly underrated Andy Garcia plays the film's unconformist villain with suave sophistication who seems to convey the notion of fear with his droopy-eyed close ups. Tense scenes between Garcia and Clooney while rare, are simply a treat to watch. Furthermore, romantics will certainly enjoy the love subplot that is truly predictable that as clichéd as it is, is still effective as only Soderbergh can create it to be.<br/><br/>The third act is completely mind-blowing as the 'execution' of the robbery is filmed in such a dizzying, comedic yet suspenseful manner that makes this film stick out from all the other heist movies. The film's robbery sequence set during a Lennox Lewis fight is epic, grand and deserves to be viewed more than once to take it all in. While some might say the film ends in a clichéd, predictable ending; I ask you, what did you expect? You are not going to get a sad ending with one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled for a motion picture. Furthermore, as a testament to Soderbergh's craftiness; witness the second to last closing scene. After all the frenzy, after all the comedy, and after all the intensity, Soderbergh assembles his cast right in front of the casino. The whole crew watches in a perverted sense of pride and accomplishment as they study the Casinos they just robbed with nostalgic music playing in the background; glamorizing their illegalities as only pure Hollywood magic can. They all take one last look at the Casinos, and slowly walk away one by one, each with a gaze of joy as they separate themselves from the 'job'. Truly an incredible scene that I played back in my mind repeatedly while writing this review, that one scene captures the true essence of the film. It still has to be seen as to whether or not any other film this year will come close to its' suaveness, its' look, its' style or its' satisfying effect it gives you when exiting the theatre. Pardon my colloquialism, but this film was damn cool. Notable mentions include the outstanding wardrobe. Seems as if Soderbergh simply wanted to make a film, put his actors in lavish sets and dress them up as good as he can. While some costumes may be outlandish to fit the character, Pitt's and Clooney's are simply stunning and had me looking through my GQ when I got home. Therefore, see it on the big screen and see it more than once to take in all the great elements this absolutely fantastic film had to offer.<br/><br/>Giancarlo's Rating: ***1/2"

","Ocean's Eleven is a very easy-going and purely fun movie to watch. The film is loaded with celebrities such as George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, and Matt Damon. Ocean's Eleven is very ""loosely"" based on the original Ocean's Eleven starring Frank Sinatra. Steven Soderbergh did a fabulous job directing this movie and having all the characters to connect to Danny Oceans group of 11. The plan is to steal 160$ million dollars from three Las Vegas Casino's. Sounds wacky? The planning time took up most of the movie, and you almost believe that it could be done after you see this. Andy Garcia did a fabulous job playing Terry Benedict, the owner of the Casino's where Ocean (Clooney) plans to rob. Brad Pitt plays and interesting role as Danny Ocean's sidekick. The plot flows quickly and some parts leave you laughing on the floor. Each one of the eleven characters had its own story behind them and it is seen when Rusty Ryan (Pitt) and Danny Ocean (Clooney) first go to recruit them to plan this heist. I have to say Julia Roberts didn't have a flexible character but nonetheless her presence in this film as Tess, Danny Ocean's ex-wife, is apparent. Ocean's 12 is due out in December with the same old cast and it promises to be a hit. This movie is one of my favorites because the premise is great and the actors are great.<br/><br/>**** out of *****"

The comradery between the actors is the most entertaining part of this film in my opinion. Elliot Gould's part had to be my favorite character if forced to pick, followed in close order by Clooney, Pitt & Damon.  Actually all of the actors did an excellent job with their roles.<br/><br/>This movie won't change the world, or probably change your mind about anything significant, but the plot is fun, the cinematography is excellent, the actors all shine in their roles, and on occasion that is enough."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's attention is focused on projecting each scene into the future; Soderbergh's is on the present, the zen of forgetting what's next. He pulls this off by immersion in the craft. Alone among major directors, he is a triple threat: he lives through the actor's eye; he works the director's end (as the variety of director that is storypuller); and he literally is the cameraman.<br/><br/>This last is the special skill, because he seems able to accomplish this zen thing by making the camera flow. It is almost always godlike -- never taking a position or focal stance that a human would; but flowing like an invisible human observer might. The trick is that it is not just within a shot, as others would have, but seamlessly across great phrases of shots. This is architecture in the master builder sense.<br/><br/>The story is throwaway except for two elements:<br/><br/>--The method of shooting noted above is pure Kurosawa, and in particular `Seven Samuri.' And the story reflects it, with all the mechanics of collecting the team. Kurosawa himself collected actors from a single acting tradition and had them act as discrete characters. Soderbergh understands actors well enough to select actors from different traditions to act different types of characters. So we get a richer ensemble: Reiner's style is all timing; Clooney's all body; Pitt's heavily eye's; Julia's all mouth; Cheadle is a nervous projector; Garcia resolutely quite. (Pitt is the anchor of this film. He's really growing.)<br/><br/>--As with all purely modern, postironic film, there is a film within, around which all things revolve. This film within the film is a carefully produced set piece where they fool the viewer. As with several other `casino' films -- particularly the self-referential `Snake Eyes' which is quoted here, there is a constant camera eye.<br/><br/>It's very competent, cinematic storytelling. Someday soon, he'll do something important. And with his growing skill, it will alter lives."

","I actually do like a lot of rebooted/remakes, such as Dawn of the Dead, Halloween or Star Trek. But, of course, for every three that are good, a dozen or more are mediocre at best. That's not the case here.<br/><br/>Granted, I have not seen, nor really desire to see the original Ocean's Eleven, after what I read and researched about it. I'll just take this movie at face value.<br/><br/>More than just a remake, this movie ranks HIGH on my all-time favorites list. I have probably seen it twice the number in the title and plan on more visits to one of the most creative, funny and just plain entertaining movies I have ever seen. It helps that I am a George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon fan and I can enjoy Brad Pitt and Andy Garcia from time to time. But, put all of those, plus a lot more, together and you have probably the highest level of chemistry between any casts in any movie.<br/><br/>Ocean (Clooney) is released on probation from jail and first things first: he starts high-rolling his latest heist scheme by rounding up the usual suspects through his buddy, Rusty (Pitt.) Their diabolical plan is to rob three Las Vegas casinos in a single night, all from the same vault under the Bellagio. To do so, they need (almost) a dozen men and everything to go as planned.<br/><br/>That's the basic premise, but there is so much more richness to this movie that causes oodles of repeat watching.<br/><br/>Number one: Even though the chemistry is pitch perfect across the board, even involving enemies, its Clooney and Pitt that make this jump three levels. Their banter and understanding of each other while finishing each other's thoughts and sentences hasn't been seen since the 1950s. Usually that involved Cary Grant and a various female lead. Here, sexuality aside, these two cats had it down. They added humor, pose and you rooted for them every step of the way, even though, in reality, they're the bad guys.<br/><br/>Number Two: The remaining cast was excellent. Each held their own, each had their own depth. Not two alike. Damon was great as the nervous and up'n'coming'thieving Linus, brothers Virgil and Turk were played hilariously by Caan and Affleck and Jemison played the computer nerd wonderfully. Those are just four. Mark my words: EVERY SINGLE actor in this film was perfect in their respective roles. I could go on another 1,000 words on each one and not do them the justice they did for themselves.<br/><br/>Number Three: It's pure fantasy. I consider myself somewhat a Vegas Expert – I've been following, studying and visiting Sin City since I was about 13-15. THIS COULD NEVER HAPPEN. Even if one aspect of their master robbery plan would partially work, it would be thwarted in seconds. And that's part of the fun. You know this is unrealistic, yet, we're so drawn into it, it's extremely enjoyable. That's due to (#4 below) the dialogue and character depth that acts as a (no coincidence) diversion to the improbability of what's happening on screen.<br/><br/>Number Four: The dialogue was original, deep, snappy and quotable from line one. Speaking of which, those first two words spoken, by both the probation officer and repeated by Daniel Ocean, ""Good Morning"" seriously became my tagline, no matter the time of day. I would walk into Santisi Brothers, my local pub and watering hole for going on ten years and tell my favorite waitresses ""Good Morning."" I did it so much, that I didn't catch myself sometimes and some newbie's would tell me it was evening. I always replied, ""It's morning somewhere.""<br/><br/>I mention that story because this movie had such an impact on me, it became part of my subconscious. Oh, and there's plenty more lines I absolutely love: ""Whiskey. And whiskey."" ""I only lied about being a thief and I don't do that anymore. – Steal? – Lie."" ""All reds!"" There's more than a hundred more. Admittedly, some still go over my head including ones about the caper lifestyle I'm not familiar with. Though I can't necessarily follow what an ""Ella Fitzgerald"" is, it just proves how brilliant this movie is. (And no, I refuse to Google it. I love my ignorance and the movie's intelligence.) It's nice to revisit a movie and either hear/catch things I haven't before or enjoy the dialogue I did.<br/><br/>Number Five: I get cranky when it comes to Vegas-Themed movies. They rarely get it right – Con Air and 21 being the most offensive and misappropriated views of the city. This movie got it right. And it was gorgeous. Though now a (only a tad) bit dated – it's 9 years old, after all, it still captures the essence of the beautiful strip, inside the casino and out. It doesn't just take the finale in front of the Bellagio water fountains to tell you: they knew Vegas.<br/><br/>Number Six: Simply intelligence. This script was perfect. Rarely will I encounter such a well written, well rounded script from minute one to the end where they introduce Julia Roberts. Everything worked here, from dialogue, to interactions, to tension, to comedy. In a word: masterpiece in writing.<br/><br/>If you have yet to experience Ocean's Eleven, you are missing out on a modern classic. Whether or not you like George Clooney or Bad Guys as heroes, you will love this. This worked in 2001 and will be timeless enough to be shown in 2050 and have the same impact. SEE IT!"
"danielmanson","8","4","4","11 April 2020"," Great heist movie
","This film delivered more than what I was expecting. Plot was fantastic and kept me on edge several times as they were doing the heist, acting was great and overall it just really hooked me in.
Considering there was 11 in the squad as well I never lost track of the characters which is quite common in films which contain a lot of main characters. To sum up if you haven't watched yet I'd definitely give it a go. I'm going straight into the sequels now<br/><br/>Only real negative to this is that I just wasn't bothered by the romantic/love side of the plot. I could not care less if Clooney got his ex-wife back or not. It just seemed a bit pointless in the grand scheme of things. It didn't take anything away from the film, but it didn't hook me in as the heist did."
"annie_greer103","10","7","9","12 December 2005"," This film is about a group of men who come up with the idea to rob three of the largest casinos in Las Vegas.
","Cheating the System <br/><br/>In Oceans Eleven, cool colors are used throughout the entirety of the film because it helps calm the audience from then building suspense when the colors the actors are wearing are relaxing and soothing and because when the surroundings are not vibrant and explosive the mood seems to change and contradict the plot. However, Julia Roberts character, Tess, her clothing color choices are warm, which reveals the importance of her character.<br/><br/>My experience with this film has always been an enjoyable one. I have seen this film on various occasions, my first being at the local movie theater in town. I bought this movie when it first came out onto DVD for my sister. <br/><br/>The cool colors that the actors wore, mostly blues and greens and browns, were very soothing to the viewer. The characters had to keep their ""cool"" throughout the film because they had to pull off the impossible feat which was attempting to purloin three huge casinos in Las Vegas. By wearing certain colors they were able to keep the audience under control and not cause any hyperventilation from the insane unending suspense. For example, throughout the planning and the first steps of the actual Bellagio robbery attempt, the characters were faced with a few major dilemmas. After they got the person inside the container and inside the vault, they noticed that the person had placed a briefcase on top of the container, and since his breathing time was running out the other characters were forced to figure out how to get him out of the box, without bumping off the briefcase and without setting off any of the alarms. With the cool color choices, the low key lighting, keeping the scenes darker, and the cool colors, the characters were able to pull it off, without being forced into frantic.<br/><br/>The cold colors are not depressing at all due to the contradiction that they served. They were used throughout the film in not only the clothing choices but the scenery as well. All the furniture and props that were used all considered within the cool color range. They were all very relaxing and seemed very comfortable and soul soothing. For example, when they are in the room waiting for everything to follow through with the plan and waiting for the next person to do their part, the room has a ""cool"" feel.<br/><br/>However, the cool colors, the blues, greens, and purples, weren't always used appropriately for say through out the film. As previously mentioned Tess's character threw off the serene feel that the other characters were attempting to produce. She was commonly found wearing red. She was drawing attention to herself in hopes to throw off her ex-husband and sidetrack him so that he wouldn't be able to finish his task even though she didn't know exactly what he was up to. She was a symbol of what was at stake for Danny, who was played by George Clooney. He could loose her again if this whole thing flops, conversely he doesn't have her back. Her vibrancy is an obstacle that is being forced upon Danny. The real challenge for Danny may possibly not be to rob the casinos, but to be able to do so without the interference of his ex.<br/><br/>The movie Oceans Eleven has an overall uplifting theme that can make anyone smile."

","I've always had a low opinion of Frank Sinatra, so I've never seen the original version of ""Ocean's Eleven"", but the remake was pretty neat. The plot of course has ex-con Danny Ocean (George Clooney) getting eleven people to help him pull off a heist in Las Vegas. The neat factor mainly comes from their planning, which takes up most of the movie. Really cool performances from Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Bernie Mac, and everyone else, make this one neat movie. Apparently, it has a different ending than the original had, but obviously only those who have seen the original will even know that. Really cool. I have yet to see the sequel."
"john-life5","10","12","19","28 May 2007"," One of the Best Heist Movies Ever
","When you want to steal $160 million in cash from a huge casino in Vegas, you can either do it with force, or you can do it in a sneaky way. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his gang map out the casino and find a way to get down into the vault without anyone knowing what is going on until Rusty (Brad Pitt) calls the owner of the casino, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) to state the terms. A large reason for the heist was that Benedict was going out with Danny's sexy ex-wife (Julia Roberts) and he wanted her back. The key to Danny and Linus (Matt Damon) getting into the vault was a device that Basher (Don Cheadle) stole, a bomb powerful enough to wipe out the power of Las Vegas. Not many people would find a movie about stealing money entertaining, but the way that this one was made certainly can catch people's eye. I really think that it is one of the best of the new decade."
"exterminator_99","6","44","94","10 January 2002"," Making the most of an average concept
","Movie goers around the world undoubtably drooled at the prospect of a movie carrying four heavyweight, A-list actors and the hottest director of the moment.  ""Ocean's Eleven"", a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack caper, contains these expensive commodities.  Directed by Oscar winner Steven Soderbergh and starring (deep breath here...) George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon, this movie was sure to make Roadshow Entertainment a bucketload of money on the premise alone.  It has done so, and while it may not be the world's most original and inspiring movie, it is a solid piece of entertainment, pleasing critics and audiences alike.<br/><br/>Clooney is the title character, Daniel Ocean, a compulsive thief who has just been released from prison.  Upon leaving lock-up he has already devised a plan to knock off three of Las Vegas' biggest casino's, all in one night! Realsing he needs the best criminals in the business to pull off this massive heist he sets out on a sort of ""Dirty Dozen"" (minus one) round up of robbery genuises.<br/><br/>This ensemble of characters hits and misses.  Clooney is excellent as Ocean. He is classicly stylish, very smooth and ultra-cool.  Pitt plays Dusty Ryan, a card shark and general villan with a heart of gold.  Since ""Fight Club"", Pitt has chosen solid and varied roles.  His portrayl of Dusty is spot on, you instantly like the character and admire is style and charisma. Don Cheadle is great as Basher Tarr, pulling off a decent English accent as the explosives expert.  Scott Caan and Casey Afleck play Turk and Virgil Molloy and provide the comic relief of the film.  Matt Damon has an understated role as Linus Cauldwell, the pickpocket of the group.  Perhaps most memorable of all, despite his limited screentime is Elliot Gould as Reuben Tishkoff, an outrageously over the top former casino owner. Swathed in gold and diamonds and sporting some hideously cool sunglasses, he hams his role perfectly as the jewish millionaire.<br/><br/>Other characters are not as memorable or effective, but fulfill their roles enough to compensate for their lack of charisma.  Andy Garcia is effective as casino owner Terry Benedict.  It's great to see him back in an A-list move for the first time in a while.  Julia Roberts' role is small and more supporting that lead billing, but she plays Clooney's ex-wife to a tee.<br/><br/>Soderbergh has a firm grip on proceedings and the film only lapses in a few instances.  The quality of camerawork and the tightness of editing is commendable and as an audience we are thankful that it is Soderbergh in control and not some MTV-style, music video director.  His contribution ensures that the film delivers on both an entertainment and artistic level.<br/><br/>The film contains equal amounts of romance, laughs, action and dramatic tension and is enjoyable right the way along.  It may not be the best work of any of its key contributors but any film that can charm picky critics and audiences with a very small attention span is bound to be a hit.  Let's hope for more movies that can pull this difficult task off in the future."
"konover","5","9","15","16 November 2002"," You know, I don't get it.
","Ocean's 11 isn't a bad movie. It's just too familiar. Caper movies are caper movies, but Ocean's 11 acts like it's covering new ground when it isn't. I caught this movie at a dollar theater and I thought: Soderbergh? Clooney? Roberts? Pitt? Garcia? Gould? Cheadle? Damon? How could I go wrong?<br/><br/>
What follows is an extremely predictable series of events that I saw coming way before I was supposed to. For example, as soon as we find out Clooney used to be married to Julia Roberts and is now seeing Andy Garcia, we can easily see what will unfold an hour and change later. The Clooney-Roberts relationship is an unconvincing, tired cliche, and it takes the whole movie to show us the predictable results.<br/><br/>As soon as Clooney discusses his extravagant and unlikely plot, we know he's going to get away with it. And when the twist arrives, you just shrug and say ok. Soderbergh is one of my favorite directors and while he occasionally brings up the occasional vibrant scene, he can't get past what is easily one of the most predictable capers in recent times. Just about everything in the movie telegraphs its punches. <br/><br/>I also saw Heist and The Score, but those movies had dynamic dialogue, dynamic relationships, dynamic performances and enough verisimilitude to draw you into the caper and leave you wondering what the characters were going to get away with. The dynamic in Ocean's 11 is ""Look how cool we are."" There's very little danger. You never get the sense that the characters are real people and therefore we never really care about them. The only exception being Carl Reiner's Saul.<br/><br/>Clooney and company are fun to watch for the most part, but the story is strictly by-the-numbers entertainment with Soderbergh only occasionally pausing to inject some welcome Soderbergh-like visuals.<br/><br/>
All in all, it's not a total misfire, but it could've been trimmed and would've benefitted from an injection of humanity and originality. Highly recommended for people who haven't seen very many capers. Everyone else, don't expect the movie to blow you away."

I thought was cliche and dull.<br/><br/>Overall not bad, but not great.<br/><br/>On a sidenote, Cheadle's British accent I think is the worst attempt I've ever heard of it by any human never mind actor? So instant -1 just for that. Why not just have him be American or use an actual cockney actor if you must have that accent. So bad."

"MissCzarChasm","9","2","2","8 December 2001"," One Word: WOW
","When i first saw trailers for Oceans 11 i was amazed that they could get a cast like that into a film. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon are among Hollywood's elite and the lesser known actors such as Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Scott Caan, and Casey Affleck have made big impressions in other films that they appeared in. Whenever big hollywood actors are in a movie i always want to see if they're actually making a good movie or if they're just putting them together to make a profit and a bad film. Then i heard that Steven Soderbiergh was directing. By that time i was hooked because he directed one of my favorite films; Traffic. After all that time of waiting last night was the night. Opening Night with about 12 of my friends and a semi-packed theatre. After viewing the film i have to say my verdict is......<br/><br/>WHAT A DAMN FUN, ENTERTAINING, and CLEVER FILM. Words can't describe how much i loved it. These actors weren't in it just to make a profit they were in it to make a memorable film. I don't want to give any of the plot away because it's just too good but i will tell you what i liked and some things i didn't like about the film.<br/><br/>What I Liked:<br/><br/>George Clooney and Brad Pitt are the embodiment of charisma. I'm a straight male but there is no denying that these guys possess a lot of style and charm. Not to mention talent. I've always enjoyed George Clooney as an actor and with each film he does he becomes an even better actor. i've always been a fan of Brad Pitt as well. He's just seems like an everyday guy in his films. Very natural and laid back. He's truly at home in this role.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is uniformily good. To see Julia Roberts in a supporting role was odd at first but even in the few scenes she's in you can't deny that the girl has talent. Her scenes with Clooney are priceless. The dialouge in these scenes are suitably sassy and snappy. Don Cheadle and Bernie Mac making a lasting impression as well. Don Cheadle is becoming one of my favorite actors and Mac is obviously on his way with this film and his own hit TV show. Matt Damon is good in his role and his chemistry with Clooney during the last act provides us with some truly entertaining and hilarious moments. Andy Garcia makes for a truly suave villian in the film. I haven't seen him in much lately which is quite a shame because he's a wonderful actor. Scott caan and Casey Affleck are a dynamic duo. They provide some of the most hilarious moments in the film and it's because of their off-beat chemistry.<br/><br/>Soderbergh is a wonderful filmmaker. He has an obvious love of films and this aids him in making good movies. He knows all the tricks of the trade and he uses them throughout the film. Subtle things are also down through the use of music. Images fly over a hip soundtrack that give the film an edge. This is especially certain during the final few scenes. Soderbergh is probably one of the best directors of our generation.<br/><br/>Vegas is a pretty interesting back-drop for everything that goes on. Vegas is basically another character in the film and through Soderbergh's work on the film he gives it a life of its own.<br/><br/>The final half of the film is outstanding. So much is going on yet the story flows at a nice pace so we know what is exactly going on.<br/><br/>What I didn't Like:<br/><br/>I tihnk i only disliked one thing about this film. Some of the dialouge was a bit cheesy but what film doesn't have that. My major gripe in the film was Julia's lack of screentime. She's good in the scenes that she's in but because her character isn't well developed you don't really care about her plight. If julia wasn't playing her however i don't know if any other actress could make you almost care with the screentime that she possesses.<br/><br/>It's rare that i dislike one thing about a film. Ocean's 11 has already made it's way into my top twenty and it's most definitely the best film i've seen this year. Very nice work<br/><br/>9/10"
"peanutthegreat","1","22","46","18 May 2002"," Awful
","This is a really bad film. First of all, there is the acting. Most of it was rather dull, with the exceptions of Brad Pitt, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner, and  Andy Garcia. Even Matt Damon--one of my favorite modern actors--gave a dull performance. Clooney was the worst, as the arrogant thief who sets out to prove that it's okay to steal $160 million dollars, as long as its because some respectable businessman who works for his money dates your ex-wife while you are in jail. That is pretty much the theme to this film. Then there is the dialogue. It's just plain terrible (with a few good one-liners here and there, I must admit). Probably the worst dialogue comes at the very end (in Rusty's car). By far the worst scene was near the end, when the robbers are standing near the fountain, it was bad stuff. This film does not even compare to the original. Frank Sinatra is much, much more of an actor than Clooney is, and he's not conceited. The original was better, and the premise was better. I liked a group of army buddies with nothing to lose better than some guy trying to 'screw the guy thats screwing his wife' with a bunch of people he had never before met. The original had the far superior ending too."

","Why do modern movies not have original ideas? This movie is horrid. Everyone knows that this is a remake of the classic 1960 of the same name. There are so many things that are bad about this movie that I can only focus on the most egregious problems.<br/><br/>First - NO CHEMISTRY. That character development is so bad that you end up rooting for the casino! They try to portray the casino owner, who's supposed to be Steve Wynn, as some kind of jerk. I found him to be a sympathetic character. In a heist picture, you are supposed to have sympathy for the crooks. Otherwise, they are just jerks who decide to steal because they are too lazy to make an honest living. Well the movie makes the bad guys look like jerks, and the casino out to be the hero. One wag once said, ""Rooting for the Yankee's is like cheering for the house to win in Blackjack."" I found myself cheering for the house.<br/><br/>Second JULIA ROBERTS. She can't act, and is not beautiful. She is the source of the dramatic tension in the movie. I just don't get it.<br/><br/>Third TOTALLY PREDICTABLE ENDING. You just knew that the cops coming into the building were fake, and would walk out with the loot. There are so many plot holes, that it strained credulity. The originals plot was more believable, and it was not supposed to be realistic.<br/><br/>Fourth ACTORS LOOKED BORED. Clooney, Damon, and Roberts looked bored to tears. To me it was obvious that they were there to pick up a paycheck.<br/><br/>Overall, horrid, bad, terrible, disjointed. The only rip-off in this movie is to the people who paid to see it in the theater, or worse bought the DVD. I can't believe they made two sequels to this turd."

think even Frank, Dean, and Sammy would be happy with what Clooney and
director Steven Soderbergh did with it. It's nothing less than a crackerjack
caper film with a few stars to gaze at also.<br/><br/>The point in the original is that this was a film almost made as a lark for the
participants while the main players were appearing at the legendary Sands
Resort in Las Vegas. These were old army ranger buddies who decide to put their training to use and heist five casinos.<br/><br/>Clooney and buddy Brad Pitt's film has them in the Frank and Dean roles and they're a much more professional outfit who are only doing one of them. But it's the one Andy Garcia owns and Clooney has a score to settle
with him. He's taken Clooney's wife away played here ever so briefly by
Julia Roberts. In the original Angie Dickinson had the part. And it was also
a brief part.<br/><br/>Clooney and Pitt go out and recruit a crack team, some they know, some they don't. But it's a professional job and close run thing.<br/><br/>Garcia is in a part the equivalent of George Raft from the original. It was 
business for Raft and business for Cesar Romero the syndicate guy he hires
to find them. But Garcia's a nasty character who settles his own accounts.<br/><br/>The film has got a whole lot of nice touches stylistically and cast is expensive and first rate. For those familiar with the original the irony of that ending is replaced by something completely different. More in keeping
with George Clooney than Frank Sinatra.<br/><br/>Nevertheless I think the Chairman of the Board would like this Ocean's Eleven."

","Ocean's 11 (2001): Dir: Steven Soderbergh / Cast: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle: Disastrous remake starring George Clooney as a thief named Daniel Ocean (how clever). He is released from prison after serving time for being part of Batman and Robin, and immediately hooks up with fellow thief Brad Pitt to (ominous drum roll), rob a casino! The casino is owned by Andy Garcia playing Al Pacino and he is dating Julia Roberts who dumped Clooney due to his lifestyle. For every great film Steven Soderbergh makes he tops it with sh*t. For example, Traffic is terrific while Erin Brockovich is overrated garbage. One can suppose that this is his bad counter to his effective Out of Sight. The cast sleepwalk through the charade with Roberts embarrassing in her pitiful grinning in the backseat bull- crap when she accepts the redeeming Clooney. Yet we are suppose to be proud that they pulled together a cast that play like a high school class of roll call. The original film isn't much better with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin leading a large cast through the same charade. The remake is so much worse in its pointless bull and yet somehow this garbage managed to gain popularity. This is one that Soderbergh doesn't score high in terms of character driven writing, but it can claim to be one of the year's very worst films. Score: 0 / 10"

","Steven Soderbergh, a really good director who (deservedly) won for Traffic, comes back with a type of film sort of remenicent of Out of Sight (mainly in style and humor which is low key but cool) but also a remake of the 1960 caper film with Frank Sinatra.  Here, Clooney plays a recently released inmate who schemes with Pitt to gather up a crew total of 11 (it might seem more, I lost count) to rob three casinos in Las Vegas all owned by Garcia. It goes through the motions almost too easily, yet this movie shouldn't be taken totally seriously as how Soderbergh most likely intended.  A good, enjoyable flick, not as great The Score of even the recently released Heist, but still worthwhile.

Boy, this is Liberal heaven with George Clooney, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner, etc. <br/><br/>The story is a bit too technical in spots with little time for the viewer to digest the heist plan with all its intricacies.

","I went to see Ocean's 11, and boy do I wish I had the $9.50 and two hours of life refunded. The film was boring, and the story or the ""perfect crime"" has been done to death. At least with the original it was entertaining. The original Oceans 11 all had criminals and con artists, that depended on each other to pull off this heist. The new Oceans 11 was a simple cakewalk on how to rob the MGM Grand vault. In my opinion the previews were better than the movie, at least they left some mystery and intrigue about this group. However, the story that was told was boring, and it was no more than a bunch of actors developing their characters very poorly. I was especially surprised by Julia Roberts performance, her character was especially poorly developed. Her performance was shallow, and there was a lack of history and future with her character. The one big problem I have with this film is that the ending is very vague, they leave it wide open for a sequel, which really disturbs me, if the first one was so badly done.<br/><br/>In closing I would like to let you all know that I would rather be nibbled to death by rabid ducks than watch this movie ever again."

","Pretty much can some up this movie in one word. Clever. It is a typical crime/heist movie, with just a packed cast. But the thing I liked most about this movie, was that it managed to be a crime/heist movie, and comedy. But not cheap jokes, these were nice and classy jokes, I really liked the comedy because it was original. Also, the comedy in this movie was well balanced, they did not over due it as to turn it into some storyless circus. What really threw this movie up in the sky was it's outstanding cast, I mean ""Oh Man!"" tons of great of actors (and actress, Julia Roberts) from all over the place. It's insane. I actually have trouble putting this movie into words. All I can say is that it's clever, original (well even though it's a remake, you know what I mean), and well made. I suggest you go see it. However, I do not look upon this movie as highly as it is proclaimed to be. It is definately a good movie, but that's as far as it goes. A good movie."
"Bigbert","4","3","5","11 November 2003"," Boring movie with no ending to speak off
","I was expecting quite a lot from this movie and boy was I disappointed. This is a boring story with very bleak performances by actors who don't really seem to be willing to do anything but just read their lines. The 'action' is sleep invoking and you don't even care that anything could go wrong. You can't help comparing it with the original and although that was not the best of movies it stands with head and shoulders above this remake. The Rat Pack version did have the different casino's they robbed, but here it was all compiled into one 'megavault' that seems to be able to be cracked by a granny in between her nap and afternoon tea. There's nothing original about this movie and as said the actors are much underused. The ending is even more boring than the rest of the movie. The cast (sans Clooney and Roberts) just stand there in a line looking at nothing for about ten minutes and then look at each other as if to say 'are we supposed to have any lines in this scene'. Looking at the line-up I even wondered who half of them were as I probably just blinked when their brief appearance was up.<br/><br/>Again the original has a wonderful ending, actually together with the original Italian Job's ending my top favourite ending for a caper movie. Give this one a miss and watch the original; at least there you have the chemistry between Sinatra and co (Ã¡nd a proper ending)."

","One of the coolest movies in recent memory Ocean's 11 is a stamp of authority on the part of director Steven Soderberg. Starring an ensemble cast and with the assistance of some great background music and cinematography Ocean's 11 is top notch entertainment. The movie provides an engaging two hours that develops in exactly the manner one would expect from this sort of production. The storyline, while certainly not a masterpiece of plotting (there are numerous holes, some of which are rather large), offers enough to keep audiences guessing and to inject a little tension into an otherwise harmless and lightweight enterprise. There are also sufficient moments of comedy to maintain an upbeat tone. And, of course, there are plenty of familiar faces, starting with Clooney and Brad Pitt in the lead roles, and going all the way down to Julia Roberts in a rare supporting performance. Unmissable work by the always reliable Soderberg."

"classicsoncall","8","2","3","13 February 2018"," ""It will be nice working with proper villains again.""
","That's Don Cheadle's character, Basher Tarr, in my summary quote above, but when I check the cast of characters on the IMDb title page for this movie, he shows up in an uncredited role. No excuse for that, without his 'pinch' contraption, the Ocean crew wouldn't have been able to pull it off.<br/><br/>Well, the whole idea is wildly implausible, but just like the 1960 original with Frank Sinatra as Danny Ocean, this is a highly entertaining and often amusing flick. It's probably a toss-up as to which film had the bigger celebrity cast; for me it's hard to top the original Rat Pack. And just like the original, virtually nothing goes wrong in the execution of the plan here to rob three Las Vegas casinos. Not very credible, but if you put that aside, you get lots of commendable support from George Clooney's band of supporting players. Taking things literally though, one must take exception to the movie's brief description, again on the picture's IMDb title page. It refers to 'Danny Ocean and his eleven accomplices, but if you're paying attention, the eleven includes Ocean himself. If you want to make a case for Julia Roberts, go ahead, but she didn't have anything to do with the caper.<br/><br/>With it's writing and flashier style, this 2001 remake does come across somewhat better head to head against Sinatra's crew, but that decision can be made by the viewer. I enjoyed both actually, and this one had enough going for it that it makes me curious to catch the two sequels, Ocean's Twelve and Thirteen. They're coming up soon on my watch list."

","Too many times, films that contain a lot of ""flash"" or ""style"" are lacking in one particular area: ""substance"". This is where ""Ocean's 11"" rises above the mold in its ability to put a fantastic plot to all the pizzaz.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Ocean's 11"" sees master thief Danny Ocean (George Clooney) get out of prison and embark on a new thieving expedition...the Bellagio Hotel owned by casino mogul Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). In order to tackle the monumental task, Ocean puts together a burglar's ""Dream Team"" (starring the likes of Brad Pitt, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, & Matt Damon, among others).<br/><br/>This movie primarily succeeds because it does so many things well. For example...<br/><br/>-The casino-robbing plot line is intriguing and never really gets old or stale. Something is always happening that keeps your attention.<br/><br/>-The characters create such great chemistry with each other that they are a joy to watch. The subtle humor embedded in the interplay between such characters also lends some needed lightness.<br/><br/>-For those who like ""glamour"" films (e.g. guys in sharp suits cracking wise, flashing lights, Vegas atmosphere, etc.), this one will remain in your video library!<br/><br/>Overall, ""Ocean's 11"" is a fun caper movie that does a lot of things well. It can be enjoyed by the ""thinking person"", or the movie-watcher who just wants a large dose of excitement."
"Semisonic","6","2","3","21 September 2016"," More glitter than gold
","You know this type of people whose broad and most sincere smile only means that they have come up with some tricky scheme to screw you over? Well, George Clooney seems to be that kind of a person. Once you see his smug face, you can definitely be sure that whatever you buy that he's selling is gonna be the truest of fake.<br/><br/>Now add some serious cast, including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts (still in her prime), a convoluted heist plot, and enough reason to dislike the bad guy - and you'll be literally waiting for our A-Team to succeed and cheering when it does. Yes, it does indeed. Did you really doubt that for a second?<br/><br/>Ocean's Eleven, released in 2001, still belongs to that (hopefully) gone era of Hollywood cinema when easy was fun and style was enough to substitute substance. And damn, how in style this film goes! All shiny and sparkling, with enough fun little twists and moments of humor, with Clooney and Pitt exchanging impeccable smiles and snappy one-liners, with a sleek kingpin of an antagonist and his dumb nitwit minions - and of course with the charm of Las Vegas and its vibe of easy money and endless entertainment - Ocean's Eleven makes you feel like a spectator at a very expensive and exclusive show.<br/><br/>But that era is over, and even the general audience is into trying to dig a film's surface, not necessarily deep but enough to expect a second layer to show itself. And that sort of thing Ocean's Eleven is kinda short of. The big talent is wasted on walking around, looking perfect and sounding confident, while the only character carrying at least some emotional charge is the usual suspect of a good person's ex-wife and a bad person's current love interest. So we can only thank Julia Roberts for being a good actress enough to make those small things count and show a variety of emotions on her face. Because it seems that the rest of the stellar cast only took a single facial expression with them on stage.<br/><br/>It is said that a casino is built like a labyrinth to keep visitors in. Huge, loud and blinking, but still a labyrinth. And so does this film, like a race through a maze, try to keep you thinking of anything but its essence. The truth is, the real essence of this movie is not Mr Clooney's smile or the wads of cash he and his friends try to steal. It's that fir-shaped car air freshener that is shown to us for long enough to suspect some bizarre case of product placement. A screamingly strong-smelling piece of unidentified material that doesn't really make the air enjoyable for breathing but instead is only suitable for distracting you from realizing how stale and stuffy it is. Well, you could of course let yourself be fooled for the whole ride, but it's much healthier not to take it at all in the first place."
"JamesHitchcock","6","2","3","24 December 2009"," Thou Shalt Steal
","In recent years George Clooney has produced or directed a number of films such as ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" or ""The Men who Stare at Goats"", most of which reflect his left-liberal political convictions. These convictions are not, however, always so well reflected in his choice of films as an actor. Witness, for example, the macho action-thriller ""The Peacemaker"". Or, for that matter, ""Ocean's Eleven"", a caper film which- like all caper films- preaches the message that ""Greed is Good"" and which- like an increasing number of modern examples of the genre- adds a further message to the effect that ""Crime does Pay"".<br/><br/>Here Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, a career criminal who comes up with a plan to rob a vast sum of money the vaults of three Las Vegas casinos, the Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand. Now the man in the street might think this scheme to be a thoroughly dishonest one, but for the purposes of the film we are expected to regard it as a highly laudable enterprise because the owner of the three casinos, Terry Benedict, is portrayed as an unpleasant, thuggish gangster. Benedict is also the current lover of Danny's ex-wife, Tess, so under the moral code which governs caper movies Danny has two quite legitimate reasons to steal from him with a clear conscience.<br/><br/>Now the Las Vegas gambling scene may have been under the control of the Mob back in the days of Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky, but I always understood that these days the Nevada Gaming Commission are keen to keep it squeaky-clean and to exclude anyone with criminal connections from having anything to do with running the casinos. It therefore seemed odd that the film-makers could, without falling foul of the laws of libel, imply that three major casinos (all of which are real institutions) are owned and run by an obviously crooked individual like Benedict. It seemed even odder that the real owners of the Bellagio welcomed the film and allowed the team to shoot on location. It seems that in some businesses any publicity is good publicity.<br/><br/>I won't go into details of Danny's scheme to relieve Benedict of some of his ill-gotten wealth, except to say it is extremely complicated in order to overcome the casinos' elaborate security precautions. (You probably have to watch the film several times to understand it fully). Suffice it to say that it is so complicated that Danny needs to recruit no fewer than ten former colleagues and other criminals, each with his own special skills, in order to pull it off- hence the title of the film. To British eyes the title ""Ocean's Eleven"" would appear to have sporting overtones, as both soccer and cricket are played between teams of eleven men, but as both sports are much less popular in America than they are here these overtones were presumably unintended.<br/><br/>Given such a large cast, it is not surprising that there is no serious attempt made at characterisation and hence no really outstanding acting performances. Although the film was made with an ensemble cast, however, the film-makers managed to attract a surprisingly large number of big-name stars, including not only those two great male sex-symbols Gorgeous George and Beau Brad but also the likes of Julia Roberts, Elliott Gould, Andy Garcia and Don Cheadle.<br/><br/>""Ocean's Eleven"" is a slick, glossy piece of popular entertainment- a sort of superior popcorn movie; I enjoyed it more than the rather dull sequel ""Ocean's Twelve"". (I must admit that I have not seen either ""Ocean's Thirteen"", the third episode in the franchise, or the original Rat Pack ""Ocean's Eleven"" from 1960). My main concern about it is its apparent rewriting of the Ten Commandments so that the eighth now reads ""Thou Shalt Steal"". It is by no means unique in that respect among modern films, but at least the likes of ""Entrapment"" were honest about their own dishonesty. ""Ocean's Eleven"" seems to be going out of its way to justify theft and robbery provided that the owner of the stolen property is sufficiently unpleasant to make him a legitimate target. 6/10"

","After the (2001) Ocean's Eleven re-make they should have left it alone. Lightning struck, but not twice unfortunately. Having a second time around where they get 'caught' by Garcia's character is slightly more than just a little embarrassing. Get my meaning from the spelling there?! It made them look like a bunch of 'Wussies'. <br/><br/>That is how silly this new Ocean's twelve is. The biggest thing for me about this is that I like these players. They all brought a ton of talent and pulled this thing 'off' with incredible style and ease. With the first remake, not only were the camera-film shots very pleasing and artistic in set up, but also complete in story view/telling. The lines felt as if they were straight out of ""the book of cool"" from the sixties, only with a current 'pop' to them. Pitt was perfect. Always sporting a good appetizer platter with him and a well-delivered line not too much, not too little, just right. Along with Clooney and the rest, just fell solidly into place. Epic, right down to the soundtrack that blended into the foreground and back drop, bounced and moved along in and out with a silky-groove-dream sequence sensibility. The score (music) was the additional character that should have made that one 'Ocean's twelve'.<br/><br/>The story I thought had graduated into current times and left the sixties version at a deficit. <br/><br/>The interaction between the players from the two Utah brothers,(Caan and Affleck) who were more like elementary school kids than skilled heist men, that was obviously part of the fun! To the blackjack dealer with attitude (Bernie Mac-man) Clooney's Danny Ocean was one of the funnest characters he has had along with other good supporting guys (Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner) they all were top drawer in this hip-heist film. It was an 'edgy' story that made it out alive...Then they had to make a sequel. How many sequels truly make it. Probably less then more. Anything to make money right? Naw, couldn't be, ""We're having a lot fun!"" They said. Well good deal for them, but in the mean-time write something else good, and or original. <br/><br/>But for me this is a library addition keeper of a good time. Ocean's is tops. (****)"

","At plain sight, is a pretty standard heist movie. A couple of leaders that wants to do the heist, the recruitment of the people needed with their special abilities, establishing the heist for the spectator and the action.<br/><br/>But what's different here is how perfect everything is. The cast is insane, because it's not just about being good actors with these type of movies. You need certain glamour, flair, that can give flavour to the often rigid story related to the heist itself and the required details for it to work and matter. That space given to the actors to spice up the needed exposition is the key to separate themselves from the mediocre ones. The editing and score are important to make the exposition as dynamic as possible too. Finally, the action in the third act has to create tension and surprises related to the original plan, and in this one, is created with perfect timing and subtlety.

","Smart, stylish & sophisticated, Ocean's Eleven is a sneaky delight that brims with a fun vibe & moves ahead with a carefree attitude, is jam-packed with colourful set of characters who are expertly brought to life by its charismatic cast, and is all the more strengthened by the smooth chemistry they share with each other.<br/><br/>The story of Ocean's Eleven follows Danny Ocean who, the moment he is out of prison on parole, begins concocting his next robbery. Needing a team of skilled accomplices to carry out his highly ambitious mission, he enlists the help of an old friend and puts together a team of 11 accomplices, all of whom must work together to carry out the heist successfully.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film doesn't waste much time in setting up its premise and keeps adding new characters without slowing down the plot. Soderbergh directs each segment with a playful tone and keeps the lighthearted nature of the story alive at all times. The writing is sleek, witty & energetic although the central core of the narrative isn't strong enough.<br/><br/>Las Vegas is captured in all its glory, thanks to its exotic shooting locations, well-carved set pieces, vibrant photography, swift camera-work, bright lighting, trendy costumes & numerous aspects that only help in uplifting the film's opulent look n feel. Music also carries a groovy element although it isn't anything memorable.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Ocean's Eleven features a charismatic ensemble in George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck & others, with both Clooney & Pitt impressing the most. Bringing his charming screen persona into play, Pitt delivers a show-stealing performance but Clooney isn't far behind plus the chemistry between these two is one of the film's main highlights.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Ocean's Eleven is an enjoyable, entertaining & sufficiently satisfying delight that promises lots of fun throughout its 117 minutes runtime and, for the most part, successfully delivers it. The lack of seriousness only takes it so far and while it's certainly missing the element that makes a good film great, Ocean's Eleven nevertheless manages to sideline its shortcomings with a thrilling climax that lives up to its expectations."

","Eleven men convene to pull off the greatest con in the history of Las Vegas: lifting three casinos (the Mirage, the MGM Grand, and the Bellagio). This becomes the monumental task for ""Ocean's Eleven"", masterminded by Danny Ocean. Danny and his right-hand man Rusty ""Russ"" Ryan assign the remaining nine men various jobs based on their individual specialties. The owner of the casinos is the merciless Terry Benedict, with whom Danny's ex-wife Tess is now in a relationship. The degree of risk in this grand heist is all too great; one tiny mistake or one lapse of concentration can cause the whole scam to backfire. Assuming everything goes according to plan, the numerical figure is just above $160 million.<br/><br/>The casting of ""Ocean's Eleven"" could not have been any better! The handsome George Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, and the beautiful Julia Roberts plays Tess; their sharp, witty dialogue exchanges are invaluable. The dignified Andy Garcia brilliantly portrays Terry Benedict, ""the enemy"". Not to mention Brad Pitt as the constantly-eating celebrity-poker instructor Rusty Ryan; Matt Damon as the skilled pickpocket Linus Caldwell; Shaobo Qin as the limber Chinese acrobat Yen; Elliott Gould as the swaggering big-shot financier Reuben Tishkoff; Carl Reiner as the convincing flimflam man Saul Bloom; Bernie Mac as the suave blackjack dealer Frank Catton; Don Cheadle (uncredited, for some reason) as the British explosives expert Basher Tarr; Eddie Jemison as the unnerved surveillance expert Livingston Dell; and Casey Affleck & Scott Caan as ""white trash"" bickering twins Virgil & Turk Malloy, drivers/bellhops/valets/bodyguards/paramedics/""balloon boys""/etc.<br/><br/>My favorite moments from ""Ocean's Eleven"" include the following. Near the end of the picture, Danny's ten comrades walk toward the famous Bellagio fountains and watch the show, to the accompaniment of a beautiful piece of music by Claude Debussy. After squeezing his small, flexible frame inside a cash cart, Yen shows his appreciation to Russ for offering him a magazine. Danny and Linus nervously strap themselves to the top of the vault elevator shaft, which is rigged with motion sensors. When Danny and some of his crew arrive at the California Institute of Advanced Science (in order to steal a ""pinch""), Linus expresses disgust at having to remain inside the van with the Malloy twins; having had enough of their quarreling, Linus escapes the van and enters the building, only to be chased by security, forcing him to jump from the roof onto the van. At Reuben's gaudy residence, Danny explains to his crew the layout of the entire scam, illustrated by computer animation. A tense moment occurs when Danny and Linus prepare to blow up the vault door while Yen's bandaged hand is stuck in the door from inside the vault! The brief blackout causes a massive free-for-all in the boxing ring and on the casino floors. During the celebrity five-card draw game, Topher shows his hand: ""All reds!"" And finally, I love the three flashbacks as Reuben describes to Danny & Russ the top three failed casino heists.<br/><br/>In closing, I cannot write a commentary of ""Ocean's Eleven"" without expressing my highest praise for the brilliant music score of David Holmes. The music keeps the picture driving along at a respectable pace and keeps the audience interested. Some of my favorite musical moments from this film include: Danny exiting the prison during the opening credits; Linus' first appearance in the subway; Livingston disguised as security personnel infiltrating the casino security hallways and eventually losing his way; the ""S.W.A.T. team"" leaving the casino carrying the bags of money; Linus jumping onto the van from a rooftop; the end of the lunch scene at Reuben's residence, leading into Frank Catton's migration to Vegas and the introduction of the Malloy twins; and finally, ""Caravan"" and ""Blues in the Night"" accompanying the respective introductions of Yen and Saul. What a fantastic music score!"

","By C.J. Cauley<br/><br/>The city of Newport, Kentucky played host to the very first theater screening of the 2001 version of Ocean's Eleven.  While Frank Sinatra starred in the film's predecessor in 1960, Kentucky native, George Clooney, takes the helm this time around.  The premiere was a red carpet event with Johnny Bench, Marty Brennaman and other local Cincinnati celebrities basking in the limelight.  The highlight of the event was the hosts, George's parents, Nick and Nina Clooney.  Nick Clooney is one of the most recognizable celebrities in Cincinnati, having been a newscaster there for many years and currently hosting his own radio show.  Nina quipped ""I used to be known as Nick Clooney's wife, now I'm known as George Clooney's mom."" Not a bad gig if you can get it.  The couple were absolutely beaming about their son's latest premiere and I soon found out it was with good reason.<br/><br/>When his elders stepped out of the theater to prepare for their trip to Los Angeles for the official premiere, the younger Clooney stepped on screen as Danny Ocean.  Recently paroled after four years in prison, Ocean sets out to gather up some old partners in crime to pull off the perfect heist: rob a vault that contains over $160 million from three different casinos. Hustlers, con men and pickpockets come together with experts in surveillance, electronics and explosives.  At the center of the conspiracy are Ocean and his best friend, Dusty Ryan, played by Brad Pitt.  All together, they add up to eleven which was about six too many.  When you have that many people in that short amount of time you don't really get a chance to know them or care about them which is unfortunate because they are quite the group of misfits.  The criminals included everyone from relative newcomers Casey Affleck and Scott Caan to phenomenal talent like Matt Damon, Don Cheadle and the legendary Carl Reiner.<br/><br/>Andy Garcia plays Harry Benedict, also known as the bad guy.  One of the richest men in Las Vegas, he owns the three casinos in question.  To top it all off, he is dating Ocean's ex-wife, Tess, played by Julia Roberts. Clooney is out to win her back and put Benedict in his place in the process. Roberts was believable as Clooney's love interest but he was not believable as hers.  While she made goo-goo eyes at him, he stared at her more like a little sister.  It was the only part of Clooney's performance that I didn't buy.  Garcia, however, played the fuming, jealous lover to a tee.  The resident pickpocket, Linus Caldwell, played by Damon, was the newest and seemingly untrusted member of the group.  This was touched on only briefly, however, because the two hour time limit was not enough to expound on this part of the story.   I also found it odd that 37-year-old Pitt referred to 31-year-old Damon as the ""kid.""  The real kids were the Malloy twins played by Affleck and Caan.  While they also offered some comedy relief, it was the cast's two older entries who turned out to be it's best.  Elliot Gould shines as the financial backer of this band of would-be thieves and Carl Reiner is fantastic as the Saul Bloom, the grandfather of the group.<br/><br/>Pitt gave his usual two-dimensional performance but the chemistry he had with Clooney made up for a lot of that.  They played off each other with excellent comedic timing.  Clooney gave an excellent performance even though it wasn't much of a stretch from previous roles like that in the Peacemaker or Out of Sight.  There will be no Oscar nominations for acting in the future for Ocean's Eleven but the large ensemble cast will not leave you disappointed.  Their quick quips amuse throughout.  One scene between Damon and Bernie Mac and another with cameos by TV heartthrobs including Joshua Jackson and Topher Grace are highlights of the flick.  Unfortunately, Roberts is the only female in the cast, aside from a cameo by Holly Marie Combs as herself.  But, it was great to see that the current Ocean's Eleven is lacking the disgusting misogynist tone set by Sinatra and his rat pack friends in the 60s version.  Back then the women were 'dames,' they were an annoyance and worst of all, pushovers.  No such ridiculous stereotypes rear their ugly heads in this pleasantly updated version.  Despite the time restraints that restricted the storyline, Ocean's Eleven really hits the jackpot."

","Literally fresh out of prison, Danny Ocean is busy setting up a seemingly impossible robbery. The plan, along with ten other experts he has roped in, is to rob the main vault at Las Vegas that houses the takings from the three main casinos.<br/><br/>The original Ocean's 11 released in 1960 is an OK film, more watchable for the Vegas setting and the irrepressible cast of Rat Packers than for any purpose or structure. That this Steven Soderbergh remake trumps the original in every department is a triumph of entertainment values over pure star appeal. Some would put a case up for the cast of Soderberg's film using stars to entice the audience in? But really at the time of release it was a stretch to put George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon (all excellent here) on the same pedal stool as Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin.<br/><br/>The most striking thing about this remake is that the whole cast seem to be enjoying themselves, mainly because they are not being asked to over exert their performances from their very astute director, they really are just asked to turn up, enjoy each other's company and deliver one of the coolest pictures to have been made in the decade.<br/><br/>The film is purely out there to entertain, it has geniality pouring out from every frame, this is a character based heist caper full of laughs and derring do shenanigans - even Don Cheadle's ill advised (and pointless character arc) cockney accent manages to create smiles instead of being an on going hindrance. Some critics said the film is far too shallow to have any real worth! What the hell do they want? So the crooks are nice guys, it's a refreshing change to see a Vegas sparkling bright without any seedy undercurrents, where these robbers aren't using AK 47s to obliterate the opposition, it's wits and dashes of cool that fills out their respective armouries.<br/><br/>The soundtrack and scoring are themselves cool characters in the piece, whilst a big shout out goes to the bona fide stunt work from the wonderfully elastic Shaobo Qin - which merely puts another cherry on this already delightful cake. All the cast (too many to mention) are great, from Andy Garcia's suave and mean boss, Terry Benedict, to Julia Roberts' (walking like a goddess) Tess Ocean, all things in the film deliver a feel good movie that when all put together, and all things considered, is a film made by lovers of the medium for, well yes, lovers of the medium itself! 9/10"

","Steven Soderbergh did not have a let-down after his amazing 2000 with this outstanding remake which runs rings around the ho-hum original. There are three casinos in Las Vegas that have all their money stored in one place deep underneath the city's streets. Enter the paroled George Clooney who is out to take all that money for himself. Of course this is a heist and a few good men who know what they are doing are needed to carry out the job. Now enter Brad Pitt, Elliott Gould, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan and a few others and you have a group in place that could make this whole elaborate scheme work. Of course casino owner Andy Garcia is not the easiest guy in the world to steal from and keep in mind that Julia Roberts is along for the ride as well. The film is highly intelligent, ultra-slick, very cool and just plain outstanding. Steven Soderbergh continues to show that he is a high-class director that is here to stay. 4.5 out of 5 stars."

","Worthy remake of the famous rat pack caper found a whole new pack taking over from Sinatra and the boys with Steven Soderbergh at the helm. Oceans Eleven is a glitzy, snazzy, and most importantly, fun recreation of the classic bank robbery film. The production value alone keeps everything shimmering along quite nicely, but it is the first rate cast, directed through Soderbergh's experienced lens that takes the infectiously entertaining piece over the top.<br/><br/>In less skilled hands the film still would have been a fun, if unnecessary comedy caper diversion, but with this cast and crew becomes one of the most easily digestible and classy pieces of adult fluff entertainment to emerge post-millennium. Sure, the smug ensemble cast tends to wear a little thin after a while, but they are directed in such an entertainingly concise way that their indulgences become our own. Whatever doubt one may cast in the face of so many Hollywood A-listers gathered together to competitively mug the camera becomes cast aside after realizing how smooth the direction really is.<br/><br/>Deceptively elegant, the Las Vegas cinematography compliments Soderbergh's smooth transitions perfectly. For all the late-game revelations that joyously unfold as the robbery occurs, the director really got to shine leading up to that elaborate heist. It is in the seductive filming of this outlandish proposal that elevates the crime comedy to a level of class film of this caliber rarely achieves present day."

","A remake of the 1960 Rat Pack version, OCEAN'S ELEVEN is about eleven men involved in robbing a Las Vegas casino vault on the night of a big boxing match--when the vault's contents will be at their highest, around $150 million. The leader of this heist is Danny Ocean (George Clooney), fresh out of jail, and his right-hand man is Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt). Things become more complicated as we learn that the owner of the casino in question, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), is involved with Danny's ex-wife Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts). The plan unfolds bit by bit, and ultimately unravels in a thrilling conclusion.<br/><br/>*possible spoilers*<br/><br/>OCEAN'S ELEVEN isn't really meant to be a thinking movie, but it does what it comes to do very well. It's a fun popcorn movie, that's really slick and very stylish and cool. Aside from the fact that this could never happen in real life, the movie makes the heist and all of the details of it seem brilliant. Of course the outcome of it is entirely predictable, but the fact that the whole plan unravels perfectly is very impressive. The movie is a ton of fun to watch.<br/><br/>Though this is a big ensemble movie (and with a great cast, too), there's no definitive star. There are a lot of big names, but one of the biggest, Julia Roberts, doesn't get a lot of screen time and has a minor role (an unnecessary and irrelevant one, as well). All of the cast does excellently, though. They aren't given a lot to work with except sit back and look cool, but they pull it off perfectly. Brad Pitt has probably the coolest role, with George Clooney in second.<br/><br/>OCEAN'S ELEVEN won't provide many twists in the plot or even real substance, but there's a lot of flash and it's very fun to watch. Excellently cast and a great ensemble. 7/10."

1. this is all to gain back his lover and screw owner of casino(what?just because he can) seems like money is not important and it seems like an unbelievable motive to literally risk life and i dont see how doing something that the person left you for is supposed to get them back<br/><br/>2.No chemistry between characters pretty much act as individuals
3. unrealistic
4. tbh it felt as if a fog was covering the whole movie because it just seemed hazy like i knew i was watching it but i felt super detached
Sure it was cool when they walked right out but the rest of the movie is just a complete muddle I would go as far as saying I don't really get the purpose for this movie. In my opinion there is no reason to watch it. Julia Robert is barely in it and her role i understand just seems a shame to give such a good actress such a lame role."

"Lumpenprole","Null","2","4","5 June 2003"," lightheaded heist
","I admire some of Soderbergh's films - The Limey especially.  I went into Ocean's 11 having heard that it wasn't much more than a celebrity parade dressed up with a heist plot and some nice camera work.  It probably should have ended with the homage to The Right Stuff where the gang seems to evaporate in front of the Vegas fountain.  Packing the expensive talent into a pointless epilogue drained most of the goodwill I had left for the film.<br/><br/>Some of the things I hated were - the lighting of Julia Roberts in her first scene was  bad.  Why give her a mongo upper-lip shadow?  Farting away the whole `Pitt is mad at Clooney for making the job personal' with a single line was  okay I guess, since I really didn't care about the subplot at that point.  It's a good thing electronic components can just bounce back from an EMP.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the script did stay ahead of any expectations I had as far as the particulars of the heist (which was kept vague anyway - when the film was over, I couldn't say where the vault was in relation to the casino floor or the surveillance room, whereas I could draw you a map of the heists in Rififi, Asphalt Jungle, Topkapi or The Red Circle).  I loved Eliot Gould. Andy Garcia was beamed in from a better movie - all of the other actors are winking at the camera and striking poses in their gloriously outlandish outfits.  I love and admire long takes, but I do occasionally get a caffeine kick out of editing that looks like it was snipped from footage taken by a swarm of bees.  With all the rumors around right now about remaking some of the most unique accomplishments in film history, I really appreciate the fact that Soderbergh decided to breath some life and style into what was a `meh' title.<br/><br/>Ocean's is like People magazine getting stuffed into a decent Bond film. Nothing wrong with that."

","This movie is about a punk ex-con who is bitter about losing his girlfriend to someone more successful than himself. <br/><br/>I personally didn't care for anyone of the characters.  Carl Reiner was the best of the lot.  They were way too bland and because there were so many involved in the heist they didn't have enough time to develop the characters.<br/><br/>I expected more.  There was hardly any action or suspense.  Basically a dialogue movie.  And the only dialogue was ""are you in?""  ZZZZZZZZZ. Did any of you think for one second the plan would fail?  Personally I wished it did.  Clooney's character was a punk.  Get over it you are a loser ex-con and lost your girlfriend to someone who was more successful than you.<br/><br/>3000 Miles to Graceland was a similar movie that didn't get the positive reviews this movie got and was far more intense and action packed.  The performances were better too.  NO ONE can say that Clooney was better than Costner.  NO ONE.  This movie got great reviews because of two things:  an excellent cast and Soderberg the director.  In my opinion go rent 3000 Miles to Graceland if you can take a lot of violence and foul language (the only reason for poor reviews)."

","When I saw this film, I thought ""Well, that's a surprisingly old-fashioned, lighthearted heist movie! It doesn't really have a 2001 feel to it, reminds me a lot of classical sixties movies, how quaint!"" As it turns out, my feeling that this could have come straight from the 1960s was right - now I know that it is in fact a remake of a 1960 movie. And there's nothing wrong with it. It is entertaining enough, very slick, with well-known actors who seem to have fun, but of course also rather shallow and predictable. Even most of the ""surprises"" are rather unsurprising to viewers who know the kind of calculated plot twists typical for such movies. Therefore I don't quite get the high praise received by ""Ocean's Eleven"" as some kind of outstanding and most original movie; these are not its qualities. So I think that the current user consensus with a 7,7 rating here is fitting and give it an 8/10 for what it is, a well-polished heist comedy without any particular depth to it."

In the scene where Dany and the staff next to him entered the safe, the Chinese man would have been seriously injured if they had not detonated the bomb a little late. The movie also strikes the fact that some people's religion is money. ""If I gave you $ 160 million, would you give up the Thesis?"" Actually, this question is asked to the audience secretly somewhere. Which of you would give up your lover / spouse !!!.<br/><br/>The music is exactly the kind that reflects the spirit of this kind of movies.

The aspect I enjoy most in this flick is the overall light atmosphere given to a very serious act (robbing a casino in Vegas). Clooney and Pitt make an awesome tag team of dry humor and brilliant masterminds of this movie. And the fact that Pitt is shoving something in his mouth almost every scene he's in just adds to his sarcastic character. Other than the two head honchos, the rest of the eleven do their job and do it well. Terry Benedict was played a bit dry for my tastes, but it was consistent throughout the film so at least it's a dislike I can appreciate.

Steven Soderburgh also threw his hat into the heist genre ring with a little movie called Oceans 11.<br/><br/>Oceans 11 is a 'remake' the 1960 'classic'. I put remake in quotes because the movies are quite different and I put classic in quotes because the original was drek. George Clooney had they easy job of replacing Frank Sinatra as Daniel Ocean, the brains behind the scene. Frank Sinatra was in one good movie (Manchurian Candidate) that I have seen and he is the reason I find it hard to watch that movie again.

Andy Garcia as the villain is surprisingly well done and Julia Roberts plays the ""EX"" well. The plot was very cool which involved many twists and turns.

","Wanna watch a movie which isn't particularly demanding, but not a shallow, no-brains blockbuster either? Then try Ocean's Eleven. It's a witty and stylish crime comedy whose purpose is solely to entertain for a couple of hours. And entertain it does.<br/><br/>As the title suggests, the film has 11 protagonists: they're all con-men, and they're uniting for the biggest heist in history. The target? The Bellagio, a huge Las Vegas casino. The motive? None in particular, except perhaps the fact that the casino's owner, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), is dating Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts), who just happens to be team-leader Danny's (George Clooney) ex-wife. The fun can begin...<br/><br/>The movie is a remake of a '60s Rat Pack flick, but you don't need to have seen that film, or even heard of it. Just think of the 2001 Ocean's Eleven as an ordinary action comedy, and you'll still have a great time.<br/><br/>The screenplay has a vital role in this movie's success: the plot is expertly constructed, so that it will be captivating but not too complex, and Steven Soderbergh brings it to the screen with brilliance and elegance.<br/><br/>But what really makes this film special is the cast: every single actor is absolutely comfortable with the various roles, and even though the focus is on some people (Clooney, Garcia, Roberts, plus Brad Pitt and Matt Damon), the other members of the ensemble (including Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould) have their chance to shine too. I was particularly impressed by Garcia's performance, which somehow reminded me of his unforgettable Godfather character (""Congratulations. You're a dead man."").<br/><br/>Highly recommended.

","OCEAN'S ELEVEN (2001) **** Ultraslick feature that follows the story of a simultaneous three-hit heist in Las Vegas' most popular casinos that are run by owner Terry Benedict. Danny Ocean leads the heist, recruiting eleven specialists to help get the job done. But money isn't all he's after: he also plans to take back his long-lost ex-wife who's affection belongs with Benedict. The star-packed ensemble of players are who liven this feature.

"shanfloyd","8","0","0","18 December 2005"," Slick.
","Ocean's Eleven is one of the slickest films I've ever seen... to tell the simple truth. Soderbergh, a very talented director as he is, creates the perfect atmosphere of complex story, suspense, comedy and style. And he's got a bunch of stars to adorn this project of his, also helped out by taut and smart script. I haven't seen the Sinatra-starred film on which this is based upon, yet I don't think that one can never come close to this in terms of both story and standard.<br/><br/>Speaking about the cast, I must say finally George Clooney is a relief to watch this time, after all the intolerable films he has done in recent past. Matt Damon, highly unutilised in this film, glitters in his short opportunities. Julia Roberts is as sophisticated as usual, bringing a classic touch to the atmosphere. Don Cheadle tries a fake accent which could have been a disaster if he would get a bigger role. However, the two actors who really stole the show are Brad Pitt and Andy Garcia. Pitt gives a perfect and passionate performance as Rusty. He's got the looks, got the attitude and here he does the job. Garcia's take on Benedict nicely shows the role's multifaceted character.<br/><br/>I wouldn't spoil too much by discussing the story. I can only say, the major plot twist is just brilliant. I have seen such type of films quite a lot and I never predict even a particle of their original plan. The ending, some may not like it, I thought very necessary. In the end, ""Ocean's Eleven"" may not be a classic film, but certainly one of the best films of its genre."

","After directing heavy dramas like TRAFFIC (which won him an Oscar) and ERIN BROCKOVICH, Steven Soderbergh decided to lighten up a little with this delightful remake of the 1960 rat pack classic. George Clooney steps into Frank Sinatra's shoes as Danny Ocean, the ex-con who gets together with a large crew of cronies to rob three Las Vegas Casinos owned by a Las Vegas bigwig (Andy Garcia) who is now dating Danny's ex-wife (Julia Roberts). The screenplay is a little on the complex side and sometimes it's a little hard to keep track of what Danny and his crew are doing, but the film is so great to look at and the cast appears to be having so much fun, you really just let little plotting devices slide and just go with it. Clooney has never appeared so smooth and slick on screen and is backed by a great cast including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Elliott Gould, and in a casting stroke of genius as a veteran con man, comic legend Carl Reiner. A slick and stylish crime caper that looks great and is wonderful mindless fun for a Saturday night movie rental."

","Steven Soderbergh out does himself with the 2001 release of the 1960s remake Ocean's 11. By assembling a dream team of today's hottest actors including George Clooney( reprising the role once played by Frank Sinatra), Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, and Andy Garcia, the movie has fantastic written all over it. Yet the real star of this movie is Las Vegas. The current day decadence of Las Vegas provides for the perfect backdrop and flows so effortlessly into the film it becomes the 12th member of the cast. Ocean's Eleven is a witty film about a casino heist where everything turns out just the way you want it too, even if you need to wait till the end to have everything explained to you. The team of cons are so flamboyant and funny that you forget their criminals. It also does not do any harm that these criminals are very very good looking. Brad Pitt is fabulous in his role as Rusty. Second in command to the plan and Danny, Pitt is fantastic and he played it just right, not overriding George Clooney. All are impeccably entertaining, with witty script, and an even more witty cleverness to their plan. The plot of the film is to pull off robbing three of Las Vegas's biggest casinos on fight night, but what gives the film depth is the charm of George Clooney playing Danny Ocean. This film is a classic heist film wrapped up in a love story. Ocean's 11 is the best way to spend two hours, you become lost in the film mostly due to the extraordinary camera work. Simply stated Oceans 11 is one of the best movies I have ever seen."

","Soderbergh brings together a brilliant set of actors in this remake of the Sinatra classic. Filmed on location, any Vegas fan will fall in love with the ""action"" that's happening off the blackjack and craps tables. Danny Ocean (Clooney) is a criminal (and a liar, ha ha) who's just been released from jail. He dreams up a convoluted scheme to take down 3 of Vegas' largest casinos, all, incidentally, owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). Danny needs money to fund the operation and a crew. Danny goes to Reuben Tishkoff, who'd love to see Terry go down. Next, Danny brings together the eclectic crew of criminals, from actors to bomb makers to a tiny Chinese gymnast. <br/><br/>The plot is fairly solid with a traditional twist at the end reminiscent of many suspense murders / robberies but it's the chemistry of the cast that really makes the film sparkle.<br/><br/>The subplot is Danny's romance of Tess, his ex, who is now with Terry.<br/><br/>Will Danny's pursuit of Tess endanger the pursuit of cold hard cash?"
"bobsteimle","8","0","0","15 August 2005"," More than a surprise ending
","Most people are surprised by the ending of this movie. I was also surprised, and I usually am not. The mumbling presentation of the preparations for the heist leave out just enough so we don't quite understand what is going on. This can often be frustrating for an audience, but in this case there is enough humor and suspense to keep our interest. Matt Damon's role as an eager but not very experienced crook provides both the humor and the suspense. We want him to succeed because he is such a nice guy, but he is so green that we fear he will mess the whole thing up. I would have given him the Oscar for this movie. He distracts us beautifully from what is really going on.<br/><br/>When our eleven thieves, the good guys in this movie, are on the verge of being caught by the wary casino owner (played by Garcia), we feel bad for what we think is their imminent demise. But the twist is that they have fooled us all. When the SWAT team comes in to arrest them, there is no one there. It's not until after the SWAT team leaves that we realize the whole thing was staged, and our friends, the crooks, were playing the SWAT team, and they took all the money.<br/><br/>The big problem with this movie is that our protagonists are criminals. ""Root, root, root for the bad guys; if they get caught it's a shame!"" It's not exactly as American as baseball and apple pie. It is more entertaining than most crime dramas."

","Ocean's 11 is the kind of movie you want to watch when you want to be entertained, you want to think but you don't want to have to think, if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>I would describe this as an 'honor amongst thieves' film in the line of The Sting, and of course its original predecessor. There are no good guys, just various levels of likable and dis-likable bad guys. The straightest arrow of the cast, casino owner Terrry Benedict (Garcia) is made to be the film most dis-likable character.<br/><br/>The story is about Danny Ocean (Clooney), who is just released from prison. His first act is to break parole and the state for Las Vegas, where he meets up with his old buddy Rusty (Pitt). They decide that they want to do the impossible, knock over 3 casinos simultaneously, with their impenetrable security systems. They assemble a team of nine thieves, and the bulk of the movie is the caper itself.<br/><br/>In spite of the star power, this is a skillfully made ensemble drama, with the likes of Don Cheadle, Elliot Gould, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia all content in breezy supporting roles. The true joy of this film is watching the robbery unfold. Steven Soderberg does not make a single wrong directorial decision here.<br/><br/>Ocean's 11 is a fun ride - a movie worth owning. It has zero social value, but at the same time, there is nothing really objectionable. It has a completely implausible plot, but we never care because it is wonderful escapist entertainment. ***1/2 out of ****."

","It has such a great cast and dazzling atmosphere. though after reading some of the trivia facts i agree on some of the early developments. for example Linus would have been played by Mark Walhberg which would have been great. as would have Michael Douglas as Terry Benedict. though in general the film is amazing great plot and above all a brilliant director and cast. My favourite character was Rusty (played by Brad Pitt, i loved the fact he was always eating it look hilarious for a man of his sliming stature. I also liked Basher played awesomely by Don Cheadle (WHO WAS SADLY UNCREDITED, which was wrong because he's terrific). I enjoyed the jokes that are spoken in it some very sardonic others just plain side-splitting. But the number one factor of Ocean's Eleven is the plot. Extremely clever and so clever that it takes at least 3 times to finally get the story in your head. My favourite film of all time, though not such a terrific sequel.

","A fun piece of flash ripe for repeat viewing, Ocean's Eleven almost has it all. A spectacular cast, a slinky soundtrack, lots of charm, a sufficient plot, and steady direction make for a zippy two hours. Almost every actor gets to play it cool; and all of them come together to form a good ensemble. I love the music in this film. It is perfect. It fits not only Las Vegas, but the crime caper genre as well. The characters and plot may not be praise worthy, but they are enough to allow the actors and, unlike the sequel, the audience to have fun. The scene between Danny and Tess in the restaurant may be my favorite as Tess' digs into Danny have some real weight for a lite movie. As much as I like this movie, I notice everything that will go horribly wrong in the sequel in this movie as well. This movie thinks it is too cool for school as well, but I think that it is Steven Soderbergh's direction that keeps this movie alive and kicking. He keeps the demons of improbability and smugness at bay and allows the fun to happen."

","Directed by Steven Soderbergh, this brilliant movie rates 10 out of 10 on the celeb-o-meter. With the gorgeous George Clooney (Danny Ocean)joined by the equally handsome Brad Pitt (Rusty Ryan) it appears this film can do no wrong. The central plot of the movie revolves around Danny's impossible plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos, conveniently owned by Terry Benedict, his ex-wife's (Julia Roberts) new man. The script is full of witty and slick dialogue, providing plenty of comedy moments, notably between Pitt and Clooney. However, the enjoyment of the film is let down by Don Cheadle's dodgy cockney accent as Basher. You cannot take your eyes off the screen for a moment- not only because of the males but the plot is very complex and you may leave the cinema wondering what just happened in the last two hours. The soundtrack is one of the best film soundtracks I have heard and full credit should be given to composer David Holmes. All in all, a thoroughly entertaining movie, highly recommended."

","Clever and amusing fun, Soderbergh puts in some nice touches here and there, but the film is weighed down by being a bit of a conventional crime caper, with nothing new to add except a different clever theft scheme. It is, however, the character that Julia Roberts plays who really brings the film down a lot, as she is unnecessary to the plot, except for spicing up a familiar revenge theme, which the film does not work all that well with, and hence could have done without. As entertaining as the film is to watch, it is far from perfect, not only because of Julia Roberts, but a number of others marks of conventionality too."

","I have not seen, but probably will soon, the original Ocean's Eleven but I have no doubt it was made for the same reasons, and with the same intent that this remake was done by Steven Soderbergh. The idea for both is this...get the hottest names, the hottest people in Hollywood, pull them together for a fun, caper movie filled with one liners, killer action, and some great twists and let them have a great time for audiences to see. Ocean's 11 the remake certainly accomplishes this goal full throttle. The stories of the off camera antics of the HUGE Hollywood cast are already legendary. Clooney and Pitt's lavish pranks, as well as the gifts the whole cast exchanged. Throw in the setting of the world's hottest night town and you can't lose. I think that Soderbergh understood this much better than Lewis Milestone who directed the original.<br/><br/>Ocean's 11 is about Danny Ocean an ex-con who is released from prison after being sent up for robbery. He wastes no time tracking down his old buddy and hatching the biggest scheme ever in the history of robberies not only to accomplish the biggest score but nail the biggest revenge. Rusty, his partner in crime, agrees that in order to pull this off they are going to need the most elaborate plan the best crew ever to get it done. So they recruit nine of the best of the best, con artists, electronics, brains, thieves, acrobatics...it's the ironic cream of the crop of crime (pulled from the creme of the crop of Hollywood.) Ocean's enemy Terry Benedict is the target as he owns no less than three of the largest Casinos in Vegas.<br/><br/>This film's magic is captured within it's purpose as outlined above. It's all about the Hollywood elite getting together for this on screen party. Clooney, Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Andy Garcia (okay he's not elite but he looks good as the bad guy), Carl Reiner...and some great cameo's from the second string Hollywood Topher Grace, Holly Combs, Joshua Jackson, Wayne Newton, Angie Dickinson (who played Danny Ocean's wife in the original.) They all play themselves in various cameo's throughout. One of the best scenes of the film is when Topher Grace, and Joshua Jackson are leaving the club they are at and they are bombarded by photographers and autograph seekers while Pitt and Clooney walk right by. The film is filled with this little off camera/on camera little tricks and it adds something to the magic.<br/><br/>The actual film is actually quite good as well. For a caper movie it's pretty straight forward, nothing new here, but it's definitely pumped up a few notches. It's far more complex and elaborate because it needs to be to pull it off. Their plans basically go off without a single hitch, even when we as the audience think it's a hitch...it's not...it's all part of their plan. It was brilliant writing that puts the audience at the center of their plans without ever revealing what that plan is so we are still surprised and delighted with their clever little plot. Everything is perfectly organized and I don't just mean the plan...the scenery, the cast, the story, the plot, the crime, everything. It's too perfect and that's what this is all about. It's as cool as it possibly could be. And it still holds a certain amount of old time Hollywood charm in there. I could even stand to watch George Clooney as Danny Ocean and he usually drives me insane. The rest of the cast is well fit to their roles although the only one who really seems to have to act would be Matt Damon playing the introverted Linus.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to seeing the sequel and even though I am sure it will fall short of this one I can completely understand why the cast would want to try and capture some of what they created in the first one so I will be happy to oblige and watch it. Until then, everyone check this movie out, it's worth it and a good time to be had.<br/><br/>8/10"

He hires Rusty (Brad Pitt), Basher (Don Cheadle), Frank Catton (Bernie Mac), Linus (Matt Damon) and others to help out with the heist. As much as splitting 160 million dollars in 11 way was a problem, there is another problem along the way: Tess, played by Julia Roberts, happens to be dating Terry Benedict. Taking money from the person he's robbing is one thing, now Danny is after Tess as well. What really excites me about Ocean's 11 is that it is the type of movie that never lets the audience down.

","Individuals electing to watch Ocean's 11 are in for a treat.  Be warned, you will likely need to watch it more than once to catch all the information. The plot moves quickly, and the set up for heist is intricate, as well as fascinating.  The actual culmination of the heist is broken up though, and I found that a bit frustrating to have a review of key elements after the fact.  The rapport between Brad Pitt and George Clooney is excellent.  There is a distinct feeling that the cast enjoyed working together on this film. The lavish background of Las Vegas coincided quite well with the lavish theme of thievery here.  If you are going to plot out the job, make it big. One thing I found interesting is there was never an estimate of what the cost of this heist was, and whether or not that figured into the net winnings of the participants.  The scenes involving some young and popular sitcom actors learning poker from Brad Pitt will remain amusing to review from time to time as these up and coming actors gain notoriety in the coming years.  I think that Julia Robert's role in this was understated, though. You learn very little about her character's past, present, and future.  For example, how did she come to be in Vegas from New York?  How did she meet Andy Garcia's character?  What do they have in common, because on the surface there doesn't appear to be much.  I think the only issue I have with a movie such as this is simple; a movie that entices you to think had better deliver.  We are forced to use our minds as we watch this, therefore we come up with several sets of question marks about holes in the plot.  Barring that, it's a entertaining ride backed by a strong Soundtrack."

","""Ocean's Eleven"" is the kind of light-hearted, enjoyable crime caper which becomes better, more enjoyable, and more intelligent upon multiple viewings. My initial overview of this film was that it was too much technicality and seriousness to be enjoyable and worthwhile. Now, having seen this film over and over again, I become bemused by its charisma, sophistication, and suave enterprise on a most exciting concept. The film plots parolee thief Daniel Ocean (Clooney) and ten of his selected ""instruments"" in the brilliant, if precarious scheme of robbing three prestigious Vegas casinos in the hopes of collecting on ""eight figures each"". Sounds enticing, yet how could such a scheme be executed, especially considering that nobody has ever succeeded in pulling it off? This film chronicles the endeavor and style of this cool, unerring gang to succeed in the impossible, to score magnificently, and to salvage certain losses (Ocean rebounding his wife, Tess, from the man he is determined to rob). The beauty and genius of this delightful, smart crime caper is its palatable premise (diverse characters working toward individual goals), its confident conviction (detailing every aspect and technicality of its theme), and its eventual denoument (which I can attest is the most consummate and rewarding conclusions in my knowledge of cinema). Every character shines, the script is smart and witty, and the style is more cool and suave than any scenario out of James Bond or Shaft. Glorious, triumphant execution of the most delicious of concepts. How cool can any film get? **** out of ****"

","I remember hearing that Ocean's 11 was supposed to be a good movie, so when I had the chance to borrow it from a friend, I was glad to. <br/><br/>I ended up watching it twice right in a row.<br/><br/>Sometimes the danger with so many big name stars in a movie is that they all try to show off, and may not work well together.  I didn't get that impression at all in this one.  With Clooney being the main character, the others seem plenty happy to play supporting roles. Characters are dry - but that's how' they're supposed to be - and do a good job of interacting while still remaining individuals.  It always feels like they are hiding something.  You expect a surprise around every corner.<br/><br/>The way they work out their heist is a very smooth operation - but not TOO smooth.  There are the natural inconveniences that make the characters seem more real, not the perfectly polished characters sometimes seen in this type of movie.  Yet other 'mistakes'  turn out to be exactly what they planned.  See if YOU can tell which is which the first time through....<br/><br/>I watched it twice because a couple of the twists caught me so off-guard that I had to go back and see if I could see them coming.

"warlock162","Null","0","0","9 April 2004"," 2001 vs. 1960, Modern Version is much better than Classic
","It is perceived that Hollywood is running out of ideas.  This allegedly explains why there are so many remakes of older, classic movies with a contemporary slant to them.  At times, the remakes are not up to par, and destroy the legacy of the classics which preceded it.  `Ocean's Eleven' destroys this perception.<br/><br/>If you are bothering to read this review, you know that the 2001 version of `Ocean's Eleven' is a remake of the 1960 version of `Ocean's Eleven' which included Frank Sinatra and the other Rat Packers.  In both versions, the plot of the films was to rob a series of Las Vegas casinos. <br/><br/>
In the new version, the movie follows a format which is technically sound: <br/><br/>
assemble the Motley crew of individuals to help pull the job (this is important, because knowing what security is like in casinos anywhere, it will take a crew to pull off such a thing); <br/><br/>they meet to discuss the job, <br/><br/>every individual gets their assignments; <br/><br/>and they execute (problems will arise, of course.  Problems must arise, or else it would not be much of a movie).  <br/><br/>The first half hour of the movie was involved the assembly of the crew.  The rest of the film involves explaining and pulling off the job, twists and turns included.  The 2001 version is more believable and more enjoyable, because a casino heist will take some time and careful execution.  In the 1960 version, the movie drags for an hour about nothing until the heist is brought up, and the job is done in 15 minutes in a very unbelievable way. Even in 1960, a casino heist could not be accomplished that fast.  If you want technical accuracy, and more interesting twists, watch the 2001 version.  In this respect, the 2001 version is far better that the 1960 version<br/><br/>The only positive to the 1960 version over the 2001 version is this:  The 1960 version gives you more feeling into what Las Vegas is like than the 2001 version, due to the Rat Pack being as much of part of Las Vegas culture at that time like the Internet is a culture in this time.  In the 2001 version, it feels like you could have pulled the job in Atlantic City, or Mississippi somewhere.<br/><br/>If you want real heist excitement, watch the 2001 version."

The little love story within takes us away from the rest of the story. Perhaps it adds a touch of ""Got ya!"" to the bad guy, but is he a bad guy? Not really. A businessman with a focused personality perhaps.<br/><br/>The other one is that burning question...How do they get the money out of Vegas? This isn't explored, but left to the imagination. I have a feeling they script writers couldn't think up a way of doing it without falling over their highly technological script. More than once the issue is raised about being stuck in the middle of the desert, and no solution is forthcoming. Perhaps Ocean's Eleven II is yet to come out with ""Did Danny's followers at the end of the film do anything?"" or ""Here's how they got the cash out of Vegas"".<br/><br/>
All that said, it's one of the first films I've watched in a long time which had very little violence, swearing, nudity, sex or the abuse of drugs or alcohol.

Every time I watch, it I pick-up something I didn't catch last time. I recommend watching it over and over.<br/><br/> Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is a recently released on parole after serving time for theft and robbery and is ironically seeking to `get back in the slammer again' After seeking out ten other prison friends, Danny's plan is to go on to simultaneously pull off the heist of a combined vault for the three casinos containing $150 million. These eleven friends, each has a specific skill that is combined to make up the assemblage. The movie follows the trail of these fellow partners in crime as they eventually join up with Danny and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt).<br/><br/> Danny Ocean's has another reason for the scam. He is trying to get the attention of Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts), his ex-wife. He also has a reason for picking the three casinos; his ex-wife is now dating the owner of them, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia).<br/><br/> I think one of the funniest scenes is when The Amazing Yen (Shaobo Qin) gets stuck in the vault because of dead batteries and does a back flip across the vault. The magnitude of the heist makes something as minuscule as a dead battery humorous. As with any suspense scene, as we try to figure out how the character is going to get out of a sticky situation. The back flip was the last thing we would have expected.<br/><br/> The excitement and enjoyment of the movie lasted all the way to the credits. The all star cast was excellent.

The thrills!!!)<br/><br/>Still that's enough complaining. It won't stop me from watching Ocean's 11 again if the opportunity arises."

The film has a nice crime fill mixed with some comedy. Some, nice .. witty comedy. It is pretty high on my all time list, along with other fantastic George Clooney movies.<br/><br/>
I highly suggest this film, as my rating stands at: 9/10. You can also look forward to Oceans Eleven 2 (not the real title), which has been confirmed for the near future."
"gordonriot","Null","0","0","10 January 2003"," Ultra-stylish and gloriously vacuous heist flick
","No-one says you have to choose The Seventh Seal or Citizen Kane every time you sit down to a movie, but even if you want something that won't test your intellect it doesn't mean you need to watch a bad film.<br/><br/>Ocean's Eleven is the perfect antidote to a hard day at the office. It is a story with no moral purpose - you might even say it is immoral (we're supposed to sympathise with a bunch of crims who plan to rip off $160m?) - but in the hands of such an accomplished director as Steven Soderbergh, it becomes a classy piece of cinematic work.<br/><br/>Soderbergh has his critics, and I'm sure many of the criticisms are justified, but he makes films that look gorgeous and slick and ooze class from every frame. It doesn't matter that this is an utterly vacuous film - it is top class entertainment: great script, great cast (give or take Julia Roberts) and a great soundtrack.<br/><br/>The art of film-making for its own sake and nothing else."
"Captain Ed","8","0","0","10 January 2003"," Cool and clever dialogue makes this a guilty pleasure
","Ocean's Eleven is never going to be mistaken for Shakespeare. However, its cool and clever dialogue and typical heist hijinks makes it a good popcorn movie, especially in light of its all-star cast.<br/><br/>While there is some truth that at some points the cast gets so cool they almost seem asleep, for the most part they fulfill their primary purpose: to deliver their well-written quips and, basically, look good.  George Clooney and Brad Pitt are terrific at this, and Andy Garcia is both menacing and cool as the casino owner that the gang targets, for multiple reasons. Scott Caan and Casey Affleck are funny as ever-quarrelling brothers.  It is delightful to see Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in meaty supporting roles; so often, Reiner only makes cameo appearances, and I can't remember the last time Gould was fully engaged in a role -- maybe American History X, and before that who knows?  Julia Roberts operates on autopilot as she isn't given much to do here, and the normally outstanding Don Cheadle affects an atrocious Cockney accent and utters the worst pseudo-cool lines:  ""We're in Barney ... Barney.  Barney Rubble. TROUBLE!!""  Oh, please.  As for his voice, think Nicolas Cage in ""Peggy Sue Got Married"", and you'll get an idea how annoying it is.<br/><br/>All that aside, the movie starts out slowly but builds momentum throughout. Soderberg uses the camera stylishly (what else is new?) and gives the heist genre a new look.  Lastly, the score is terrific and matches up with the dialog and action, but never overpowers it.  Obviously, this is lightweight material, especially for Soderberg after ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich"", but give the man a break -- he's allowed to do something for pure fun occasionally.  That's what this movie is, pure popcorn-munching fun.  Are you in or out?  I'm in for an 8."

","""Ocean's Eleven"" is the kind of film that you enjoy watching, but that you'd really, really like to be a part of.  The actors all look like they're having a blast, and the extras on the DVD confirm that theory.<br/><br/>For those who don't know, the eleven are George Clooney (""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""), Brad Pitt (""Fight Club""), Matt Damon (""Saving Private Ryan""), Elliot Gould (""American History X""), Carl Reiner (""It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World""), Don Cheadle (""Traffic""), Bernie Mac (""Get On The Bus""), Scott Caan (""Enemy Of The State""), Casey Affleck (""Good Will Hunting""), Eddie Jemison (""Schizopolis""), and Shaobo Qin (making his feature film debut).  Julia Roberts (""The Player""), and Andy Garcia (""The Untouchables"") co-headline the promotional work with Clooney, Pitt, and Damon, but their parts are actually fairly small, considering the magnitude of the actors in the roles.<br/><br/>Getting past that magnificent list of names, the film itself is what the advertising promised:  A bunch of cool guys being cool.  Clooney and Pitt, in particular, exude the sort of ""Hey, wouldn't it be fun to rob three casinos?"" ""Yeah!  I'll start calling the guys!"" nonchalance that has made them both huge stars.<br/><br/>As an aspiring filmmaker who's struggling to finish writing his (VERY independent) directorial debut, the banter and the sense of unity that are so prevalent in ""Ocean's Eleven"" are very much things that I aim to imitate. As a fan of dialogue (as evidenced by the fact that I'm an avid Aaron Sorkin fan), Ted Griffin's screenplay is like music to my eyes and ears. Visually appealing (It's cool people!  In Vegas!) and tightly-written, it was easily one of my favorite films of 2001, and having recently seen it again on DVD (my third or fourth viewing), it's fast climbing my list of favorites from any year.<br/><br/>Now, why couldn't I have thought of getting 11 cool people like Clooney, Pitt, Damon, and company for MY movie?  Oh, yeah.  I'm not Soderbergh..."

","It's refreshing to see a film where the principals involved seem to be enjoying themselves immensely.  'Ocean's Eleven' is just such a film.  Rumor is that George Clooney got the star-studded cast to waive their usually high fees as a favor to him.  As a result, he ended up with a massively talented group of actors working their way through a remake of an old Rat Pack flick, with acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh at the helm.  What else do you need?<br/><br/>Recently paroled con Danny Ocean (Clooney) assembles a crew of eleven con-artists and thieves to pull off the heist of a lifetime:  Robbing over $150 million from the vault of three Las Vegas casinos.  Without giving anything away, the caper itself is imaginative and completely unrealistic - which is why it's fun to watch play out.  Refreshingly, the mark of the con, casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) is no dummy.  He's smart, clever and careful, and that plays into the twists and turns of the heist.<br/><br/>The best part is in watching Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner and the rest diving headfirst into their roles.  They have parts that are built on style and attitude, but rarely ham it up.  They have natural chemistry (especially between Pitt and Clooney - their rapport is great).  The dialogue crackles crisp and stylish.  These thieves aren't vulgar or violent - they're smooth and refined and almost never lose control.  <br/><br/>'Ocean's Eleven' is a display of cool, a production of style, and a very enjoyable heist flick to boot.  Well worth your time, it does what many movies fail to do but seems so simple:  It entertains."

","Like Mission:  Impossible's excellence in espionage performance, Ocean's Eleven follows along the same track with cunning thievery, great cast, enjoyable music, and above average plot.  I was surprised to find this movie to be much, much more than a dim-witted attempt at something like Gone in 60 Seconds (which was a poor remake of an ancient film).<br/><br/>George Clooney hits the spotlight as a recently released prisoner.  He wants to go back to his life of crime and rob a ring of casinos in Las Vegas. Immediately the movie jumps into the plot, as he meets up with Brad Pitt's character and together they plan the world's greatest robbery.  The amount of time spent and effort put into this theft is amazing, and I could not tear my eyes away from the screen as their plan slowly took form.  The moviemakers surely have brains with enormous capacity to do all this.<br/><br/>Ocean's Eleven is based off an older movie, but I'm not sure how closely it matches its counterpart.  I've not seen it, so I can't comment on that.<br/><br/>The music, although not a huge part of the movie, was great and fit in perfectly.  Not too heavy and loud, but up enough so that it filled the atmosphere with a sneaky attitude that made me think of the NOC list download in Mission:  Impossible.<br/><br/>The only downside I can find of Ocean's Eleven is the huge lack of character development.  Most of the super-thieves we meet in the movie are hardly explained.  We know little about them.  They are a great addition to the movie, and some of them provide excellent comic relief, but I felt the audience should know a little more about them.<br/><br/>That problem is nothing compared to the sheer brilliance of this movie.  It kept me intrigued the entire time, as the actual theft began no less than halfway through the movie.<br/><br/>I was extremely impressed by Ocean's Eleven.  I can recommend it to anybody, as it has no nudity or extreme violence.  The language gets a little harsh at some points, but overall it's a decent movie.  The actual idea of thievery is underscored by a deeper purpose which attempts to send a clear message that thievery is still not right.  Morals, although masked, are still present in this exceptional movie."

And the fashion. Clooney's style appeared sophisticated, Garcia's elegant, Julia's okay, and Pitt's immaculate. The comedic tone in this film was great. The Cahn kid and his side-kick played well off of each other. Damon was bland but appropriate for the role. It would have helped if he had a better physique. Bernie Mack was perfect for his role.

Most movies with this much star power only relies on it and forgets that theres more to making movies than casting. Ocean's Eleven exceeds those expectations and achieves the most important things. It first of all has a well executed plot, secondly it has believeabilty in plot as well as characters, and finally achieves the most important thing which is to entertain the audience and avoids insulting the intelligence of the viewer. It doesn't require over-the-top stunts and explosions to thrill, doesn't need to jump off cliffs, get chased by avalanches, or integrate phony martial arts sequences. However Ocean's 11 doesn't get and 11, or a 10. It is a good movie, well put together but it seems to fall short from greatness just a little bit. The talentless phony Roberts ruins it for me.

"NKMacGuffin","8","0","0","1 August 2002"," Big stars having big fun
","It's all too rare that a film packed with big stars is any fun. When major studios put A-List, $20 million talent onscreen together, they don't want to take any chances on the movie- there's so much money at stake, the final product is boring, but safe. The good news about Ocean's Eleven is that a studio did not put these stars onscreen together- Steven Soderbergh did. Since making a big splash with his debut Sex, Lies, and Videotape in 1989, Soderbergh has earned the respect of actors with smart, classy, and sophisticated projects like Out Of Sight and The Limey. With the one-two punch of Erin Brockovich and Traffic in 2000, major studios are now willing to trust him with big budgets. However, the studio's bankroll didn't get all these names on the marquee- Soderbergh did, and he did it at a bargain.<br/><br/>Soderbergh set out to make a fun, popcorn flick involving a casino heist, in the spirit of the Frank Sinatra/Rat Pack movie of 1960. The new Ocean's Eleven stars George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts. Clooney, with Pitt, scheme to steal $160 million from Andy Garcia's casino. They enlist ten con men and hustlers to make it happen. The Eleven of the title pull off the heist, Mission: Impossible style- no guns, no violence. Hardly anyone even gets their hair mussed. There are plenty of kinks in the plan as we go along- but are they kinks or a part of the plan we're unaware of?<br/><br/>The great casting continues below the title, with Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould as old-school Vegas cronies looking for one last hand; Don Cheadle as the bomb expert, Bernie Mac as the inside man at the casino; plus Casey Affleck and Scott Caan as the bratty, feuding footsoldiers of the gang.<br/><br/>Everyone took pay cuts to join in the fun, and it shows; the set must have felt like a class reunion as it seems everyone has worked together before. Soderbergh has directed Clooney, Roberts, and Cheadle before; Clooney worked with Cheadle in Out Of Sight; Affleck and Damon were in Good Will Hunting, and Gould is on Friends with Mrs. Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>You'd think with a big cast and a fast-moving story, that there wouldn't be enough screen time for all the principals. With such a long list of stars, you might expect some bruised egos as some of the cast could get short shrift. However, Soderbergh does a nice job of giving everyone at least one scene to shine. For example, Cheadle (Traffic, Boogie Nights), in some ways, is barely in the movie. But he gets a few brief moments to be noticed which count for a lot.<br/><br/>A few of the great moments: Pitt's first and last scenes begin with his character eating junk food. We just watch him eating nachos for 5-10 seconds. How he can look so cool and yet funny while eating nachos is beyond me. Clooney has a scene where he plays with his wedding band. His character is not aware he's doing it, but he fiddles with his ring finger while talking to his ex-wife, and it says more about his feelings that any dialogue can.<br/><br/>I had some problems with the Roberts/Clooney relationship. Clooney played a similar role as a thief in Out Of Sight and squeezed out sexy sparks opposite Jennifer Lopez, including a pivotal scene at a secluded table in a dark restaurant. In Ocean's Eleven, Clooney and Roberts' big scenes take place in a similar setting, and suffer by comparison.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, suffice it to say her character is supposed to harbor a grudge against Clooney. She does unleash some sharp jabs in their snappy dialogue. However, we need more romantic magnetism underneath to develop her character arc.<br/><br/>It's rare when all the pieces come together for a fun and exciting film these days. Hollywood seems to have forgotten that movies can be thrilling without gunplay, explosions, and car chases. We can only hope that the rest of Hollywood follows Soderbergh's example. This film is not genius, it's just first-class entertainment. On the whole, Ocean's Eleven will be the most fun you'll have at the movies this year.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for language, and one brief scene with a strip show in the background (no nudity). Hardly any violence (a few punches are thrown); no gun violence. Hardly any smoking. Hardly sounds like a Vegas movie, does it?"
"Dehlia_","8","0","0","31 July 2002"," The Heist of All Heists
","This is a very fun movie that could have been excellent without Julia Roberts dragging it down. Now, normally I am a fan of Ms. Roberts, but here she is miscast and her part is poorly written. Unfortunately, said poorly written part is meant to be the linchpin that holds the entire motivation and structure together. Her character is treated as a stunning beauty, but we all know that Roberts's appeal is not beauty but prettiness -- she is a nice girl, not a knockout, and that's why her beauty -- when it does shine forth -- is so startling. Roberts looks like a pretty girl who, when she smiles at you, shocks you with her sudden radiance. But her character is the kind of woman who Makes an Entrance, and it just doesn't work. Without either the looks or the dialogue, she creates a mushy center to a movie that needs to be sharp straight through.<br/><br/>Still, the rest of the movie is diamond-edge sharp, the heist is entertaining, and the cast mainly sparkles. 8/10"

The only drawback to the movie is DON CHEADLE'S IMMENSELY INFURIATINGLY ANNOYING ENGLISH ACCENT. If the English accent thing was connected to the plot at all or if the viewer saw a scene of Basher in England, then the accent would make sense but we don't see a scene in England so it's just annoying!! And in fact, there is a scene in the movie (only one that I found) in which Basher (Cheadle) loses his accent. As the robbery gets started, Basher comes in to the hotel room and says ""where we at boys?"". If he had stuck with his own voice then I would have no problems with this movie and just enjoy it. Overall, good job all around except the accent thing."

The mechanics of the heist and the love story -between George Clooney and the snappy, dazzling Julia Roberts- are preposterous but Soderbergh is more interested in dialogue, cool(not hip, but genuine cool), and elevation/subversion of the mainstream aesthetic than airtight storytelling. Good choice, it turns out, as we get to witness Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, Andy Garcia and others riff on familiar ""dirty dozen"" type setups and fashion memorable characters out of just a few minutes of screentime each.

"moveefrk","Null","0","0","4 June 2002"," The best remake of a Rat Pack film
","2001's ""Ocean's Eleven"" is by far the best remake of any film; most notably one that starred the Rat Pack (Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., Dean Martin...). Steven Soderbergh (who obviously understood the remake guidelines) wisely took a breezy cool 1960 piece of piffle and made it even better. How? Simple. He upped the charm factor.<br/><br/>In this case, the charm came from George Clooney (in the Sinatra role). Clooney plays ex-con Daniel Ocean with the right blend of subtle sweetness and diabolical snakiness. His warped plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos in the dead of night couldn't have worked if at least he and his ten cohorts couldn't convince us (the audience) that they could do it. I mean, let's face it. The only way that heist could've gone down is if it was funded by a big shot Hollywood producer.<br/><br/>The film also ups the sexual tension by bringing in wild card Julia Roberts as Tess; his ex-wife and now seeing Ocean's nemesis Terry Benedict (the always welcome Andy Garcia). The original film was by no means a classic (and neither is this one), but Soderbergh, Clooney, Pitt, Roberts, Garcia, Damon and company sell us pretty well on this one.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

What do these terms mean? 3) And this is the Most Important question: why doesn't someone teach Julia Roberts how to walk!? As in Pretty Woman, she looks like she's stepping over corn rows in the back forty.<br/><br/>Roberts is a wonderful actress when she doesn't have to play off of a male,and here there are eleven of them. Roberts is best when she can let her natural exuberance explode into the part, as in Erin B.<br/><br/>Plus, since I'm on the subject, Roberts doesn't have the flowing elegance and natural grace that Benedict would look for in a female accessory. She is not beautiful standing still and she spends the entire movie just hanging around.<br/><br/>Carl Reiner and Elliot Gould are perfect. So is Brad Pitt. But Pitt and Clooney are not the Newman and Redford of this generation. Brad Pitt holds up his end, but Clooney, like in all his films, is on cruise control. He exudes contentment, kind of a, ""What the heck, I think I'll act"" kind of presence. While this is great for his personal life, it costs him an acting edge.<br/><br/>But who cares?

"Spleen","8","0","0","28 May 2002"," It turns out Soderbergh IS an artist, after all
","As in ""The Limey"" and ""Traffic"" Soderbergh will now and then (in the earlier films he did it all the time) use a visual gimmick that's pointless and ill-advised - like the useless, split-second split screen he introduces and then immediately drops during one casino sequence (why during THAT sequence, and not another?), or the jerky, stroboscopic motion of Danny and Linus running into one another on the train.  It's a pity.  Visually, ""The Limey"" and ""Traffic"" were ALL hollow gimmickry, which meant that no particular Jean-Luc Godard touch (like Godard, Soderbergh uses ""experimental"" devices as though he's trying to patent them) did much harm - but the photography in ""Ocean's Eleven"" is, at heart, simply wonderful: tinsel colours, beguiling bright lights, tight framing.<br/><br/>It's not just the visuals.  Soderbergh's three previous films (the only other three I've seen) come across as mere exercises.  ""The Limey"" (the worst) appears to be a classroom assignment that accidentally saw the light of day; ""Erin Brokovich"" is a formulaic commercial exercise; ""Traffic"" is a propaganda exercise.  Soderbergh has said that in making ""Ocean's Eleven"" he wanted to make a purely entertaining film, and the way he said made me think that he viewed it, too, as just another exercise, but it entertains so well and with such intelligence and grace that the artistry must be regarded as real.<br/><br/>There's so much that's right that could not have been got right simply by accident.  The thieves are all civilised: the co-operate, and when they disagree, they disagree in a civilised fashion.  So many other directors would have made the tensions between them the point and driving force of the film - to give the film ""depth"", perhaps.  But Soderbergh realises that it's eleven versus the casinos, and that factional warfare would neither complicate, nor deepen, nor enliven the picture.  These thieves really are cool and intelligent.  When Danny meets his ex-wife, he admits that his advice on her love life is neither disinterested nor unbiased, and then adds, ""...but that doesn't mean that I'm wrong.""  He simply SAYS this, and Tess actually digests the comment and admits its force without being one over by it, and my God, can it be, is this an actual CONVERSATION taking place on screen?  Scenes that other films would have played up as contests or clashes of passion, this one milks for their value as dialectic.  It's almost a first.  THAT'S why the dialogue (which by and large isn't, alas, as clever as it should be) sparkles.<br/><br/>And the heist itself is pleasingly clever.  It's a charming film.<br/><br/>Spoiler ahead!<br/><br/>Yet, as I said, the remaining flaws somehow gnawed at me.  The ending in particular.  Danny and Tess shouldn't have got back together - reaching an amicable understanding would have been better for both them and the audience.  And we shouldn't have seen them being tailed without, at the very least, being told whether or not they knew they were being tailed.  Trust Soderbergh to make two opposing mistakes at once: weakening the intelligence of the ending for the sake of sweetness, without actually making the ending any sweeter; then taking away the sweetness for the sake (I presume) of logic, without making the ending any more intelligent."

You'll have to watch the movie to see how they did it.<br/><br/>Every heist movie has a step where they ""cut the power"".  This movie decided to have fun with the idea when the team effortlessly took a Volkswagen sized ""bomb"" from some university lab.  The thing looks like some sort of glowing crystal device straight out of Star Trek.  This device causes no physical destruction at all, but just kills the power grid for 30 seconds.  You're supposed to laugh at something so ridiculous.  They could have left this step out.

"FlickJunkie-2","8","0","0","20 May 2002"," An entertaining caper flick
","I have trouble calling this a remake, because it doesn't share much in common with the `rat pack' original except the name of the lead character and that it is a casino heist.  Actually, this is a better film than its namesake, apart from the fact that the cast of the original was filled with entertainment legends.<br/><br/>Director Steven Soderbergh (Erin Brockovich, Traffic) takes a vacation from serious filmmaking with this film, which on his resume is something of a lark.  Everyone seems to be having a good time and it is clear that the actors enjoyed making this film.  The overhauled screenplay pops with snappy dialogue, riddled with deadpan humor and a decent, though somewhat far fetched plot.  It has a little of the whimsical feel of `The Sting', though the screenplay isn't as strong.  A crew of professional thieves plans to knock over three casinos on a fight night by raiding the impregnable vault that serves all three.  The plan is elaborate, full of high tech wizardry, daring deceptions and acrobatic stunts.  The caper runs into more than the normal amount of foul ups, but our devious team of burglars is always up to the task of working around the glitches.<br/><br/>The cast is very solid.  George Clooney is perfectly cast as the brainchild of the scheme.  He is dapper, macho and smooth with a sardonic wit that keeps the film's tone serious yet light.  Brad Pitt plays the always eating Rusty, who is really the brains behind the operation, coordinating it flawlessly.  Except for `The Mexican', this is much lighter material than Pitt usually tackles, yet he gives a suave performance seeming very comfortable with his character.  Despite the fact that this is an ensemble cast, Pitt carries a lot of the weight and makes the story as close to believable as could be possible given its improbable nature.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle continues to impress, rendering a terrific demolitions expert. His cockney accent is great and with this part Cheadle shows once again what a terrific character actor he is.  In a little twist of irony, Cheadle plays an analogous part in this film to that played by Sammy Davis, Jr. in the original, and he also played Sammy in the TV movie entitled `The Rat Pack'.  Poor Andy Garcia has the thankless task of playing the heavy in a tongue-in-cheek film, but he does a marvelous job.  Matt Damon plays the rookie, giving the character a charming naivetÃ© and a mischievous bent. Julie Roberts is nothing more than a throw in, with a minor role as Ocean's ex-wife.<br/><br/>If you don't take this film too seriously, you are in for an entertaining evening.  It is smartly done without too much melodrama, and provides just enough suspense and realism to keep it from being a farce.  I rated it an 8/10."

","The lack of good entertainment in theaters has been becoming more and more noticeable. That sounds silly actually considering it is a fact that most of what we see in a darkened theater is flat out terrible. It tries to please us and no more, and constantly fails. We accept it since we often need distractions, and with DVD's out on the market films have a great opportunity to be repackaged and sold in a whole new light, making decent films seem great, and shitty films seem decent. We all seem to think we're enjoying ourselves but the sad truth is we don't. Or at least I don't. We take what they give, and not only that, but we pay top dollar for it. Well it's an absolute wonder that Ocean's 11 exists.<br/><br/>This film has been heavily hyped from the day Clooney attached every star he could find to it. Then Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brokovich) signed on to direct it and shot my standards for this film way beyond any I believed could be met. Safe to say I finally saw the film today and it delivered. Everywhere I thought it was going to go it didn't... a very rewarding feeling. It was fun, funny, exciting, enchanting, imaginative, charming, sweet, genuine, wild etc.. At first I thought at the very least I was going to watch a fun film. I thought Clooney and the gang would just be up there having a good time and the film would just play itself out to simple satisfaction, but in retrospect what the hell was I thinking! Soderbergh was responsible for having his last 4 films become some of my all time favorites. Make that the last 5.<br/><br/>I can't believe I haven't mentioned the plot. Basically the film revolves around a heist that is set up by the freshly paroled Danny Ocean (Clooney), to rob the vault of 3 las Vegas casinos on night of an event boxing match. Along with Rusty (Pitt) they put together there team (better known as Ocean's 11..get it) and proceed to set it up. The twist and motivation for this heist is Danny's attempt to simultaneously get back his ex-wife Tess (Roberts) who is dating the owner of the 3 casino's (Garcia). Now every single character in this film is perfect. No one tries to steal the show, Clooney leads and they follow and in turn every performance shines. I don't know what I should describe to make you understand how truly enchanting this film is. Perhaps the fact that the scenes between Clooney and Roberts made me feel warm and somewhat breathless is a good way to start. For the few moments they shared on screen I felt as though I had been witness to something I hadn't seen in a film in a while... romance. The dialogue, the look and feel, and the actors... God I felt great. Those moments are sure to become classic (or already are seeing as they do borrow heavily from the classic romances Hollywood once made... also I forgot to mention if you loved the scenes between Clooney and Lopez in Out of Site, be ready to smile at these ones).<br/><br/>Soderbegh definitely knew what he was doing with this film, and has again crafted a masterpiece. I can't stress just how surprised I was with this film. I just wouldn't understand someone not loving it... or at very least liking it. There was passion and sentiments behind the making of the movie. It's right up there on screen, and it is that which makes it great. It put a smile on my face, and though it is just a movie I am glad to have spent a few hours of my life to watch it. I would gladly do so again."

","The film develops slowly trying to gather the group of characters who will play a central role in the robbery of a casino masterminded by Daniel Ocean played by George Clooney. Unlike the film 'The Sting' the story doesnt bring out the characters too well probably because there are too many characters to deal with in the short space of time. However, the main characters are portrayed superficially including the ex-wife of Ocean played by Julia Roberts. The main theme of the of the story is to highlight the challenging attempt at robbing a highly secure vault at the basement of a Casino owned by casino mogul Terry Benedict played by Andy Garcia. The entertaining part of the movie was the execution of the plan and the way it unfolded all the way to the end. The film was marred towards the end where the 'robbers' actions were put in good light against that of a businessman but I would guess to add substance to the film and the characters. Also the wife's unscrupulous behavior to leave Benedict for Ocean was also questionable.

","***Possible Spoilers (though very slight)***<br/><br/>This is a fun, ""bubble-gum for the brain"" type movie.  It is a little suspenseful, but for the most part, easy to follow.  I've not seen the 1960's version of this movie, so I base my opinions on the 2001 version alone.  <br/><br/>I thought the casting was great.  And I liked seeing Brad Pitt and Matt Damon in a working relationship.  They have complimentary acting skills.  Of all the (modern) actors out there, I think that Brad Pitt has the widest array of characters, with Matt Damon easily in the top five.  Even though they both play their most tried and true personalities in this movie, I was glad to see them together.  I don't easily buy into the craze, and for a while, I didn't like Brad Pitt or his movies, but after seeing his diversity, he is impossible to ignore!  I am finding the same pattern in Matt Damon.  <br/><br/>George Clooney is yet another actor who I thought was riding on his looks, but as it turns out, he is a consistent actor.  I've not seen him in many varying roles, but he does play this character well.  <br/><br/>As always, Julia Roberts is cast as the leading lady, struggling with her plight for control over her destiny, or rather, her autonomy.  Granted, she is the highest paid actress, and one of the three highest paid actors OR actresses in Hollywood, she does her character well.  (Which is probably why she is so high paid).  In Ocean's Eleven, she once again plays her character to a tee.  I felt that the Chemistry between she had Clooney was admirable, though perhaps a little practiced.  <br/><br/>And then we have Andy Garcia...a flawless performance, once again.  He consistently plays a wonderful villain-type character, and Terry Benedict is no exception.  I did feel that this film perhaps insulted his intelligence, it was necessary for the progression of the plot.  <br/><br/>Overall, I found the movie enjoyable and I would rent it again - if I don't buy it first."

","I've always got a kick out of these heist movies.  But Ocean's Eleven tops them all.  In this one, George Clooney plays a man who recently got out of prison and plans to have the biggest robbery in Las Vegas, and to try to make amends with his wife.  He teams up with an all-star cast, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts. <br/><br/>  Ocean's Eleven deserves a standing ovation!  It even has some comical moments, too.  I liked Matt Damon's reluctance in his character, and George Clooney is always cool in anything he does.  Julia Roberts says this was the one movie she had fun making.  This Ocean's 11 is better than the original with Frank Sinatra.<br/><br/>  My favorite scenes were when the fat guy was pretending to beat up George Clooney and the way Clooney and Damon tried to steal the money by climbing down those ropes, and when the circus contortionist got stuck.  And just all of it was just very enjoyable and entertaining from beginning to end.  It's such a shame this movie wasn't nominated for an Oscar, but it did get nominated for a Golden Globe, I believe.  Either way, you won't be let down by this movie.  I give Oceans Eleven 5 stars!"

","The Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand. These are the targets for the 2001 version of Oceans 11. This is not the 1960's version and should not be put on the same level as it. The change in technology has changed so much since the original 1960's Rat Pack movie that the 2001 version acts as a totally new film. The original was a great movie no denying that. The heist in the 1960's version was way ahead of its time. But a lot has changed in 41 years; in this age of computers it would have been impossible for the original heist to work without a Vegas camera watching you. Though the original had a certain style of class that this one didn't. Both versions were extremely fun to watch.<br/><br/>I rate this 9/10 and the original an 8/10.<br/><br/>TRIVIA: Angie Dickinson had a bit part in this movie playing herself. She was the Beatrice Ocean in the original Oceans 11 in 1960.<br/><br/>In the original 1960 version of Ocean's 11, Sammy Davis Jr. played a demolition man. In this version of Oceans 11, the 2001 version, Don Cheadle plays Sammy's role as the demolition man. In 1998 a T.V movie called `The Rat Pack' was made, Don Cheadle played as Sammy Davis Jr."

A remake of the 1960's Rat pack classic, Ocean's 11 tells the tale of a plan masterminded by Daniel Ocean (George Clooney) to steal $150million from three Las Vegas casino's. To aid him are ten different men from different spectrums of the criminal field. From the rookie thief (Matt Damon) to the explosives expert (Don Cheadle). The owner of the casinos is the ruthless Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who happens to be dating Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts), Daniel's ex-wife. How the plot thickens! The style is alluring and sexy, and the acting can simply be described with one word, Superb! All the characters have excellent chemistry and their comic timing is precision personified. This film is worthy of praise and I can see it being a worthy contender for the Oscars. This film earns a well deserved five stars."

","...as the credits rolled.<br/><br/>Why, you ask? Because ever since I saw the original kings of cool, The Rat Pack, I've been hooked by their style. Their songs, their clothes, their attitude and their movies defined coolness. So when I heard that my favorite Rat Pack Movie, Ocean's 11, was being remade I had one thought in my mind? Will they mess it up?<br/><br/>Its a proven fact that remakes end up being crappy, as seen with Psycho, Planet Of The Apes, and A Kid In King Arthur's Court/Black Knight. My fears were put to rest when Steven Soderbergh was given the helm, as he directed great films like Out Of Sight and The Limey (but stumbled with his last two Erin Brockavich and Traffic). Then he assembled a great cast with Clooney, Damon, Pitt, Mac, Gould, Casey Affleck, Garcia, Cann and Cheadle. I was weary with the addition of Julia Roberts (since she has been known to mess with a movie's chemistry), but she was able to pull off her role.<br/><br/>
Everyone did their part from music from David Holmes, to cameos from TV teen stars. Great pacing, great storytelling, a heist movie that doesn't seem far-fetched. No singing though....<br/><br/>
As a fan of the original and a fan of movies, this is one not to be missed. They hit the bullseye, they did it flawlessly"

","What's there not to love about Steven Soderbergh's remake of the 1960's heist flick ""Ocean's 11""? As soon as word got out about the project (and cast) I was waiting impatiently to see this one.  And it didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Yes, the cast is fantastic, though Roberts' role is surpringly limited. Clooney plays the same type of slick charmer role he did in ""Out of Sight,"" perhaps with the idea that those who (mistakenly) passed on that film will see this one. Not a bad idea when you think about it. Damon is very Ripley-like. The surprises come from Pitt, Cheadle, and Carl Reiner.  This is one of Pitt's best performances; this is no action role for him. Instead, he too has to put on the charm, in slick shirts and suits, to keep up with Clooney, and he pulls it off.  Don Cheadle is also great--one of the most underrated actors around--putting on an Irish/Brit accent as a demolition expert. And then there's Carl Reiner, playing Saul (the name's a bit of irony), the most ""unreliable"" of the 11 robbers.  One never knows what he's going to do, or not do, in the process of the robbery. Elliot Gould is also good.<br/><br/>One bit of comic genius in the film (and why was I the only one laughing in the theater?):  Brad Pitt trying to teach a bunch of young actors (Joshua Jackson, Holly Marie Combs, Topher Grace, et al PLAYING THEMSELVES!!!!) how to play poker. A great touch."

Yes it has action, and yes there are some spectacularly over-the-top characters, but who wants to see true to life when true life is so frightening now?<br/><br/>The plot was twisting and evolving every scene, rarely was there a lax moment. What wasn't said was seen in the amazing locations, costumes and photography. As for the actors, I would give them each a standing O if it were still fashionable.<br/><br/>I am of the opinion that George Clooney pulled off his Leading Man role exquisitely. His smooth delivery made Daniel Ocean a pleasure to watch. Rusty and Danny have a tense, well-connected rapport that speaks for itself with the actor's facial expressions and communicative glances. The cast was an orchestra of well-played men. The inclusion of real life ""Teen Beat Pin Ups"" poked fun at the established fan base of Brad and George; As well as giving a slightly Brechtian lien to the rest of the show, blurring reality and fiction pleasantly for a change.<br/><br/>I have respect for all involved- whether or not they are still picking scenery splinters from between their teeth. What I found in Ocean's 11 (both times I have seen it so far) was a great suspense filled get away from the real life crime and fearful things we have seen in the past few months.<br/><br/>So lighten up and grab your popcorn; they'll be talking about this one for years to come!"

It is not hard to figure out what is going to happen in this movie. My logic says that this big budget film can't afford to end any but one way. So making this movie it is important to make the journey more interesting than the destination, since we know where it will go. The trick is to make getting there as clever and fun as possible. Sure, there is a mild feeling of suspense and a few mild twists. This half of the equation barely squeaks by. As for the fun factor, the movie is enjoyable. It is a nice ride, but not a white knuckled ride. George Clooney's smile and charisma seems to always make a worth watching (Three Kings, Out of Site, O Brother, Where Art Thou). Brad Pitt has definite star power, personality and edge (Fight Club, 12 Monkeys, and the underrated Kalifornia) that works for most of his films with a few exceptions (Meet Joe Black, The Mexican, Seven Years in Tibet). Don Cheadle, I love Don Cheadle. His name is so fun to say, Don Cheadle. Aside from hearing his name, he always has a presence whether it be in Traffic, Boogey Nights or Ocean's 11. Matt Damon. What can I say about Matt Damon? but he is consistently good (Good Will Hunting, Dogma, Rounders). I have yet to see him in a bad flick. Julia Roberts is Julia Roberts. You either hate her or love her. She does bring a very human feeling to all the movies she is in (Mystic Pizza, My Best Friends Wedding, Erin Brockovich).

"Aviva-2","Null","0","0","7 December 2001"," This movie just wants to have fun!
","There are movies that you watch when you want to think.   There are movies that you watch when you want to be called to action.  There are movies that you watch when you want to cry, or laugh, or be frightened.  And there are movies that you watch just for fun.  ""Ocean's Eleven"" is one of the latter type, and it fulfills its purpose with great success.<br/><br/>
Recent months have seen several caper/heist films: ""The Score"" with DeNiro and Norton was fairly positively reviewed, Mamet's ""Heist"" got praise from Mamet fans, but not too many others, and even back this summer, ""Rat Race"" might come to mind with its caper/race goofiness.  I've been to see them all, and ""Ocean's Eleven"" is probably my favorite.<br/><br/>""Ocean's Eleven"" is not a particularly complicated film, though it's a technically pretty one.  It's more along the lines of a ""Mission Impossible"" idea: lots of plot twists that _look_ very complicated, and feel so, but the details of which aren't so important.  And I don't mind at all, really. The point of ""Ocean's Eleven"" isn't to teach you how to break into a casino, it's to let you have a lot of fun while eleven other people, most of them very pretty, and all of them highly charismatic, do so.  And have fun you do, what with the interesting plot twists, hilariously funny moments, and engaging acting.<br/><br/>The film only really loses its momentum (and its sense of fun) during the overdetermined and unnecessary Julia Roberts plot.  I'm a Julia Roberts fan, and I love to see her in a movie, but I'm afraid she just didn't belong in this one -- and nor would anyone else have in this part.  The addition of a romantic subplot to the main action of the heist seems redundant and unnecessary; more an attempt to give George Clooney some soulful-eye camera time than anything that's actually necessary to the spirit of the film.<br/><br/>
Nonetheless, ""Ocean's Eleven"" remains an engaging, visually pleasing, and overall _fun_ movie.  I'd definitely recommend seeing it!"

","Having read other user comments, namely bams, I have to disagree on many fronts.  I feel as if this is the movie we have all been waiting for this year.  Soderberg did something with this piece that I was certain would not happen.  He actually brought several big name Hollywood stars from many different backgrounds and actually made an ensemble.  Without the chemistry, the movie very well could have died.<br/><br/>The script could easily been chopped and dropped with the wrong timing, character relation, or direction.  But by not only introducing the audience to many different character developments, and not just limiting each character to try to relate to one another with useless banter, the movie had me wanting to know what was going to happen next.<br/><br/>Of course, the script did tease me into believing that it was going to be a fresh idea, the audience realizes by the end that it wasn't necessarily something they had not seen before, but it was seen in a new manner.  The best part of the film was the timing.  The one liners didn't break the flow up, like they very well can and do in most films.  Soderberg scored a winner with this one, and glory be to this movie as I have been thoroughly disappointed in the film industry this year."

","Just saw the movie, and suggest you do too!  Seems to me that many people are stomping on it for all the wrong reasons, and are quite simply missing the point.  This movie is not about breaking new ground or providing us with insight about how to be a better person.  It's made to entertain, and it does so quite cleverly.  There's a reason that Clooney and Pitt seem to be the same character that they always are;  They're making fun of it! There's a reason that the stakes keep getting higher, and the heist more and more improbable:  They're making fun of these types of movies!  And it's done sharply and stylishly. If you're disappointed that the movie didn't give you more, you completely missed the point.  Yet, the movie was directed right at you.<br/><br/>Some people need to realize that movies shouldn't always be pretentious and with a sense of moral urgency.  Sometimes it's fun just to watch guys being cool; cool for no reason.  Add on top of that the fact that we (should) know that Clooney and Pitt are self-referentially making fun of the whole bit, it only makes it that much better.  Why do you think Pitt is always trying to 'teach' people to be cool, or Clooney pokes holes into Pitt's facade?  Just to have fun with it.<br/><br/>Complaining about this movie's lack ingenuity or believability is like complaining about animals in the Lion King talking.  Suspend some disbelief, and enjoy the experience of watching a movie that puts down the mantle of self-rightiousness, and dares to ask the question: ""How do you get a large group of Oscar caliber actors to share the same movie?""  (which seems to be harder than the heist pulled off in the movie) The answer, of course, is let them have fun.<br/><br/>For any of you needing a deeper intellectual fabric, you need to start taking some lessons from Pitt."

"tom_j_1982","Null","0","0","7 May 2002"," A detailed comparison of the old and new Ocean's Eleven
","A `Rat Pack' movie re-make may spring to one's mind on first hearing the title of this latest cinema release, but according to the producer Jerry Weintraub (who has also worked on the original) the two are very different. The name is the same, yes, and the basic story-lines also bare resemblance to each other, that is true. This is where the similes end between the two productions ! Ocean's Eleven (1960's) is about 11 `straight guys' who unlike the new 11 don't have any previous criminal convictions, and with dames at their beckon call throughout the movie and a highly pleasurable social life you start to ask yourself why should they even bother robbing their proposed target of 5 Las Vegas casinos? Aren't their lifestyles lavish enough as it is? This slightly surreal setting is all part and parcel of the slapstick styled movie. Some of the dialogue is great, and it's a classic period piece saluting chauvinism, alcoholism, arrogance, and Las Vegas glitz.  Ol blue eyes plays the part of prime instigator Ocean (but in my opinion is not a patch on the alternative Clooney character who out-smooths Sinatra) with Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jnr by his side as part of the over excessive extra ten needed to pull off the insanely risky heist. It's a colourful neon encrusted showbiz spectacle but unfortunately what was considered `cool' then seems a touch silly in today's world in comparison to the over powering slickness of the modern day version. The 2001 version offers us a range of characters, some of whom are just irresistible and are so good at acting  `cool' and thus keeping the whole ethos of the film running smoothly throughout, with ` smoothly' being the operative word in that last sentence. There are some unforgettable scenes in this movie and since all the actors involved in the production openly admitted how much fun they had making it. You can really see how relaxed everyone is around each other on screen. To all who are unaware of the modern day storyline I will now guide you through a brief outline of it. To those who think they know it because they've seen the original, read on anyway because believe me as I have already stated to you earlier these are two different films. The story begins with the just-out-of-jail Danny Ocean, (Clooney) who, straight from his penitentiary discharge starts hand picking a group of individually skilled men to embark on a three (not five) casino heist. The group consists of (Pitt) Ocean's wing man, who is also a bent cop, the pickpocket (Matt Damon), the explosives expert (Don Cheadle), the jittery surveillance expert (Eddie Jemison), a con man/blackjack dealer (Bernie Mac) a team of twin mechanical geniuses (Scott Caan & Casey Affleck), a Chinese acrobat or `grease man' (Shaoba Qin) and two old veterans to the game (Elliot Gould & Carl Reiner). On the opposing side to the likable group is the stern, machine-like owner of the three targeted casinos, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). Garcia's character is ruthless in the art of revenge and would be a reasonable deterrent to any potential thief wanting to steal his casinos combined earnings, which lie in a top drawer high security vault 200ft beneath the Las Vegas topsoil. Benedict's current girlfriend and Clooney's ex-wife in the film, Tess (Julia Roberts) puts the icing onto this already star-studded cake. It is after Garcia and Roberts are introduced that this film really takes off. The intricate and technical methods used by the eleven strong in the act of the heist are a joy to behold on the big screen and with Soderbergh behind the camera you can rest assure that sensational shots of Vegas and a barrage of slick effects accompany the entertaining story. I think it was the presence of the well-known producer Jerry Weintraub that allowed the production team such flexibility when shooting Vegas. Weintraub was quoted as saying `nobody could have shot Vegas like we did' and you can see why on witnessing the breath taking aerial shots (especially good when sat in your cinema seat). What Weintraub says becomes even more clear when you think of the strings that were pulled in staging a mock heavy weight title match with Lennox Lewis to boot. One may have to turn a blind eye to a couple of unrealistic sequences through the film, but from an overview these minor blunders don't really hinder the brilliance of Soderbergh and his team. Above all else the film is accompanied by a well suited  and easy-going jazz funk soundtrack created by our own David Holmes. Holmes who also made the Out of Sight soundtrack hits the proverbial nail on the head with his latest offering. His sounds allow the film to roll nicely from one scene to the next and it all moves beautifully in tandem with the way the film and characters look, you can even feel a hint of the 1960's atmosphere coming through. As a film, its entertainment and should be enjoyable to the majority of you out there. If on the other hand you are looking for something with a deeper meaning or just hard and serious viewing, either version of Ocean's Eleven is not what your looking for, trust me!! Without a single act of profanity this is definitely family viewing and I am sure this film will do well at the box office. With an additional bonus of the Robert Altman type star line up its no wonder the stars were queuing up to be in this one."

I didn't do that with Oceans Eleven, but it's so good it makes me wish I could turn back time and change my course.  Starting off with George Clooney in a goatee discussing his reasons for being paroled, the movie grabs you by the lapels and never lets go.  Clooney and Pitt steal and own the show, most notably Pitt, who is easily becoming the all around coolest actor in all of Hollywood.  Everything he touches turns to gold these days.  From frame 1 to the joke credit for Julia Roberts, the movie is one great ride.  Don ""Scenestealer"" Cheadle comes in as a guy named Basher, further adding to the element of this movie being the ""it"" movie of 2001.  Not a ten, but a solid, bold, bright, tall nine."

There's talent behind and in front of the camera and the script has enough pizzazz to keep even the shortest attention spans interested.  The Julia Roberts character throws an unnecessary degree of schmaltz into the macho brew and weakened the piece quite a bit; of course, leaving out a sex interest for at least one of the boys would have been bad for box-office demigraphics.

","I saw Ocean's Eleven recently at a dollar matinee and found it to be extremely enjoyable.

The soundtrack and scenery are funky and colorful, and everyone looks fabulous, with the exception of Elliott Gould, who sure didn't age well.

There were several times where I actually laughed out loud, which is rare for me with ANY movie.<br/><br/>However, I also found Ocean's Eleven to have a couple of flaws. As quite possibly the only woman alive who doesn't appreciate romance, I think the love interest could have been eliminated, or at least diminished, with no harm to the plot. And I found the ending to be somewhat disappointing and contrived.

","Danny Ocean has just got out of jail. He's a free man. All he has to do is keep his nose clean, stay in the state and report to a parole officer several times a week. So with a chance at a clean life Danny comes to a decision, he's going to leave the state, hire a crackpot team of criminals and rob three of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas. And so the plot of Steven Soderbergh's remake of the 60s crime thriller Ocean's Eleven, unfolds. Danny (George Clooney) recruits a highly trained team of specialists including card shark Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), a speedy pickpocket Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) and an explosives expert Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle) who pulls of a cockney accent admirably to great humour throughout the film. With the highly camp, medallion-wearing Reuben Tishkoff played by veteran actor Elliot Gould supplying the money for the operation, the crew plan to steal over $150 million from casinos owned by the slippery, venomous Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). The film is tightly directed by Oscar-winner Soderbergh who allows the Hollywood ensemble to play off each other in coolness and laughs. And laughs are the most important element to the movie. Without comedy the film would just be about a group of slick, hotshot criminals in suits. Clooney and the other ten specialists all have flaws and though their operations leading up to the heist itself are brilliantly planned, the suited men run into problems such as when they steal equipment from a California lab. Matt Damon only does pick-pocketing so breaking in and stealing equipment isn't his speciality so he's left in the van with two brothers of the team whilst the others brake in. Damon gets so tired of the brother's bickering that he sets off to help the others in the lab. As he goes in one door, the others rush out another door with the equipment and drive away leaving a panicking Damon to scramble across a rooftop and jump on top of the van whilst being shot at by security guards. The film uses several different points of view throughout the plot to allow the story to run smoothly and build suspense but it never hides too much for too long.  A downfall of many thrillers is that they rely on a twist, which is sewn throughout the film but leaves the audience feeling cheated. Ocean's Eleven cuts away only briefly from events to build suspense and therefore remains convincing but more importantly, comes across as an honest account. Clooney and Pitt have chemistry but it doesn't boil down to much just two good actors dressed in suits acting well together, nothing spectacular. Supporting roles by the young Cheadle and Damon are excellent and Elliot Gould doesn't disappoint. Julia Roberts puts in the only bad performance of the whole film. Playing Danny Ocean's ex-wife Tess, Roberts is wooden in movement, her acting is bland, if it can be called acting, and suggests maybe Roberts wasn't available at the time and the film's producers used a look-alike doll instead. She could have done a lot better as has been shown with roles such as Erin Brocovich, also directed by Soderbergh and though not having much screen time, manages to bring the film down a peg. That said, Ocean's Eleven is still a worthy watch and thanks to a competent cast, a catchy soundtrack and a slick plot, the film raises just above the usual Hollywood no-brainer."

I have never seen the original, but I must say that this movie was great entertainment that had me laughing, and on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>The characters in the film could have been developed some more, but their chemistry together was particularly both amusing and cooperative.<br/><br/>The director of this film, after his huge success with Traffic, has definitely shown himself again as a somewhat experimental filmmaker.  His various uses of Extreme Close Ups and rapid montage are excellent and thought provoking, and his hypnotic way of using just the right volume of music at the right time puts you in perspective with the characters.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this film is that I, myself, felt like Andy Garcia's character.  This is because the main cast of thieves kept on surprising the audience little by little, leaving the detective work to us.  I truly could not figure anything out of any one scene until the scene was over.  This was experimental, because some viewers don't like to try and figure things out, but I believe that it worked.<br/><br/>There are a few problems with the film.  One of the problems is that the very talented Matt Damon seemed to have been placed on a low key throughout the film, and the hysterical Bernie Mac seemed to have been given a low profile in the editing room.<br/><br/>However, I still enjoyed this movie tremendously, routed for the bad guys like I was supposed to, and I would recommend this movie to anybody with a free Saturday night.<br/><br/>I rate this film : ********  (Eight out of Ten)"

","Let's rob together! (Ocean's Eleven)<br/><br/> Eleven charming delinquents intend to rob the three largest and richest casinos in Las Vegas. The mission seems to be impossible, but our heroes especially Danny Ocean (George Clooney) the leader of the gang are amazingly smart. The plan is simple and incredibly complicated at the same time. Naturally we know nothing about the details at the beginning of the chosen night, which is the night of a box match between Lennox Lewis and DR. Vladimir Klitschko, so surprise follows surprise. Eleven males would make a kind of boring film from sexual point of view therefore the director did not leave the indispensable love element out. This is how finally we have to realize in the cinema that the whole thing is not because of money but love.<br/><br/>Remakes are fashionable again in Hollywood although they are usually remakes of European films, the case of Ocean's Eleven is different. This movie isthe adaptation of an old American film from 1959. 'People went to see that film because of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop If they only had had to read the telephone directory, the film would have been successful still.' - says Jerry Weintraub the producer. It is very difficult to get rid of the feeling that the same is true to this version. The creators did not have the intention to change anything but the scene. What we get is bunch of superstars like George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and I firmly believe this is what makes the audience get into the cinema initially.<br/><br/>On the other hand the story itself promises something interesting. People seem to like these kind of brainy guys solving problems that are expected to be impossible, robbing top secure banks, escaping from prisons, etc. Basically this is a typically Hollywood topic and the message is simple: there is no such a thing as impossible, everything can be done, you can conquer a crowd of aggressive dinosaurs (Jurassic Park 1993), you can escape from the whole German army (Saving Private Ryan 1998), one man can save the whole world (Armageddon 1998 and many others) and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>Except for the luxurious house of Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) the financial supporter of the plan the whole film takes place in casinos and hotels. These institutions let the crew work in their buildings free. It is easy to understand since the film is a two-hour advertisement for them. So the story is in the world of glittering and the world of well-off people, both much adored by average Americans (and Europeans)."

The team assembled is certainly shady given their tarnished backgrounds (accomplished via impressive flashback clips and clever montage sequences which are informative as they are entertaining) and couldn't have less in common personality-wise yet collectively gel into a well-oiled machine which convince you their mission could actually be attainable. Even with the given skeletons present in their respective pasts you still find yourself rooting for these 'bad' guys. Andy Garcia is great as the stooge and ultimate fall guy who gets a deserved comeupance and the added tension of Clooney's team attempting to pull off the caper with unexpected hurdles makes the confusion and chaos a more than welcomed plot entanglement.

The remake isn't exactly the same as the original, in fact quite far from it, which is why viewers of the original Oceans Eleven won't basically be seeing the same film again if they try Soderbergh's version.

","WOW. I just watched Ocean's 11 yesterday and I think it is one of the best movies of 2002. A wonderful cast, it's kind of obvious being it includes George Clooney (ER), Brad Pitt (Legends Of The Fall), Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting) & Julia Roberts (Pretty Woman). Every cast member has a spark that unites them all. No character (even though the script obviously says otherwise) has a bigger role that the other. Ocean's... unites Hollywood's hottest star in one film. Though film could of been better written, works for any fan. Film's smartness will dazzle you at the end. Even though Julia's role is small it is smart and sexy. Clooney's role will leave you breathless, with his abbility to confuse you, even though according to script. Pitt's part is a secondary role but is played splendly. Damon's role is of a dumb thief, he still played it perfectly. Director's directing is better than any other Steven Sodebergh film. BOTTOM LINE: 11 (out of 10) for Ocean's 11"

","A very obvious plot flaw towards the end concerning the lone female cast member almost sinks this lighthearted remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film concerning a simultaneous heist of three Vegas casinos. The fact that the flaw could have easily been corrected makes it all the more disconcerting and you leave the movie shaking your head. But ultimately the memory of the geniality of the project wins you over. It's definitely minor Steven Soderbergh but that's the point: after the seriousness of both `Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich' this must have been a welcome relief and he has a lot fun letting his actors indulge their hipness quotient. The large cast does just that, with George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts among others preferring to underplay rather than ham it up (although the always-welcome Carl Reiner has some very juicy scenes impersonating a Russian). Soderbergh revels in the testosterone heaviness of his film--there are some shots of backlit Vegas fountains exploding that would seem almost silly if they weren't tinged with the bit of melancholy that occurs after orgasm. All in all, a good way for Soderbergh to recharge his batteries."

George Clooney plays himself, much the same as his character in Out Of Sight. Brad Pitt puts in a very mediocre performance by Brad Pitt standards (but this could never be as good as his 'Fight Club' or 'Twelve Monkeys' or even his 'Se7en'). Julia Roberts is just there for eye-candy (enough said). Matt Damon just looked like he was strolling though this, not a patch on his performances in Good Will Hunting or Dogma (then again both had better screenplays). Andy Garcia is probably the best of the top-billed actors, but playing a character with a reputation for being evil I wished he could have shown more of an evil side. The supporting actors were better. Scott Caan and Casey Affleck were probably the best and funniest characters and Elliott Gould put in a memorable and amusing performance. Worst of the supporting actors was Don Cheadle (but not for his acting abilities), for some unknown reason they took an American and decided to put a Cockney accent on him! Why ? What was the point ? No wonder he decided to appear 'uncredited'.<br/><br/>Saying all that the film kept going at the same pace throughout and never died at all. When I saw this at least 75% of the audience were women (no shocks there!)and I'm sure they loved the film.<br/><br/>I just expected more from 'the cast to die for'.

"#1 Gracie","10","0","0","9 December 2001"," Fun, Laughter-Inducing Film
","Steven Soderbergh is really beginning to impress me. Being a relatively new fan of his, he caught my eye by punching out two Oscar-nominated films in the year 2000 alone. And showing his versatility, he takes a break from those films and creates a popcorn movie for us, ""Ocean's Eleven"". But he pulls off something with ""Ocean's Eleven"" that can rarely be achieved: making a popcorn movie that's excellent and well-crafted.<br/><br/>""Ocean's Eleven"" begins in New Jersey, where Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is being questioned to see whether he should be allowed parole. He of course is given the parole (how would this movie have even had a story if he hadn't been granted it?) and immediately after he leaves the slammer, he begins his next heist: robbing three casinos in Las Vegas, which are all owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), who is currently keeping Danny's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts) company.<br/><br/>He talks to an old acquaintance named Frank (Bernie Mac) about the whereabouts of his old pal Rusty (Brad Pitt), and is directed to Hollywood, where he finds Rusty getting a paycheck by teaching various young Hollywood actors (led by a very funny Topher Grace and including Holly Marie Combs, Joshua Jackson, Shane West and Barry Watson) how to play poker. He talks to Rusty about his heist plans, and they both decide they need to assemble a crew. They acquire the aid of eleven criminals, and as a team, plan the biggest heist yet that Danny has put together.<br/><br/>This movie was great from the first cell of celluloid to the last. The story was good and the script made the story even better. The lines were believable and never failed to have me rolling in my seat.<br/><br/>The movie was paced well; I didn't feel like I was watching a 117 minute movie. The plot rolls smoothly and takes it's time, making Danny's planning as well as the actual heist move at a good and believable pace. We don't have five minutes of planning and two hours of the heist, or vice versa. Each section of the movie has enough time to breath.<br/><br/>The acting was great as well, which is what you can expect with a cast like this. George Clooney put in a great performance as Danny Ocean; he represented the character really well and let you understand his motives and backgrounds. Brad Pitt also did an excellent job as Rusty; he was often stealing scenes from George Clooney and the rest of the eleven. Everyone that was in George Clooney's assembled team did an excellent job as well, especially Elliot Gould as the millionaire, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan as the drivers and masters of disguises, and Don Cheadle as a British bomber. And Julia Roberts did a good job as Danny's bitter ex-wife--you could almost feel the ice when she would bicker with Danny and retort at his remarks.<br/><br/>It's rare that a movie meant to not be an artistic one can have great cinematography, but ""Ocean's Eleven"" has accomplished that feat. There are some great shots taken during a scene where the guys are trying to escape from a building but also trying to save Linus (Matt Damon) as well--lots of ""underneath of the runner"" shots. And the angling used during some of the scenes throughout the heist looked very pretty.<br/><br/>""Ocean's Eleven"" was a great movie to watch. Not a masterpiece or anything, but it wasn't supposed to be a masterpiece. It was supposed to be a fun movie. And that's what I got: a fun movie. Only this fun movie had a bonus for it's audiences: being crafted well.<br/><br/>10/10, A"

In addition to being a really fun movie to watch one can almost feel how much fun the cast had being in it. It's really great to see a movie where the mood is so infectious and this is a movie one just gets swept into.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it be warned: the first 20 minutes or so is a bit draggy but that's just to build momentum, the movie more then compensates for that during the rest of the film. The movie Pulls the viewer into keeping eyes glued on it and stays Consistently engaging and on the edge of your seat exciting. <br/><br/>I think everyone was great in this and this is one of those rare movies that has a rare energy where you really don't wanna BLINK less you miss something.

","I had read the reviews of ""Ocean's 11"" beforehand and was told to expect a fun, slick, well made, smart and forgettable movie. That's what I looked for - and that's what I got.<br/><br/>""Ocean's 11"" tells the story of Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his ten cohorts (a range of actors including Brad Pitt and Matt Damon), who are attempting to knock over the casinos of Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). Thrown into the mix is Benedict's girlfriend, who happens to be Ocean's ex-wife - Contessa Ocean. Ocean, naturally, sets about trying to win her back...<br/><br/>There's many a thing working in the film's favour. Firstly when any other director saw the cast-list of Garcia, Clooney, Roberts, Damon, Pitt, Elliot Gould and others, that Soderbergh had managed to assemble, they probably went off to cry in jealousy. It's a fabulous cast - almost too good for one movie. The best chemistry in the movie is not between Clooney and Roberts, but Clooney and Pitt who play wonderfully off one another. Clooney plays his character quite like he did in Soderbergh's ""Out of Sight"": charming, witty, with just-a-hint of self deprecation. Roberts is quite under used and isn't allowed do much beyond sit around, trying to make her mind up about Ocean. It's Pitt who stands out the most - not just in his excellent interplays with Clooney - but whenever he has a line. The rest of the cast are equally up to the job, though like many reviews here I was forced to grate at Cheadle's ""English"" accent.<br/><br/>The script is grand. You can't expect much from a heist movie because they usually, as this does, degenerate into extremely silly territory as they attempt to explain just how the heroes pulled off the impossible-bank-job. This is no different but the viewer is having enough fun that they can jump over the plot-holes. It's not a movie taking itself too seriously, or looking to give Mr. Soderbergh more Oscars. It's made for enjoyment.<br/><br/>Soderbergh does a grand job directing. There's nothing particularly gimmicky ever employed - the occasional split screen is it - but he carries the movie along with a slick, well edited pace. There's a somewhat unfortunate need to over-explain certain elements, particularly towards the end, but I can forgive that. Soderbergh, much as he did in ""Out of Sight"" shows how he can make a fun, character-based, little movie that entertains.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me a lot of ""Bandits"" from last year - one large heist, with one ""twist"", characters invested with comedy and smartness. ""Ocean's 11"" has better actors, characters, and a plot and - particularly if you enjoyed ""Bandits"" - should be caught to while away an hour or two. There's far too little substance to make it a classic, but there's more than enough to fill the one-off entertainment quota. 7.5/10."

"rdarlington","Null","0","0","17 February 2002"," Inversion of the convention
","The cinematic convention is that the remake of a successful film is rarely as good as the original, but here director Steven Soderbergh has inverted that convention by taking a mediocre movie of 1960 and turning it into an enormously entertaining caper. A lot of it is down to Soderbergh's sheer cinematic verve; some of it is explained by the sharp script from Ted Griffin; but ultimately it works because of the stellar casting.<br/><br/>
George Clooney oozes charisma and cool as Danny Ocean, a career criminal who is no sooner out of jail than, like Yul Bryner in `The Magnificent Seven', he's recruiting for a mission impossible. Few shots are fired on this escapade, though, because it all comes down to planning, cunning and sheer bravado. <br/><br/>Along for the fun  and it's clear that the crew really enjoyed themselves  are young stars Brad Pitt and Matt Damon, old timers Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner, and sundry others ranging from a non English-speaking Chinese acrobat to a Cockney-speaking black man. Andy Garcia is the owner of the three casinos whose $150 million is targeted and Julia Roberts is his girlfriend who  at least for Ocean  is as much a target as the money.<br/><br/>The plot is totally fanciful, never more so that in the suggestion that one could take possession and operate a device that would knock out the electricity of Las Vegas without either act attracting the attention of law enforcement let alone special forces. But it is all done with great panache and, as sheer entertainment, this is hard to beat.<br/><br/>Footnote: The movie ends with a beautiful rendition of `Claire de Lune' by Debussy. Question: which other film uses this piece classical music? Answer: the 1991 `Frankie and Johnny'."

George Clooney revisits his Out of Sight persona; he's been here before and know all the right moves which executes perfectly.  Particularly pleasing is the chemistry between George Clooney and Brad Pitt, who seems to be wearing the wardrobe from Fight Club.<br/><br/>OK, the film is formulaic.  We've been here before and you might even be wondering if Steven Soderbergh is going to adding in the alternate 'SWAT van dangling off a mountain' ending to the director's cut of the DVD.  None of this matters though.  It's like being reunited with an old friend who's smartened up a lot since you last saw them.  All the familiar characters and plot twists are there and they're all where you expect them.  For the postmodernists among you there are lots of cheeky references not only to the original but to the genre in general.

You consistently  deliver unique characters and have a story-telling style that is hard to match not to mention takes on heavy subject matter. Now that I've painted the picture I ask you, wouldn't you just want to make a film that's fun just to make? I think that if you approach this film with the idea that Steven Soderbergh just wanted to make a film with a few of his friends who just happen to be big stars then you will enjoy it. You must also remember that every film doesn't have to smack you in the face with a message. Sometimes a movie should be enjoyed for its pure entertainment value.

","When thinking about the movie to write this review I had to pinch myself to come up with why I really like this movie because it shouldn't be as good as it was. The main problem is the plot or lack of, Danny Ocean comes up with a plan for stealing cash, and they do it, and no it never really gets any more complicated. Okay I'll admit that there's are a few twists, but after the woman turns up then it very easy to see where the plot is going. However even with the lack of plot, director Steven Soderbergh manages to produces another great movie. One reason is the one liners, they're nearly all funny and there's something for everyone's taste, at times when thinking about the movie, it would do well as a stand up comedy act. Then there's the cast, WOW how much money went on the pay roll is my question (I could list them but there's no point). Everyone plays their part very well, there are no weak performances, although I have to point out Matt Damon for the best performance. Yes I think it's the fact of the cast and the humour in it that makes this film very good. This is another go and see movie, especially if you want a good night out with some fun."

","Very good comedy thriller movie that does not try to take itself seriously or try for any story depth.This movie was deliberately done in a PG-13 style which is ok BUT the story genre demands a grittier rated R style production.The acting was nothing intense at all as they seemed to just go on cruise control.Roberts showed a little more acting effort than the other main actors but it only made her seemed a little out of place.The last few scenes of the movie was also very messy.The movie producers really tried too hard to water this movie down a tag too much. This remake is definitely better than the wasted 1960 effort but I can only imagine if this newer version was done rated R style,with a little more depth and plot attention to detail in the mold of PULP FICTION or SNATCH.Still,if you are into Las Vegas setting comedies of are a big fan of any of the lead actors here and you don't mind your crime caper movies done in a PG-13 style,you will get your money's worth with this one........"

But at the end I know everything.

I hope he will continue making films. -Elliott Gould: he was funny and good as always... -Andy Garcia: Terry Benedict couldn't be better played than Andy did it!<br/><br/>-Story: Danny Ocean is free after spending 4 years in prison.

It can sometime go wrong and the result will be a disaster, but Ocean's Eleven is an example that it can sometime have a good ending.

And yet under that old premise, lies a subtext which is as enjoyable as the main one. The subtext deal with making a movie and the relation between fiction and reality. While these are not the main subjects of the film there are there, in the air, in what people says and the whole execution of the robbery.<br/><br/>The cast(old and new) is good and they are on spot with the characters.

Look at From Dusk Til Dawn.  All affable criminals, and all excellent.  On the other hand, look at that travesty of a Batman movie, and see how George Clooney can really only play one role.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this movie has him in that role once more.  And it's smashing.<br/><br/>The amount of male eye candy in this movie is astounding.  At least three of the leads are extremely attractive.  Men are less fortunate.  Julia Roberts's upper lip is larger than her lower lip, which I've never noticed before; I can't help wondering about possible collagen implants.  She plays a snotty little wench in this movie, without much character development, but then this movie isn't about the characters.<br/><br/>It's about The Heist, like all heist movies are.

"localboy","Null","0","0","14 January 2002"," Taut and stylish heist thriller
","Fresh from his Oscar success for Best Director and Picture (Traffic) as well as coaxing Julia Roberts to Best Actress (Erin Brokovich), Steven Soderbergh is certainly flavour of the moment. It's probably due to this flush of recent successes that he has managed to resuscitate what would seem at first glance to be an unlikely candidate for a remake. The original Ocean's Eleven was made in 1960 with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jnr and the rest of the so-called 'Rat Pack' of that time.<br/><br/>Ocean's Eleven are the eleven people chosen by fresh-out-of-jail ringleader Danny Ocean (George Clooney). They are selected for the particular skills they have as pickpockets, computer whizzes, card sharps and acrobats. The aim? To simultaneously rob three Las Vegas casinos owned by creepy billionaire Terence Benedict (Andy Garcia). The plan calls for an elaborate series of scams and is complicated by the fact that Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts) is now the girlfriend of Benedict. The reward? One hundred and sixty million dollars in cash locked away in a heavily-guarded underground vault.<br/><br/>Soderbergh has, against the odds, managed to create a taut and stylish heist thriller. If anything, it's probably top heavy with a few too many big names. Although they look attractive and can certainly act, they tend at times to distract from the story. The high profiles of actors such as Julia Roberts often overshadow the characters they're playing.<br/><br/>One of the standout performances is Andy Garcia who gives a cold, calculating and unnerving performance as Terence Benedict, the control-freak casino owner. George Clooney turns on his trademark smooth, self-deprecating charm and Brad Pitt is charismatic and dependable as the clever sidekick Dusty Ryan. Matt Damon is not as annoying as he has been in most of his movies since Good Will Hunting and is actually not too bad as pickpocket Linus Caldwell.<br/><br/>Ocean's Eleven is definitely a class above The Score, another recent and similar heist movie. It has more tension, a better plot with more twists and a director currently on a creative roll. It also looks great with edgy camerawork and skilful lighting that makes everyone look good in an old-fashioned luminous Hollywood kind of way.<br/><br/>A very sophisticated effort, jam-packed with an incredible cast of 'A' list actors. Ocean's Eleven scores 7.5/10"
"DannyBoy-17","Null","0","0","8 December 2001"," Something missing...
","I can't quite say what was missing from Ocean's Eleven.  The heist itself seemed a bit hard to follow with all the eleven guys contributing to distractions from the robbery itself.  There seemed far too many little twists, and yet I didn't care about them.  I think there isn't a single moment in the film where I shook my head in disbelief. The best heist movie of 2001 was The Score.  Why?  Because a simple job becomes complicated, and two guys who are not going to be the best of friends go head-to-head in the heist itself.  The heist is not so complicated in the Score, but we are in DeNiro's head so we seriously sympathize with every grunt, wrong turn, and realization he goes through. (The way he actually pulls off his robbery is quite clever.) <br/><br/>   Something about Ocean's Eleven is too sure of itself.  You know what's going to happen before it does.  I liked the scenery, the photography, and some of the characterizations were also quite fun.  However, where are the characters and the suspense?  Why is Andy Garcia so damn calm and lifeless throughout the film?  The Washington Post said that Ocean's Eleven was MI, Dirty Dozen, and the Sting rolled into one.  It'd like to be all those things.  All I can say is the film that does the team heist to the best degree is SNEAKERS.  Always will be.    <br/><br/>   Why?  Because of the camaraderie of the team, the simultaneous desperation and talent in each member, the writing, the villain, the plot, the wonderful prize of ""the box.""  The pure sweat that it ended up taking to get away with the job done. You never draw a breath in Ocean's Eleven...well, except when that mini-truck gets crushed by the monster truck.  Onto to better films..."

George Clooney was great in this movie ( and was it just me or did anybody else also expect him to say ""Jack Foley"" when asked for his name in the first scene??) but Brad Pitt definitely outshone him.

","(Note: If you have not seen this film, or do not want any indication of the outcome, you are advised not to read this review.)<br/><br/>Chances are most audiences will be `In' in answer to the slogan of the new Ocean's Eleven film, `Are You In or Out?'  Director Steven Soderbergh's remake of the original 1960 `ratpack' film cleans up the abuse the women take in the original and salvages the plot line only to resurrect it as a star-studded audience favorite.<br/><br/>The new electrifying comedy has a way of taking you and twisting your morals to siding with the beloved criminals in their quest for revenge and riches.  The revived Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is the experienced `Idea Man' who immediately after his release from prison, is out making trouble again with old friends en route to his former `Wildcard' wife, Tess (Julia Roberts) who has fallen into the wealthy hands of Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the owner of Ocean's target casinos.  Ocean is quickly in-touch with his good buddy Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt)  who co-plots the heist of three of Benedict's casinos.  Ryan's suggestions of supporting criminals include `A Bowski, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros and a Leon Spinx, not to mention the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever.'  The following twenty minutes of recruitment of the right people for the jobs whizzes around the country in a speedy and enjoyable fashion including picking up their bankroll and hilarious advice from Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) along the way and even though he thinks Ryan and Ocean are `out of your god d**n minds,' he grasps the chance to get his own payback on Benedict who muscled him out of the casino business.<br/><br/>The quest continues picking up a `grease man,' an electronics expert (Edward Jemison), a bomber, an inside man (Bernie Mac), a pair of getaway pros, and a high roller being the formerly retired Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) who suffers intermittently from his ulcers.  The crew assembles in Vegas and begins to collect information on each of the casinos and the security inside them in a two week period before the night of the heist which just happens to be a fight night featuring Lennox Lewis.  Ocean also bravely probes into Tess on a couple of occasions throughout the weeks even in front of Benedict making for an extremely tense and appealing scene.<br/><br/>As all the elements of the heist fall into place on fight night, Benedict's team is toppled in a truly clever and aggressive array of Soderbergh's film genius.  The fast paced heist is almost so lucrative that you will want to see the film again to appreciate the planning and execution carried out as you are left wondering `how they did it' just as Benedict is as Tess leaves him for Ocean once again.<br/><br/>The funny part is that in the end the heist works, and you sit there completely amazed, yet you feel extremely pleased as if the good has actually overcome the bad whereas it is more like the moderately good has overcome the evil, almost tragic.<br/><br/>Though at times the film may be a bit predictable and seem to draw itself towards an `All is well' ending Soderbergh never gives in and keeps it fresh and somewhat righteous as even Ocean pays for what he has done although the price is miniscule as to the reward.  He came and they conquered once disproving that `the house always wins.' ***Â½"

I have been waiting to see this movie since I first saw the cast listing last year.  It didn't fail to live up to everything I expected.

The rest of the cast was dead-on as well and quite funny.  <br/><br/>The other thing, and probably my favorite thing, was that no one in the cast got short changed.  Everyone got their bit of screen time and their ""moment to shine"" so to speak.  The other cool thing was that all the ""major players"" in the movie got to interact with each other together on screen. Gracia-Clooney, Damon-Pitt, Clooney-Roberts.  It seemed like everyone was on the same page and that they all actually seemed like they wanted to be there.<br/><br/>Other then that, the plot was silly and wack but creative and funny.  The players were so smooth in pulling of this heist and the twists and turns keeps you guessing the entire time.  Just for the record, this crime would never happen in a million years in real life, but this is not real life. So, if you are looking for an escape, something to totally relax to....Ocean's Eleven is that movie!!!  <br/><br/>If nothing else, watch it for the cast alone.

","Ocean's Eleven is a very entertaining movie, one that I have been looking forward to seeing for awhile, the movie has gone up and beyond my expectations, It is probaly the best of 2001 so far.. First of all the acting was just great in this film, George Cloony (Danny Ocean) gives us problay one of the best performanes of his career, Brad Pitt (Rusty) does a great job with his charecter as does Matt Damon, you can tell that both of them put in alot of time trying to perfect there perfomances... Oceans Eleven tells the story of Daniel Ocean just released from prison, who set's up a casino hiest, 3 casino's in one night, impossible? maybe but with the help of his Right-Hand man (Brad Pitt) he figures out every detail of every casino and sets up a team of 11 men to try to pull it off. The story is great, no visible plot holes, no scenes that could of been left out, and no cliches involved. The movie is probaly the best hiest film ever made. Steve Soderbergh has out done himself here, giving us the most entertaining movie of the year. He does a fantastic job capturing the beauty behind Las Vegas, and the overhead shots of the city or some of the best I have ever seen. The only thing that really got to me though is Don Cheadle's irish/british acsent it gets annoying real fast, but that is one thing I can easily forgive and forget, and overall Ocean's Eleven is the most entertaining movie in years. I truly recommend this film to anybody that love's film making at it's best, and acting at it's best.... This is by far the BEST movie of the year (Next to Lord Of The Rings) it's so much fun to watch, It's not an easy task for movie to receive a 10 from because I am very STRICT with my rating system, but this and LOTR were the one's that captured me the most therefore they both receive a 10/10."

"EmperorNortonII","8","0","0","12 January 2002"," Retro Meets Techno
","The original ""Ocean's Eleven"" starring Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack was a classic of coolness.  The remake starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt and a host of others tries to shoot for something close to that.  The movie uses a retro cool jazz score, and has a lot of gimmicky camera shots (like the rear view of Clooney and Pitt as they drive).  And it was interesting to see new technology added to the story, bringing the 1960 original into the 21st century.  But, all in all, I must say the original was better.  It had a certain charm to it.  The remake was done adequately, but if not for names and premises, it just seems like a completely different movie altogether."

","Can it really be that in his heart of hearts, Steven Soderbergh is not<br/><br/>Jean-Luc Godard, and not Martin Scorsese, and not even Don<br/><br/>Siegel, but...Sydney Pollack? In the vein of Scorsese's AFTER<br/><br/>HOURS, the OCEAN'S ELEVEN remake is a clear attempt by the<br/><br/>director to take his skills-set to a new level by exercising it on<br/><br/>material that ""has nothing to say;"" but where Scorsese's exercises<br/><br/>in pure style (like AFTER HOURS and CAPE FEAR) are triumphs of<br/><br/>sheer filmmaking verve over content, ELEVEN smacks of mere<br/><br/>yeoman professionalism (at least, until its visually sumptuous last<br/><br/>third). <br/><br/>What makes Soderbergh different from the rest? Why does his<br/><br/>version of this routine, Elmore Leonard-y guys-on-a-heist picture<br/><br/>feel richer, more human, more cinematic, more alive than the most<br/><br/>recent 25 to have come before it? I think it is that Soderbergh<br/><br/>understands disparate things, like a) the handling of a 35 camera<br/><br/>and b) the handling of the chairman of Warner Bros. and c) the<br/><br/>handling of the biggest movie stars on the planet, that no one else<br/><br/>has on their resume. The shaker-and-baker people, the Barry<br/><br/>Levinsons and the Joel Schumachers, don't have Soderbergh's<br/><br/>daring, his knowledge of movies, his love of the perfeect image;<br/><br/>the other guys, the art guys, don't have Soderbergh's conciliatory<br/><br/>make-everybody-feel-good tactics. Even Spielberg (a far superior<br/><br/>director) doesn't have a toe in both worlds the way Soderbergh<br/><br/>does.<br/><br/>But something finally makes one bridle against this. Though some<br/><br/>of the filmmaking in the latter half of OCEAN'S is spectacular, and<br/><br/>the tight, worked-out quality of Ted Griffin's script is impressive,<br/><br/>one wearies of Soderbergh's endless titrations of brainy-yet-slick<br/><br/>or slick-yet-brainy. He has proven that he can do the Hollywood<br/><br/>movie nonpareil. Now it's time for him to do SCHIZOPOLIS<br/><br/>2--before he winds up like the Elliott Gould character, a<br/><br/>cigar-chomping hackmo reduced to eating a meagre green salad<br/><br/>with vinaigrette in the back yard of a mansion the size of the Ritz."

","One of the slickest films of the year has to be `Ocean's Eleven.' Director Steven Soderbergh has remade this Rat Pack classic about a heist in Las Vegas with a golden nugget touch. It also contains some excalibur performances by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, and Don Cheadle. It also has made some booming business at the box office that has probably made some MGM executives grand with anger that they did not produce the film. Clooney plays Danny Ocean an expert thief who recruits 10 skilled crafty characters to rob 3 casinos in Las Vegas. The look of Las Vegas has never looked so `luxor'ious in a film until `Ocean's Eleven' that it deserves to be inserted in some type of stratospheric category. The only thing about the film that I should hope was just a mirage was the dull acting of Julia Roberts as the angry ex-wife. All in all, `Ocean's Eleven' is one that you should treasure in your movie collection. **** Good"

","I have to start this review by saying that I had never seen the original nor do I have any intention to watch it because of Frank (the egotistic) Sinatra.I did however enjoy the new film in the same spirit and fun of The Thomas Crown Affair(the one with Pierce Brosnan).<br/><br/>First off is the cast which is lead by Clooney and Pitt who now seem to enjoy the cool and sexy reputation that of Connery and Redford.I like their combination and it seemed to work well,also are the hilarious casting of Elliot Gould and Don Cheadle who plays a casino owner and pyrotechnician.The rest of the high profile cast which includes Roberts,Garcia and the ever enjoyable Riener lead the way to a good old fashion heist flick.<br/><br/>When I mean old fashion I mean the camera work that you see in the movie which will obviously draw your attension to sixties Bond movies and Bullit.I kind of liked that feeling where the camera goes out of focus\and blurs and then moves on to the next scene like a dream sequence.I also enjoyed the fact that they did not make Vegas look like some gawdy,bright red and yellow show girls everywhere you look kind of image.It is quite similar to the look of Indecent Proposal.<br/><br/>The film virtually centres arround Vegas where Danny Ocean and his buddy Rusty plans to steal $150 million from a Vegas casino during Boxing night.It's all pretty straight forward and you got to hand it to the Director who gives you everything strait up with no twists leaving the actors to do thier respective parts.Don't expect an 'Entrapment' or 'Thomas Crown Affair' ending to this film because that is not what they are aiming at.<br/><br/>My only regret in this movie was the soundtrack and I wish that it would have been handed over to pro's like Burt Bacharach or John Barry.The reason for this is that I could almost hear a really smooth pop/jazz track whenever they show the gang at work.David Holmes is a good composer but the old guys would have done it better.<br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh score's 10 points for this movie because he makes his actors deliver performances and does not worry too much about plot twists and that in itself came to me a big surprise."

","Yes, I enjoyed this movie. It was good entertainment! Initially when the movie started, I felt myself thinking - I hope this gets better and picks up the pace. Thankfully it did. The introduction of Carl Reiner and Elliot Gould in the movie added a new and better dimension to the story. Good call on putting in some good old actors in there to make it more interesting!<br/><br/>The acting all around was pretty good. My only beef is with Clooney and Soderbergh casting Julia as Tess. She had zero chemistry with everybody that she came in contact with. the chemistry with her and Andy Garcia was flat and close to non-existent. Julia was supposed to be George's ex - there should be some sort of chemistry there, but again, I felt none. Actually, she was more like a window dressing, she didn't need to be in the movie at all.<br/><br/>I would have to say the best chemistry that was tangible was that between George and Brad. They were a great pair - George and Soderbergh did a bang up job of getting everybody else in this movie!<br/><br/>the story moved along quite nicely after the first few minutes, introducing the characters, new spins, and twists to the plot. It kept me laughing and watching with anticipation (even though you can figure out the ending). And the special effects when it came to the actually heist, I thought were pretty cool.<br/><br/>Although I've never seen the original, I'm sure that this was far better. This group of actors have coolness almost up there with the rat pack! Pair that group of actors with a good upbeat script and you can't go wrong!<br/><br/>I would suggest this movie to anyone.

In my humble opinion she is just about as overrated as an actor can be.<br/><br/>But, this film was just plain great.  Entertaining all around... funny, but not overly so... this film seemed very tight to me in it's weaving the story in a way that gives the big ensemble cast their own chances to develop their characters on screen without hurting the plot advancement.  There are a bunch of ""techno-heist"" films out now... and I'll put Ocean's against any of them.  While not entirely unpredictable, I was having such a good time throughout the whole film that I just didn't care.  Terrific use of music to propel you through the story and provide a sense of pacing... just one of the many things I noticed about the movie.<br/><br/>My girlfriend even liked it, which brings the number of films we agree upon to 4... (should I be surprised that 3 of these films star Brad Pitt, I wonder?)<br/><br/>As for Julia... mercifully her role limited her to be the eye candy and not the Erin Brokovich, which I think she does much more convincingly.<br/><br/>I know it will never reap any real critical recognition, but for sure it has a spot on my dvd rack where it will see repeated use.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion.... probably the best remake ever.

","The original Oceans 11 wasn't really a very good movie. It had the cache of the Rat Pack, those entertainers who, led by Sinatra's star power, embodied for America a blend of 30's and 40's show biz and star system glitz, with a new elite 50's cool, hip, carefree. They were recognizably powerful and influential both culturally and politically. Those guys seemed to be behaving at their public personas while they were supposed to be acting. <br/><br/>In the 2001 Oceans 11, we get hot Hollywood stars who are also really fine actors and whose crafted performances embody all the easygoing bravado of the original rat packers. It's a skillful accommodation of the tone first film and it works magnificently. Under the sophisticated and sure hand of one of the best and most versatile modern directors, Steven Soderburg the millennial star power of Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Carl Riener, Elloit Gould, Don Cheadle, and Andy Garcia is under control. The script is clever and compact. You don't ever question the verisimilitude of what's going on because the movie creates such a convincing world for itself. The audience can forget the improbabilities and go for the ride. The soundtrack creates hints of cool 50's movie music. The look is snazzy and electric. Soderburg keeps the camera alive while avoiding the headache inducing jump cuts, fast motion zooms, and other such tricks that are too often used by other less assured modern directors. I think the real joy is the satisfaction of seeing that these million dollar actors really are good at what they do and seem to have a great time doing it. They allow the audience in on the fun. The old veterans are especially good. Elliot Gould's Jewish gangster sets a witty standard for that type. Carl Reiner is wonderfully convincing as a seasoned but weary pro. And Julia Roberts, in true 50's fashion, is credited as '..and introducing Julia Roberts' .Cool."

","Don't let the long list of Hollywood stars put you off; this movie was pure fun with a great soundtrack to boot. When Danny Ocean (Clooney) is let out of prison, his goal is to knock off three of the largest Las Vegas Casinos. With his pal Rusty (Pitt), they put together a team of eleven experts to carry off the most elaborate heist in history. Throw in a little Las Vegas groove, a beautiful girl (Roberts), a powerful nemesis (dark and sexy Garcia), some awesome explosions, and you have a good, old-fashioned Hollywood flick. <br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film. It had enough camp and humor to keep it light-hearted. Two-thirds of the story involves the group getting their heist together and I was fascinated by their shenanigans. The last third involves the heist and it has some good tricks. Surprisingly, I thought Brad Pitt had the best part, and I always enjoy Elliot Gould in everything he does. The cast seemed to fit the movie perfectly, and for those of you out there with a real disdain for Julia Roberts, never fear; her part is not very big and they shine her in unflattering lighting the whole time. My only complaint is that Andy Garcia didn't have much of a role. If nothing else, go see this for Carl Reiner alone.<br/><br/>
I didn't feel that this version competed with the original, so if you're a fan of the 1960 Rat Pack version, don't let this scare you away. All in all, I highly recommend this movie and can't wait to see it again.<br/><br/>http://www.moviepie.com"

Soderbergh doesn't make bad movies.<br/><br/>For once, Robert Altman's movie of the year does not hold the most important cast. I think it took nearly one hour before the last star was introduced in Ocean's Eleven. George Clooney is perfect in his role as the mastermind. He is constantly compared to Cary Grant, but he is more than Grant ever was. Pitt continues his row of cool roles, while Andy Garcia makes a a cruel and slick villain of the kind audiences love. The only objection I have to the cast is why they had to bring in Julia Roberts. Her role is so small and uninteresting, she just seems like wasted money. <br/><br/>The film is an elegant and clever robbery flick. It is not of the most complicated of the genre, but you will have to be attentive to understand all the plot points. The usual characterization of the movie is that the eleven thieves ""rob three casinos"". This is misleading as they only make one robbery. I believe the vault they were going after contained money from all three casinos, which makes the catch phrase sort of unnecessary.<br/><br/>

","Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's Eleven"" epitomizes cool with a classy ensemble cast, sharp dialog, romance, and robbery. Leading the pack is George Clooney as Danny Ocean who as the movie begins is just released from prison. Being the reformed man that he is, Ocean quickly devises a scheme to rob the 3 biggest casinos in Las Vegas-- the Bellagio, the MGM Grand, and the Mirage.<br/><br/>All of them are owned by Terry Benedict played with icy ruthlessness by Andy Garcia. Also Terry is now with Tess Ocean, Danny's ex-wife. Danny seeks out his point man, gambler, Rusty Ryan (Brad Piit). Rusty and Danny get a financier and begin assembling Ocean's 11. It soon becomes evident to Rusty (Pitt): Is this about the $160 million or Tess? If it were only about the money, ""Ocean's Eleven"" would be an exercise. It is not. <br/><br/>George Clooney is a movie star. His Danny Ocean is slick, smart, and a charmer with an underlying substance-- he's a romantic. Brad Pitt is also at his best as Rusty. Pitt exudes the charisma and cool, and he is also very funny. There is hilarious running gag where Pitt is eating something in almost every scene. Clooney and Pitt together nail the crisp and very lean dialog. Julia Roberts is particularly sullen here which is called for in the role, surprisingly out of character for her. The great supporting cast includes Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, and Carl Reiner, who all have their moments to shine. Soderbergh orchestrates the movie cohesively with great style. I saw a Barbara Walters interview with the cast of ""Oceans Eleven"" where Clooney said that Steven was not making a statement movie with ""Ocean's"". He is correct. What Soderbergh made is a fun and entertaining movie with a very talented cast."

The duo enlist former casino honcho Reuben Tishkoff (a hilarious bit of gone to seed tackiness by Gould) who bankrolls the hatched plot when he learns it is involving his nemesis Terry Benedict (Garcia, sleek and sinister).  Ocean's real ambition is to win back estranged wifeTess (Roberts as the girl' here on a lark) who also happens to be Terry's main squeeze.  This only complicates an already improbable task at hand and Rusty is only two steps ahead of Danny's desires.<br/><br/>The motley crew assembled includes in-the-loop blackjack dealer Frank Cotton (the sublimely hilarious Mac); expert pick-pocket Linus Caldwell (Damon in low-key mode); old-timer grifter and semi-retired Saul Bloom (legend Reiner having a ball by pulling his foreign character work out of moth balls to high comic effect); knuckle-headed brothers Virgil and Turk Malloy (Affleck and Caan who have some inspired stupidity chemistry) who act as decoys/drivers;  demotions expert Basher Tarr (Cheadle affecting a hokey Cockney accent that one feels is a total con to begin with); high tech nerd Livingston Dell (Jemison); and as ""grease man"", Chinese circus acrobat Yen (Qin).<br/><br/>The droll one-liners and casual dress storytelling doesn't seem like a stretch for recently Oscared director Soderbergh (thanks largely to the laconic and smartly paced screenplay by Ted Griffin) but it helps to have a crackerjack ensemble clearly having a field day with its improvisatory air about it.  The mechaniques of the plot fall neatly and precisely into place like a thousand piece jigsaw puzzle: half the fun is doing the work itself.<br/><br/>Clooney clearly the star of the show wisely lets his co-horts get in some fine moments themselves such as Reiner as a Eurotrash millionaire manqué and the running gag of Pitt snacking on junk food with as much intensity as the proceedings at hand.  Mac and Damon's racial encounter as part of the sting is one of the film's highlights in hilarity and Roberts is the crown jewel as the prize Danny clearly wants and is the no-brainer sub-plot to boot. The look of the film is all gleaming and spiffy thanks to Soderbergh himself who almost always does his own cinematography.   Overall it's a lot of fun:  Vegas, baby, Vegas! Frank, Dean and Sammy would've been proud."

I never thought things would work out the way they did.  If you like movies like Usual Suspects, Fight Club, & 6th Sense, check out Ocean's Eleven.  I also like how realistic it was.

","The original was entertaining, because Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis, Jr. kept things light. This time around, even without the guys who were Vegas legends, Ocean's 11 is a well crafted and enormously entertaining film. All year, I have been trying to convince my fellow movie buffs, that this version was going to be a totally different movie. I have to confess, I had some doubts as to the eventual outcome, of this movie, but I am very pleased. From creating the heist team, planning it, and finally the caper; witty, outragious entertainment was sustained. Brad Pitt and George Clooney created the coolness, that was necessary to make the movie work. Great chemistry! Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner were wonderful, and added immensely to the feel of the movie. Julia Roberts, was barely competent as Tess, but her bland performance did not hinder the movie that much, and there were moments with George Clooney, that created some sparks. Hollywood should do this type of movie more often. Bring together beloved movie stars; have a very competent director at the helm, and a good light-hearted story; this will make lots of moviegoers happy."

","Luckily caught this the day of release in the US and avoided any hype and reviews before hand... Loved every minute of it from the acting to the script. Editing and soundtrack were superb. Brad Pitt is really picking his roles well - and here he bounces off Clooney brilliantly. With the huge list of big names there was a danger of actors trying to upstage each other, but that's not an issue here. I haven't seen the original so am glad to say I didn't suffer the problem of comparisons through this film and enjoyed it for what it was. The only criticism I have is that the plot does get a tad tangled in the climax and I would imagine that you might need a second viewing to pick up on everything...having said that - I'd be happy to watch this film a few times anyway. Have summed it up as having elements of Snatch, Tarantino and a bit of Mission Impossible. Can't wait for the UK release and have already ordered the Soundtrack!"

Most of the parts were very well cast, except that Matt Damon's character just sort of wanders around in a daze.<br/><br/>Carl Reiner was great, but there was a bit of dialog between him and one of the other actors, that didn't work because of the difference in age.  I'm sure that veteran movie-watches will pick out more logical loose ends.  But I don't care.<br/><br/>The visuals are great.  The real Vegas doesn't have a thing to complain about ... this movie could have been financed by the Visitors and Convention Bureau.  The gadgets the guys use?

","Sometimes movies don't have to be about a ""message"".  Sometimes movies don't have to be the pentultimate in character development or plot twists.  Some movies are just about going to the theatre, buying popcorn and having fun. Ocean's Eleven is a breath of fresh air ie its pure entertainment.  The actors are more than capable -- the characters are two dimensional but well executed and the story isn't really plausible but you find yourself rooting these guys on and hoping they succeed even if they are committing a crime. After all, they never really hurt anyone and they steal from a less than redeemable character and they are all charming as hell.<br/><br/>George and Brad are pure eye candy.  Lots of close-ups, a fabulous wardrobe and weak-in-the-knees charm.  The character line-up of the rest of the ""11"" contains many of the expected in a fun ensemble -- kooky brothers, cyber geek, crazy explosives expert, old school guy out of retirement, the new guy etc.  And of course the girl.  Julia doesn't get to do much in this film. She's eye candy as well walking around in amazing outfits and serving as the girl in the love triangle.<br/><br/>The movie was pure enjoyment and the actual heist was well written and put together so that you feel that they might actually be able to pull it off. There are laughs here and there and alot of great shots.<br/><br/>This is a great date flick (as long as the guys don't mind being measured up against this cast of lookers) or a great girls night out movies so that you can ogle the guys freely."
"Havenokind","Null","0","0","16 December 2001"," I loved this movie
","VIVA LAS VEGAS<br/><br/>Ocean's Eleven had some pretty high standards to live up to. What, with it's a-list cast that includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, it's Academy Award winning director Steven Soderbergh of Erin Brockovich and Traffic fame, and, of course, if you remake an old Rat Pack classic, you better do it right.<br/><br/>And they did.<br/><br/>The plot of Ocean's Eleven by itself is great. Danny Ocean (Clooney) is a con artist who just got out of jail. And he's already got a new gig in mind. He wants to `knockoff' three casinos in Las Vegas: the Mirage, the Bellagio, and the MGM Grand. He enlists the help of his friend Rusty (Pitt), another schemer and together they set off to gather a crew of nine others to make...Ocean's eleven. The `others' they enlist include such big name stars as Matt Damon as the pickpocket Linus, Casey Affleck (Ben's younger brother) as the vehicle guy Virgil, and Don Cheadle as the ammunitions man, aptly named Basher.<br/><br/>There has to be some bad guy in all this, if you don't count every single man involved with the heist as a `bad guy'. That role is played perfectly by Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict, the owner of all three casinos who happens to be dating Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts). He isn't a bad guy, but he's ruthless. You don't want him to catch the bad...er...good guys. Even when they begin to rob the casino.<br/><br/>The tagline for Ocean's Eleven is `Are you in or are you out?' I'm in. This movie was awesome. Only one word comes to mind when you walk out of this movie: cool. The clothing, the music, the atmosphere, the way they talk. They are cool all the way. Like the original Rat Pack, they have a certain...air about them. They seem so laid back and relaxed about what they're doing. At the end of the movie I couldn't help but begin to hum the words to `Smooth Criminal.' They were smooth as stone.<br/><br/>Every person in this movie contributed something. With out anyone single person in the 11 the job wouldn't have worked. It was amazing the things they did and the ways they did them. I won't give anything away, but they even tell you the secret of the ending in the middle, with out you even knowing it.<br/><br/>Witty dialogue and good acting make this movie a keeper, but something else caught my eye. The way in which they showed you how everything was done. Most of the time with the bigger or more important parts, they would show you what everyone else thought was going on, but when you discovered that wasn't the case, they replayed from the `eleven's' point of view. This was a really good way to keep the audience guessing and to make the movie look fun.<br/><br/>There is one thing I didn't like about this movie though. When Linus (Damon) would pickpocket someone, they would slow the picture down and close up on his hand. This bothered me for two reasons. One, it took some of the mystery away in one scene where it was critical he `lift' something without getting caught. Two, it made it too movie like. In real life, pickpockets work so quickly and slyly that a person standing next to them couldn't even see it happen. They should have just kept the camera rolling like they did in the rest of the scenes.<br/><br/>I suggest that anyone who is looking for something light and fun to watch, go see Ocean's Eleven. The feel of the movie will get you happy. Just like the plot of this movie, a whole lot of little things pull together to make a great picture."

","Judging from some of the remarks on this board, it seems that it's been so long since there's been classy, deliberately lightweight entertainment that people don't know how to react!<br/><br/>This is a rare opportunity to see a filmmaker at the top of his form goofing and having a great time -- and giving us a relaxing, great time. Too much suspence could actually ruin a cinamatic souffle of this type. (That's why comparisons to ""Rififi"" don't really make a lot of sense here.) This is easily the best looking film I've seen in some time and the immediacy of the performances, which has to have something to do with SS being his own DP, really brings something a little bit new to the blackjack table.'<br/><br/>I enjoyed it from start to finish (though I admit the ending played a slightly off). I always judge movies based on what how well they achieved their goals -- not how well they acheive the goals I think they ought to have. Just like ""Iron Monkey"", which aspired to be nothing more than an super-fun, funny and good natured martial arts film and nothing else --- and achieved it perfectly, Ocean's 11 aims at a goal most people think is ""lower"" than on a movie like ""Traffic"" (perhaps wrongly, but that's a whole essay for some other time), but achieves it in top form, with plenty of flourishes and grace notes.<br/><br/>I'll say it again. ""Nifty""!!!!"
"jhclues","9","0","0","7 December 2001"," Entertainment with A Capital ""E""
","Call it improbable, or even a highly imaginative flight of fancy; either/and/or, all of the above are correct.  But whatever you choose to call it, this is one of the sleekest and slickest caper movies you're ever likely to run across, and what you're really going to end up calling it is pure Entertainment (yes, with a capital `E').  Incomparable escapist fare, impeccably crafted and delivered by director Steven Soderbergh and a dynamite cast, `Ocean's Eleven' is a joy ride that gives you a chance to root for the bad guys and feel wickedly good while you're doing it. Because, after all, what's so bad about a bunch of regular guys ripping off a bazillionaire casino owner, who in the first place isn't such a great guy himself?  Remember, the key word here is `escapist'; don't worry about moralizing while you're watching this one, because a movie like this is made to let you to live vicariously for a couple of hours, so just sit back, relax and go with the flow.  Just remember:  These are professionals; don't try this at home.<br/><br/>	When Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is released from prison, he doesn't waste any time.  Taking a rather indirect route after leaving the place he's called home for some time, he winds up in Las Vegas where he quite simply plans to rob three casinos owned by one Harry Benedict (Andy Garcia), an extremely meticulous businessman, who is also-- if his reputation serves correctly-- an extremely ruthless individual.  He's not a guy you want to mess with.  So why does Ocean want to pick on Benedict, who has the means and the muscle to crush him like a bug with a mere nod of his head?  Suffice to say it has something to do with a personal agenda, as well as the possibility of a paycheck worth around $160 million, which-- even after splitting with the ten other guys he's about to recruit for the job-- will land him a share that won't be too bad for a day's work.  And, of course, there's the challenge; Danny Ocean and his buddies are about to attempt the impossible.  What he is proposing is something that has never before been accomplished, a gamble with nearly insurmountable odds; but, hey, this is Vegas-- and that's what it's all about.<br/><br/>	To be sure, Soderbergh had the deck stacked in his favor right out of the chute with the cast he assembled for this film; but like any self-respecting odds-makers in Vegas will tell you, nothing is a sure thing.  Soderbergh still had to mix all the ingredients just right-- cast, story, photography, music, action, humor-- to make it cook.  Well, he may not get the Oscar for Best Director for it, but if there's a Golden Chef's Hat Award, he's a shoo-in for preparing this feast.  This is a veritable smorgasbord for the senses; it's easy on the eyes, it'll give you some laughs and make you feel good, it's easy to digest and in the end is a totally satisfying experience. There may not be anything ground breaking about this movie, and certainly nothing especially new, but Soderbergh presents it with nuance and finesse, as well as that special artistic touch of his that is so definitive of his work.  Neither was a haystack anything new in Monet's day when he chose it as a subject for one of his paintings, and the rest is history.  It's how the artist renders the subject on canvas that's important, and it is in this that Soderbergh excels.  <br/><br/>	As Danny Ocean, George Clooney demonstrates that he has the charm of Grant, the magnetism of a young Brando and the down-home agreeableness of Jimmy Stewart.  With his personality alone, he defines Ocean in no uncertain terms.  From the opening frame you know exactly who this guy is.  Still, there are a few surprises along the way that keeps him interesting.  Mostly though, he's just enjoyable to watch as he puts his plan into action, and it's easy to believe he's who he is and doing what he's doing.  And that's part of the charm of this movie and, moreover, goes to show you what a good performance Clooney actually gives here.  Unlikely as the story may be, he sells it in such a way that it works; and as the customer, you not only buy it, but walk away with the extended warranty and go home satisfied.  And that's a good bit of acting in anyone's book.<br/><br/>	And though Clooney is clearly the star of the show, Brad Pitt checks in as Ocean's friend, Rusty Ryan, and emerges on fairly equal footing with his illustrious co-star.  Like Clooney, Pitt turns on the charm and serves up Rusty as a credible enough figure, with a performance that may not be much of a stretch for him, but one that is certainly engaging.  The character is lacking somewhat in depth and definition, but Pitt manages to give you a clear idea of who Rusty is without too much by way of development.  Call it a fast-food characterization; nevertheless, Pitt does a good job, and for all intents and purposes, he makes the character work. <br/><br/>
	The single question mark in the casting may be with Julia Roberts as Tess, Ocean's estranged wife.  She looks good and gives a solid, if not memorable performance, but she seems to miss the mark slightly in capturing the true essence of the character, which may have been better served by someone like Catherine Zeta-Jones or even Rene Russo.  But that's a purely subjective observation, and I'm sure there are those who will argue that Roberts was perfect for the role.  In either case, Tess is an integral part of the story, and Roberts neither enhances nor distracts from the overall proceedings; most importantly, she does make Tess believable.  And in the end, with a terrific supporting cast (too lengthy to mention here), `Ocean's Eleven' is one you don't want to miss.  9/10."

"dfranzen70","8","0","0","13 December 2001"," Three casinos. A lot of security. Eleven guys. $150 million. No problem.
","Thank goodness for popcorn movies. Okay, so this one doesn't completely qualify, as at certain moments during the film the brain is encouraged to wake up and breathe a little, but it's still an exciting escapist movie. The plot centers around a massive heist - three major casinos in Las Vegas, all robbed simultaneously. <br/><br/>The ringleader is Danny Ocean (George Clooney), recently sprung from the big house. He has an ulterior motive for robbery (well, other than the $150 million); seems his ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts), who left him while he was in stir, is now with the owner of the three casinos, Harry Benedict (Andy Garcia), a suave, cool, egomaniac. He looks like he's been patterned after Steve Wynn, who owned (still does, probably) many casinos in the desert and who was always at odds with his eastern rival, Donald Trump.<br/><br/>
So Danny's out, and he has a plan. Plans are always good. He first recruits old pal Dusty (Brad Pitt), who's busy teaching poker to nincompoop Hollywood actors. Dusty and Danny get together the rest of the gang, sprawled all over the country, including the Malloy brothers (Scott Caan and Casey Affleck); Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon), a novice whose dad worked with Danny; Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner!); demolitionist Roscoe Means (Don Cheadle, sporting one heck of a cockney accent); Yen the acrobat (Shaobo Qin); Frank the blackjack dealer (Bernie Mac); and their financial backer, Ruben Tischkoff (Elliott Gould!). <br/><br/>It's a game cast, and it looked like they all had a lot of fun making the movie. I was surprised to see old hands Reiner and Gould in this one, especially since so many Gen-X people are involved. Reiner's character is a lot like that of Lawrence Tierney in Reservoir Dogs, except that Sol's not in charge of anything (and, in fact, has to be coaxed out of retirement). And Gould looked to have put on about 70 pounds - whether that's padding or he put it on for the movie, I'll never know. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast did a fine job. The best performances were by Pitt, Damon, and Clooney. But Julia Roberts - well, she had no chemistry with the man she was with (Garcia), none with the man she had been with before (Clooney), and none with the camera. In fact, she looked terrible in closeup, as if someone had strapped her down and injected her lips with about 10,000 cc's of collagen. I know she has full lips, but sheesh! Plus they were supercoated with this Mary Kay lipstick that only served to enhance the gaudy image.<br/><br/>This takes the basic plot of the original 1960 movie (starring the Rat Pack, with Sinatra in the lead) and reworks it a little. It's more stylish, more elegant, more thrilling than the original, and how often can one say that?<br/><br/>
But of course the real story's the caper. They have to bust into the vault, get this money - and it's in CASH, mind you - and walk out. No one's ever come close. This is a movie where you definitely have no problem rooting for the good guys. It's part robbery thriller, part Robin Hood, part Mission:Impossible. It's well-written, although it's not as multilayered a film as some of Steven Soderbergh's other movies, such as Traffic, Out of Sight (with Clooney), Erin Brockovich (with Roberts), or even sex, lies, and videotape. But it really is a blast."

Either way, Ocean's 11 is a lovely little genre film that rests a little on the enjoyment of seeing a whole bunch of movie stars (Don Cheadle AND Bernie Mac?!) being slick and over the top.<br/><br/>As a Soderbergh fan, I'll say, it's no Out of Sight.  But you need to lighten up if you really hated this movie.  It's well directed, casual, cute and fast.  Don't blame it for not aspiring to be a masterpiece."

","Ocean's Eleven feels like a jazz song. It has style  a sharp, crisp tone, clever and innovative. From one extreme to the other, it changes, coolly and calmly following the flow.  The rhythm takes you and holds you until it feels like letting go. A remake of the 1960 Rat Pack movie of the same name, Ocean's Eleven is like a combination of The Thomas Crown Affair, Mission: Impossible, and Sneakers. This movie is one that holds on to you; even after it is over, you still feel it. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) sits in front of a parole board. When questioned, `What [he] would do if released,' Ocean sits back, smiles, and casually rolls his eyes left and right. After being released from jail, Ocean contacts friend Dusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) with his answer. Once he convinces Ryan, the two gather nine more friends, in preparation to rob 150 million from the Bellagio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The packed cast includes Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner, and Don Cheadle. With Ocean's Eleven, director Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brockovich) chalks up another success. Weaving together humor, suspense, and style, Soderbergh sets the definitive and delicate tone that distinguishes the movie.  The jokes are part of the regular dialogue, so when they fall short, the movie as a whole remains strong. Judging from the random comments and expletives, the audience became actively involved with the film, heightening suspense. Visually, Soderbergh highlights the movie with deep yellows, blues, and reds. Suitably, most of the background music fits the `feel' of the movie: cool, clean, and crisp. At the end, however, the music shifts tone to a flowing, melodic harmony that confuses the already inconclusive ending.<br/><br/>The film possesses an aura reminiscent of the 60's: vibrant colors, smart one-liners, and a sly score. With few weak points and a loaded cast, Ocean's Eleven offers a modern and hip re-telling of the 1960's Rat Pack classic.<br/><br/>Rating: A"

","This film is pure fun right from the beginning.<br/><br/>I cannot honestly remember the last time when I've seen ""cool"" personified on the silver screen. The cast is superlative, plain and simple. This movie is meant to be an entertaining, escapist meringue and it delivers.<br/><br/>
This movie expects you to pay attention and I respect that. The dialog can move at a quick and brisk pace, much like ""The West Wing"" and ""SportsNight"", which is something I admire. Too many movies these days fall into two categories; those which move at such a slow pace as to make sure even the dullest person can follow along, or those movies that move so fast you can leave for five minutes and not miss anything (ex. Mission Impossible 2).<br/><br/>
While watching this movie you come to realize two things: one, the actors had fun doing this movie (and you can see it) and, two, you have fun watching this movie. As heist films go, it is probably one of the best that I've seen.

","This exciting movie was easiliy  far better that the orignal, Indeed better than any of the heist films released this year (2001).<br/><br/>Only the most basic plot elements remain from the original movie, main characters name, etc. I think that was the right route to go as no one really wanted to see a second rate re-hash of the rat pack. George Clooney leads the all star cast, much to its credit the stars aren't as important as the movie, that is another great argumant for an ensemble Oscar becuase as good as they are no single actor carries the entire film.<br/><br/>The film opens with geoge clooneys danny ocean getting his five minutes before a parole board, in probably the most sedate scene in the entire film. the rest of the film picks up the pace quite a bit and only slows down again for clooneys confrontation with his with his ex-wife, played of course by Julia, who is also of course very much still in love with her ex even if she doesn't know it yet, it's very formulaic and probably the weakest part of the movie. The Movies is at it's best when it focuses it's energy on the heist and it's perpetrators the titualar 11. Also making a strong performance is Andy Garcia as the ice cold Terry Benedict, or the machine as he is fondly called in the film. I've deliberately avoided speaking about the details becuase the film is in the details and should be experienced to be believed. in conclusion another strong effort by new hollywood wunderkind Steven Soderburgh, who has a profound talent for caoxing the best out of his actors. that combined with his strong visual style makes Oceans 11 one of the best of this year. Though people who enjoyed the orignal probably won't be as entertained as those who didn't."

","I saw Ocean's Eleven and I must say that it is the coolest movie of the year and one of the best. George Clooney and Brad Pitt lead a pack of 11 in robbing three casinos in Vegas. Not only do they want to steal $150 million, but George's titular character Danny Ocean wants to get his ex-wife back, Julia Roberts. Watching Danny assemble this team and watching them practice and execute their heist, you realize just how much of a master Steven Soderbergh is. You realize that he can handle the lightweight and fun stuff just as well he can handle the heavy and dramatic stuff e.g. Traffic and Erin Brockovich. You can say he hits a opposite field home run with this one. The last 45 minutes or so, as the team is pulling off the heist, is the best as you see elements of the plans unfold as well as surprises and twists. All of the actors do a wonderful job here. Clooney and Pitt are just supremely cool. Don Cheadle is funny as the man with the Cockney accent. Everyone else, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, and others pull off their roles convincingly. A perfect combination of great acting, dialogue, cinematography (Don't let the name Peter Andrews for Cinematography fool you. It's Soderbergh himself), music, and sound. It all adds up to being one of the best films of the year."
"StephenC","8","0","0","10 December 2001"," Nothing special, but still enjoyable
","No, this film won't win an Oscar or anything like that.  But I have a feeling you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>The plot, admittedly, is pretty predictable, at least until the actual heist attempt starts.  There is some interesting sleight of hand here that forces you to do a mental rewind, not unlike ""The Sixth Sense"" and its surprise ending (at least for those who didn't wrack their brains for half the film to figure it out early).  The plan of the heist itself is pretty far-fetched, which does help to heighten your anticipation as to whether they can actually pull it off.  Entertaining?  Yes.  It's still the weakest part of the film, but it's still fairly good.<br/><br/>Not that the plot matters, really.  The assemblage of actors here more than makes up for it.  There is nothing flashy about the performances here -- they're simply played well, very straight-faced, very every-manish (or dare I say, ""Bruce-Willis-esque"").  The gang as a whole is an interesting and entertaining mix, and it is these caricatures here that make this film enjoyable.<br/><br/>This film is not really a heist film, per se -- it's not about being suspenseful, but rather, much like the Rat Pack it hails from, it's about being smooth and suave.  This cast does so in near-perfect fashion.  There is a certain timing and tone in every bit of dialogue, and he who takes the time to analyze it sees just how well done this film really is.<br/><br/>Further reinforcing that this is not a heist film, it ends not with guns blazing but with...well, I'll let you see that for yourself.  I've mentioned already that there is a lot of trickery involved with the heist, much of it hidden from the viewer as well until the end.  I laughed out loud in the theater when the final trick was revealed, and then my rating of this film went up a couple points.<br/><br/>Those seeking Academy Award material may opt to wait for the DVD.  But if you just want a couple hours of entertainment, this film shouldn't disappoint.<br/><br/>My IMDB rating: 8/10"

"UrbanFilmCritic","Null","0","0","10 December 2001"," Thanks to Don Cheadle...
","For not standing on a crate singing, ""EO 11"" the way Sammy Davis Jr. did in the original Ocean's 11. I was afraid after seeing Cheadle portray Davis in the HBO movie The Rat Pack that he was going to forever be casted as a Sammy Davis Jr. type.<br/><br/>Let me say first, the Urban Critic despises remakes, and with all the indulgent media hype I went into the theater convinced Paramount's Ocean's 11 produced by and starring George Clooney was going to be a very disappointing flick. I like it when I'm wrong.<br/><br/>First, I saw the new Ocean's 11. It was clever and funny. A group of 11 guys attempt to steal $14 million from  3 Las Vegas casinos.  While the premise was fantastic, that's the stuff that good comedies are made of. For one thing, a heist like that one isn't cheap. They had to spend $14 million trying to steal $14 million.<br/><br/>I was glad to see Carl Reiner doing what he does so well, which is making others laugh. I enjoyed Bernie Mack tremendously (as I always do). Brad Pitt is always a treat, as is Matt Damon both of whom had pretty good comedic timing (who knew?). I greatly appreciated George Clooney playing Danny Ocean but not playing Frank Sinatra. And although I'm not a huge fan, I enjoyed the movie so much that I'm not going to say anything bad about Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>And then I went home and watched the original starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. on the Turner Classic Movie station. The two movies are very different. For one thing, in 1960 it was not nearly as difficult to steal from a Las Vegas casino as it is today. Technological advances have made it impossible, where as back then all you needed was a key into the cashier's office.  What the original accomplished with just a small bomb, the new version needed an atomic blast to do. But it was cool because this version required a lot more ingenuity than the first one.<br/><br/>But there was one very distinctive difference. When you watch the original Ocean's 11 you get a buzz off the Rat Pack. George, Brad, and Matt have game but not like Frank, Dean, and Sammy. You knew that when the director wrapped the shoot for the day that Sinatra and his boys would go to the Sands where they performed their nightly act complete with the drinking and smoking . You could tell by watching that they just weren't making a movie, they were having fun because they were friends. It was more than just the acting and the storyline, it was the Rat Pack in all their glory.<br/><br/>I've found that when I evaluate a film, the best standard of measurement is to ask myself, ""Is it worth $8.25?"" There are certainly enough laughs in Ocean's 11 to justify the costs. But just so I can seem like a critic, I'll give it an A' or a thumbs up, whichever you prefer."

"giancarlorocks","Null","0","0","10 December 2001"," An elaborately detailed, fantastic piece of film...
","Throughout the past 6 months, heist films have been protruding our screens at a sporadic rate.  'The Score' starring Robert De Niro was one of the first out the gate last July, while David Mamet's highly praised 'Heist' was just released last month. Now, the Holiday season plays host to one of the most enjoyable films this year 'Ocean's 11'.<br/><br/>Steven 'Do No Harm' Soderbergh's latest opus in a nutshell is absolutely fantastic. Watching the film I could see Warner Bros. tagging the lines for upcoming promos from all the reviews such as 'the most fun you'll have at the movies' and 'the year's best film'. For once, I would agree with those promos.  This is an absolute great piece of film. That is not to say that Soderbergh has not included a couple of clichéd crowd pleasing segments, but that takes hardly anything away from a superbly acted, written and directed film.<br/><br/>George Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, who after just released from prison plans to concoct a daring caper to rob 3 Casinos for more than 150$ Million in cold cash. He therefore sets out to recruit, train and execute the plan which these three verbs respectively describing each of the film's three acts. First for recruitment is Brad Pitt who plays Dusty Ryan, a food-obsessed criminal who leads the plan with Clooney as they recruit Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck and many more. Hence the title; 'Ocean's 11'.<br/><br/>With his newest film, Soderbergh seems to return to his roots with his 'Out Of Sight' style he created when Jennifer Lopez and Clooney collaborated on that film in 1998. From the opening sequence when the camera tracks Clooney out of the prison gates, to the cutthroat dialogue in the same vein as 'out of Sight', I knew Soderbergh was onto something. The result is a great, fun, fast paced film that moves so fast at some parts that if you blink, you'll miss it. The opening 20 minutes have Danny and Rusty recruiting all over the U.S. with great scenes that prove to be  some of the most memorable. Who can forget Elliot Gould's character Rubin Tischikoff as he tries to talk the men out of the heist by providing examples of the most successful Casino heists ever achieved - which turned out all to be  unsuccessful.<br/><br/>Those who saw the film know that the aforementioned scene is just one of the many scenes that work. If we look at the film in a dissecting fashion, we can clearly see that the film works on many levels. The first act quickly, easily and 'non-challantly' introduces us to our characters in a subtle detailed manner while simultaneously mocking the teen cover boys acting industry. Pitt is first approached from Clooney while he teaches teen stars on how to play cards. None other than Joshua Jackson, Holly Marie Combs and Topher Grace appear in this scene.  While the stars' presence can actually detract from what is another great scene in the film, just when you finish digesting that memorable scene, the film takes off a mere minutes after it starts with the recruitment of the Danny's 11 man-crew.<br/><br/>The 'training' act explores several sub plots including the introduction of the Julia Roberts character Tess Ocean. She plays Ocean's ex-wife who is currently dating one of the Casino owners they are trying to rob. The incredibly underrated Andy Garcia plays the film's unconformist villain with suave sophistication who seems to convey the notion of fear with his droopy-eyed close ups. Tense scenes between Garcia and Clooney while rare, are simply a treat to watch. Furthermore, romantics will certainly enjoy the love subplot that is truly predictable that as clichéd as it is, is still effective as only Soderbergh can create it to be.<br/><br/>The third act is completely mind-blowing as the 'execution' of the robbery is filmed in such a dizzying, comedic yet suspenseful manner that makes this film stick out from all the other heist movies. The film's robbery sequence set during a Lennox Lewis fight is epic, grand and deserves to be viewed more than once to take it all in. While some might say the film ends in a clichéd, predictable ending; I ask you, what did you expect? You are not going to get a sad ending with one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled for a motion picture.<br/><br/>Furthermore, as a testament to Soderbergh's craftiness; witness the second to last closing scene. After all the frenzy, after all the comedy, and after all the intensity, Soderbergh assembles his cast right in front of the casino. The whole crew watches in a perverted sense of pride and accomplishment as they study the Casinos they just robbed with nostalgic music playing in the background; glamorizing their illegalities as only pure Hollywood magic can. They all take one last look at the Casinos, and slowly walk away one by one, each with a gaze of joy as they separate themselves from the 'job'. Truly an incredible scene that I played back in my mind repeatedly while writing this review, that one scene captures the true essence of the film.<br/><br/>It still has to be seen as to whether or not any other film this year will come close to its' suaveness, its' look, its' style or its' satisfying effect it gives you when exiting the theatre. Pardon my colloquialism, but this film was damn cool. Notable mentions include the outstanding wardrobe. Seems as if Soderbergh simply wanted to make a film, put his actors in lavish sets and dress them up as good as he can. While some costumes may be outlandish to fit the character, Pitt's and Clooney's are simply stunning and had me looking through my GQ when I got home. Therefore, see it on the big screen and see it more than once to take in all the great elements this absolutely fantastic film had to offer.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2"

","Okay, here we go, my thoughts on this film:<br/><br/>Ocean's 11 has a very good pace to it.  Steven Soderbergh does a wonderful job piecing together this film because, as you'll probably notice, there are next to ZERO dull moments in this entire film.<br/><br/>The dialogue is great!  It's fun, quick, witty, and entertaining.  There were a number of people involved in the writing process, but I found it particularly interesting to see that Charles Lederer, (writer of the original 1960 ""Ocean's Eleven"" film), was involved in this screenplay. The films weakest moments are the scenes between George Clooney and Julia Roberts, however the dialogue is so well written, that even these scenes were interesting.<br/><br/>Great acting:  These actors were well selected for their roles.  Their performances helped keep the movie interesting and going at a steady pace.<br/><br/>Bad Stuff: There is this scene near the end of the film that simply did not match the pace and style of the rest of the film. In this scene the bandits stand near a Las Vegas Hotel looking at its fountain.  Each walks away one by one in this mushy sequence that I felt slowed the film and was completely unnecessary.  I wonder if there is a scene like this in the original film (I have not seen it yet).  Maybe Soderbergh put that in there as a sort of tribute to the original film.  Then again, maybe I'm off base here.  We'll see.<br/><br/>Another thing I didn't like about this film was its ending.  It dragged on longer than it needed to be, there were a lot questions left unanswered, and there was not enough chemistry between Julia Roberts and George Clooney to justify the last 5 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>I should mention that this film is not ground breaking material.  It deals with a kind of story idea that has been done and done again.  So I wouldn't watch this movie expecting a whole lot more to it aside from it being just another heist movie.  I do, however, recommend seeing this film.  We go to movies to be entertained.  This film does just that, and it does it well!"

","I can confidently say that ""Ocean's Eleven"" is one of my favorite movies of the year.  This movie's heist and suspense made it a gem of 2001.  The humor was at an appropriate level for this film and was done with skill and success.  The great acting by Cloony, Pitt, and Garcia is a thing to remember.  But this movie did have its flaws, the major one being Julia Roberts.  I give a lot of credit to Julia Roberts for ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Pretty Woman"", but she is a hit-and-miss actress, and she scored a big miss in ""Ocean's.""  Her presence in every scene was a unwanted one, not because the character was bad, but that she wasn't at her ""Erin"" best.  The relationship between George and Julia also added to the problem.  The one thing I could not see between them is the spark.  That is what makes a great onscreen relationship, i.e. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in ""Sleepless in Seattle"".  Cloony and Roberts do not belong together and this was not their mistake, but their director's.  I have given credit to Steven Soderbergh on his past two movies ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich"" for the great casting and the superb acting.  But his remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"" lacked those tow elements in Roberts and her performance with Cloony.  Even though this was an unnecessary element to an already full to capacity film, ""Ocean's Eleven"" still turns out to be one of my favorite movies of this lack-luster year. It is one of my FAVORITE, but certainly not the BEST."

","The summary says it all.  This movie was very disappointing to both my wife and myself. It utilized about a tenth of talent that these actors bring to the table.  Andy Garcia had the only true acting assignment.  With the exception of Matt Damon's scene with Bernie Mack in the casino office, I can't say that there was much to get excited about.  And unfortunately, I caught that scene on the Tonight Show the other night.  In fact, if you have seen more than two trailers on this movie,,,,then you have seen the movie. It doesn't get much better than that. Of course my biggest disappointment is with myself.  I was sucked in by media hype and the big names.  I was also misled by the actors plugging this as 'the funnest movie they ever made.'  I am glad they had a good time.  I just wish it wasn't at the movie viewer's expense.

","If you went into this flick believing it would be Oscar caliber writing, directing, acting, then maybe you should have waited a few more weeks to see something else. But, if you went into the theatre looking to watch cool Hollywood stars put on a cool movie where each and every one of them gets at least 1 or two memorable scenes/lines, then you exited the theatre with a big ol' smile on your face. Oceans 11 is fun, right from the very beginning when Danny Ocean is asked what he would do if he were released from prison right on through to the end. Clooney plays Danny Ocean as the straight up cool guy, the undisputed leader of the pack, who you yourself would follow into this caper just because the guy LOOKS like he knows what he is doing. Pitt is equally cool, suave, and kinda plays his character of Rusty as the old sage, even though he is obviously very young. You almost get the sense that while Clooney's character is the ring leader, the best thief/con-man, may in fact be Pitt and there is never, ever a moment where you feel like Pitt is in danger of losing anything.<br/><br/>Matt Damon does a good job as the youthful thief new to the big score (see the seventh gunslinger in the Magnificent Seven for a reference) and is given some good moments, especially with Barnie Mac. Cheadle, I thought, did a wonderful job as the British born, cockny accented thief, but the strange accent and the strange words used made it hard most of the time to pick out exactly what he was saying. Affleck and Cann are VERY funny as feuding brothers and have some of the funniest moments in the movie and rival only Carl Reiner as a movie stealer. Reiner is GREAT as the old Saul and brings is wonderful to watch on the screen.<br/><br/>Now, my only contention with this movie comes in the form of Julia Roberts. I understand she is in this movie because she is a huge star and she wants to come hang out with all these cool guys in Vegas. She seems like a very nice woman, even though she can come across as a little fake, but can anyone tell me they believe she really is a great actress? I mean, come on, she plays the SAME character, herself, in every movie, and in every movie it gets older and older. Now, I understand in this movie you are not looking for Lady McBeth, but can anyone really tell me she looks AMAZING? Lets face it, this role is designed for one thing, the glamourous, gorgeous woman who takes your breath away. Julia is a really cute soccer mom, not Grace Kelly re-born. The introductory scene of her coming down the steps? It looked like she was having a hard time walking in her shoes. All I could imagine was a Catherine Zeta-Jones or even a Michele Phiefer, graceful, glamourous woman who would take the audiences breath away walking down those stairs and, in the end, Julia just comes up FAR short. She doesn't ruin this movie by any means, but I guess I just have a hard time seeing the obsession with her.<br/><br/>But that being said, this is a fun movie. It never seems to sit still for too long, it blends all of the stars together nicely so you don't have that somewhat nagging feeling like, oh I wish so and so would have had a scene together. To me, this will forever be a modern version os The Sting. Is it laugh out loud funny? At points yes, but not all the way through. Is it tense and suspenseful? Yes, at certain times, but not all the way through? Is it cool and fun and well shot, well directed, and well acted? Absolutely, throughout the whole thing. Leave your mind and your cynicism at the door and enjoy just simply being entertained for a few hours."

","Ocean's 11 definitely shapes out a heist without the usual suspenseful superficialities to make this movie work. It's the traits of the articulated characters, parallel at times, but contrasting at most that bind the story and the characters with the scenes. Absolutely charming and stylistic! Sorderberg brilliantly carves out the ten criminals, detailing their individual skills through their dialogue.  Great dialogue too, so bitingly smug and graciously funny!  It's definitely one of the few movies that successfully avoid putting the viewers in stress with the attempt of deciding what and who to watch at any particular scene.  This is about a heist that needs to work because of team cooperation.  No mind-boggling visual effects, no martial arts tactics, but just a story that allows each role to be a part of a whole.  Watching each character is like watching a piece of puzzle carefully slotted into a jigsaw board.  This is what creates my interest throughout the film.  Every con comes through as a smooth character. as classy as the casino environment. Not even the theatrical grandiose of the casino, nor Julia Robert's beauty and performance,  will distract the viewers from their concentration on each member.  It's obviously a movie where cheers are for the crooks in their attempt to defeat a pompous braggart and his glorified environment! Observe Gargia's performance. definitely a great choice for the villain! And Pitt. it's his best acting performance so far!  Not to say that the acting skills of the rest of the cast members are lame! Not for a bit!  They all definitely fit well into their roles!  And they are believable. just like a diverse group of workers whose team effort, without vile nor violence, will bring success to any venture.  This movie truly exposes a great philosophy for the corporate world! Truly a charming movie to see!"

","I will keep my review of this film simple: it was pure fun.  Soderbergh as usual is absolutely amazing in his direction of the actors and his camera work and editing.  The A-list cast proves how good of a director he is here in a fun movie that never takes itself too seriously.  The dialog is quick and witty and George Clooney and Brad Pitt prove yet again (but for the first time together) that they are the two coolest men on the planet.  The story here is not the best, but it is a heist movie and a remake of a movie that had it not been for the rat pack's present would have been delegated to B-movie status.  This movie is a huge improvement upon the original, and all of the principal actors in this piece (that would be 13 if you're counting) have their moment to shine.  If you want to go to a movie and have some fun go see Ocean's Eleven, the most entertaining movie of the year."

","When I first saw the trailer for Ocean's Eleven, I wanted to see it. It had a different tone than other movies usually do. I have been a fan of Steven Soderbergh's work since seeing OUT OF SIGHT. Then upon seeing THE LIMEY, TRAFFIC, and ERIN BROCKOVICH, he's become one of my favorite directors with just marvelous films, and this one is no exception.<br/><br/>I don't like to spoil films, but I'll say what's great about the movie. It has an simple, but interesting plot: George Clooney (Danny Ocean) is released from prison and meets up with Bernie Mac who works at a casino. Then he conspires with Brad Pitt to pull off a job to rob three casinos. They then get eight other guys to pull off the job.<br/><br/>Other than the plot, the movie is well directed. The acting from all people in the film is superb. The movie is very funny which is a plus because audiences should laugh.<br/><br/>Ocean's Eleven is just one of those movies with a classic film atmosphere that's just a good movie to sit down and watch.<br/><br/>SCORE: 8 out of 10"

","I enjoyed this film very much. It was really well-written and kept my interest throughout the 2 hour running time. The editing and direction were very sharp and the pacing of the story was right on the money. The playfully eerie musical score was pitch-perfect, and added a lot to the fun.<br/><br/>
As for the cast, there is only one word for: FLAWLESS! This is an ensemble if I've ever seen one! Each actor brings something special to the movie. Everyone did a great job!<br/><br/>I loved how the whole scheme came into play. It was very interesting to see what lengths the characters had to go through. It was the kind of set-up where if any the 'eleven' messed up in their particular assignments, the whole con would be ruined. Although, it is highly unlikely that anyone could think of a strategy that complex.<br/><br/>In short, if you're looking for a snappy and fun crime comedy, then you'll love OCEAN's ELEVEN. It was an old-fashioned great time at the movies!<br/><br/>My Grade: A-<br/><br/>Cast: George Clooney (Daniel Ocean), Brad Pitt (Rusty Ryan), Andy Garcia (Terrence Benedict), Matt Damon (Linus Caldwell), Carl Reiner (Saul Bloom), Elliott Gould (Ruben Tischkoff), Don Cheadle (Bashir Tarr), Scott Caan (Turk Malloy), Casey Affleck (Virgil Malloy), and Julia Roberts (as Tess Ocean).

","""Ocean's Eleven"" was fun, well-oiled, and smooth--like silk on glass.  I'm not sure the actual *heist* logistics were completely intact--but I really didn't care.  It seemed believable enough, and I didn't get bogged down (and frankly, bored) with minutia the way I did while watching ""The Score.""<br/><br/>What is to be enjoyed about this film is its perfect finesse, its thoughtful dialogue, its excellent timing, and its numerous comedic bonuses (hats off to Affleck and Caan).  There is a certain elegance about this film that I appreciated--no bullet holes, blood, or violence--yet it managed a real sense of suspense and climactic thrill without them.

","Just like ""Crouching Tiger"" showed what a competent director can bring to the kung-fu genre, ""Ocean's Eleven"" showed how a great director can elevate a typical Hollywood flick above the usual mindless drivel.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't attempt to be deep, philosophical or even, at times, believable.

","This movie...kicks ass. It doesn't make you think deeply, it doesn't move you emotionally, it just kicks ass. Period. I'd have to say it's absurdly entertaining, stylistically amazing, and simply a joy to sit through. The acting is fabulous and the plot is witty, intricate and and best of all ridiculously unbelievable but for the sole purpose of being ridiculously unbelievable. It's a charming little piece of filmmaking that isn't expressive of the director's desire to make a statement about life, but rather a collaboration of fine actors with a superb knack for style, a script with the perfect dosage of whimsical dialogue and clever plot twists, and a director capable of Oscar-caliber schematics giving his audience a break from social commentary by replacing it with unrealistic yet straight-forward amusement. Steven Soderbergh, after masterminding Traffic and Erin Brockovich, doesn't disappoint simply because his film entertains rather than moves, and although some film critics may question his motives in choosing such a project, I'm impressed with his consistent ability to appease movie-goers whatever the subject matter. So there you have it. After finally seeing Ocean's 11 ending months of anticipation, I can honestly say my expectations were exceeded, and I couldn't be more excited to have discovered another film to be added to my collection in the very near future. Needless to say, everyone should see this movie. I assure you, it will not disappoint."

","Steven Soderbergh's remake of 'Ocean's Eleven' is an action filled heist film about a criminal, Danny Ocean (George Clooney), who was just released from jail and close friend, Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), who gather nine other men and plan to rob 150 million dollars from three different Las Vegas casinos. It is a fast-paced, clever film that is so entertaining, it has you rooting for the thieves. It is full of a great cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts and many more. There are a lot of key characters but each ones important qualities to the job allow them all to come together nicely. It was shot very well with many of the scenes in low lit, dark rooms to show the privacy among the group and the conversations of the heist. In contrast, the casino is full of bright neon lights and gold decor to show it's extravagance and wealth. There is a constant theme of conflict and suspense that can be seen from small mistakes made throughout the heist, the relationship between Danny and Terry (casino owner), and Danny trying to win back his ex-wife. Overall, It is a good mix of comedy and suspense that always has you watching till the end."

It's this aspect and this fun approach to 'Ocean's Eleven (2001)' that makes watching the film so entertaining, like an untaxing puzzle to be unravelled as it goes along, and its easy-going attitude makes for a laid-back watch with some twists to keep you on your toes and great character writing to keep a smile on your face. 7/10"

","This movie game me a blast when i first saw it with my parents. But i was young and couldn't comprehend as much. The acting is impeccable, character development is excellent. The heist planning has an attention to detail that you don't normally see explained as thorough in movies. I have analyzez the heist, to see if there are any loop holes that i cannot explain, but i can't find any (other than the ""pinch"" is kind of fictional). Every character has a different personality and even if you think due to the large cast of actors it's going to be hard to present them all, then you will be pleasantly surprised that by the end you will be able to differentiate all of them. Dialogue is handled gracefully and further accentuates the marvel of the plot. Visuals are so good, direction is top-notch. The director makes you see only what you have to at each scene. It leaves you think about the others. The ending is unbelievable, you won't realize what you saw, how everything was executed so perfectly and your head will trying trying to wrap your head around how all of this worked. There's a positive vibe thoughout and this movie can be enjoyed with a partner or with the entire family. Overall beautiful film. <br/><br/>The only thing i didn't like about the plot was the inclusion of Julia Roberts, as Clooney's love interest. I believe her character had more than enough screen time than necessary and wasn't that important for the story, but anyway i can neglect that. <br/><br/>Rating: 10/10 - Masterpiece - Best heist movie I have ever seen."
"Tkbn3812","9","1","2","6 January 2018"," Simply brilliant
","Ocean's Eleven sets out to be an engaging, thrilling yet fun heist movie, and it manages to accomplish just that. It's stunning, it's simple, it's brilliant. Everything about the movie, from the pacing to the acting and dialogue, is done with so much thought and so well.<br/><br/>Ocean's Eleven has quite the typical heist film plot. A criminal, Danny Ocean (played by George Clooney) plans to pull off possibly the biggest heist in the history of the United States, planning to rob $160 million from three casinos in one night. It's no easy task, and he seeks out a team of people (eleven, to be exact), of which include great actors such as Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Carl Reiner.<br/><br/>I think it's easily the acting that makes this heist film such a standout from other similar films. Matt Damon is so innocent and yet so powerful, and Carl Reiner plays Saul very well, but for me the two best actors had to be George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Together their characters Danny and Rusty lead the team in real style, right from the get-go. Clooney plays his character stunningly, honestly yet with plenty of fun injected into it. Brad Pitt shines in his role, just so...amazing. The highlight of his character for me was easily when he casually got Basher out of an arrest. <br/><br/>The dialogue in this movie couples itself perfectly with the acting. It's just such witty, fun dialogue. It's the type of dialogue many may cringe at, but if you're watching this movie you've got to remember that it's just trying to have fun. Everything from the content, the timing, the delivery of the lines, is done so well.<br/><br/>Personally, and rather obviously, the highlight of the film had to be the heist. The movie doesn't waste time getting to the heist like other heist films (I'm looking at you Fast Five...which actually copied an awful lot from this movie), and once it gets to the heist it doesn't muck around. It just rolls with it, and it has plenty of witty fun along the way. The heist itself is clever, it's smart, it's brilliantly thought out by the characters and more importantly the writers of the movie.<br/><br/>My two only gripes are rather minor; the ending and Basher's accent. I'm not even British but the cockney accent that Don Cheadele puts on can't possibly fool anyone; it's just so unnecessary and whoever suggested he use one should be fired. Also, I don't want to spoil the ending but I feel it could have gone just a little further. It's still great, it's just that it could have been perhaps more satisfying. Still, that's why there are sequels.<br/><br/>Ocean's Eleven is just such a clever and yet heist film. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a thriller or is just looking for a quick way to kill two hours. You won't regret it."

He shot this film very intimately often allowing the camera to stay close on the actors a tad longer than expected which lets their personas shine through their personalities draw you into the movie as much as the caper itself.

The Great actors bring their characters to life with energy and passion even though each protagonist is more cliché than the last. If not for the ridiculously Sci-Fi looking ""blackout machine"" the film manages to pull off a classy vibe in a very money and stripper themed decor. The music compliments each scene and correctly translates the emotion of the moment though it never really transcends to into anything greater.<br/><br/>Time.

The essence of the film - planned robbery, which no one has identified as impossible. However, all things are possible, only to be meticulously choreographed plan. The action begins soon - as soon as the familiarization with the actors who will work throughout the plan, and their not so little. Plenty to no time, the focus is detained from the first to the last minute - wondering how to continue to behave as good. Quality construction, colorful characters, maybe as much as stereotypes occurred, but not the fact that it is. Love the line could be missing, the first number it and decommission of all this (despite the fact that the robbery for the same love and scheduled). Actors team does not lack big names, so it is not surprising that do not interfere with performance. It is a little short. If you are also fans of thrillers, and somehow you will be missed in this movie, I recommend joining. And the most ever in the future, and other components will turn on second glance, when you will want not boring, intelligent thriller."

","Oceans Eleven is one of them films that you watch the first time and you'll be in shock as to how good it really is. You'll then want to watch it again and again to the point where its on the TV while you're eating a meal or just relaxing. Its such a good film for people looking for a modern stylish crime capper and it cannot be topped! (Not even by the original). Lets not forget to mention the unbelievable cast that brings actor like Brad Pitt and George Clooney together and in my opinion is both their greatest casted roles in movies. So just watch this film and I guarantee you will not be disappointed by a great masterpiece like this."

","Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is an ex-convict just released from prison, whose first order of business is to get his buddy Robert ""Rusty"" Ryan (Brad Pitt) and an assortment of other characters together to rob three Las Vegas casinos owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). These characters are great and we love seeing them talk and rob. All the actors do a great job is animating the personalities of their respective characters. Danny is the charming mastermind, Rusty is the sarcastic right hand man, and Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) is the innocent newcomer. It's a great caper flick and it's really hard not to like it. The whole film is a load of fun. If you haven't seen it yet, go check it out."

Although lots of goofs have been spotted, they are all trivial. There are also lots of great lines, (check out the 'quotes' section)<br/><br/>My problem is in later trying to work out just how they did it, ie, Ocean explains to the others that the $150+M will be split evenly between them, but later, he trades half of it all to get his ex-wife back?

"taemliving-07405","10","1","2","15 April 2015"," Ocean's Eleven Evaluation
","Ocean's Eleven (2001) is a comedic film, based on the 1960 film Ocean's 11, about a group of thieves, led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his accomplice Rusty (Brad Pitt) who rob The Bellagio casino in Las Vegas along with two other casinos that feed into its vault. The casinos are all owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) whom Danny has a personal dispute with. They are all very smart people who know how to play outside the law and win. The plot is cunning and The gang of thieves stress and collaborate together to pull off the perfect crime in this clever film. <br/><br/>I've seen this movie many times and every time I watch it, I still admire it. Ocean's Eleven is a witty and funny film that keeps you thinking up until the end of the movie. Every detail is perfectly placed in the movie and I still catch new important clues relating to the plot every time I watch it. It really plays with small details and the relationships that the characters have with each other. There is a perfect balance of fun and seriousness in their job and you can really tell that based on their conversations and interactions with each other. It's a brilliant film that I can watch again and again without boring myself.<br/><br/>This film is unique in the way it was filmed and edited. As Rusty and Danny explain exactly what they will be doing according to the plan, this film flashes to them enacting their plot as Rusty and Danny talk about it making it very neatly edited. It tricks you when it comes to time and location, making you really think about what is going on. I also love the cinematography of this film. It takes place in Las Vegas and you really get that when you're watching it. The dim lighting, and glamorous wardrobe selection really conveys what the film is trying to get across, as well as the characters as they are playing different roles. It's really the kind of film that makes you want to rob a Las Vegas casino. And who better than Brad Pitt and George Clooney to rob it with you? The cast is absolutely magnificent. It is picked perfectly with star studded actors. Each actor and actress plays their role exquisitely. The main character are introduced into the film showing exactly who they are and their distinct personality right off the bat, and you love each of the characters instantly. They are all quirky and have their own little comedic mannerisms and actions that just add to the hilarity of the film.<br/><br/>I've seen other con-like robbery movies but this movie really is my favorite. There are even two sequels to Ocean's Eleven and I still keep this one close to heart. This movie reminds me of another robbery film, Inside Man (2006) with Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Now this movie is more intense than Ocean's Eleven and is not a comedy like it, but it does share some of the same features. Both of these movies deceive you in the plot just as the characters have deceived their robbery victims. In Inside man, Clive Owen pulls off the perfect bank robbery just as Clooney, Pitt, and their crew did in Ocean's Eleven. I love both movies but I really enjoyed the comedic appeal that the Ocean's Eleven added to something serious like robbing a place. It really makes it more entertaining for the audience and makes you love the quirky characters even more.<br/><br/>This movie is simply a delight to watch. I could watch marathons of these movies and still wish I had more to watch. Clooney and Pitt steal the show in this film and lead us through this funny and smart plot effortlessly. The whole idea of this movie is simply gold and the whole cast shows us that throughout every scene. I really think highly of this film and encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to take the time to watch it. I would also suggest watching its sequels, Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007), as they are written just as perfectly as the first one."
"Kings_Requiem","8","1","2","23 March 2015"," The heist film is back!
","This remake of the Frank Sinatra classic accomplished something that I thought I would never see again. This re imagining officially put the heist movie back on the map. <br/><br/>Along with Rat Race this film has the best ensemble cast (Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Cheadle, Roberts, Affleck, Caan, Garcia, Gould, Reiner, & Mac). All of them come together for a hilarious ride into the heart of Vegas as they attempt to rob 3 casinos and hit a $160 million jackpot. <br/><br/>After seeing this flick I knew that it would be considered a new classic for years to come. This has it all... laughs, great scenery, and some very exciting action. Now I'm convinced that I want to rob a casino. <br/><br/>Here comes the MONEY!"
"Vartiainen","Null","1","2","18 March 2015"," One of the penultimate heist films
","I think that Ocean's Eleven is the film a lot of my generation recalls when they hear the term heist film. And for a good reason. A reboot of an older film by the same name, it updates its story to the modern era, features an all-star cast of high end actors and as a whole is the very definition of slick and cool. Exactly the qualities a good heist film has going for it.<br/><br/>Objectively looking Ocean's Eleven doesn't really do anything revolutionary. The story, while more sympathetic to the crooks, is basically the same as far as the premise goes, the plan is clever and will keep you guessing until the end, but doesn't contain any huge twists, and the style is something we've seen before. It's just a matter of how well it can pull those clichés off. And this movie is the very definition of tropes are not bad. Everything in it is textbook, but in the best possible meaning of the term.<br/><br/>To be fair, a lot of that is due to the two main leads, Clooney and Pitt. These two are cool and suave in everything they do, and together they are dynamite. It's no wonder they got two sequels out of this. I'm actually somewhat disappointed they didn't get more.<br/><br/>You've all seen this film already. It's a part of our cultural understanding nowadays, a cliché, a definition, an understanding of something that just is, a trope in and on itself. And in the end, that simply means that it's a movie worth seeing."
"songbirdn","10","1","2","3 March 2012"," One of my favorite heist movies ever
","Ocean's Eleven is a spectacular film. It's played out perfectly and it's everything you'd want in a heist movie.<br/><br/>The movie moves at a fast pace, keeping you constantly at the edge of your seat as you watch Danny and the crew steal from three casinos belonging to Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) for the prize of over $150 million. There's tons of twists, surprising you as the heist is carried out and nothing is as you'd expect it to be. Overall, it is an awesome movie.<br/><br/>The Vegas setting is vibrant and cool, and it is filmed in a way to make you feel like you're in the heist with the actors. <br/><br/>The casting is great. George Clooney was perfect for the role of Danny Ocean and plays the mastermind in a beautifully confident manner. Brad Pitt is sexy as always and super cool as Rusty Ryan in the flick. Matt Damon is the sneaky pickpocket Linus Caldwell, mixing the perfect amount of innocence to the world of high-stakes theft yet with a maturity as well. <br/><br/>Julia Roberts is stunning as always as Tess Ocean and Andy Garcia makes the perfect villain in his role of the billionaire casino owner Terry Benedict. Bernie Mac is extremely charismatic as Frank Catton (the inside man), Carl Reiner is the old timer-Saul Bloom, and Don Cheadle is hilarious as Basher, the explosives genius. <br/><br/>Other stars, including Casey Affleck and Scott Caan as wheelmen Virgil and Turk Malloy, Eddie Jemison as Livingston Dell the computer genius, and Shaobo Qin as greaseman Yen are wonderful in their roles. <br/><br/>And last but most certainly not least, Elliot Gould as Reuben Tishkoff, the man funding the heist and the lovely, charismatic casino owner is perfect. Gould steals every single scene he's in. <br/><br/>So as you can tell, this movie is a must see and a perfect ten. This is one you don't want to miss.<br/><br/>PS- The sequels, Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen, are amazing as well. I highly recommend you see all three."
"tieman64","Null","1","2","20 February 2012"," Soderbergh's Squad
","The ""Ocean's 11"" franchise started in 1960 with Lewis Milestone's ""Ocean's 11"", a glossy heist thriller which saw a gang of thieves pulling a daring operation in which several Las Vegas casinos are simultaneously robbed. Milestone was a bit of an auteur, known for several fairly good war films, but his ""Ocean's 11"" remains an anonymously directed affair. Instead, crooner and mega-star Frank Sinatra seems to be the one pulling all the strings, playing the titular role of heist-master Danny Ocean within the film, and the star and money-man calling the shots outside the film. The production was reportedly wrapped around Sinatra's lengthy stays in Las Vegas, where he performed various concerts at up-scale casinos, hotels and theatres.<br/><br/>While Milestone's ""Ocean's 11"" made ridiculous amounts of money back in 1960 – everyone wanted to see its big name cast: Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford and Angie Dickinson – today it's a hugely dull movie, with large chunks of exposition, unnecessary filler and a heist that's been bettered by countless heist films released both before and after. With notions as to what is and isn't ""cool"" constantly changing, ""Ocean's 11"" also looks completely neutered, its ""smooth"", ""relaxed"" and ""cool"" cast now positively lifeless. Half a century later, only Sinatra comes off looking well, though precisely because of him the film plays like one of those bad crime movies by modern African American rappers, designed to show off the star's ""riches"", ""bling"", ""money"", ""rule breaking"", ""flashy accessories"" and ""bad boy criminality"" (Sinatra had close ties with the criminal underworld – both the Italian mafia and US government). It's a white bread version of such mega-celebrity egotism. Milestone's best scenes? A colourful Saul Bass opening and a wordless ending shot, much imitated by Tarantino, in which our suited gang of heroes walk down a pavement. Everything between these scenes can be missed.<br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh would release a remake of ""Ocean's 11"" in 2001. It's a much better film, featuring a cast of photogenic mega stars (Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould etc), smooth operators, bad boys and likable character actors. ""I owe you for the thing with the guy in the place,"" is the line which gets the plot rolling, a slice of dialogue which epitomises the film's comically nonchalant attitude. If Milestone's film strove to be cool, Soderbergh goes for a kind of meta-cool, our cast both too cool for cool and playing uncool with coolness, mega stars Brad Pitt always chomping down on food, Matt Damon bumbling with style and George Clooney perpetually basking in his own silly magnificence. As the heist movie is intrinsically formulaic – first act: assemble the ""samurai"", second act: plan the heist, third act: escape or get captured – Soderbergh indulges in a kind of postmodern devil-may-care attitude. Meanwhile, the film's aesthetic is retro cool, with European/French touches, glossy locales, eye popping lights, sparkling surfaces/bulbs, lush cinematography, romantic editing/music, liquidy shapes and a camera that salivates over its suave actors, smooth villains and expensive locales. It's all about the money.<br/><br/>Soderbergh describes his ""Ocean's 11"" as a ""big wind up toy"", and while its designed to be ""just entertainment"", it does fit in with a number of the director's ""heavier"" films (""King of the Hill"", ""Che"", ""Traffic"", ""Eric Brockovich"", ""The Girlfriend Experience""), which have focused on economic inequality, economic depressions, Marxist revolutionaries and violent corporate muscle. Indeed, the casinos where Soderbergh's heists take place, the Bellagio and several other mega-casinos on the LA Strip, were built in the 1990s by entrepreneurs and corporate raiders like Steve Wynn (the real life model of Benedict, the film's villain, played sexily by Andy Garcia) with junk bonds and help from organised crime lords. With its art galleries and upscale restaurants, the Bellagio was then part of a diversification strategy in LA to earn profits from non-gaming sources. Yet the appeal of all these amenities, like gambling itself, is fuelled by a drive to offer consumers escape from a reality of diminished opportunities for upward mobility (within an American economy of diminishing wages, outsourcing and continuous lay-offs). Within a postindustrial, globalized economy, gambling, and even crime, increasingly appears to offer the best way, in the words of Jackson Lears, ""to get ahead in a world where work no longer seems reliable"". Indeed, each of the film's robbers comes with some indication that they embody the disaffection created by the increasing division of American society into ""haves"" and ""have nots"", whether it be a criminal past, lack of work, or entrapment in a job they find to be unrewarding. Even the bank-roller behind the heist, a former casino owner named Reuben Tishkoff (smoothly played by Elliout Gould), wants revenge against a new economy in which corporate moguls like Benedict can use their financial muscle to push him out. On the flip side, such readings are contradicted by the film's need to work as a big budget wish-fulfilment fantasy, and the fact that the crime genre has always portrayed the criminal as Soderbergh does here: cinema's lovable criminals may live on the outside, but they're still perfect conformists, chasing money in their own way because of capitalism's failings.<br/><br/>Soderbergh would release a sequel, ""Oceans 12"", some years later. This one takes the form of a ""con movie"", its narrative bending giddily in all directions, mercilessly toying with both convention and audience expectations. The film wasn't well received, despite being as good as its predecessor, which led to Soderbergh releasing the dull, and far safer, ""Oceans 13"" in 2007. The villain's name is literally ""Bank"" (Al Pacino) in this outing, but the film is mostly dumb.<br/><br/>8.5/10 – Some overlooked modern heist films: Mamet's ""Heist"" and Neil Jordan's ""The Good Thief"", a remake of Melville's genre defining ""Bob The Gambler""."
"drqshadow-reviews","6","1","2","22 January 2012"," Slick, Smooth All-Star Cast Never Seems to Risk Failure
","George Clooney, Brad Pitt and dozens of their elite Hollywood buddies get together to remake and rejuvenate this rat pack classic from forty years prior. The end result is a slick, mildly overproduced adventure that's smart and suave, though not quite so much as it seems to think it is. Much of the movie is blown on excessive, ""look what we can afford to do"" antics that are, admittedly, fun to watch but ultimately do little to endear the cast to their audience. Rather than a case of pillaging the rich to fill the coffers of the poor and desperate, this first installment of the Ocean's franchise feels more like a case of the filthy rich reaching into the cookie jars of the filthier. The heist genre loses a bit of its inherent suspense when a film's protagonists have access to a garage full of police paraphernalia, server racks spilling over with imaginary ""future tech"" computer equipment, Italian sports cars, cushy upper deck hotel rooms and access to all the blueprints they'll ever need. Clooney's charisma does buy him a degree of invulnerability to this phenomenon, which makes him an ideal centerpiece, but after the first viewing most of the team's close calls seem far too easily resolved. With these resources, Beavis & Butt-Head could have a pretty good shot at making off with a casino's millions. Good for a few action spots, at least."

"lagriff05","7","1","2","2 March 2008"," Not the best movie I've ever seen
","This is okay, I guess. Not near as good as I hoped, but what ever really is? The plot is a bit flimsy, as is the lame, half-cocked romance between George Clooney and Julia Roberts, and definitely the underwhelming acting. Pitt and Clooney aren't given a lot to work with here, and most of the time it's all clichéd super-slick con artist posturing with little to no actual emotion or anything put into it. Seriously, this could be really good if our main characters had ever shown any emotion aside from the conniving smirks and poker faces they usually seemed to have on, but as it is, all I can say is that this is too generic and unmemorable to merit any of the praise it has been given.<br/><br/>It does get some points for an entertaining climax and the well constructed heist, but that doesn't make a movie.

I also prefer movies that do not get carried away with useless and over-the-top special effects. Too many modern movies are depending on CGI. This movie reminds me of movies from the past. I enjoyed watching this movie as much as I enjoyed 'The Sting' from 1973. <br/><br/>Now I will admit the idea of knocking over three casinos is fairly unrealistic.

"jebabcock00","6","1","2","10 June 2006"," Tasty Treat That Leaves You Hungry
","After having seen this movie more than eight times (not by choice), I've come to realize that the original lukewarm reviews I read were correct: this film is not much better than mediocre. That's not to say that the film is terribleit's notor that you shouldn't watch ityou shouldbut rather that it has many flaws, some of them glaring.<br/><br/>Ask most people why they saw the movie, and they'll say something like ""It has George Clooney and Brad Pitt in it,"" or ""It has Julia Roberts in it,"" or ""Stephen Soderbergh directed it."" Ocean's Eleven is a ""People"" magazine reader's dream come true. So many celebrities in one movie: what bliss! The point is that Ocean's Eleven is not meant to be strong on character or plot; it's meant to be strong on Star Power. In fact, it's surprising that there is a plot, such as it is. It follows the new Blockbuster code: Hot Bad Guys who are actually Good Guys want to steal money from crooked, mean Big Businessman; they make elaborate plans, use fancy equipment, and ultimatelybut we all know the ending. Soderbergh may court the strange, the offbeat, the underbelly of society, but he also knows that when making an action movie one should not deviate too much from the tried-and-true. He gives us what we want, and more.<br/><br/>George Clooney and Brad Pitt as Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan, respectively, are the most likable of the bunch. They have a rapport that either is natural, or was rehearsed so effectively and so well that it became natural. They're like Laurel and Hardy, only with stubble and expensive suits. They eat each other's lines, insult each other, show off in front of each otherin some ways they're a more compelling couple than Clooney and Roberts.<br/><br/>Incidentally, Julia Roberts, apparently confusing Tess Ocean with Erin Brockovich, gives an intensity to her role of The Chick that is entirely inappropriate. This is an action movie, not a chance to win another Oscar. She delivers lines like she's chopping onions: short, quick, and full of force. Of course, her dramatic skill is unquestionable, but in this case a lighter touch would have been more fitting. I can understand her desire, if she had it, of wanting to give more weight to her role as Clooney's ex-wife and Andy Garcia's new girlfriend; it must be frustrating to be a piece of meat that men fight over. But she should have been more perceptive of the movie's genre and its requirements. In action movies, chicks should look hot and be tough; not much more is (usually) required.<br/><br/>The fact is, we hardly ever think of Roberts, or any of the other Big Names, as anything but who they are off the set. Although Garcia calls Roberts ""Tess"" several times, somehow the name always rings false. The other cast members, being less famous, have the advantage of being able to play their characters more convincingly.<br/><br/>This movie was a remake of another all-star movie made in 1960. (I've been unable to see more than snippets, and since I currently live out of the US I'm not able to rent it.) Most reviews refer to this previously made film, but the fact is that Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven is its own entity. We should judge it not based on its predecessor, but on its own meritsunfortunately too few.<br/><br/>When I first saw this movie, it was dubbed in Spanish, and I thought it was well made, well acted, and generally better than most action movies. (Of course, I was on a date at the time, so I wasn't scrutinizing every detail.) Upon subsequent viewing, however, this movie's imperfections only become more glaring. It's too bad. Although you won't think you've wasted two hours if you watch it for the first time, this movie is not one that you'll return to over and over againthat kind of film where each time you see it you discover more of the director's ingenuity, or the actors' skill, or the screenwriter's craft. This movie is good for a quick laugh and a thrill, but, like cake, it's not ultimately what will satisfy your hunger."

The handsome George Clooney was the handsome George Clooney, as always.....no acting involved. Brad Pitt promised a good role in the beginning, but what did he have to work with? Julia Roberts was a waste, but isn't she usually? The rest of the actors did their jobs well and provided an old fart with good entertainment for an evening, as most posters commented. I'm still trying to understand all that high-tech stuff....."

","Wow! This is a great crime caper flick which will have you guessing from start to finish! That is the main thing that I can say about OCEAN'S ELEVEN. If you ask me, the best things about this film were the lights and casinos of Las Vegas. Also, in my opinion, Danny (George Clooney) was a very smooth criminal. To me, Tess (Julia Roberts) was a very beautiful woman. My favorite outfit of hers was the gold dress she wore when she and Terry (Andy Garcia) went to the boxing match. Anyway, I thought that everyone involved did a good job, the cast was perfectly chosen, and the direction was excellent. Now, in conclusion, if you like George Clooney, Julia Roberts, or any of the key players, I highly recommend this excellent crime caper flick which will have you hooked from start to finish."

How did they think of that."" Whenever critics say that a movie is a ""roller coaster ride"" I think the movie is far from that. But this movie really is a roller coaster ride. You never know what will happen next. Watching this movie once is not enough. To really appreciate it, you need to watch this movie at least two or three times.

","Add me to the list of people who think that Hollywood is running out of original ideas. This film tries too hard to be cool. Somehow, you get the impression that the big stars of this movie (Clooney, Pitt, Roberts, etc.) are just laughing at all of us, saying ""Don't you wish you were beautiful like us and could appear in movies and make lots of money like we do?"" <br/><br/>I'll admit I've never been a fan of George Clooney. In this movie and others, he apparently wants to be the next Steve McQueen (who turned down Sinatra back in 1960 when when asked to appear in the original movie). The only problem is, Clooney's not McQueen. McQueen didn't have to act cool, he was cool. As was the real Rat Pack.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Matt Damon are somewhat better. Both at least show some talent, although this film gives them little opportunity to use it.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is decent, but again, they haven't got much to work with. The best work is turned in by old pros Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould. Andy Garcia is convincing in his role as well.<br/><br/>Probably the best thing about this film was the soundtrack - there was some decent music in several sections throughout.<br/><br/>I haven't bothered to see ""Ocean's Twelve"", as the real ""heist"" of these films is being played on the moviegoers who've paid to see them."

And that's not very often, that the remake is actually better than the old one. I remember when i was about to see the premiere, i was thinking to myself: ""Perhaps i can still get a refund"", cause I had very little faith in the movie.

Although I like most of the lead roles, I've seen much better performances. The plot is simple enough, a robbery of a casino. The only problem is that it's not a bit exciting. Everything goes smooth, nothing fails, and they get the money. Although a bit clever, it feels like the original parts are stolen from movies I have yet to see. When all's said and done, the movie leaves you with a feeling of being cheated of something; How did you get so many stars to make this boring movie?

","Some of Hollywood's biggest stars came together to help form a motion picture that is both fun and delightful. George Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, a man who just got out of prison from being caught stealing a large sum of money. But, nevertheless, Ocean wasn't ready to stop there, because he had something bigger in his mind than ever before... to rob 3 of the most largest casinos in Las Vegas, all at the same time. Once Ocean was set free, he then gets the world's most cunning, deceivous and rather clever 'men on a mission' to join together and help him get the job done. Ocean was planning on stealing all of the 150 million dollars stored in the casino stocks, with 11 people to share the reward with. The movie is filled with excitement through interesting dilemmas and hilarious character personalities and interactions. Brad Pitt is great as a man with class and who knows how to do things right, while Matt Damon is terrific as a mysterious robber with a subtle charm that makes him likable. The lovely Julia Roberts plays Tes, Ocean's ex-wife, and complications arise when she starts dating the casino owner (Andy Garcia). Since Ocean still wanted Tes back, it became obvious to the team that Ocean had more on his mind than they first thought. Will Ocean get all the cards he needs to win the game? A great, coming-of-age motion picture that's filled with laughs, great performances from all the actors, and a fresh screenplay that make this film well worth watching. Rating: 4 1/2 out of 5 Stars."

","With a class director and four of Hollywood's top stars, you would expect a guaranteed success. But not with this unnecessary repeat of one of Sinatra's minor films. <br/><br/>Soderbergh seems to have no empathy with any of his stars. George Clooney's normal sparkle is missing: Matt Damon is even more wooden than usual: Brad Pitt is anonymous, and even Julia Roberts is so subdued that you cannot see why Andy Garcia and Clooney are in the least interested in her.<br/><br/>The plot - yet another heist - builds up slowly through the standard Hollywood stages - recruitment of team, preparation using a simulation, the robbery and the smart escape. But it's all been done before (not least by Tom Cruise in 'Mission Impossible'). There's no excitement, and the quickfire(?) dialogue is muttered so indistinctly by the cast that half the time you need subtitles to follow what's going on. Worst of all, the hope of an unexpected twist at the end - all that kept me awake through the final stages of this boring film - is ruined by a final sequence crudely and obviously set up only with a sequel in mind. A waste of time."

","Let me confess something straight away - I hate heist movies.  As my Dad is fond of pointing out, in real life people hate thieves - yet Hollywood insists on turning them into heroes, time and again!  I wonder why.  Could it be that Hollywood loves underdogs?  That can't be the case in ""Ocean's Eleven""; somehow I can't see Clooney, Pitt, Damon and co. ever qualifying as ""underdogs.""  They're rich pretty boys who want to steal some cash so they can become richer and prettier.  Yuck.  <br/><br/>Here's a few disturbing elements to chew on: we've got a full range of stereotypes on display here, from the Funny Asian Guy (defined exclusively by his physical ability) to the Angry Cockney Guy (defined exclusively by his accent and his anger!).  Julia Roberts, the only woman on display - and boy, is she ON DISPLAY - is defined exclusively through her relationships with men.  What, can't she have a subplot that doesn't involve romance?  No, of course not - she's a female character in boys' own rubbish. <br/><br/>
Still, somewhere in the depths of my cynical being, I am mildly entertained by these gaudy proceedings; some deeply-buried part of me enjoys watching the white collar crime antics of these People magazine celebrities.  But for brainless entertainment, I'd still take the likes of Godzilla over this crowd any day."

Danny wants revenge, to get his wife back and steal all the money, estimated at over $150Million on the night of the big fight. Of course vault security is about the best anywhere, so he has to enlist the help of 10 others to pull all this off. Thus the name of the film, ""Ocean's 11.""  With only two weeks of preparation.  Nothing in this film is credible, so we just relax and watch the stars (Pitt, Damon, Roberts, Cheadle, and others) do their things. Of course, they succeed, and the film ends with Pitt getting Clooney after his ""3 to 6 months"" for parole violation, with his wife back, and two of Garcia's men following him.<br/><br/>The tricks they pull to case the joint, to prepare for the heist, the actual pulling off -- nothing is new but still interesting.  Of note is that all the characters are ""bad"", even Roberts' who knowingly associates with criminals. Garcia's character is known to have men whacked if they cross him. So that's supposed to make us not feel so guilty about enjoying a heist pulled off successfully.<br/><br/>In summary, good light entertainment, lots of stuff to make you smile, but no lasting impression.

","PLOT:  A+ ACTING:  A+ ACTION:  A+ OVERALL:  A+<br/><br/>I had been following the development of this film since day one:  director Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brockovich) and George Clooney teaming up post-Out Of Sight for a remake of an old Rat Pack flick called Ocean's Eleven.  Now, two years later and sporting one of the most talented casts of actors and actresses ever assembled, I finally got to see the film I had been looking forward to.  I was not disappointed, what I found was both entertaining and something other than a popcorn movie.  This is one of the best films I've ever seen and I don't think I'm the only one who will end up saying that.<br/><br/>The story deals with Danny Ocean (George Clooney), a con-man just out of doing a stretch in a New Jersey prison.  Anxious to get to work, he teams up with pal Dusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) and the two men hatch a plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos on the night of the biggest fight in Vegas history. Forming a team of specialists in a Mission: Impossible-esque fashion which includes: a Cockney demolition expert (Don Cheadle), a pair of bickering Mormon brothers (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan), a pickpocket (Matt Damon), an aged con (Carl Reiner), a blackjack dealer (Bernie Mac), an electronics expert (Edward Jemison), a Chinese acrobat (Shaobo Qin), and the men's bankroll (Elliott Gould), the eleven prepare the biggest heist of their lives on an un-crackable vault.  As the story progresses and we watch the plot progress, we find out the vault is not the only winning on the table. Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts), is currently the girlfriend Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the man who owns all three of the targeted casinos.<br/><br/>With such a cast of all-stars, it was worth the price of admission alone. Clooney, Pitt, Damon and Roberts, it's a dream come true.  However, this film is not a dream, it is the real thing and will not disappoint.  Each actor works superbly in the confines of their role, not trying to out act one another or take things too seriously.  They are the perfection of cool and it's incredably entertaining to watch them act without breaking a sweat. For example, little mannerisms are worked into each character for  depth and detail when the story cannot focus solely on them.  Such a mannerism is that of Pitt's character, Dusty, he is eating something is every scene.  Granted, I would to have loved to see more of each character (Roberts could have had a lot more to do), however, the film is not about these characters, it's about the heist.  If it was an ensamble piece about eleven criminals robbing some casinos, the film would have been about two hours longer than it's two hours and fifteen minutes.  Don't get me wrong, I would have loved to see more, but more isn't always better.  Why can't more movies have a cast like this?  Every actor took a pay cut just to be able to work with one another and have fun, which clearly shows.  Everyone is having a good time.  Not in the same way the Rat Pack did in the original (film for  an hour and take the day off), just getting together to make a great film.<br/><br/>Of course it's not just the actors and actresses that add this flair to the film.  It's the screenplay (written by Ted Griffin), musical score (David Holmes), and the direction/cinematography (Steven Soderbergh).  The screenplay is sharp in it's dialogue and action, adding twists and turns and just a plain cool tone to the flick. The score is also something to notice, composed by Irish DJ David Holmes who once again teams up with director Steven Soderbergh (they previously worked with one another on Out Of Sight), gives us a score of funky jazz that I absolutely love.  It really sets the whole mood.  Finally, my hero, Oscar winner Steven Soderbergh provides excellent direction and gritty cinematography (he also shot Traffic himself) that gives us an excellent sense of location.  The man is truly one of the grestest filmmakers ever.  His influence is visible in much of today's cinema and if weren't for his first film, ""sex, lies, and videotape"", independent film would not be where it is today.  I hope he gets another nomination and possibly another win.  He learned not to come out with two great movies this time around.  I should also mention that there is a likeness between this film and Soderbergh's Out of Sight.  Is this a bad thing?  In my opinion, no.  Out of Sight is one of the best films I've ever seen, while  Ocean's Eleven borrows some of it's style from it's predessor, it pays it's  own way.<br/><br/>I had read the book and bought the soundtrack before I went to see the film. I even tried to watch the original, which to my surprise was drawn out and just a romp of excess.  It was refreshing to find that Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Angie Dickinson had been replaced with such a talented cast of Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts.  I couldn't get enough of Ocean's Eleven and I still feel the same.  My friends plan on going back again tomorrow (the day after opening night) for another showing.  It's that good, one of the best films of the year.  I can't wait for the DVD release."

So, if you like movies with hot boys or simply movies with coolio plots, you should totally check out Ocean's 11, you'll be glad you did. Have a nice 2002!"
"jotix100","7","1","2","7 December 2001"," Why bother remaking this film?
","As it was, the original Oceans 11, wasn't a masterpiece of filmmaking!Whatever was in Mr. Soderberg's mind in taking this project, is beyond comprehension. The plot is ridiculous, to put it mildly. It is very convoluted and just to think this gang could carry it off just goes to show us the arrogance not only of the director, but the whole production company involved with this mess. Are we the only ones to think that Brad Pitt is a bad actor? He just doesn't register an emotion in this film, at all! What about that other over-rated star, turned producer, actor, screenwriter, Matt Damon? He is just beyond help. These 2 actors could improve a lot by taking serious acting classes before they even venture out again. Their characters are phoneys, as they're portrayed by these 2 on screen. The only one that shines in this film is George Clooney. He is an actor with a terrific screen presence and a natural, in comparison with the rest of the others. His scenes with Julia Roberts show a rare chemistry and we believe in their past and present involvement. The rest of the cast is just blah. Why doesn't Hollywood use writers and directors who can give us original stories with plots that can be believed instead of remaking films that had their moment and don't merit a remake in any way, shape, or form. Amen!"

"filipemanuelneto","6","1","3","21 February 2017"," A light film that entertains the audience well.
","This movie tells the attempt to rob the vault of three major Las Vegas casinos by a group of professional thieves led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney). It's a very light film, made for entertaining, with an improbable but fun plot, full of moments of intelligent humor that look good in the movie. In addition to Clooney, who has done here one of his most popular works, we have Brad Pitt, Bernie Mac, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Julia Roberts among others. Clooney and Pitt stood out for the positive, being able to amuse and to make humor without losing the charm of their characters or overshadowing the colleagues. The story is relatively simple but allows almost all actors to have room to appear. And although I said the story is unlikely, the biggest problem of the script for me was the love trio Clooney-Roberts-Garcia. The idea was good, but it did not work out because Julia Roberts never seemed very willing. The romantic chemistry between her and her two colleagues was zero and I ended up thinking about what the actress really thought she was doing in the movie. Andy Garcia has already made more inspirational performances but was decent enough on his character. The scenarios are very good and realistic, from the safe to the gaming rooms, and the great sights of Las Vegas are truly beautiful and look good on the screen. The soundtrack is great and stays in the ear."

It relies very, very heavily on the chemistry between the main leads (Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Roberts) but there is a decent story being told too.<br/><br/>There's lots of witty banter and one-upmanship that is entertaining and the heist itself is well directed.<br/><br/>It can at some points come across as being a little overly smug though, in a sort of ""how can you not like this film?"" way. I found it a little self-indulgent as well.<br/><br/>Overall, the best in the trilogy that shouldn't have been a trilogy at all."
"robsta23","7","1","3","2 May 2015"," The Plan is Almost Too Perfect
","This was a movie that kind of confused me as a kid in that this was one of the first movies I saw where the protagonists commit a crime. I remember asking my dad, ""so these are the bad guys?"" His response was along the lines of ""well, they may be stealing something but they're still the good guys."" I still liked the movie as a kid, but this concept confused me a little bit. Many years later, it is still a delightful B movie to watch.<br/><br/>It is pretty awesome that they have so many people on their team to create an ensemble cast, but some of them get barely any screen time when I would want to see an equal balance of the cast. For example, all we know about the little acrobat is that he is really good at what he does since he doesn't speak much English, besides dropping the second use of ""f***"" in the movie. We also don't delve too deep into the back story of certain characters, such as the oldest member on the team. We know all of these guys either have a connection to Ocean or Pitt's character or that they are found, and for this senior citizen we know he has a connection to Pitt's character and that is about it.<br/><br/>The funniest bits of the film come from the twins, one of whom is played by Casey Affleck, who really gets how annoying his character is supposed to be. One of my favorite parts of the film is when Affleck's character's toy car is going faster than his brother's monster truck just to get destroyed by his brother.<br/><br/>Getting back to the point of the movie, the heist seems to go way too smoothly, which is meant to satisfy the viewers I guess, but a great film requires conflict - no matter if it is external or internal - but this film's struggle seems mainly to be internal struggles within Ocean and his enemy played by Andy Garcia. One is trying to win his ex- wife back, and the other is dying inside as his money is getting stolen. As Brad Pitt's character points out, it is really selfish of Ocean to concoct this plan with some motivation to win Tess back. Romance makes a good subplot in movies - in fact a lot of producers want at least some type of romance in their movies - and while it holds up and illustrates that Ocean is a better man than Garcia's character, but it seems to stray from the focus on the rest of the team.<br/><br/>While watching this my friends were pointing out how gadgets in this movie go unexplained, especially for a film released in 2001 where this type of technology wasn't even in many James Bond films. Each step of the plan seems to go almost too well, with the exception that they almost blow the acrobat away.<br/><br/>This is an enjoyable heist film that makes us feel for Ocean, but I wish there was more connection to the other characters in the film."

","Clooney and Pitt are a great duo; they have great chemistry, comic timing and are just an attractive pair. The plot is eleven men who are robbing one of the biggest casinos in Vegas on fight night for a possible bag of $150million, split between them. It's a completely ensemble cast including Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Bernie Mac, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts amongst others. It's clever, witty, multi-layered and something of a film that you can watch again and again and see more things each time. It's one that I had to watch a few times to get the entire plot and each time I see it I don't remember the full points so it's a good yarn. The writers were brilliant.<br/><br/>It's shot excitingly, with lots of crisp cuts, and jumping between scenes using a split screen occasionally, giving it a retro feel. The plot is convoluted enough that it's believable, if a little slick (given it's got Pitt and Clooney in it that's a given), with some clever time wasters to ramp up the tension, and I just adore Brad Pitt's characterisation - he's ALWAYS eating! Don Cheadle (uncredited, apparently due to a disagreement) is a funny Britt who speaks primarily in cockney rhyming slang is a bit of a hoot as well. The thrill of this film is in the details - silly little things that you might miss. It's a great watch and I thoroughly recommend it as tense comedic entertainment for everyone.

","Ocean's Eleven (2001) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film features a new slew of ""A"" list actors as they try and rob three Las Vegas casinos in one night for a total of $150-million. I really don't think this remake improves on anything in the original movie but at the same time this one here contains an excellent cast that helps keep everything watchable. Director Steven Soderbergh adds a great style to the picture that keeps you glued into what's going on but at the same time making sure you never think about things too much or else you'd quickly realize that the entire plan simply could never happen. Soderbergh manages to keep the film moving at a very quick pace, which certainly helps things since overall this is just an average caper film. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner, Bernie Mac, Elliott Gould, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck and several celebrity cameos certainly keep you glued to the screen. Not only do the actors all show up in good form but several of them turn in excellent performances. This includes Garcia who is just so calm, cool and collective that you can't help but love the character and the way he handles his business. Both Clooney and Pitt share some great chemistry and even Roberts manages to be charming. Again, I don't think this version really improves any on the original story but then again, the original wasn't the greatest picture ever made. Fans of the cast will certainly want to check this out even with its flaws."
"MartianOctocretr5","5","1","3","5 June 2010"," Not fun enough as a comedy; not properly constructed to be drama
","So-so redo of the classic rat-pack comedy/adventure made 40 years earlier. Although the movie has its moments, it lacks the heart and humor of the original, while taking itself way too seriously.<br/><br/>An all-star cast, but several people in the cast are relegated to two minutes of screen time, a waste for this calibre of talent. The people we do see most often are George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts. Of these, Pitt and Damon fare best with the crime suspense approach the film takes. Clooney's character is written as the kind of failure in life type that could never devise and certainly not pull off a major caper like this. If the movie had shot for comedy, that would be OK. But it's not; it burdens itself with an absurd side plot of the casino crime boss, Roberts, and Clooney being in an old love triangle. And of course, Clooney is after revenge. Come on. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but accepting that theme requires suspension of sanity. Julia Roberts, by the way, plays her unlikely character's situation way too straight. She's so low-key, she looks like she's asleep half the time. As for Clooney, his mugging wears thin after a while.<br/><br/>The way the casino security is depicted is ridiculous; again this would have been OK in a comedy. There's never more than about five or six of these brain-dead glorified bouncers running around; none of these inept fools could even catch his own Siamese twin. The state of the art high tech systems used in Vegas, according to this movie, couldn't prevent a blind man from wandering into a casino vault.<br/><br/>On the positive side, it still manages some brainless popcorn level entertainment. On that basis, it's about an average quality movie."

La dee da what else to say..Amsterdam is an attractive city, and so is Rome...Not much else you can say about this film...except one of the actors in it was born today..I suppose the plot twist underlies the fact that there really was no possibility of making a working version of a sequel to the first movie. I wonder if the 3D tech that appears in the film really exists...Oh well, thats all I have to say. Good luck to the producers filling cinemas with stuff like this. They say that cinema is based on the audience willing to suspend their disbelief of things that are maybe impossible. Maybe that point is taken too far by some film folk."
"tsheridan94","7","1","3","7 February 2010"," The king of the dialog comedy
","Steven Soderbergh is the unchallenged lord of comedic dialog (not including Inigo Montoya, but that character has only been in one movie.) Soderbergh has proved this countless times, with everything from this to the Informant!<br/><br/>Generally, his movies contain very little ""immature"" comedy, which comprises physical comedy, primarily people being hit in the groin or the head. His comedies rely much more heavily on wit and comedic interplay. They are all the better for this fact.<br/><br/>Ocean's Eleven, definitely the smartest and best of the Ocean's movies, may be the best of the Soderbergh collection in general. These actors have the art of banter down to a science, literally. I think some of them may have majored in it in college. The Oceans crew pull off the effect of making this gang of thieves seem like a family, albeit a dysfunctional one. And therein lies the charm. We are so used to wanting to see the criminals locked up in these movies that it's a refreshing change to see the people on the right side of the law, at least on paper, be the fools and bad guys.<br/><br/>These robbers are in it partially for the money, but partially for the thrill of the heist. But these guys aren't necessarily adrenaline junkies or sociopathic criminals. Rather, it's almost like a sport. The thing that makes these criminals of the Vegas underworld so charming, however, is that they aren't out to hurt people, at least in the physical sense. I don't think any of the crew ever carried a gun at any point in the film. <br/><br/>Not only was I empathizing with these criminals, I was laughing, occasionally to the point of tears, along their exploits. Not at their exploits, these guys are the best in the biz, and for good reason. No, I was laughing at the quick one-liners that were so adeptly thrown in there that not a single laugh feels forced, as well as at the general and increasingly imbecilic and barbaric actions if casino owner Terry Benedict.<br/><br/>This has also got to include one of the best casts ever assembled, as well. George Clooney is marvelous. Almost all of his movies are comedies, but he is able to act so serious, dead-pan, throughout, that he is often forgotten to be a comedian, or at least a funny actor, first and foremost. Brad Pitt and Matt Damon are equally fantastic, and Bernie Mac was the funniest he'd been in years. And let's not forgot Don Cheadle. He plays the comedian's role quite nicely. I'd recommend he stick to it, if he wasn't so good in movies like Traitor. And how about that Amazing Yen? Everyone here is so funny in their own unique way that they are incomparable. But that's what makes so good...the cast is so unique, but also grafted together so seamlessly, that is easy to feel that if not all were there, the movie wouldn't be what is. Each piece is of the same importance.<br/><br/>In the end, this may be one of the funniest movies you'll ever see."

The huge ensemble cast, the great cinematography and editing, wonderful sound...nothing saves this film. I haven't seen the original film, so someone else will have to comment on its significance to this movie.<br/><br/>If you've seen one heist film, you've seen everything that this film will try to offer. These are stock characters going through a stock exercise in crime. Pitt and Clooney try to be charming, but they seem to be cannibalizing their own careers, dredging up pale imitations of characters they played in previous films (Out of Sight, for Clooney). Even some of the music, instrumentals by David Holmes, is taken from older albums. There are no surprises in this movie and very little chemistry between the characters. The central conceit is that you are supposed to want these guys to pull off the crime, but with a veritable sea of generic criminals, there really isn't a way to get the audience to focus enough to care about them. Clooney and Julia Roberts have almost zero chemistry (although the film's dialogue improves 90% when the two of them interact).<br/><br/>The attempts at humor in Ocean's Eleven are embarrassingly flaccid; particularly when you take into account that Soderbergh and Clooney worked together in Out of Sight, a film that surpasses Ocean's Eleven on every possible front, but particularly in its comedic delivery and pacing.<br/><br/>There's no doubt in my mind that Ocean's Eleven will be successful. Others in the screening were touching their throats and praising the film shamelessly. The ensemble cast and the dearth of adult movies will position Ocean's Eleven favorably. But discriminating movie-goers will want to avoid this dull and unamusing exercise in genre."

The characters are the worst - they are a bunch of arrogant, rich con-men who decide to steal a ton of money from the casino vault. That's it. Just because they want and they can. They design and execute an elaborate plan, and of course they win and, as the ending suggests, live happily ever after. No regret, no second thoughts, just happiness from stealing millions from casino employees - dealers, guards, cooks and all the rest who work there, because it's them who will get the cut to recoup the casino losses. Benedict (the casino owner) will restore his wealth, he's a rich guy anyway, but the majority who work at casinos won't be so lucky. Their lives will be ruined, just because some criminals decided to have fun and steal millions of their dollars, all sitting conveniently in a vault.<br/><br/>The cast is really spectacular, but it can't save this film. It has absolutely atrocious moral message, it is boring and predictable and I honestly can't imagine who might like this, let alone recommend this ""masterpiece"" to others.

","""Ocean's Eleven"" is a very fun and stylish heist movies with a wonderful cast and clever script that provides more than enough surprises and fun twists.<br/><br/>The movie is just mainly fun as it is meant to be, it is no Oscar material or anything. I think Steven Soderbergh (who also wrote and did the cinematography for this movie) really used his big name to get together such a great cast with big names such as: George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Elliott Gould and Andy Garcia. All of the actors portray some fun and enjoyable characters. Characters such as Yen, Virgil and Turk Malloy and Basher Tarr, which are the most enjoyable.<br/><br/>If you liked ""The Italian Job""(2003) you'll love ""Ocean's Eleven"". Hopefully ""Ocean's Twelve"" will be just as good, or maybe even better.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"sddavis63","3","1","4","6 January 2003"," An Uninspired Remake Of An Uninspired Original
","I was not a huge lover of the original version of ""Ocean's Eleven,"" but would still give it the nod over this rather weak and uninspired remake. Basically what makes this the weaker of the two is the cast. In the original, there was the chemistry of the ""Rat Pack"" to at least keep things interesting. Here, George Clooney et. al. are never able to establish that same rapport and a movie that boasts some big names (Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, etc.) is never able to convince me that the cast was working as a team.<br/><br/>The same problem that infected the first version is apparent in this as well: the plodding beginning which takes us in great detail through the planning of the casino heist. Here, though, the planning itself leads to questions. To do everything that this bunch did in preparation would have required (it seems to me) a fair bit of seed money. Sure, $160 million is a lot of money, but I found myself wondering at times why they needed it. In any event, the planning of the heist is not exactly spell-binding. This version goes into far more detail about the heist itself than did the original, but it loses points for its ending, which was quite weak compared to the ""Rat Pack"" version.<br/><br/>Since I wasn't a fan of the original I wasn't really expecting much, and that's exactly what I got: not much!<br/><br/>3/10."

","I'm too late to watch and it feels long and boring"
"elshikh4","6","1","5","2 January 2010"," Ocean's Eleven Robots !
","It's the score this time. Not the scorers.<br/><br/>(Soderbergh) wanted the trust of the studio?, wanted to be a big player?, wanted to fulfill his own dreams by directing Hollywood dreams first? Whatever the reason was, the man delivered. But despite being loved or successful, the popcorn movie which he made was so unfunny and spiritless. Maybe it's (Soderbergh)'s real unconcern of the project's nature coming unconsciously on the surface. Maybe that's his very sense of humor. Or maybe he got a desire to insert something extra in a genre movie?!<br/><br/>With unceasing warm colors, so smooth editing and soothing, low tone, soundtracks, the movie's time managed to be anesthetic; like seeing everything through hued glass of many bottles of wines while being a bit drunk; which took a lot from the movie's supposed suspense.<br/><br/>Despite the considerable halo of coolness around the actors, I knew pretty little data about all of their characters, with no moving matters. So I couldn't care less. You must notice that they don't make mistakes either; the problems are always around them, not inside of them, which's surely inhuman, read: boring thing to attract any attention. Plus there was no interplay between them, or anything like it. To tell you the truth, it pushed me at times to think that (Soderbergh) was intending to show us the bad affect of the contemporary modernism on the human's relationships. Sometimes they're like actors with so insignificant material to do while the stars' charm does the rest. And sometime I believed that the insignificant material was silly, and the stars' charm was lost, rather speechless, amongst it.<br/><br/>It looks nice, but it doesn't feel the same, since there aren't that nice characters in the first place. I watched bunch of outwardly different replicants who work together for money. Well, at least the original movie, which many consider goofy in comparison, made them one band of friends who work for money, having some motives as well. Showing the whole gang scrutinizing their unspoken dreams while watching a dazzling fountain, celebrating silently their must-be-in-the-dark glory with Debussy's Clair de Lune playing in the background was well expressive moment, but nothing in the world can prevent me of convincing that it would've been more deep, emotional, and long-lived with an early glance over their actual dreams.<br/><br/>Save the idea of the lover thief who wants to get his love back and ""hit"" his rich opponent, nothing was human. I sensed a human breath in only 2 scenes (Clooney reunites with Roberts for the first time after going out of jail, and the one where Damon and Mac were bluffing Garcia). In fact, the cuteness and cleverness in them looked not present in all the rest. There were places that beg a witty line or gag, but nothing was done. And even the real *funny* gags were whether too cold, or too American to be followed.<br/><br/>For instance, in a second viewing, I discovered that every time we get to see (Pitt), he's having a snack. Is that funny? Maybe with other, real funny, situations it could've been smart touch. Because being as it is alone was poor, giving a feel that this cast was just enjoying a vacation in Vegas where they eat and hang out together while doing, and saying, nothing funny!<br/><br/>With another cast that would've been way less interesting. However, while the stiff personality suits the character played by (Andy Garcia) to be that scary, it was unfortunate that most of the rest looked the same under the name of coolness!<br/><br/>The absence of the A-list, star-studded, heist movie since the 60s's end and the 70s's start was part of the reason why this was a hit. Simply this kind was long-time missed. Plus I believe that its success opened the way during the whole 2000s for similar projects like The Italian Job (2003), Inside Man (2006), The Brothers Bloom (2008), let alone 2 (Ocean) sequels, to be made, returning the ""Hollywood"" heist to ""Hollywood"".<br/><br/>For me, I enjoyed part of the scheme, the good image, and the nostalgic, high class, soundtrack, but none of the characters. And with this outcome, it isn't a very good or finely memorable movie. It's only a good one to pass the time with.<br/><br/>Losing the interplay between the characters and their viewers is a calamity. So again, is it (Soderbergh)'s indifference? Is it just his dry fun? Or is it his own satire; where it becomes all about the score, taking the humanity out of its scorers as long as they do it right anyway? But even if that was the point; then this is the movie to display that, and to be an example for it in the same time too!<br/><br/>P.S: (Brad Pitt)'s voice and persona were so recognizable as the SWAT team's leader in the walkie-talkie. I have no idea why to blow up the movie's biggest twist prematurely as easy as this?!"
"skepticskeptical","5","1","5","31 December 2009"," Fairytale for underdogs? thinly veiled socialist propaganda? or just plain incoherent?
","This movie is relatively entertaining and provokes a few good laughs. It exhibits the classic structure of the Fairytale for Underdogs, leading the viewer to root along with the losers (Ocean's 11) against the powerful and rich (Andy Garcia's character). We are to hope that this mad-capped caper will succeed so that the eleven losers will no longer be insolvent, and the rich guy will lose big.<br/><br/>The odd thing about this version of the fairytale is that we have no idea why we should detest the King of Three Casinos. Is it because he's a crook (which we don't really know)? Apparently not, since the losers who are taking him on are also crooks. Is it because he stole the ex-con Ocean's wife (played insipidly, as usual, by Julia Roberts)? That seems to be the idea, but we haven't a clue as to why SHE divorced him (and not vice versa), except for the fact that he was in prison for a number of years, and she is clearly angry with him about something. Perhaps, having been left in the lurch, she simply decided to move on... But now we are supposed to side with the loser ex-con upon his release from prison as he endeavors to rob $160 million from her new boyfriend, while winning her back as well.<br/><br/>There seems to be a bit of a socialist undercurrent here, for even if the Andy Garcia character is a crook, he's a successful crook, unlike his adversaries. So it looks as though we are supposed to hate him for being competent and rich! Julia Roberts plays a woman who appears to have been hurt deeply by her ex-husband the ex-con, but is ready to hit the road with him again, upon his successful heist of $160 million from the guy who has provided her with not only companionship during her ex-husband's incarceration, but also a job as the curator of a museum in one of his casinos. (Hmmm... Was it love that attracted her to him?) Honestly, I don't get. At the end of the day, this morally sanctimonious chick appears to click with whoever is rich!<br/><br/>The socialist waters become even more muddled at this point, for now that Ocean's eleven are rich, shouldn't we side with some other cluster of underdogs who should now want to rob them? (It looks as though I'll have to watch the sequels for the answer to that question!) In fact, if we (the moviegoers) were to take the premise of this film seriously, we should all conspire to rob George, Brad, Matt, Julia, et al., of the millions that they each earned for starring in this thing!!!<br/><br/>OCEAN'S ELEVEN was never meant to provoke thought. Just some raucous laughter and the primordial desire to side against anyone who's better off than one's self. Or maybe just the idea that a bunch of losers might be able to pull off an impossible heist despite the fact that they make blunder after blunder, almost blowing it about a dozen times. So, against all odds, fortuna takes their side. Maybe that was it."
"freeheat","2","1","5","13 December 2001"," Why would anyone care?
","This drivel never left the starting gate. There is nothing here to care about.<br/><br/>The opening scene is a convict making a lame case for parole. In spite of his ridiculous story, in the next scene he's walking out of a prison in NJ. Next he's in an Atlantic City casino. At this point I still don't know who he is or what he's doing, and I don't care. After apparently meeting an old friend who's dealing there, he makes a late night call to his parole officer. That thread goes nowhere. Next he's in Hollywood for some unknown reason. At this point I started counting the twinkly lights in the ceiling.<br/><br/>The ""banter"" some critics have swooned over is trite at best. Clooney and Pitt sound like they're satirizing some bad detective novel.<br/><br/>Finally, Julia Roberts is nothing but a female stick figure.<br/><br/>Soderbergh, who did marvelous work with ""Traffic,"" should be ashamed of himself."

","Yeah I laughed out loud three times total.  ""'Suicidal?', 'Only in the mornings.'""; ""Don't turn up in Newport Beach trying to by a 100,000 dollar car."" And one other time, but I can't remember when that was.  The Newport Beach line is classic, a sly reference to the kidnapping a few years ago of the former Bellagio owner's daughter, wherein they paid the ransom, but the kidnappers got caught in So. Cal., trying to buy a Ferrari for cash.  This line flew way over the heads of the audience in the showing I saw.  And damn we were in Reno, Nevada where the kidnapping made pretty big news.  But then the audience was laughing and having a good ole time thoughout the rest of this movie.  Both these facts lead me to believe that the audience was lobotomized.<br/><br/>It's amazing in a movie with so many actors having tremendous on-screen chemistry, that none of it shows here.  The chemistry of this movie is nil, assign a number from 1-10 to whichever actor in this film, epitomizes charisma and chemistry for you, then divide that number by 11.  That should give you an idea of how bland this film and it's acting performances. If you like this movie, it's my guess that you are incapable of long division and something as complex as dividing by eleven.  Make your appointment with the brain surgeon and get your lobotomy done pronto."
"vasco_cid","1","1","7","18 March 2002"," The ending worths the movie.
","When one sees the movie poster of Ocean's Eleven, one sees it is directed by last year's academy award winner director Steven Soderbergh, and it stars a fantastic cast, uniting some of the most talented actors nowadays. The story isn't new, everyone knows that, a man recently came out of prison, wants to rob three casinos. Starts hiring professionals to do it, but soon we know that he is not doing this work only by the pleasure of stealing. He is also doing this because the casino's owner wife happens to be his ex-wife, whom he wants back. Done. The movie itself is disappointing halfway in, I myself wondered in what mess I was, and how much disappointed I was, also, I became aware that Steven Soderbergh ISN'T the director they make of him.  He is not that great. There are some directors, which we recognize their work, miles away, by being unique. Soderbergh's work is recognizable not for it, but to be similar to many others: shoulder cameraÂ… Only when the end was coming I start thrilling myself. Twists. A worlwhind of twists one after another, all of them making perfect sense. By the end I could tell what elegance it was, not the beginning, not the middle, but the ending. All eleven characters working together at the same time. The robbing itself was great, and Brad Pitt's call was humorous but expiring charm and intelligence. After all, Ocean's Eleven is not what many expected of it. Is just us watching a talented cast doing something good and fun. Don't expect your life to change, don't expect an average action film, expect a movie that could have been great if the pace was always the same... 7 out of 10"
"halatalo","1","1","8","17 December 2001"," A dull film...
","This was an exceptionally useless film. The only thing that kept me watching the film to the end was Soderbergh's direction. Ocean's Eleven has no suspense, no action, very little comedy and certainly no drama. The only thing this film has is a linear, predictable and uninteresting script and a bunch of big stars playing characters none of whom are least bit interesting or unique. I only wish they would have had Guy Ritchie write the film's screenplay; his films have just the things Ocean's Eleven would have needed to be a good film."
"tonidizer","1","1","9","22 May 2003"," Shallow and boring
","I was terribly disappointed by this movie. Actually, I was trying hard to stay awake. There were some good jokes, but no suspense really and the plot was very easy to guess.<br/><br/>*** possible spoilers ahead ***<br/><br/>Right at the beginning of the movie I was sure this was going to be another Hollywood production with a happy end. I had no doubts whatsoever whether they will succeed or not. They had to succeed in robbing the casinos.<br/><br/>Also, would you imagine people who are professional thieves to be so gullible? Two situations: first when Ocean says that all that were invited to take part in the hit can give up. What professional thief would take the risk that the ones who give up this task will keep their mouths shut? Similar situation - when Ocean is excluded from the hit because of his emotional engagements with his ex-wife - they just let him go around the casino - what guarantee do they have that he won't do something stupid and screw up the whole hit? They have too much to lose to be so gullible. There are many more such situations...<br/><br/>The play was far from exceptional, perhaps except of the few moments when characters pretended to be someone else. I also have no idea what people see in Julia Roberts. A typical movie with an overgrown budget and a famous cast which is supposed to draw you to see it. Not worth it in my opinion."

"RagingDraugr","8","0","1","2 March 2019"," Talk about ""the perfect crime"".
","In terms of an elaborate heist story that keeps building and revealing the full extent of the plan as the film goes on, I haven't quite seen anything else like 'Ocean's Eleven'. The way this film unfolds is something to marvel at, and is practically worth the price of admission on it's own. Fortunately, it has more going for it than just a well thought-out heist plan that accounts for every single eventuality. What also stands out are the characters and the soundtrack. Each of the heist members are distinct and memorable, much like the soundtrack is - with classical tunes mixed in with then-modern beats, as well as a funky, jazzy score that evokes the spirit of a romanticized era of film and music and thus, gives the film a sense of timelessness...if it weren't for the chunky early-2000s mobile phones, that is. But those, in all fairness, can be easily overlooked.<br/><br/>The movie also has a good dose of humour, but it never detours the film for the sake of making a joke or needlessly 'ruins' a serious or emotional moment. Rather, it helps to flesh out the characters and make them feel real and believable. In addition, the humour is interwoven with the dialogue, which has no small measure of wit or cleverness to it and again, contributes to improving the overall characterisation. Finally, the pacing is actually remarkably strong - even in the slower moments, it never feels like the film is dragging its heels and instead, manages to maintain a breakneck pace with ease. My only major criticism with the film is that some of the editing can be...odd. Specifically, the transitions and occasional effect such as the ever-""classic"" 3D flip transition and the intentionally choppy footage in the scene where Ocean spots a potential heist member on a train. These editing choices seem bizarre and amateurish, and do drag the film's rating down somewhat.<br/><br/>Overall: 8/10, maybe 9 or higher if it wasn't for some of the weird editing decisions."

This is a remake of an older film featuring a bunch of stud criminals who decide to swindle a Las Vegas casino. Ocean's 11 is fun and light hearted. There are moments of suspension of disbelief, but one must ignore them to truly enjoy the film.

This film is about 11 guys carrying out the impossible, robbing 3 casinos simultaneously using clever wit, skilled technical work, Brut force and charisma.<br/><br/>Well they pulled it off, there are some mini twists and some Humour along the way. Its just short of 2 hours and its just the right length, an hour to get to know those involved and see the plans coming about and the next 50 minutes to execute it, just perfect.<br/><br/>Overall a great film and well executed, great all star cast and not too involved nor hard to hard to understand."

","Ocean's Eleven is an entertaining but unambitious endeavor that combines traditional caper rhythms with comic riffs. The movie provides an engaging two hours that develops in exactly the manner one would expect from this sort of production. The storyline, while certainly not a masterpiece of plotting (there are numerous holes, some of which are rather large), offers enough to keep audiences guessing and to inject a little tension into an otherwise harmless and lightweight enterprise. There are also sufficient moments of comedy to maintain an upbeat tone. Furthermore, all the actors are clearly having fun which adds to the appeal. This is a great fun film to watch."

","I was never interested in seeing ""Oceans Eleven,"" though ""Ocean's 8""'s release slightly made me want to see this film as well as its sequels. One boring day, I decided to watch and I had very low expectations. After watching it, I HAD A BLAST... at the film's 2nd and 3rd acts.<br/><br/>Acts 2 & 3 - FUN AND SMART! The planning and execution of the heist was a brilliant ride from act 2's start to act 3's end. These acts were near-perfection! (Some parts were slightly boring)<br/><br/>ACT 1 - The film has a lot of supporting characters which, sadly, meant a lot of dragged and sometimes uninteresting introductions to said characters. If act 1 was the entire film, I'd give ""Ocean's Eleven"" 4 stars. Thankfully, it's not.<br/><br/>NOTE: Though the character introductions were too long and, at times, uninteresting, the actors did their best. Their on-screen charisma made these scenes slightly better.<br/><br/>I still have one more flaw with this film: Julia Roberts' character. Despite her amazing performance, her character was just a plot device for Danny Ocean. Yes, a plot device is important but when a character is a plot device, the film shouldn't make you feel that said character IS a plot device.<br/><br/>Overall, I had a blast with ""Ocean's Eleven!"""

","Ocean's 11 is a sleek update on the original rat pack film of the 60s. Steven Soderberg is an auteur of sorts, especially in the way he lights his films and this is a gorgeous looking highly atmospheric crime caper set in the casinos and heat of Las Vegas. The film looks cool and the lighting needs to be singled out for that. Of course just lights don't make great films and the script is good. On close inspection it may fall apart but no one really cares about such details with regards to a film like Ocean's 11. The casting is what is stupendous and all the actors are too cool a bunch.

"klheintz","6","0","1","9 October 2017"," Better than the original, but plot holes and lack of direction in some characters keep it from greatness
","Ocean's Eleven follows the story of Danny Ocean putting together the biggest heist Vegas has ever seen. He enlists the help of a few close friends to help him put together an impossible team for an impossible job, and it's fun the whole way through. If you don't pay attention to some glaring plot holes.<br/><br/>I enjoy this film, I really do. Even with the blatant plot holes, unbelievable means by which they pull of the heist, and the back-and- forth character motivations it is by no means a perfect film. But is a fun ride the whole way through and I am glad that I watched it. Ocean's Eleven wastes no time getting right into the heist, and the sequence of scenes depicting the gang being brought together is fun to watch and does a decent job of setting up some of their individual backstory. But these backstories, while serving the purpose of the film, do not give audiences much that seems very exciting except for maybe Tarr's bank heist. <br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh utilizes more than just quick and witty dialogue to advance the plot but also takes advantage of silent storytelling with some scenes containing no dialogue whatsoever. He does this throughout not only this sequence, but various other scenes in the film as well. It's a nice upbeat way to advance the plot and break up major parts of the film.<br/><br/>I have yet to talk about cast and this is one of my favorite aspects of this film. I have always been a fan of both Clooney and Pitt, so seeing them on screen interacting with each other is very cool. Sure, Brad Pitt's character, Rusty, kind of feels like a mat for Ocean's dialogue to bounce of, but it was enjoyable throughout. Most of the other characters don't have scenes that really stick out as fun dialogue or even good interaction except Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict.<br/><br/>Something the film does terribly is the motivation and choices some of these characters make. Oh and the plot holes with the hooker ads somehow getting into the vault out of nowhere. Like what is that!? But back to these motivations/decisions. In what world does it make sense for Tess, who left Ocean because he was a liar, to go back to Ocean? That makes absolutely no sense to me. The better option, the option that should have happened, was for her to realize she's nothing but a trophy to them and leave. Ridiculous like the hooker ads somehow showing up inside the vault. <br/><br/>Overall, I believe this is a solid heist film. Yes, it has a few plot holes but, the character decisions will make you confused, and it has some weird accents but I think it is an enjoyable ride throughout and definitely one I would recommend to someone for some light viewing."

"Leofwine_draca","7","0","2","6 September 2016"," Classy heist thriller with an all-star cast
","An enjoyable enough crime story from golden child Steven Soderbergh, perhaps not achieving classic status but still very amiable to sit through. This remake has many things in its favour, not least in Soderbergh's direction; this is a man with the power to turn the most mundane plot events into fairly gripping, watchable drama. His film looks and feels good, reaching a classy level far above anything most Hollywood directors these days have the capability of achieving. The plot, it has to be said, is fairly clichéd and predictable, but there are one or two surprising twists and a witty script gives to some fine interplay between the characters. Of course, it goes without saying that the star-studded cast is the main reason to sit through this film and enjoy it.<br/><br/>George Clooney heads the bill as Danny Ocean, a suave and snappily-dressed criminal who devises the perfect robbery. The more I see of Clooney, the more I like him; in fact he may be one of the only stars in Hollywood today to recall the charm and charisma of the old school actors like Cary Grant and Clark Gable. Combining dashing looks with strong acting methods, Clooney is a real gem of an actor and it's astonishing that he began in television when his forte is so obviously the cinema. Not that I want to sound sycophantic, but Clooney is one of the good guys. His foil is none other than Andy Garcia, who seems to have been off our screens for a decade, so who now looks suddenly a heck of a lot older than he used to. Garcia crafts a cold, cold character for his casino owner, Terry Benedict, combining smoothness with menace with barely uttering a word.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt has a supporting role as Clooney's accomplice and is, well, Brad Pitt. He doesn't have a lot to do but he seems to be enjoying himself. Julia Roberts is the conventional love interest but I have already expressed my dislike of the actress elsewhere so I'll leave it at that. With so much of the screen time devoted to many different characters and actions, not many of the other actors get much of a look in and instead appear to be along for the ride, adding ""name value"" to the poster. Matt Damon barely registers as the young, smart pickpocket; Casey Afflect and Scott Caan provide dubious comic relief; Elliott Gould has aged in an astonishing way so this distracts from his acting. Congratulations to Carl Reiner, putting in a tour-de-force acting performance in a very small part. Watch out for Joshua Jackson as a card shark and Don Cheadle, whose character appears to have been influenced by Dick Van Dyke in MARY POPPINS. OCEAN'S ELEVEN is a pure popcorn movie, but at least it credits the audience with some taste, intelligence, and refinery, unlike most big bucks blockbusters these days."

","Some films have this uncanny knack to be great from the very start and for ever. They were fresh, funny and cool at first, they remain great all years throughout. Soderbergh made this brilliant masterpiece back in 2001, and even now this movie is watched with a real pleasure, as it goes on with a gusto, excellent tempo, mesmerizing music and impeccable sense of humor. This is a remake that is way better than its Frank Sinatra original. Here, the shining cast of excellent stars make this film a real treat and a real chef-d'ouevre to digest at any time. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, among many, made this film such a tremendous trip. The soundtrack is a huge winner, too, with all that cool jazz, dance tunes, Presley's hits and lounge tracks, adding much to the seemingly nonchalant and brisk beat of the movie. The suits, the sets, the stunts are all jaw- dropping. Beautiful, lovely film that already stood the test of almost 15 years and will stay so for sure. Highly recommended."

","A comical heist. Eleven experts unite to execute a master heist plan. They perform their execution through a series of comedies and twists. Throughout the movie, you will feel excited enough to watch what happens at the end. George Clooney, Brad Pitt have delivered outstanding performances. Clooney in the role of a wife separated lover, who tries to re unite with her and perform a heist at the same time, is marvelous. Pitt as a loyal friend is also good. Julia Roberts as the wife, who loves her husband but is not ready to forgive him, is also stupendous. The twists in the movie are lovely and the whole plot and movie is very dynamic and static.

It doesn't take long for him to get back to his favorite city, Las Vegas. He meets with his accomplice, Rusty Ryan (Pitt), and lays his plan out on the table. There is a vault that holds the money for three casinos, the Bellagio, the Mirage, and the MGM Grand, and he wants to take all of it. Both Ocean and Ryan agree that they'll need not only a well-executed plan, but also a heist crew that is as crazy as they are. After putting together a group of 11 men, they get set for the biggest heist on a Las Vegas vault in history, and the craziness, suspense, and humor ensues.<br/><br/>In this reincarnation of the Rat Pack classic of the same name, the stars shine brighter than the lights of the city that the story takes place in. With an unprecedented ensemble cast featuring some of the hottest actors of the early 21st century (see above), Ocean's Eleven has had money rolling in based on its poster alone. However, while the casting alone boosts the box office, this film does have great characters, and it's a fun movie to watch. What I loved the most about this movie was the smart, witty humor that occurs throughout, especially within the dialog between Rusty and others. While this film doesn't exactly fit into any Oscar category, and there really is no major life lesson or theme, this movie brings classiness, wit, and style to the big screen with the big stars <br/><br/>I felt like the script included some scenes or lines that really weren't needed, and they didn't add anything positive to the story.

I have watched this movie many times and have enjoyed it every time I watch it, and I usually don't enjoy re-watching movies. I definitely recommend watching this movie at least once.

There are so many characters in this film and they are all fantastic from George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts all of them are great and the chemistry that all the characters have is one of the best parts of the film. The story is okay and is a slightly weak point as it is a bit slow in the beginning and it gets pretty convoluted towards the end which is fine for me but for some people it will be difficult to follow. There are some good storytelling aspects but it isn't near perfection. The script is excellent and the dialogue from each character is cool and witty which really enhances the film and carries the film.

"CinematicInceptions","8","0","1","26 July 2014"," Great crime with excellent character balance.
","For me, an integer is not specific enough to grade a movie. I really would have given this movie an 8.5, but decided to round down since an 8 still brings the overall rating up. This is the best crime movie I have seen as well as the most successful one ever, most likely due to the cast. I think the cast is quite good and embody their characters convincingly (apart from George Clooney, but that's a personal opinion). The thing that really makes this picture stand out, apart from the very well thought out burglary, is the balance of characters. No character is given too little screen time or too small a role in the robbery. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for most movies, even Twelve and Thirteen. Everyone will probably have a character that they love and one that they hate because of their diverse personalities. For me, the only character I didn't really like was Danny Ocean. The Benedict blow-over is perfectly thought out and yet perfectly impossible at the same time. The subplot of Danny, Tess, and Terry Benedict's relationship is emphasized enough to attract viewers that might otherwise not choose to watch the movie, but not too much to turn away people that would have otherwise enjoyed the story. There is a good amount of humor in it, especially from the parts with less famous actors like the Malloy brothers, Livingston, and Basher. The twists are so utterly simple and genius that it's funny how well Benedict falls into a trap that he almost weaves himself. For anyone who likes a good laugh or a good plot, Ocean's Eleven is worth a watch."

","From director Steven Soderbergh and an all-star cast the remake of Ocean's Eleven is a rare cast of remake is considered better then the original. Ocean's Eleven is a very entertaining caper film, filled with twists and turns as we see the plan unfold with both the preparation and the actual heist, centred around a strong performance by George Clooney as he got to use his trademark charm as he lead the film. All the characters have a moment to shine and they have distinctive characteristics. But the real star is Soderbergh who injects a lot of style into the film, using screen swipes, split screens, disjointed timelines and expert camera movements to transition to different scenes. There was even a great scene of flashbacks, shot in the styles of the era. Ocean Eleven's is one of Soderbergh's more mainstream efforts and he made a witty, entertainment heist flick. It is a film that is a great modernisation whilst still keeping a sense of 60s style cool, the clothes to the music.<br/><br/>Yet the less we say about Don Cheadle's atrocious Cockney accent the better."

","George Clooney and Brad Pitt lead a fantastic cast in Ocean's Eleven. The plot is also very interesting and the movie and characters, even though there are a lot of them, develop rather nicely. My favorite character is probably Don Cheadle's though. He plays the role of reckless British explosives nut flawlessly. I thought there were a few plot holes but none that actually affected the critical plot points regarding the heist so they are easily overlooked. I think they could've spent more time on the actual heist/planning process but the movie would've probably been too long if they did.

","I really liked this movie. I've figured out that I love heist movies recently, so my expectations for this were really high. As you know the outcome was me really liking it. It had good characters, a good story line rapped around the heist of the casino, and awesome, intense parts of the movie. It was very enjoyable, but I was starting to doubt it at the beginning...<br/><br/>For almost an hour the movie, was very slow, and I didn't like that. It actually bored me for a while. I understood that it was a buildup to the big casino-robbing scene, but I still thing they could have done it better. Part of the first hour was the main characters getting some people to help them rob the casino. That was of it was a little entertaining, but still kind of boring. At the beginning of the movie, it kind of illustrated why Ocean wanted to rob the casinos, and that was interesting. I'm glad that they did that. But, all in all, the first half of the movie was pretty boring, so the second half really had to make up for that. And... It did.<br/><br/>The second half was pretty much just awesome. Almost all of it was the casino-robbing scene and the scenes where they practiced for it. Even the scenes where they practiced for it were pretty cool and interesting. You figure out why Ocean decides to use those people. And they really do practice for it in those scenes. They make sure they'll get it right. Now for the casino-robbing part. The first about 10 minutes of it were interesting, but I think could have been a little better. At that point I had no idea what the rest of the movie would be like. It could have started to be really bad, but it could have gone to be awesome. It went to be awesome. I loved the casino-robbing scene after the first 10 minutes. Even though the first 10 minutes had some cool tricks that Ocean and his people used to get past things, the rest of it was completely awesome. I loved what they did at the end to finish robbing the casino, but before that...<br/><br/>There were several clever tricks they used, even more clever than the first few tricks, and even some things went wrong. I don't want to talk about the ending too much, but at the end there's one of the coolest and most intense twist at the end that takes brain power to understand. So 8/10 in my rating system means I really liked the movie. I thought it was really good."

","Ocean's Eleven is a remake of a Rat Pack 1960 movie of the same name that starred Frank Sinatra. This movie is just graceful, that is the word. It features one of the greatest ensemble cast that you can find and having them come together for one purpose and one purpose only to take down a casino. And the merging of these talents was well done by Steven Soderbergh, who was the director and cinematographer of the movie.<br/><br/>Daniel Ocean and his crew made robbing a casino look easy, since all you need is some background cash and a crew of different people with unique skills. If you have these people in your back pocket then you, ""the robber"" are game enough to take down anybody.<br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh and Clooney came together with the aim of putting this film together and after the wonderful display of acting from all the cast, let's not forget Julia Robert and Andy Garcia were also in this movie, the movie was well received and led to a trilogy.<br/><br/>The movie is about Danny Ocean (George Clooney), who just got out of jail and the first thing on his mind is to perform the perfect steal. After Danny got out he started to recruit the team members for his heist, they were:<br/><br/>In order of recruitment: 1. George Clooney as Danny Ocean 2. Bernie Mac as Frank Catton 3. Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan 4. lliott Gould as Reuben Tishkoff 5. Casey Affleck as Virgil Malloy 6. Scott Caan as Turk Malloy 7. Eddie Jemison as Livingston Dell 8. Don Cheadle as Basher Tarr 9. Shaobo Qin as ""The Amazing"" Yen 10. Carl Reiner as Saul Bloom 11. Matt Damon as Linus Caldwell<br/><br/>The job looked impossible but Danny believed they could do it, so together they formed the master plan to take on the Bellagio, The Mirage, and the MGM Grand casinos, these casinos were owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia).<br/><br/>There is also a catch to this heist; Danny's Ex-Wife (Julia Roberts) is now going out with Benedict.<br/><br/>This movie was extremely popular and the movie grew from just a fun movie to watch, to having a huge fan base that led to the release of two other Ocean crew movies that also had the same cast from here and featured new popular cast. This movie cost nothing less than $85 million to make, due majorly to the cast, but it made its money back and over in the box office and it stands as the best of all the three in the franchise.<br/><br/>My favorite take from the movie is that 50% of the time when Brad Pitt is on screen he is eating something.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"KineticSeoul","8","0","1","3 March 2013"," Cool, slick and entertaining
","This is a heist movie that is slick, cool and entertaining. And doesn't rely on the grittiness of the heist or the violence. But the clever and intricate way the team works together to pull off the heist. Although some parts don't seem plausible, it doesn't get to the point where it gets dumb and irritating to watch. The movie is directed by Steven Soderbergh which is why some top well known actors and actress at that time decided to be part of this movie. It may seem like it just has top actors and actresses combined to make a movie. But this movie is actually cleverly constructed with each character playing a part and crucial to the story. Well at least for a movie that has over a dozen characters in a time frame of around 2 hours. The team for the heist where they are planning to steal from not 1 but 3 casinos. Is composed of Danny Ocean who is the leader aka The Idea Man. Rusty Ryan aka The Pro or Danny's right hand man played by Brad Pitt. He sort of reminded me of Tyler Durden in this, well Tyler Durden who is trying to steal from casinos and not just fat to make soap out of. And these two are the two cool guys of the bunch. The rookie or the pick pocket guy is played by Matt Damon. And these three are like the main characters of the bunch since they are also the most well known actors on the team. The team is also composed of The Getaway, The Basher, The Bankroll, Eye in the Sky, Inside Man, Grease Man, and The High Roller. And than there is The Target, the man they are trying to steal from who is played by Andy Garcia. He plays a character named Terry Benedict, who runs the three casinos and is very good at what he does. And is one of the main conflict when it comes to pulling off the heist. I think it's kinda cool for a guy that is passionate about his job and there really isn't anything that makes him the bad guy. Besides him appearing and working like a machine. But he has Danny's wife who she is with on her own freewill and that woman is played by Julia Roberts. Yeah she was a popular actress at that time but she just didn't seem to fit this role well. Maybe it's just me since I never really found her attractive. And a really attractive woman was needed for this role and I rarely say this. But some parts I just couldn't buy into because of her. Overall this is a well crafted and slick heist movie that has some cool dialogues and is worth checking out.<br/><br/>8/10"

Why on earth bother, and why did they not employ a real Londoner (cockneys very hard to find now) who would at least be credible? I know this film is over 10 years old and maybe things have improved, but just needed to vent my spleen. The movie is however very watchable and apart from the aforementioned, there are good performances by all<br/><br/>Need another few lines, so only reason watching now this is that we just came back from Las Vegas and spent a happy evening at the Bellagio.

"robybaggio18","8","0","1","14 August 2012"," One of my guilty pleasures
","It is not a masterpiece in general since it is not even close to being a serious movie. Still, it knows what it wants to be and it is wonderfully fine tuned to almost perfection. The plot is fairly simple and entertaining, it is nicely timed (not being a minute too short or too long) and it has a finale that stretches almost half an hour without a moment of boredom. All this makes a solid backbone for the strongest part of this movie - small details and dialogs.<br/><br/>Except for some Tarantino movies, you will hardly find anything modern in Hollywood done which such slick dialogs and chemistry between characters. There are dozens of small and funny attachments which put the icing on the cake and make you a fan or in my case an addict:<br/><br/>1. Rusty and Ocean together on screen 2. Rusty eating in almost every scene. There is (obviously) no need for that, but it is there. And you feel like it is natural that it should be there. 3. Amazing Yen and his conversations with others. 4. The whole joke about Linus (Matt Damon) being a rookie and trying to achieve reputation of Ocean and Rusty (and in real life Clooney and Pitt as a movie star). 5. Small, almost unnoticed comments like when Topher says ""actually, they're both named Bernie"" or ""I'll never forgive you for the thing with the guy in the place"". There are about a hundred of lines like that which people who watch the movie for the first time will not understand, but after several viewings they easily become insider jokes. 6. It's a heist movie and yet there are no dead people and no weapons used. Not to mention no CGI, no massive explosions and no sex on screen. It can be done and it was done. 7. Fictional Lewis vs. Klicko match as a background event, brilliant. At the time they agreed only for this fictional match for the movie, the real fight was arranged months after that. 8. Best advertisement for Las Vegas ever. My trip to Vegas would not be the same without first watching this movie many times."
"martin-rice","7","0","2","28 March 2012"," The original was better
","For me Oceans eleven (there is some spoiler info below) epitomizes my reaction to many modern movies with good directing, good acting, but sub par writing. Either the original was inherently difficult to adapt or it was simply poorly done, because the dialogue is sparse and clichÃ©'d at points. At times they sound like a Dr. Evil parody astounded by the possibility for '1 million' dollars. Pitt is good, as is clooney (although he still hasn't achieved his potential with a really good movie), but Andy Garcia is way too one dimensional and it's not believable that julila roberts would date him, even it just for the money & lifestyle. And even the dimension Garcia has ( the nobody's fool anal tough guy) turns out not to be true, as he lets clooney off easy after it should be clear he is implicated in the heist. And speaking of overdone, don't get me started on the chief financer character. Ocean's eleven attempts to ooze coolness like pulp fiction, but the script just doesn't back it up."

","""Ocean's Eleven"" is packed with a classy ensemble cast, sharp dialog, romance, and robbery. Leading the pack is George Clooney as Danny Ocean who as the movie begins is just released from prison. Being the reformed man that he is, Ocean quickly devises a scheme to rob the 3 biggest casinos in Las Vegas-- the Bellagio, the MGM Grand, and the Mirage.<br/><br/>All of them are owned by Terry Benedict played with icy ruthlessness by Andy Garcia. Also Terry is now with Tess Ocean, Danny's ex-wife. Danny seeks out his point man, gambler, Rusty Ryan (Brad Piit). Rusty and Danny get a financier and begin assembling Ocean's 11. It soon becomes evident to Rusty (Pitt): Is this about the $160 million or Tess? If it were only about the money, ""Ocean's Eleven"" would be an exercise. It is not.<br/><br/>George Clooney is a movie star. His Danny Ocean is slick, smart, and a charmer with an underlying substance-- he's a romantic. Brad Pitt is also at his best as Rusty. Pitt exudes the charisma and cool, and he is also very funny. There is hilarious running gag where Pitt is eating something in almost every scene. Clooney and Pitt together nail the crisp and very lean dialog. Julia Roberts is particularly sullen here which is called for in the role, surprisingly out of character for her. The great supporting cast includes Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, and Carl Reiner, who all have their moments to shine. Soderbergh orchestrates the movie cohesively with great style. I saw a Barbara Walters interview with the cast of ""Oceans Eleven"" where Clooney said that Steven was not making a statement movie with ""Ocean's"". He is correct. What Soderbergh made is a fun and entertaining movie with a very talented cast."
"slokes","8","0","1","22 March 2012"," So Much Fun It Ought To Be A Crime
","Watching George Clooney and Brad Pitt battle it out for smoothest cat in Vegas shouldn't be this much fun to watch. ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a smart, breezy caper comedy that glides along on enough wit and cool, jazzy energy to make you enjoy getting snookered by the pretty boys.<br/><br/>Clooney is Danny Ocean, a con man who just lost four years and his wife to a term of confinement in the New Jersey penal system. Now he wants to get even, with interest. He plans a scam involving himself and ten confederates, including right-hand man Rusty (Pitt), targeting three of Las Vegas's richest casinos in a single evening for a nine-figure haul.<br/><br/>Asked why, Danny shrugs and says it's because ""it's never been tried."" Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack would say otherwise, but this ""Ocean's"" is cooler, funnier, and more suspenseful than theirs. Normally I'd rather watch Frank and Dino than George and Brad, but the latter two made the better film.<br/><br/>Ted Griffin's script and Steven Soderbergh's direction do a lot to sell you on a clever if shaky plot. When Danny asks his wife Tess (Julia Roberts) why she dumped him, she responds with a line that keys in on the way the picture operates: ""You've met too many people like you."" Danny, Rusty, and their merry criminal associates seem to communicate mostly through nods and one-liners, not wasting time explaining things.<br/><br/>""I owe you for that thing with the guy in the place,"" is how one of the Eleven, money man Rueben (Elliott Gould), puts it to Danny. This in-the-know argot works for everyone else, too.<br/><br/>A lot of movies try for the big ensemble cast, but this one finds the right balance between star power and character performances. My favorites: Andy Garcia as a standout bad guy and Carl Reiner as the oldest, most sympathetic member of the Eleven.<br/><br/>While there's not a lot of depth, you hardly mind when what you see and hear gleams and purrs the way ""Ocean's Eleven"" does. ""Eleven"" is both a puzzle picture and a love letter to Vegas at the turn of the 21st century, with its dizzying array of gaudy monstrosities and gyrating dancing girls. The music is a frothy stew of Elvis, Perry Como, Berlin, and Debussy. It pulls you in, and keeps you from thinking too hard until long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>Yet I find ""Ocean's Eleven"" more enjoyable on re-viewings. I say this despite the plot holes in the way things work out. Plot holes or not, ""Ocean's Eleven"" puts care into how it works. You get to actually enjoying how the film sets up its misdirection plays and basks in the impossible smoothness of the lead characters. And the dialogue is hilarious.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS BELOW**<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS Everyone has noted one thing I missed, the stacks of flyers that magically appear inside the vault. But about Danny spending all that time being ""beaten up"" in that guarded room, especially when the lights go out? Aren't there too many witnesses to trace Danny and the others to the scam? And what about the mini-scam played on young Linus (Matt Damon), when he is told Danny has been taken out of the operation, only to be surprised when Danny greets him inside an elevator? Why pull that on your youngest, least experienced team member? Well, it was a fun reveal, and I guess that was the point. SPOILERS END ***"
"knucklebreather","9","0","1","26 December 2011"," A real winner
","2001 was unusually awash in heist movies. Ever a popular genre, 2001's crop included one with top box office draws (Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell in the horrible ""3000 Miles to Graceland""), a pairing of two cinema legends (Robert de Niro and Marlin Brando in ""The Score"") and acclaimed writer David Mamet's take on the genre (a film simply called ""Heist"").<br/><br/>With all of this competition, perhaps the least likely candidate to yield a memorable film was ""Ocean's 11"", which was a remake of a long-forgotten rat pack movie directed by the hit-or-miss Steven Soderbergh with a cast (other than Elliott Gould) better known for their looks and celebrity than their acting chops at the time.<br/><br/>Movies are often more than the sum of their parts, and ""Ocean's 11"" is not just the clear winner of the crowded 2001 class of heist movies, but one of the greats of the genre. With a jazzy soundtrack that literally hits all the right notes for a hip, sleek movie, ""Ocean's 11"" is shot much in the style of then-recent movies like ""Casino"" and ""Boogie Nights"" with a rolling, non-stop story set to a great soundtrack that keeps presenting you with interesting new things and never making you sit through a tedious scene.<br/><br/>The story is wonderfully simple, and gets around the basic problems of the heist genre (revealing too much too soon about how the climactic heist is going to work) in a fun way that isn't heavy-handed. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) recruits a crew of odd but talented criminals, each with their own specialty, for an unprecedented robbery of three Las Vegas casinos. And, as the gang is surprised to find out, this may be as much about getting back Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts), who is married to the ruthless and ice-cold owner of the casinos in question.<br/><br/>No one is going to confuse this with a serious movie about criminality, this plan would no more work in the real world than the idiotic one in ""3000 Miles to Graceland""), but the charm of ""Ocean's 11"" is that it's so sleek and fun with its great music, frenzied pacing and larger-than-life characters that you don't really even care about the deviations from reality.<br/><br/>Forget the sequels and the other heist movies of 2001, ""Ocean's 11"" is the only winner here."
"erfrosen","Null","0","1","30 October 2011"," Great Film!
","The movie Ocean's 11 is a riveting film supported by a star-studded cast and a complex plot line. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon are all actors with impressive resumes who truly know and understand the art of acting. They transform themselves fully into their characters and leave no trace of past roles. Adding to cast's slew of celebrities is Julia Roberts, whose role as Danny Ocean's (Clooney) ex-wife is acute yet powerful. Every time she enters a scene she manages to dominate it and leave a lasting mark with her soft-spoken, deep voice. The cast alone is justification to watch the film, since it is hard to imagine a bad movie with such incredible actors. The names provide an instant attraction and reason to watch and the plot and script provide a reason to enjoy the thrill. This movie takes you on an exciting adventure of an effort to rob one man's casinos in order to earn money and love. The writers George Clayton Johnson and Jack Golden Russell come up with twists and turns for every heart-stopping sequence leaving no question unanswered by the time the film is done.<br/><br/>The Ocean's Eleven version that I chose to watch is the remake of a 1960 film starring Frank Sinatra. The plot was very similar, with the leader being Danny Ocean, and although they robbed five casinos instead of three and the names were different, overall the basis is very similar. It is really interesting to watch a film that's a remake especially when the ideas are from so long ago. The technology was so different in 2001 compared to 1960, and since technology is a key aspect to the plan of the heist I can only imagine how difficult it must have to been to rewrite a script with the modern terms and ideas incorporated, I'm sure it changed a lot of the movie, however they still very much relate and have the same foundation. <br/><br/>The plot is set up by the divorce of Danny (Clooney) and Tess (Roberts) Ocean. Danny is a con-artist with a history of failing his wife. Once they're divorced she meets the owner of several hotel casinos in Las Vegas, Terry Benedict. Danny is finally released after his serving his prison sentence and his jealousy gets the best of him as he decides to go after Benedict. However, his plan wasn't to beat him up or slash his tires. Instead, the revenge was to rob his three Las Vegas hotel-casinos for 163 million dollars. He recruited a team of friends who were in the same ""business"" as him and all had very exact specialties to contribute to the project. Near the beginning of the movie the viewer gets to know each team member, as the viewer travels to where they each live and observe them in their day-to-day activities. They have a specialist who can fold himself up small enough to fit in a steel restaurant box, a computer hacking specialist, and a couple elder gentlemen who have been around the block and know how to play the game. The whole process of robbing the hotel is pretty unrealistic. I could never even come up with the ideas that are used and especially would never guess the twist at the end. The whole movie builds up to a scene near the end, where it is fully revealed how they completed the robbery. I found it mind-blowing and that ending scene really completes the movie by summing it all up.<br/><br/>Throughout the whole movie the viewer feels as though they're in the dark on some matters. It seems like the plot is always one step ahead of what you may be thinking and that there is no way to catch up. They always have a plan coming and the viewer is left to struggle along as though a car is dragging them attached to a rope through loopholes and bumps in the road. While this may sound unpleasant, I would caution potential viewers to give it a chance and survive the frustration, because it is very rewarding. The feeling of mystery makes your heart pound in a thrilling way and creates a completely new genre for films with very few members. The first time through it is definitely more confusing then necessary, but watching it multiple times increases the clarity and comprehension.<br/><br/>The clothing selections in the film make the viewer feel like a fly on the wall at a classy, upscale party. Aside from his brief stint in prison, Ocean is never seen without a crisp, expensive black suit and his cohorts are all in suits and ties. Since the heist takes place the night of a big boxing fight, the women are in long ball gowns and men in suits and tuxedos. The clothing takes away any notion of grunge that could be associated with con artist and thieves and replaces it with a look of intelligence that almost commands respect. The suaveness makes the viewer like Ocean and feel badly for him that his wife left him, even though it was completely his fault. <br/><br/>The casino look is completed with the high rollers in tuxes, the dealers in shiny red and gold, and the other gamblers in tacky trying-to-impress clothing. Outfits are even used as disguises throughout whether it's as a casino board member, a hotel staff, or a S.W.A.T team member. It's clear that the costumes were carefully chosen in order to convey the feeling of class.<br/><br/>In this film, the costumes make the setting and set the mood for the film rather than the other way around. They could be in a slimy basement crawling with bugs, but dressed in their suave attire and slick hair, it would look like the Plaza. The mood is created by the costumes as well, since they look like respectable men who are almost too intelligent."

How could you not like a movie with George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, and Don Cheadle? It is obvious the actors had fun with this and so did I to a certain extent. The film is a remake of a 1960 Frank Sinatra vehicle and it appears that director Steven Soderbergh may have even improved off of it.

","The movie Ocean's Eleven is an exciting yet thrilling movie. This movie begins with George Clooney's character, Danny Ocean, in front of a parole board answering questions that will eventually lead to his release. As soon as he is released he heads out to Las Vegas to put his plan to rob three casinos of $150 million in action. The three casinos are the Bellagio, MGM Grand, and the Mirage. All of these casinos are owned by Terry Benedict, played by Andy Garcia. He first meets up with Bernie Mac's character, Frank Catton and Brad Pitt's character, Rusty Ryan to unveil this unthinkable plan. Eventually Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan recruit a total 11 people to pull of this huge heist. Each person is assigned a specific task to do and they practice thoroughly. Most of this movie shows them preparing and rehearsing. Danny Ocean's ex-wife Tess, played by Julia Roberts, is dating the owner of all three casinos. Danny Ocean is upset and wants his ex-wife back. Rusty Ryan figures out the driving force of this heist is that Danny Ocean wants to rob Terry Benedict to get back at him for dating Tess. Tess reiterates to Danny that the reason that they are no longer together is because he is a liar and a cheat. All of Terry's casinos are monitored with cameras. Terry likes to have his eyes on everything. The day finally arrives and they pull of the heist successfully. Toward the end of the movie, Terry and Danny are discussing the robbery after Terry had his security guards detain Danny to ask him if he had any part in the heist. Danny implies that he might be able to get information from one of his prison buddies. Danny asks Terry if he would want the money or Tess and Terry replied that he wanted the money. This encounter is taped and showed to Tess, so she could see exactly what type of man he is. Danny is thrown back in jail for violating his probation. When Danny is released for the second time Rusty and Tess are there to greet him. I believe that the theme of this film is that people want what they can't have and will go to different extremes to achieve this, no matter what it takes.<br/><br/>I think the transitioning from one scene to the next was exceptionally done. I believe that the movie flowed smoothly. This movie keeps you interested and able to pay attention. I think the director did great job with the plot. Although the end I thought could have been more detailed. I felt like it left out some important details that could help to imagine the ending. I think this ending leaves a few questions.<br/><br/>One film that is comparable to this movie is the Italian Job. In this movie, the thieves plan to pull off the perfect heist by creating the biggest ever traffic jam. Both of these movies share the same theme as The lighting in this movie I believe was natural, but some scenes were dark and gloomy. For Instance at the beginning of the movie when he is in front of the parole board the lighting seems to be dark and gloomy. As he is released from prison you see the natural lighting from the outside. This brightens up this scene. One motif in this film is the dice. The dice represent the gambling in the casinos. This is a perfect example as the heist takes place in a casino.<br/><br/>I believe that this movie was written and directed perfectly. This movie kept you interested and wanted to continue watching to see what happens in the end. I would definitely recommend watching this movie. In this movie these gangsters pull off the perfect heist to steal the money that was not rightfully theirs. They came up with the perfect plan and got away with it."

George Clooney is Danny Ocean, a thief that is released from prison on parole at the beginning of the film. He proceeds to break the terms of his parole by not only leaving New Jersey, but also by gathering a group of known felons in preparation for a very large heist. One of the first to be recruited is Rusty Ryan, who is played by Brad Pitt. Danny informs Rusty that the target of the heist is the safe room for three casinos that are owned by Terry Benedict, who is played by Andy Garcia. Rusty, knowing Terry to be a very powerful and ruthless man, reluctantly agrees to help Danny plan the heist, as well as recruit the remainder of the necessary crew. Being aware that Terry's casinos and safe room have the most sophisticated security measures of any on Earth, they know that the best crew along with a large sum of financing must be obtained. After going to great lengths to get the crew and money, Rusty discovers that there is one additional complication: Tess, Danny's ex-wife who is played by Julia Roberts, is with Terry Benedict, and Danny is aware of this. <br/><br/>The complex and messy setup develops into a churning plot, in which the best thieves in the world go up against the best casino security to have ever existed. Aside from all of the adventure and action, the film shows that the elements of humanity exist in even career criminals: friendships, enemies, loyalties, and love. Regardless of whether or not this notion is to be taken seriously, it is necessary to establish characters with which the audience can relate, in order to make a relatively lighthearted movie about a heist.<br/><br/>During the scene that Rusty confronts Danny about Tess being with Terry Benedict, the audience gets the feeling that Danny has deeply violated an unwritten code of honesty among thieves by not admitting this fact during the recruitment phase. Rusty appears to be sincerely distraught over the fact that Danny would keep this fact from him. In another scene, Danny and Rusty prevent Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle) from being arrested after a botched team theft. Basher nearly being arrested results from incompetence on the part of one of Basher's other team members. When he is asked to join Danny and Rusty, Basher indicates how exited he is to be working with a professional criminal element. Both scenes illustrate the human qualities that help to endear film characters to a movie audience. A similar method is used in the film Lucky Number Slevin. In this film, Bruce Willis secretly raises a young boy that he was contracted to kill. In this manner, the audience is able to attach some respect to those who would otherwise be despicable.<br/><br/>A great deal of the film is also focused on the plot. Being a heist movie, the pace at times was necessarily quick. This was accomplished by the effective use of jump cuts. Particularly, when the crew was being established, the jump cut was a primary element. Danny and Rusty would have a conversation about a certain thief, and then the film would cut to one of them approaching that particular thief. Also helping to keep the plot interesting was the use of parallel cuts. Parallel cuts definitely helped in the exposition that occurred in the final portion of the film. It was during this time that expository narration was also used. Parallel cuts and expository narration make for a very interesting scene combination in this film. The elements of humanity that are attributed to the characters, along with the cinematography and plot, make for an excellent manner in which to introduce a lighthearted tone into the film."

","Three casinos. One hundred and fifty million dollars (the stakes, not the film's budgetbut you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise) and just under a dozen of modern cinema's most capable and recognised stars combining to create I daresay the greatest heist movie of all time. As Jake LaMotta once said: 'That's entertainment.'<br/><br/>Hit-and-miss director Steven Soderbergh assembles George Clooney and Brad Pitt, who in turn assemble Damon, Gould, Mac, Qin, Reiner, Jemison, Cheadle, Affleck (the good one) and Caan (the young one); a crack team of thieves and con-artists poised to rob Terry Benedict (Garcia) of his wealth and, if all goes well, his girlfriend (Roberts).<br/><br/>There is a lot to like about this film from an artistic perspective. The cinematography is always slick and co-ordinated beautifully with the required speedy pace. This is particularly impressive upon a second viewing. Because of how few individual shots were actually used in this film compared to most other contemporary efforts, one has to admire the skill in direction; being able to convey so much activity in so few shots without leaving the film feeling sluggish is a real credit to the production team.<br/><br/>While dynamic filmmaking from behind the lens is part of the reason for how well Ocean's Eleven engages its audience, it is the actors that set the tone perfectly. Heavy-hitters like Damon and Garcia are persistenly in control of every scene, and are complimented by some above-average performances from the rest of the cast. <br/><br/>But it is the fantastic interplay between Clooney and Pitt that makes the movie. Accommodated by an offbeat script that plays towards these two actors more than any others in the film, they inject a believable 'buddy-comedy' undertone, which doesn't feel at all out of place, probably because the movie refuses to take itself seriously. Rather than trying to convince us that to steal money from a casino in this way is actually possible, Soderbergh positively lets the mechanics fall by the wayside and instead puts his primary focus on pure entertainment.<br/><br/>As a rule of thumb, the ending of a heist film does not have to be its strength, as knowledgeable audiences are content to have simply gone along for the ride, and whatever ending the film throws together to justify the series of events will usually suffice. For Ocean's Eleven, this is where a refreshing point of difference lies. A twist ending of sorts, the conclusion is altogether satisfying, unique, and has clearly been well thought-out, so as to avoid a minefield of potential plot holes.<br/><br/>This film is as much about the essence of Vegas and excess as it is about a crime syndicate. A sexy soundtrack (the kind of music you expect to hear in the Hard Rock Hotel foyer), fun references to other genre-moulding crime films (including The Godfather and Sinatra's original Ocean's Eleven), expansive shots of The Strip's skyline and cameos galore make the film utterly enjoyable in the plainest sense of the word. <br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

"cbsports04","9","0","1","29 August 2010"," Ocean's Eleven
","This is one of my all-time favorite movies for many different reasons. To start off, I believe that this movie was cast very well. The actors that are in it know what they are doing and make this movie great because of the way they all interact with one another. This movie also flows really well, while keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout. One of my favorite parts about the movie is how they chose to bring in each character in their own unique way. Even though there are no particular scenes that really blow you away, the end result is exceptionally great. This movie gets better every time i watch it.<br/><br/>There are not many things about this movie that i did not like. I guess one thing that their could have been more of is action. This movie has it's moments, but overall is not action filled. And even though the actors performances are really good I think that the relationship between some of the main characters could have been a little more defined. <br/><br/>At first I am not really sure why, but this movie makes me think of the movie by the name of ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"". Both these movies have very good actors and are scripted in a way audiences enjoy. I really like the way both movies bring in each character and explains that character's role in the overall scheme of things. ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" did a better job at defining the character's relationships with each other, and also involved a little more action but that's to be expected from a movie that involves stealing cars not bankrupting a casino. Ocean's Eleven,overall, is a great film and I would highly advise anyone who has not seen it to go watch it right now."

","I haven't seen the 1960 film for a while, and plan to re watch it shortly. But I will say I did enjoy very much this film. True, there are a lot of characters so sometimes the film feels shallow, and sometimes the pacing is a tad too pedestrian. But there are a number of things that made it a slick and well done film. First, the direction was excellent. Steven Soderbergh is a talented director, and he direction is super efficient. The plot is good, about Danny Ocean and his ten accomplices planning to rob three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously. The soundtrack is cool, the cinematography is professional and the script is witty. But it is the stellar performances that make the film. George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Elliot Gould and Bernie Mac all give fun performances, elevating what could've been a predictable and unoriginal film into a quite enjoyable one. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"jrlhlme","8","0","2","4 December 2009"," One of the best in the genre
","Oceans eleven is one of the more clever movies I've seen. The plot is fairly standard for the heist genre, just a bunch of gentleman thieves robbing a bad guy. Nothing spectacular. But the real strength in this movie lies in its characters. The chemistry between them is brilliantly executed; the highlight being the George Clooney-Brad Pitt interaction (I actually believe that this is one of their best performances). <br/><br/>Although the plot itself isn't all that interesting, it's enjoyable thanks to the fact that we have no idea how George Clooney and his ten rascals will pull it of, and when you figure out what they had in mind, you'll love it. Without spoiling anything, it'll leave you satisfied. To sum it up, this is a step forward for the genre, and a fresh take on how characters can interact with each other. A must see."

","I truly do love 2001's somewhat remake to Ocean's eleven. Ocean's eleven is directed by Steven Sodeburgh(Out of Sight, Che)and I can see how. Sodeburgh is a good director, and he directed the whole trilogy. The film has a great cast including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Bernie Mac, and others. Just to name a few. The film has a great heist also. These people are way too smart for me. I never could've thought of a heist plan like the one Danny Ocean's group came up with. The heist is brilliant in this film, and it's pretty surprising. Ocean's eleven is great, fun entertainment.<br/><br/>The Plot: When Danny Ocean is released from prison, he hires ten people to rob from Terry Benedict, who owns The Belagio, and The MGM Grand. Danny also finds out that his ex wife Tess is engaged to Bennedict. So the gang isn't sure whether Danny is trying to rob this guy because of his wife or not."

","I'm aware that it is a remake of an earlier film but as I've not seen that I can't say if it is as good or not. This is a fun caper film with a star cast who all appear to be having a great time, that isn't to say that they don't do a good job however.<br/><br/>The film opens with Danny Ocean, played by George Clooney, being released from prison. He has no plans of going straight though, he has a job planned, a big job that will require a large team of expert criminals. The job in question is robbing a Las Vegas casino, something considered impossible by most people but he thinks he has found away.<br/><br/>The early part of the film concentrates on recruiting the team and their preparations for the job itself, when they start their on site preparations it becomes clear that money isn't Danny's only motivation for robbing this particular casino; its owner is going out with his ex-wife. The robbery itself is pretty exciting even though the viewer is never in much doubt that nothing bad will happen to our anti-heroes, after all it is a fun film not a gritty drama.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this to anybody wanting to watch a fun will that doesn't contain lots of violence, it might not be all that realistic but if you can suspend your disbelief it is a well made, well acted caper film."

","Ocean's Eleven brings a new look to the gentleman thief genre. Instead of one individual seeking fortune for themselves, it is a sophisticated clique of masterminds trying to pull off a million to one heist with a huge payoff. The film features an all star cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon. Each thief in ""Ocean's 11"" plays a major role in the heist and puts forth their particular area of expertise. It keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat and just when you think you have a bead on what's going to happen next, the film throws a curve ball twist right past you. My favorite aspect of this film is how calm and cool everyone of the 11 seems in the face of the consequence of being caught. If you're a fan of con-artist films such as The Sting, I highly recommend Ocean's 11."

","The first film of the Ocean saga, trilogy, so far, The first one is the prototype and prototype it is. One simple situation. A casino in Las Vegas. A complicated security set up but nothing impregnable because impregnable is not in Hollywood's dictionary. A whole set of gangsters led by Brad, Matt and George, and enjoying themselves very much. Of course they succeed with a little bit of high tech. And they stage the whole thing for the casino entrepreneur who falls in the trap of what he sees on his video cameras and on his surveillance screens and then he finds out he has been tricked and that the bill of the trick is something around 163 million dollars, maybe less, maybe more, who knows, but sure more than the trick his female, or male, employees are selling to the hotel and casino customers. It is apparently easy to lure this business gangster or this gangster businessman: flatter his vain and arrogant ego by flattering his security because he believes he has the best security in the world, and then you can go through. Apart from that tricky complicated situation, the film is very simple, if not ordinary. But after all it is only a matrix: it has to remain simple to breed good sequels, and this one bred two sequels. Good entertainment, for the actors too I guess.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"

","One's attention is immediately drawn to this movie for its many famous stars such as George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts. It is a bit odd storyline from the beginning that Daniel Ocean, played by George Clooney, risked robbing the casino for love and revenge. However, I liked how they planned the whole thing out carefully and how the movie proceeded speedy. I liked the part when Rusty, played by Brad Pitt, calls Terry Benedict, played by Andy Garcia, and tells him that they are robbing his casino. And yet, Benedict wasn't able to get anything, neither the money nor his woman. Also, I liked how it let Tess, played by Julia Roberts, know Benedict preferred money to her. I thought it would have been better if the casino heist weren't so perfectly planned and that there were some critical moments or tensions. Though I now know there is a sequel of this movie, ""Ocean's Twelve"", when I first watched this movie I predicted that there would be another one. Because at the end two of Benedict's staffs follow where Ocean and Rusty were going. All-in-all this was a hilarious and well-acted movie overall."
"Mariano_Anderson","Null","0","2","18 September 2008"," What Happens in Vegas...
","Ocean's Eleven is a fun heist movie blessed with an A-list cast who defines cool in our current generation of actors, a funny, intricate (kinda convoluted) script and a director who knew what he was doing and was having a blast doing it. This is a remake of the pretty dull 1960s Las Vegas heist movie of the same title starring Frank Sinatra and the rest of the Rat Pack. I've seen both films and I must say that this is one of those rare exceptions where the remake improves on the original. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is an ex-con newly released from prison who immediately jumps back into the shady life. He already has a larcenous scheme in mind and enlists his old right-hand man Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) to help him recruit a thieving crew. Oh and what a crew: Matt Damon as the rookie, quick-fingered and well versed in pickpocketing; Bernie Mac as the inside man; Don Cheadle, the explosives expert, comes armed with a great Cockney accent and that weird Cockney way of rhyming (""We're in Barney""; Clooney makes a nonplussed gesture; ""Barney Rubble - Trouble!""); old-school Carl Reiner plays the old con-man out for a last con; Casey Affleck is the nerdy computer/surveillance technoman; etc. Ocean and company target the super-protected vault underneath the Bellagio casino. This vault stores money for three casinos: the Bellagio itself, as well as the MGM Grand and the Mirage. Apparently, on weekend nights of big boxing events, the vault by law has to house at least $150 million to cover all bets. The man who owns the Bellagio is Terry Benedict (played with smooth, reptilian menace by Andy Garcia), who is also the current love of Ocean's ex Tess (a radiant Julia Roberts). Hmmm, you start to think. Ocean's motivations are not the only thing that'll keep the viewer guessing in this funny, fast-paced, twisty film. The director Steven Soderbergh skillfully plays fast and loose with flashbacks, dizzying, continuing pan shots and sleight-of-hand camera-work. There is plenty of false jeopardy played out in the course of this movie, numerous plot reversals. Don't take anything for granted until the end credits come up. Steven Soderbergh directs this remake with such a light touch that it seems as if all he's done is throw all these high-profiled mega-stars in the same room and direct them, with perhaps a nonchalant wave of a hand, to simply wing it. The performers deliver their lines convincingly and with panache. They are, after all, all damn good actors (check out the DVD actor commentary with Damon, Pitt and Garcia, who have a chuckle over the talented serious actor Don Cheadle, who delivers his lines while covered in poo). I had a sense that everyone involved genuinely liked each other and had a great time bouncing off each other in their scenes. Clooney and Pitt, in particular, seem to have great buddy rapport together, whilst romantically, Clooney and Roberts sizzle. Andy Garcia is a great villain, suave yet intense, worthy of going up against eleven crafty adversaries. Soderbergh does a masterful juggling act in this one: ensuring that everyone in the film gets his/her day to shine, managing to stage every scene so that every shot is interesting and keeping the topsy-turvy plot on point. Kudos, too, to the music, which works to great effect and greatly influences the mood of every stage of the film (I thought actually purchased the soundtrack). Great job by everyone involved."

","People may complain about the OCean's films from time to time but the fact of the matter is this: an Ocean's movie just makes you want to commit a crime. The appearance of these suave and debonair guys just makes you want to knock over a casino. Danny Ocean, Rusty, Linus, and the gang all have that certain panache. I can't help but feel the energy in this movie, the excitement and the humor.<br/><br/>The main cast is great to begin with: everyone from Andy Garcia (who gives one of the best frowns in movies) to Matt Damon (who can still pull off wide-eyed innocence while stealing from a California science lab). But the minor cast members also do a great job. Elliot Gould gives the sarcastic Reuben a life of his own with his dealings with young Linus and his conversations with Danny and Rusty. Don Cheadle brings the Aussie to the indomitable Basher. And Bernie Mac makes racist misunderstandings a joy to see.<br/><br/>Ocean's Eleven not only captures you with a great American story, but it also creates subtle nuances for you to watch and rewatch in order to really appreciate the intricacies of the plot. And cameos from other notable stars help to make the film a basket of Easter Eggs. From Topher Grace's poker game with the stars to Wayne Newton sitting at the ringside of the ""big fight,"" the film is magic.

","For some reason, I never tire of seeing this film. It's not an academy-award winner, it doesn't make a statement about the human condition, and it certainly doesn't reference anything remotely truthful about real Vegas casinos. What it does do is simply entertain at a first-rate level for roughly two hours. And it's 100 times better than the original offering from 1960.<br/><br/>In 1960, several of Hollywood's biggest name talent, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop, turned up in Las Vegas to shoot a movie called ""Ocean's Eleven"". They shot the film by day and played the Vegas strip by night. These live acts proved so popular that the group returned to Vegas many times for years after the sets of the film were torn down and the production moved back to Hollywood. The film was about a Vegas heist by some amateur gamblers, but the live act, made up of the legendary ""Rat Pack"", became ever-associated with Vegas. However, the original ""Ocean's Eleven"" does not share the status of the Rat Pack's live offerings of the 1960's. Apparently, while shooting, Frank Sinatra refused to do multiple takes in many scenes as if he was bored with the project, and consequently the final cut of the movie suffered immensely.<br/><br/>Fast-forward 40 years. Stephen Soderbergh, on the heels of ""Traffic"", was given a large budget to remake ""Ocean's Eleven"". The cast is a host of current Hollywood notables, including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Julia Roberts, and George Clooney as Danny Ocean, the character played by Sinatra. Strangely, the original 1960 production seems like a low-budget bad Vegas show when compared to the 2001 version. Not only is the more recent production much slicker and more finely tuned, the acting and the plot are far more compelling. Sort of like comparing the Flamingo Hotel to the Bellagio or the Venetian Room. There's no comparison.<br/><br/>The plot itself is simple enough: Danny Ocean and eleven brilliant but shady characters attempt to enact a heist on one of the major casinos in Vegas. Add to the stew, Tess, played by Julia Roberts, who was previous Ocean's wife but is now hooked with the casino's head-honcho, Terry Benedict, played with mostly cool detachment by Andy Garcia. This is not akin to robbing the Sands Casino when the strip was made up of these little 6-floor casinos where you could get a room for less than 10 bucks. The new version is like trying to rob the MGM Grand where billions of dollars enter the casino every year. The ultimate outcome is an outstanding textbook example of misdirection that is well worth a DVD purchase. It seems unusual today that there are few productions that are both as well-produced AND well-written. Unfortunately, the subsequent sequels do not measure up nearly as well."

","No matter how many times I watch this movie, it never gets old. Steven Soderbergh has remade a classic and updated the style for the twentieth century. The movie centers on freshly-paroled Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his plot to rob three Las Vegas casinos in one night. The movie grabbed me at the first scene and I was entertained until the end. The two components that make this movie what it is are the spectacular cast and the intricate heist plan.<br/><br/>For a movie with thirteen characters, Soderbergh and screenwriter Ted Griffin did a great job of giving each enough screen-time and personality to make them each interesting. Clooney and Brad Pitt are charismatic as usual in their roles as the heist's ringleader and primary accomplice. Andy Garcia is cold and calculating as the owner of the targeted casinos. Though, some of the best performances come out of the supporting cast. A lot of the movie's best scenes feature Bernie Mac, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, and Elliot Gould. Julia Roberts is a bit under-used in her role as Tess, Danny's ex-wife, but makes for a pleasant distraction. Playing just as large a role as any person in this film is the setting, Las Vegas. We are treated to great visuals of Vegas and it gives the movie a grander, flashier vibe.<br/><br/>The heist in this movie is definitely complex, and there are still parts I'm not too clear on. I also felt that they got a little too high-tech during the vault break-in (i.e. the little ""knock-out"" disc and the getaway van). Other than a couple hiccups, the heist was fun to watch build up and come to fruition. Soderbergh did a great job revealing little details throughout that seem insignificant until you see the end result.<br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh's remake of a classic caper makes a great popcorn flick. It's got sharp humor, great performances, and an intelligent design that almost makes you think, ""That just might work..."". There may be a couple plot holes but that never slows the movie down. So, check this out if you haven't already...and keep an eye out for the cocktail waitress that gets clothes-lined during the chaos. It's probably one of the funniest images in the whole thing."

He already has a plan for one of the largest heists in history. He wants to rob the vault the houses the cash for Bellagio, The Mirage and MGM Grand in Las Vegas on a fight night when it'll be flush with $160 million or so in cash. Problem is that casinos are tougher to rob than Fort Knox. And the owner of these properties, played by Andy Garcia, is the type of guy who will ""kill you, then he'll really go to work on you"".<br/><br/>To do the job, they put together a crew of very colorful characters, each with his own specialty such as explosives, electronics, driving, etc... The additional cast members include Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Bernie Mac and Julia Roberts. What follows is a good old fashioned caper flick.<br/><br/>The story for this movie is pretty predictable, and this film had every opportunity to be a mediocre effort. But the director here is Steven Soderberg of Traffic and Erin Brockovich fame. And he used the all star cast and Vegas backdrop to create a very, very, very entertaining film. There are many funny moments in this movie, however a lot of them are subtle and may not be as funny to someone who has never been to Vegas.<br/><br/>There are a few problems with the movie. First off, with so many characters we really do not get to know any of them other than the principles. And although I won't spoil it, I will say the ending is more than a little weak. But there are some laughs, a really strong cast and the movie is very stylish.<br/><br/>It's a real shame we don't get to see much of Matt Damon in this movie. 7/10"

","Ocean's Eleven is a charming, fun-filled heist movie. George Clooney is great as Danny Ocean, a thief who decides to rob three casinos at once with his team of expert criminals. The bank owner (Andy Garcia) is a ruthless man who will stop at nothing to keep his money in his wallet.<br/><br/>Several stars join the fun, including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts. It adds up to a good heist thriller I am glad to have seen...once. As I said, it's creative and entertaining, but it just didn't give me enough to keep me waiting eagerly for the sequel (which turned out to be pretty bad).<br/><br/>I give Ocean's Eleven a 3/4."

","Long before Thirteen and Twelve, there was Ocean's Eleven. A salute to Hollywood's golden era where glamor and glory graced the silver screen, Eleven was a cool breathe of pure cinematic fun when it initially hit theaters during the winter of 2001. Being a remake to a forgotten Rat Pack 1960 release only added more glitter to the story  as director Steven Soderbergh managed to recruit some of Hollywood's finest current talents to this intelligent remake. When you come to think of it, there really isn't that much room for mistake when you have living-legends George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia as your main leads.<br/><br/>If plot is of any importance to you, you'll probably want to know this is about Danny Ocean (Clooney), an ex-con who just got out of a 5 year period behind bars. Determined to make a final heist before he retires from crime (yeah right), Ocean finds the perfect target  a casino owner named Terry Benedict (Garcia) who has his eyes out for Ocean's ex, Tess (Roberts). With the help of his ten newly recruited accomplices (each individual specializes in a different field of theft), he plans the perfect crime  simultaneously robbing three Las Vegas casinos owned by Benedict. The suave gang of criminals soon set their plan in motion, working every little detail leading up to their final move.<br/><br/>The slick and sly group hand out a magnificent performance as they make you realize that sometimes, in certain aspects and circumstances, crime does pay  and with an interest. Kudos go to Soderbergh and his gang for this one, as I truly had a ball watching it, as I'm sure they did making it (btw, the sequel, Ocean's Twelve, is a far inferior predecessor to this film  but the threequel, Ocean's Thirteen saves the prestige of the trilogy)."

","Magnifico!! Bravisimo!! This was a masterfully done movie; well thought out, well organized and well planned. I love it when a good plan comes together, and ""Ocean's Eleven"" was a good plan. So many movies of this type fail because of plot holes, bad directing, bad acting, or a host of other issues. ""Ocean's Eleven"" brought all parts together seamlessly and cohesively, which was amazing considering the grand scale of the theft that took place. Once again, this was a remake of an original I never saw, but it would be hard to believe that the original was much better, if it was better at all. All of the performances were good, which boded well because many star studded line ups tend to disappoint. ""Ocean's Eleven"" certainly didn't disappoint."
"EijnarAmadeus","7","0","1","10 June 2007"," Brilliant remake
","Ocean's Eleven is one of the best remakes ever made. Soderbergh doesn't do one thing wrong in this all spectacular con-movie, the way he sets Las Vegas in flames with great music and great camera-sliding is truly classy. The cast is all amazing, every one from George Clooney to Don Cheadle and Brad Pitt to Bernie Mac and back again. And although Ocean's Eleven doesn't do any surprising jumps or turns, it always stays true to it's message and meaning; entertaining you to the last second. Andy Garcia's super-serious Terry Benedict keeps a firm maturity to a story even a kid could understand, and the Clooney/Pitt cooperation works like childhood buddies just having another laugh robbing millions from three of Las Vegas' most impressive casinos. It's a movie that can truly change the mood of your day, as its bright and jaunty tone will keep you wanting more and more of Ocean's striking eleven."

","This is about the first time I decided to comment anywhere on any movie. But I really find it hard to contain my emotions after what I've just seen. It is particularly difficult given the magnitude of accolades this movie has received. The only question I would like to ask of all those who seem to be in raptures over this pathetic flick is: Are you out of your mind? if you have any, of course. You can call me opinionated or whatever but I don't - just do not remember the last time I was so truly and sincerely bored while watching what is supposed to be a blockbuster of sorts!!!! Boredom, boredom, nothing more but boredom. It so amazingly slow-paced, developments are so uniquely incoherent, and most importantly - you just DO NOT BELIEVE for a split second that anything like this - I mean the plot - is feasible, possible, doable, achievable - add your own synonym. The viewer is obviously taken for a complete, unadulterated fool to give even a particle of credence to this pileup of superbly sophisticated moves coming from an uncatchable and inhumanely ""intelligent"" bunch of pathetic morons. The makers of this movie must have thought that the ""divine"" privilege of seeing Pitt, Cloney, Roberts, Garcia, etc - all in one flick is enough to justify the absolute boredom and unbelievability it conveys. By and large - it is a very poor job which has unfairly earned its high grades - through the presence of the above hotshots - nothing more nothing less. For those of you who would like to enjoy themselves throughout a comical heist movie I would heartily recommend a polish flick: Vabank (1981)(among many others of course). You can trust me - for I'm a Russian and for a Russian to say something good about whatever polish - believe me - it must be reallllll good. And it is indeed. So have a good time watching! You sure will."

","The risky thing about these kind of films is the fact that being remakes of previous versions carrying big-name stars it faces the inevitable comparison. However, the first OCEAN'S ELEVEN wasn't exactly CASABLANCA or CITIZEN KANE. Steven Soderbergh assembles a spectacular cast -- which I don't need to mention since practically everyone who's seen the film knows it will have Soderbergh s usual suspects and some new ones -- but if there is an ultimate star in this, OCEAN'S ELEVEN, it is he. Every shot, every scene, the very construction of the heists that Danny Ocean's pack of sophisticated thieves execute, along with cracking dialog and vintage music creates not only a sizzling reconstruction: it transcends its genres limitations, and it flows elegantly with Soderberghs inimitable stamp, and that is film-making at its best -- the art of creating cinematic jazz."

","Although this film is a remake of the 1960s Ocean's Eleven, and people seem to like originals better, I thought that this was an outstanding remake. My favorite film of all time is Pulp Fiction and this movie is just as witty of a crime plot, and even pretty comical.<br/><br/>Another thing I always love, also like Pulp Fiction and my other favorite film The Departed, is a big ensemble cast. Geogrge Cloony and Brat Pit are astounding as the leaders of the group and every other character, my favorite being Don Cheadle's character ""Basher"", all have there own piece of the puzzle that brings this movie to life with all sorts of personalities and points of view.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie if you've ever watched a robbery in a film and thought ""I wanna do that"", because that's what you'll be thinking after watching this.<br/><br/>ENJOY!"

In fact, i would nearly go as far as to say that its Clooney's best role of his entire career. The look of the movie is fantastic and the great soundtrack also adds a great dimension. The fact that the movie was filmed on location in Las Vegas and in an actual casino made the whole experience seem very realistic.

","The original Ocean's Eleven was a misfire: it was slow, unfunny, and devoid of any sort of entertainment. Surprisingly, Hollywood was able to produce a remake far superior to the original--an extreme rarity. This film owes little to the 1960 film, and that is not a bad thing.<br/><br/>Ocean's Eleven is an example of a stylish, flashy, and cool movie done right. Too often big stars come together to collaborate on an ambitious project only to produce a pile of trash. While that may describe this film's sequel, Ocean's Eleven is anything but of a pile of trash. It's full of wit and humor and style, and for me it is never boring ,even when I know what's going to happen. Think of the possibilities if Hollywood could churn out original ideas with scripts as good as Ocean's Eleven."
"bnymph","9","0","1","22 December 2006"," caper flick with great characters
","I don't _think_ this contains a spoiler, but am playing it safe.<br/><br/>An engrossing, funny caper movie. I saw it in theaters when it came out, and liked it just as much seeing it on cable tonight. The casting is very good, across the board, and it's fairly clear that everyone involved is having a lot of fun (Carl Reiner and Don Cheadle especially). I find that something essential to a caper, or gambit, movie, is that violence is restrained, and con artistry is involved. Also essential is an ensemble cast that works well together. This remake succeeds on both counts. One thing that I find interesting is that many people who comment on this film don't seem to be able to count: Ocean's 11 is Ocean plus the 11 others in his platoon, not 10. Possible spoiler: if you do the math, the booty divided by 11 does not equal the proposed cut. It equals the booty divided by (Ocean+11) ie. 12. Soderbergh plays a LOT of games with the viewer, and you practically have to see it a second time to figure it out -- his tribute to Kubrick. Every member of Ocean's platoon is crucial to the gambit, but they flicker in and out of visibility -- another aspect of great gambit flicks. Some of the 11 do a lot, and others do only small but critical things. Working this out is a big part of the fun of the movie. Trivia: the first Ocean's Eleven was an inspiration for a great reggae classic."

I'm not a huge fan of Clooney, his general image doesn't appeal to me but in this crime dram he pulls off the part of the leading gangster really well.<br/><br/>The story is slow paced to allow viewers to catch all the different ideologies put forth by director Soderbergh. The beginning is extremely dull and never lifts off the floor. Its slow and uninteresting and doesn't appeal to they hype of the film's reputation.<br/><br/>But after the lame beginning and all of the lead characters are involved does it become interesting with many different personalities sharing their views, making it highly engaging.<br/><br/>The ending is really clever, it confused me slightly at first but after I realised what actually happened I loved it.<br/><br/>Its fast and upbeat and extremely well created.

"matlefebvre20","7","0","1","29 July 2006"," The greatest sin of Sin City
","There are some stories which you know from the start that it won't be worth five-star. The only thing you can do is making the best with what you have and hope that it will be worth the try. Caper movies are like that. It's too much unbelievable, high-tech gadgetry is overly used and robbers rarely appear to be real human beings.<br/><br/>""Ocean's Eleven"" is that kind of movie, but the major difference between it and the other heist movies is that it works well, whatever the difficulties might be. Directed by the always excellent Steven Soderbergh and starring Soderbergh's favorite George Clooney as the title role, ""Ocean's Eleven"" is one of the best heist movies since a very long time and I appreciated every bit of it, from the first to the last second.<br/><br/>Released about six months after the disappointing and violence-laden ""3000 Miles to Graceland"", ""Eleven"" only focuses on the complicated and meticulous planning of the robbery and the robbery itself, instead of making it a silly and looking-easy launching element, like in ""3KMTG"". And that's all we need. We don't need an aftermath with stupid inner battles about who's gonna keep the loot and what is gonna happen to the robbers' associations. There's also a surprisingly low amount of violence and there is no gunfight and no car chase, which is well-welcomed in that domain.<br/><br/>In a sense, it's like ""The Score"" from the same year, but on a much larger and more spectacular scale. Instead of two guys stealing a single scepter in a federal building of Montreal, you get eleven guys who try to rob $160,000,000 from three casinos in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>The eleven guys are the following ones: Danny Ocean (George Clooney), a charismatic and professional thief who's leading the operation; Rusty (Brad Pitt), Ocean's loyal right-hand man; Reuben (Elliot Gould), an extravagant casino owner who is also a longtime friend of Danny and Rusty; Virgil and Turk (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan), two very dysfunctional brothers from Utah; Livingston (Eddie Jemison), the electronic specialist; Basher (Don Cheadle), a bomb expert; Yen (Shaobo Kin), a Chinese acrobat; Saul (Carl Reiner), a con artist; Frank (Bernie Mac), a croupier and Linus (Matt Damon), a young pickpocket who becomes the rookie of the gang which makes that he's not aware of the strict rules and codes of the caper game.<br/><br/>That's a very long list of characters. But the casting has some kind of genius. The characters are so different and so good that we never lose ourselves among them. It's not like in ""Platoon"", where the casting is some kind of labyrinth.<br/><br/>When you listen to Ocean describing the vault and all of the obstacles that await the 'Eleven Team', you wonder how they're gonna make it in the most realistic way possible. Well, the screenplay is so well crafted that it can only make the viewer satisfied. Screenwriters include plot twists and safe-cracking elements without losing themselves in the complex storyline. And some scenes are so surprising that they're funny. Not ridiculous. Funny.<br/><br/>The boxing championship tournament is an excellent background and it's good to see Lennox Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko marching pass the crowd in the MGM Grand arena. The way that Soderbergh pictures the scenes give some grandeur to this event, which is not something that every filmmaker do.<br/><br/>Anyway, every Vegas spot is well shot and it makes you see that Sin City is not an ordinary America town. The crowds' reactions to the provoked black-out are eye-catching and brilliant. The final 'Team' scenes near the Bellaggio fountains are gorgeous and beautiful. So, all in all, every shot is well done...<br/><br/>George Clooney is good as Danny Ocean. He's as cool and charismatic as he looks, but he ends up getting too much Mr. I-know-all for me. But every character does the adequate job. Julia Roberts' performance is very mixed, but when she's good, she's good for real. Her relationship with Terry Benedict, the casino owner played by Andy Garcia, is not very convincing, but her loyalty for Danny Ocean is quite good.<br/><br/>Directed on a very epic scale with an incredible list of A-rated Hollywood actors, ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a real success, from the very first scenes to the very last scenes. No less, no more. It's a pure delight."

","From director Steven Soderbergh (Out of Sight, Erin Brockovich, Traffic), I only found out this was a remake some years later, but it is not the same film at all, and I'm glad I watched it again. Basically Danny Ocean (George Clooney) has just been released from his New Jersey prison having served his time for robbery, but he is already planning his next heist with his partner in crime, card master Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt). They get some funding and advice from Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), as they plan to steal from three big Las Vegas casinos, The Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand, all belonging to ruthless entrepreneur Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). The stealing isn't just for the millions of dollars, Danny also wants a little revenge for Benedict having an interest and seemingly taking away his beautiful ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts). So Danny and Ryan gather together a team of eight other master minds to carry out the job: pickpocket Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon), explosives mind Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle), Malloy brothers Virgil (Casey Affleck) and Turk (Scott Caan) are drivers, card dealer Frank Catton (Bernie Mac) as watch, retired Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) playing cards and living in the hotel, Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison) placing bugs, and Chinese acrobat artist Yen (Qin Shaobo) using his skills to turn off alarms. Using sophisticated technology, an identical built safe as simulation and a camera trick, disguises, gymnastics, cons, double crossing and blackmail, they pull off the robbery and steal the millions, and in the end Danny seems to get Tess back. Also starring Lennox Lewis, Henry Silva, Angie Dickinson, Steve Lawrence, Wayne Newton, Joshua Jackson and Shane West. Clooney is cool and calm, Pitt is good looking and suave, Damon is nervy but reliable, Garcia is aggressive, Roberts is innocent and beautiful, and the supporting all star cast members get their time too, with a witty sharp quick-fire script and one or two exciting and engaging set pieces, it is watchable action crime caper. George Clooney was number 72, and Brad Pitt number 15 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Clooney was number 7, and Pitt number 5 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and Pitt was number 30 on The World's Greatest Actor.

Great film.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about this film is that it is so cleverly written. It never bores you and allows you to live the fantasy of pulling the biggest steal in history. To think that they are actually going to do what they do in the movie is just outrageous, but they make you believe it is so possible. Brad Pitt and George Clooney make that happen.

","I finally got to see this, after hearing so much positive stuff about it. People were raving about how it was the definition of cool. I believe someone even told me that it rivaled the likes of a Tarantino film. Well, having seen it, I can say that it's definitely got a lot less style than a Tarantino film, and none of the associated substance. It's basically an empty shell, albeit a pretty-looking one. The film has plenty of acting talent, but not even half of it is put to any use. There are just far too many characters, so many of them spend the better part of the film, following their initial introduction, sitting around, not really doing anything at all. Maybe the film should have been Ocean's Five instead... so we actually got some semi-interesting and well-developed characters instead of these cardboard cutouts spouting hip lines every chance they get. The dialog is witty and at times clever, but it's almost entirely superficial. The plot is decent. Another thing is that there's not really anyone to root for; it's a film about dishonest criminals stealing from other dishonest criminals. The pacing is OK. I found the film to be far too long and drawn-out. It could easily have been cut by at least half an hour. Once again, we don't care about these people. Submit any viewer of this movie to a lie detector test and ask if they saw this for the heist or for the characters. If anything less than 90% prove to have seen it entirely for the heist, I'll be very surprised. Then there's all the unneeded scenes, probably done to establish relationships(between the characters that we don't care about). Add to that, the plot holes and completely random actions of some of the characters. This film reminded me of a Danish produced film... Klatretøsen, or Catch That Girl, as it's international title is. It's a children's film, and I found it far more interesting, involving and plausible than this. Note that I didn't claim it was more entertaining. That's what this film is; entertaining. Nothing else. As a matter of fact, you should probably either see the Danish film, or the American remake(which I haven't seen... yet) as you'll probably find more substance in either of them than this film. If you insist on seeing this, just prepare yourself to be underwhelmed and possibly disappointed. I recommend this only to the biggest fans of the stars and people who look for an attractive film rather than a meaningful one. 7/10"

","After having seen this movie more than eight times (not by choice), I've come to realize that the original unfavorable reviews I read were correct: this film is not much better than mediocre. That's not to say that the film is terribleit's notor that you shouldn't watch ityou shouldbut rather that it has many flaws, some of them glaring.<br/><br/>Ask most people why they saw the movie, and they'll say something like ""It has George Clooney and Brad Pitt in it,"" or ""It has Julia Roberts in it,"" or ""Stephen Soderbergh directed it."" Ocean's Eleven is a ""People Magazine"" reader's dream come true. So many celebrities in one movie: what bliss! The point is that Ocean's Eleven is not meant to be strong on character, or plot; it's meant to be strong on Star Power. In fact, it's surprising that there is a plot, such as it is. It follows the new Blockbuster code: Hot Bad Guys who are actually Good Guys want to steal money from crooked, mean Big Businessman; they make elaborate plans, use fancy equipment, and ultimately...but we all know the ending. Soderbergh may court the strange, the offbeat, the underbelly of society, but he also knows that when making an action movie one should not deviate too much from the tried-and-true. He gives us what we want, and more.<br/><br/>George Clooney and Brad Pitt as Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan, respectively, are the most likable of the bunch. They have a rapport that either is natural, or was rehearsed so effectively and so well that it became natural. They're like Laurel and Hardy, only with stubble and expensive suits. They eat each other's lines, insult each other, show off in front of each otherin some ways they're a more compelling couple than Clooney and Roberts.<br/><br/>Incidentally, Julia Roberts, apparently confusing Tess Ocean with Erin Brockovich, gives an intensity to her role of The Chick that is entirely inappropriate. This is an action movie, not a chance to win another Oscar. She speaks words like she's chopping onions: short, quick, and full of force. Of course, her dramatic skill is unquestionable, but in this case a lighter touch would have been more fitting. I can understand her desire (if she had it) of wanting to give more weight to her role as Clooney's ex-wife and Andy Garcia's new girlfriend; it must be frustrating to be a piece of meat that men fight over. But she should have been more perceptive to the genre of the movie and its requirements. In action movies, chicks should look hot and be tough; they shouldn't be too serious.<br/><br/>The fact is, we hardly ever think of Roberts (or any of the other Big Names) as anything but who they are off the set. Although Garcia calls Roberts ""Tess"" several times, somehow the name always rings false. The other cast members, being less famous, have the advantage of being able to play their characters more convincingly.<br/><br/>This movie was a remake of another all-star movie made in 1960. (I've been unable to see more than snippets, and where I live I'm not able to rent it.) Most reviews refer to this previously made film, but the fact is that Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven is its own entity. We should judge it not based on its predecessor, but on its own meritsunfortunately too few.<br/><br/>When I first saw this movie, it was in Spain, dubbed in Spanish, and I thought it was well made, well acted, and generally better than most action movies. (Of course, I was on a date at the time, so I wasn't scrutinizing every detail.) Upon subsequent viewing, however, this movie's imperfections only become more glaring. It's too bad. Although you won't think you've wasted two hours if you watch it, this movie is not one that you'll return to over and over againthat kind of film where each time you see it you discover more of the director's ingenuity, the actors' skill, the screenwriter's craft. This movie is good for a quick laugh and a thrill, but, like birthday cake, it's not ultimately what satisfies your hunger."

","There is nothing wrong with movies that are as deep as a pile of leaves in June. A fun heist movie does not need an emotional motivations, emotional climaxes, emotion at all. Ocean's 11 is a fun remake of the 1960s rat pack movie of the same title, and essentially the same plot. Las Vegas casinos can never be robbed enough in the world of movies. A fun movie which stars almost anyone and everyone: George Cloony, Brad Pitt, Bernie Mac, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck (Ben's brother), Scott Caan (James' son), Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Andy Garcia, and introducing someone named Julia Roberts. The movie has a simple plot, a crew of ten specialists, headed by Danny Ocean (Cloony) plot to steal over $160 million from 3 Las Vegas casinos owned by Terry Benedict (Garcia). The fun part of Ocean's 11 is that it uses three real Vegas casinos, the Bellagio, the MGM, and the Grande, and uses real boxers in a match-up fans of the sport could only dream about in 2001, Lennox Lewis and Vladimir Klitchko. They may sound like small details, but the success of Steven Soderbergh's movie is in how maybe this heist could actually work in real life. Sure there are a few lapses of logic, just how a team of people could transport duffel bags of hooker brochures into a large vault, I do not know, but the overall style overcomes them. The music, the lighting, the filter used on the cameras all bring about a sense of coolness, high energy that keeps the audience into the plot as much as the thieves. Humor from unexpected sources also helps keep the audience engaged in the movie, and the fun dialog helps as well. Popcorn entertainment? You betcha. Anything to make you think? Nope. Fun and entertaining? Absolutely."

One critic famously described how ""Clair de lune"" evokes fountains rising majestically in the moonlight, and that's exactly what we see as our heroes gather to contemplate what they've done.

"Anonymous_Maxine","8","0","1","14 December 2004"," Hell yes.
","The remake of Ocean's 11 is a tremendously entertaining movie. I personally find Brad Pitt and George Clooney to be among the most watchable actors working today, so I found the movie to be hugely appealing despite numerous plot holes, an almost nonstop barrage of clichés, a ridiculous ending, and Don Cheadle. Before I go on, I should mention that I think Cheadle is an immensely talented actor with some great performance's under his belt, such as his work in Boogie Nights, Traffic, and A Lesson Before Dying (sure, he can't pronounce Vladivostok, but it was still a great performance). The problem with his character here, probably the most controversial role of the entire movie, is that he was forced to take on this ridiculous accent, making him the Jar Jar Binks of Ocean's 11. Pretty sad, but I hope it serves as a lesson for how dumb it is to have well known actors take on thick accents. It does nothing but call attention to itself and invite criticism for the actor's ability to pull it off. And given the content of the discussion boards on the IMDb, Cheadle didn't pull it off so well. <br/><br/>That being said, the rest of the movie is enormously entertaining, even though Andy Garcia, who I have had an unjustifiable aversion to ever since Desperate Measures, turns his character of the ridiculously rich Terry Benedict, owner of three casinos in Las Vegas, into an almost cartoonish villain. George Clooney plays the title character Danny Ocean, recently released from prison where he had plenty of time to develop intricate plots for robbing three casinos simultaneously. The parole board asks him if he thinks he would ever return to a life of crime were he released, he smiles, gets released, and promptly returns to a life of crime. This is the kind of character that Clooney was born to play.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt plays Ocean's Second, the second man in charge and much of the pull behind getting this whole thing together. We get the usual montage of hilarious antics being committed by those that are to be sought to be among Ocean's 11 (edited together on the same template used to introduce us to the colorful characters in Armageddon), each one fulfilling the need for another stereotype. In this way, the movie is pretty weak, but it is so entertaining to watch the robberies pulled off that it makes up for a lot of these shortcomings. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt lends his massive presence to the film as Rusty, an old friend of Danny's. Rusty is an interesting character, sort of a freelancer in Vegas, living his life in the casinos, obviously raking in comfortable amounts of cash from his less than legal endeavors, and willing only to dress in the highest of fashion. Strange, however, for a man to constantly wear such high priced clothing when he is ALWAYS eating. Matt Damon plays the part of the pickpocket, whose skills come into good use in the plot in ways which I will not reveal, Don Cheadle plays the demolitions expert, Bernie Mac gets a great role as a card dealer with a not so clean past, and Elliott Gould makes a huge turn from his character in American History X to play the part of a washed up con man, eager for revenge against Terry Benedict, who put him out of business.<br/><br/>The idea is to rob the central safe that stores the cash for the three casinos in question. Supposedly this is the most ingenious and impenetrable vault ever created by mankind (as this is generally how it is described throughout the movie), which begs the question of why the blueprints for the vault are kept under the watchful eye of a cheaply rented night security guard. That's like leaving the keys to Fort Knox in plain view outside the vault and protected by a thin pane of glass. <br/><br/>(spoilers) Complicating matters, conveniently for the script, is the little factoid that Benedict is now dating Ocean's ex-wife, who left him because he was involved in a life of crime. It's interesting to see the movie take place in what is to me the familiar setting of Las Vegas, but it is not enough to distract attention from the disastrous romantic content of the movie.<br/><br/>Not only does Tess (Roberts) come off as a stiff and exceedingly unpleasant woman, but she left Danny in the first place for being a criminal and landing himself in prison. Then he pulls off this astronomical heist, stealing millions and millions of dollars from her current love interest (as well as managing to get him to admit on camera that he cares more about money than he does about Tess), and THEN she wants him back. What, she didn't want to be with him before because his criminal life landed him in prison, but now she wants him back because he's GOOD at being a criminal? Please. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, while the ending almost completely ruined the movie because it leaves such a bad aftertaste, the rest of the film is hugely entertaining, bad fake accents notwithstanding. There are lots of twists and turns, lots of people get what is coming to them, and as is to be expected from a movie starring Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts, the star power is substantial. It ends badly, but it's great up to that point. It's just too bad that the bad part is so near the end and therefore in the front of your mind at the end of the movie."

Also, the cast seems more focused on making a good film rather than using the film as an excuse to party.<br/><br/>As for the cast, George Clooney shows that he is a great comedic actor and displays a sly charm that he pretty much displayed on ER. Brad Pitt is perfect as his second in command and the two of them have a great chemistry. However, Don Cheadle is the one that really steals the show. He really steals the show as the electronics wizard. Ironically, he played Sammy Davis Jr. in HBO'S ""Rat Pack"" biopic that came out a few years earlier and he plays pretty much the role Sammy played.

","Bust out the popcorn and leave all of your realistic criticism at the door and be prepared for some good old-fashioned entertainment. We all know Soderbergh can make a very gritty and realistic film as we saw him do with Traffic, so it's a little hard to rip this movie for it's lack of realism since it's safe to say that it was never meant to be so.<br/><br/>
An ensemble cast with mostly decent actors definitely helps OE, although there are a few that I think we could've done without. Maybe it's just the fact that Julia Roberts makes me want to gag, or maybe it's the fact that Don Cheadle can't pull off a British accent that well, but something about the characters annoys me. Overall though, they're fairly decent but could've been a tad stronger. Andy Garcia and Brad Pitt are the definite standouts.<br/><br/>The premise of the film itself, the scheme to rob three casinos simultaneously, is let's face it, completely impossible although entertaining. And some of the tools this crew uses are straight from James Bond's workshop and are very unlikely to be available to anyone. But hey, it's not trying to be realistic and really doesn't need to be. It's simply a fun popcorn caper that never expects the viewer to take it too seriously. The plot to the heist itself is fairly amusing and clever.

"rwint","Null","0","1","11 April 2004"," Far Superior to the Original
","7 out of 10<br/><br/>     Agreeable, easygoing actioner detailing a motley group of eleven very different guys brought together to a rob a highly secure casino in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>     This is a remake of the 1960 original that starred Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.  This one is far, far better.  Of course that film was so boring it is hard to believe that a remake could be any worse.  That film did not concentrate on the robbery itself, but instead just relied upon ol' blue eyes and Dino mugging for the camera.  This one is much more focused on the heist, which is elaborate and once it gets going even exciting.  They also do not fill you in on the complete plan and therefore gives the viewer some real neat intricate twists to the heist as it progresses. <br/><br/>
     The real drawback to it is just the fact that it seems virtually impossible to pull off especially with the way that they do it.  The fact that they do it with such ease really hurts the tension level.  It also gets a bit too exaggerated and hi-tech.  At times it almost seems more like an espionage film than a caper flick.<br/><br/>     The comraderie amongst the group is one of the film's better elements. No one is overly obnoxious and no one is so cool that they can't be touched. These guys are slick, but they can still get nervous and display other vulnerabilities.   There is also some genuine concern and support for each other.  There is even some snappy exchanges although there could have been and should have been a lot more.<br/><br/>     It is also nice that it breaks the age barrier and incorporates old timers Reiner and Gould into the fold.  Gould is pretty much wasted, but at least it's nice seeing him back doing movies that are released to the theatre and not just to your local video store shelf.  Although I must say his oversized Harry Carey glasses are awful and not even good for laughs. Reiner is good because he proves here that he can actually act as well as write and direct.  The ethnic accent he uses isn't bad.<br/><br/>     The character of the casino owner who gets robbed is a interesting one. He is a man that carries everything out with a precision and is apparently quite sadistic and violent if he feels you betrayed him.  He is written as kind of  'untouchable' character with a mystic like the one in THE USUAL SUSPECTS.  However Andy Garcia, who plays the part, fails to bring out even one shred of that mythical quality.  In fact Garcia makes the character seem downright dull.<br/><br/>     One should also mention the terrific smooth jazz score.  It perfectly compliments the laid back style of the film and is distinct.  Of course, at times, the film may get a little too laid back.  It takes a while to get you involved with it and the ending is just too restrained.<br/><br/>     I am usually not too into sequels, but a sequel here seems like a good idea.  This is a fun bunch too watch and they should be enjoyable in further adventures.  Their robbery schemes are clever.  A little fine tuning and it should be a blast.  Clooney is always good, but he overshadows Pitt too much and hopefully that will get rectified."

","An old-time con gets out of the can and comes up a grand master plan to rob a casino strongbox. But is it business or is it personal?<br/><br/>
Movie makers are so short of ideas that they are prepared to remake movies that weren't very good in the first place? Having said that, this product belongs in the ""Star Is Born"" mould of film: A frame to put your star product rather than anything special or unique by itself.<br/><br/> All star cast? Well about six people here could be considered stars (Andy Garcia we will count as a falling star, Elliot Gould as well and truly fallen!) and even most of these look like overpaid extras. Matt Damon needs to be looking for more substantial roles than this - he is getting a bit old to be the wide-eyed tea-boy. I think Brad Pitt has a good set of washboard abs and a nice face, but has he ever convinced you that he is good at anything other than bench presses? Master thief - don't make me laugh. Julia Roberts isn't much more than a muse but does well enough with her well paid bit-part. Very dignified.<br/><br/>
George Clooney has been lucky in life. Nice TV face that has been given a chance with movies because there isn't really anybody else coming along. While mediocre in mediocre material he is quite good with this type of light and throwaway material - understated and cool. That guy should market antiperspirant.<br/><br/>We shouldn't go in to how they plan to turn over the casino given this is so much of the movie. However I am sure the casino security people wiped tears of laughter from their eyes watching things unfold.<br/><br/>The security they have is unbreakable and criminals don't rob big vaults anymore - when was the last big robbery of this type? Besides they would simply kidnap someone important even if they were mad enough to give it a go. Sorry film makers - if you want to focus on crim's then small timers and drugs dealers are all you are left with.<br/><br/>All faults to one side, this is quite an acceptable  little package, but there is something missing at the heart of it. Namely tension. I couldn't really care less if they got caught or not and frankly without this bank robberies become men-at-work movies.<br/><br/>Good to see that while very few people have seen the (excellent) British comedy-drama Two Way Stretch (with Peter Sellers) the authors of this piece clearly have!

Surpassing even Keanu's Idiot-British in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" or ""Much Ado About Nothing"", ""inauthentic"" would be a compliment to Cheadle's uneducated abomination of the mother tongue. <br/><br/>Cheadle played Sammy Davis Jnr. in the TV movie ""The Rat Pack""  a role which called for the most talented actor of The Pack, as he had to mime not only singing, but tap-dancing, trumpet-playing and six-gunning, so it is with great concern that we view this exemplary actor's abject ignorance and lack of perception of one particular inflective tongue, based on his own spoken language! (Well, actually, *preceding* his spoken language, but this ain't the forum for resolving etymological beefs.)<br/><br/>Still, casting Cheadle as a warbling limey was only nominally more sensible than casting the shovel-mouthed Julia Roberts as a ""beautiful woman"". And as casting choices go, this movie was at a disadvantage from the outset with the impossible task of filling the shoes of one Francis Albert Sinatra. In a role which Frank insouciantly tossed off as a lark (which cast all the more sheen on it for its rebellious bent), head-waggling George Clooney steps up as Danny Ocean. And fails.<br/><br/>With ""Ocean's Eleven"", as with ""Robin and the Seven Hoods"", or ""Jailhouse Rock"", or ""Every Which Way But Loose"", we're not so much dealing with ""movies"" as we are with ""movie STARS"". (In sooth, this 2001 ""Ocean's Eleven"" observes that tradition with the wealth of wasted talent deployed in it.) Re-making films such as these will not capture the consecrated quality afforded the originals by the passage of time and the involvement of their particular god-status icons. It is merely a fiscal exercise, involving brand-name recognition (buy the original rights and wretchedly sully the nostalgia), curiosity quotient (we'll get the Frank & Dino fans into the theater at least *once*), next-generation retro hipness (""I'm so kewl cos I like the ""classics""), crossover marketing (with this ensemble, we're *bound* to get *someone* through the turnstiles) and providing A-List actors with work to keep them off reality shows. <br/><br/>The premise to heist major casinos in Las Vegas is the only tie with the original ""Eleven"", as this remake's storyline had to be noticeably updated to cater to the state of advances in hi-tech security, the writers sensibly eschewing re-creating The Rat Pack's lo-tech heist note for note.<br/><br/>Of the heist gang, Brad Pitt is Clooney's ""Dino""; Matt Damon meanders one- dimensionally, Bernie Mac does his ""black thing""; Cheadle does his ""cockney(?) thing""; excepting Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner, the remainder of the Eleven are populated by ""passengers"", including Ben Affleck's brother and James Caan's son gaily taking on half-dimensional roles.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just admiring that previous generation's devil-may-care tilt at Life (or at least, the *media's* reporting of it) that gives the 1960 ""Eleven"" more of a rose-colored flare than all the gadgetry and gags this remake offers as collateral. Though there are attempts at capturing the magic and camaraderie of the original (Clooney's best line to Pitt, ""Ted Nugent called  he wants his shirt back""), this movie's redemption is in its slick production value  it may ring hollow as a buddy-piece, but it is truly a guilty ocular pleasure, highly watchable for its appealing camera-work, lighting and set design. <br/><br/>Inadvertently turning this piece into a *nolo contendre* flame-fest, I might as well fire home the last barb in stating that the original ""Eleven"" packs a hilarious, if not frustrating, twist ending - unequivocally a more substantial wallop than the anchor that this remake is built on: the interpersonal fizzle of George & Julia's latent love. Let's face it, an action-comedy movie with an ending where Nothing Happens leaves us holding the proverbial injured aquatic bird (i.e. lame duck). <br/><br/>With this ensemble, one would expect roiling acting chops flung at the viewer like raw meat to lions, but the only players who consistently chew their roles delectably are Andy Garcia (as the casino owner heistee), Gould and Reiner. Everyone else is flailing for substance, including Pitt and Clooney who only have a few good moments together; the rest of the time, they're just being Brad Pitt and George Clooney, vying for enough screen time to try to top each other for one of those provincial, back-slapping, faux-prestigious awards that already exists: People Magazine's World's Sexiest Man.<br/><br/>My vote is for Frank Sinatra.<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"

There's no acting per se - just the plot, a casino robbery.  George Clooney plays George Clooney, Brad Pitt plays Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts is The Girl. Elliott Gould looks old, Carl Reiner is old.  The actors do just enough to advance the story, nothing else.  There is no character development, just characters.<br/><br/>And the plot isn't good enough to carry the show.  The film is basically the planning and execution of a casino robbery, and the way they carry it out isn't a bit believable.  <br/><br/>I don't know what Steven Soderbergh was thinking of when he made this film. It's the equivalent of airline food - it looks like a movie, but it's really just a cardboard imitation of one.  And of course, they're filming a sequel, because ....... it made money."

","""Ocean's Eleven"" is a remake which certainly is worth seeing --- if you like this type of movies like I do. Frank Sinatra's film seems really naive compared with this one, which also looks naive if we don't suspend our disbelief, but I think each viewer is able to do that and enjoy the movie or at least enjoy the actors on it. There is one interesting point: the films of the 50s and 60s which tell the story of thieves usually are spoilers (I don't know if this is the right word to use here) because they make us like the thieves and then they are caught in the end (for example: ""The Day they Robbed the Bank of England""). So, one thing good about movies about thefts nowadays is that we can be fairly sure that our favorite characters are going to get away with it, like for example ""The Entrapment"" with Sean Connery, or  ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" with Pierce Brosnan. ""Ocean's Eleven"" seems to me to be better than these movies. Don't miss it if you understand what I have been talking about."

","* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * good * * * * * Brilliant<br/><br/>WARNING *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Danny Ocean(George Clooney)is a petty thief and con man who after serving about five years in prison is released on parole.Having just got out, Danny heads for LA where he hooks up with old friend and partner in crime Rusty Ryan(Brad Pitt), who is now teaching Hollywood brats how to play cards.<br/><br/>Danny tells Rusty that he wants him in on a plan to rob three major casino's in Las Vegas which are all owned by Pseudo-gangster Terry Benedict(A brilliant Andy Garcia).Together, the two hustlers with the help of a former casino owner named Reuben Tishkoff(A funny Elliott Gould)who finances the crime.They put together a team of men,eleven including themselves to pull off the crime.<br/><br/>Little does Rusty and the others realise however.Danny's ex-wife Trish(Julia Roberts)is none other than the new main squeeze of Benedict and is the main reason for Danny wanting to rob the casino's.He wants the woman he loves back and is prepared to risk everything for her.How long do you think it takes for Rusty and the others to find out?<br/><br/>Oceans Eleven is again one of those movies that is about style over substance.A remake of the sixties crime caper featuring the original 'Rat Pack' that comprised of Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr.,Dean Martin and one other guy who nobody ever seems to remember.Having not seen the original it's impossible therefore to compare this version to it's earlier predecessor.Which is probably a good thing.<br/><br/>Oceans Eleven isn't a great movie.Sure it's entertaining enough and is amusing in parts but it won't be classed as the best of it's director, Steven Soderbergh.It does contain much of the trademark syle and amazing cammera work that has already earned him the recognition he deserves.Then there is the fine ensemble cast that he has aquired.Pitt and Clooney are pretty good in their respective rolls but it's the rest of the cast that really impresses.Matt Damon is superb as Linus Caldwell, the young man who is the son of a former friend and assosciate of Danny and Rusty's.He brings the right amount of rebellious youth and gritty determination to make him a truly memorable character.Carl Reiner's performance as the retirement age crook, Saul is also first rate.He shows the younger guys that age doesn't nesecarrily mean you can't cut it among the young folk any more.The rest which include, Don Cheadle(Sporting a terrible cockney accent but is never the less good in his roll), Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck etc. are all great.<br/><br/>Special mention must go to Andy Garcia, who the odd one out as the bad guy of the piece(Even though he is the one being robbed).Puts in a charismatically sinister performance as Benedict.A ruthless, methodical man who uses the resources of his bank balance rather than muscle to get even with those who cross him.<br/><br/>Where the movie fails though is in much of the plot holes that are never quite covered.For instance, how at the end of the movie do Danny and the rest of his crew manage to get out of Las Vegas and out of the Nevada desert with the loot.Lets face facts.That is a hell of a lot of cash they're carrying and you would think Benedict would quickly call the authoritesie ie.The Police and tell them to keep a look out for men disguised as security gaurds in a fake van.Not only that but you would think that Trish, knowing Danny, would inform Benedict who she thinks she loves of who Danny is.Even though she would risk exposing her past to Benedict.Plus this is hardly an original story.Look at the long list of heist movies.'The Thomas Crown affair', both versions.City of Fire, Reservoir Dogs, Gone in Sixty seconds.All these are all more or less  variations on basicly the same premise.Not only that, you would have thought that Soderbergh would have had a lesser known actress(Who could have been just as capable and talented) than Julia Roberts cast in the roll of Trish.She is not in it as much as would have been expected and feels to be under used.God knows how much her salary for the part must have come to but I bet it was a fortune.<br/><br/>Oceans Eleven isn't a bad two hour movie.It's actually quite fun in parts but it's not the sort of movie that I would think would have made a good night out to the pictures.Rather more a decent enough viewing on the couch with your partner in front of the TV.If you get the chance, watch it but don't feel too disgruntled if you don't get to see the flick.It's not as if you're missing a classic.<br/><br/>Robs Rating:* * *"

"ihave8ofem","Null","0","1","28 April 2003"," Which Version Do You Like?
","My opinion of remakes is usually negative. The remake is rarely as good as the original. The new cast is rarely able to equal the originals' status. Since I've seen the movie before, I know what to expect, and the movie just doesn't measure up. This remake is an exception. The 1960 version is great. The 2001 version is awesome. If we watched the 1960 version and the 2001 version of Ocean's Eleven, we could easily see the difference between the two movies.<br/><br/>The Rat Pack (1960) is great and compliment each other to make them look good together. The all-star cast (2001) makes it look like they have been working together in several films together, even though they haven't. The cast in both movies works together as a whole. Both movies having so many big names add so much strength to them. The likelihood of these eleven men all knowing each other and each having a skill that is needed in order to pull off the heist is a little far fetched in both movies. The length of time spent getting the other men together is ridiculous in both movies. What is also far fetched is the availability of access to the vault. There is a bit of humor in both versions of the movie. And, there is the romantic influence to the main character-- of course there is a woman involved! Because of the difference in eras that these movies were made, the diverse technology is unavoidable. For instance, the inclusion of cell phones in the 2001 remake is a twist that couldn't be there in the 1960 version. The high-tech security surrounding the vault is another difference that is obvious. The way that the money is lost in the end is different too.<br/><br/>What about sequels to remakes? As much as I enjoyed the 2001 remake of this movie, I can't wait for the proposed sequel to the remake. `Ocean's Twelve...'"

Julia's character could've been done without, but I guess the director wanted a love interest in the mix. I found her distracting and it distracted from the fun of the movie. Andy Garcia was a treat, as well as the over-nerved Don Cheadle. Everyone did a great job in their respective parts. The ending was great too. I didn't find anything too wrong with it.

","The original ""Ocean's 11"" (1960) famously starred Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin and several other well-known stars of the era.  The so-called ""Rat Pack"" were friends and the movie, a quickly slapped together story involving robbing the vaults of several Las Vegas casinos, was as much a lark for them as the movie-going audience.  The modern version shamelessly appropriates the title and plot of the original film, but completely misses the point, and several major components of the first version, settling instead to be a vanity piece for the smirking but boring Mr. Clooney and company.<br/><br/>In 1960 Las Vegas was a relatively new venue, which had erupted from the desert in what was still a very undeveloped and rustic Nevada.  World War II had ended only 15 years before, and the United States was going through a period of tremendous economic growth and optimism.  The original Danny Ocean (Mr. Sinatra) and his crew had all served during the war together in the 82nd Airborne Division, and therefore were trained commandoes, and very used to working as a team.  The concept of the movie is that this team of commadoes uses their wartime skills to plan and carry-out an elaborate scheme to simultaneously rob the vaults of the adjacent casinos on the strip in Las Vegas.  In the original, the plan moves smoothly, until a very unexpected development deprives them of their ill-gotten gains.  They leave, satisfied that their plan worked, and that the widow of one of their team is provided for, but otherwise none the richer for the criminal activities.<br/><br/>The Clooney fantasy is unencumbered by any such notions of plot or message; it's simply all about George and the assembled well-known Hollywood faces recruited to mimic the style of the original, which include Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon.  Not war heros and comrades who are used to putting their lives in eachothers' hands, but simply an amalgamation of two bit hoods and convenient ""experts"" with apparently limitless funding from a sympathetic gangster (a premise also borrowed from the original)Clooney- himself a small-time robber just out of jail- smugly stumbles his way through the exposition as though this was some type of ""Mission Impossible"" TV show setup.<br/><br/>Ridiculous, inane and outright dopey, the updated ""Ocean's 11"" sails along through frantic attempts at clever plot twists and the bad guys make off with the loot, and handsome George seems to be on track to win back his former wife, Julia Roberts.  Guess what? Crime does pay!  Apparently so in this case of stolen ideas and smug self-congratulatory celebrity. Montsrously enough, there are rumors of a sequel.  What's next? Clooney re-recording ""New York, New York""?"

","As others have noted, the details of the casino caper plot (which reminded me a little of David Mamet's ""The Score"") are highly implausible, mainly because of the expense.  The cost of creating a duplicate vault, of buying all the high-tech equipment and gear, of outfitting a SWAT team, etc., had to be extraordinarily high.  And yet the movie shows the eleven buying all this stuff and using it and the viewer cannot help but get a little skeptical when they start unloading machine shop equipment, and skids of supplies.<br/><br/>But a little thought about the plot suddenly helped it all make sense to me. and it all revolves around Rueben, Elliot Gould's character.  Pitt and Clooney go to him to bankroll the job and he agrees for two reasons - to make money, of course, and to stick it to Andy Garcia's casino owner character.   If we assume that Rueben has a ton of money, and that he made available to the eleven whatever they needed, then all we have to demand from the plot is that the personnel are as talented as Clooney and Pitt tell us they are - which is not that big a leap.<br/><br/>I really like complicated con movies and this one keeps moving and keeps the viewer wondering what will happen next.

Their intention is to coordinate and execute a robbery in a Las Vegas casino. They aim at breaking open the most secured vault in Las Vegas, which has combined revenue of Terry Benedict's (Andy Garcia) Bellagio, Mirage, and MGM casinos.

Usually a director doesn't put this many big stars into one movie, but I like it. I thought the plot moved very well. It kept me watching. The part that I liked best was when they walked straight out the door with the money. Compared to other robbery movies, this film has a different tone on how it goes about robbing.

We follow the recruitment of the old gang, the planning, and assorted hi-jinx along the way.  The characters are interesting enough, with a mixed bag of old-time Vega$ types as well as some young nerdlings and assorted hipsters thrown in the mix, makes for an entertaining bunch.  The plot is to rob three casinos at once and actually is quite elaborate.  One thing I dug about it was that they slowly revealed how the robbery would take place, so your are kept in the dark for much of the movie.  To complicate matters, Clooney targets one of the casinos because his ex is seeing the owner.  Normally, this would seem like a contrivance to bring in the 'chick flick' audience (Doesn't having Clooney in a movie already bring in the chicks??), but it tosses a kink into their plans, so I'll let is slide.

","Director Soderbergh started by making a name to himself as one of the innovative figures in the out-of-Hollywood American film movement. It is a pity to see him now making such a mediocre establishment movie.<br/><br/>'Ocean's Eleven' is a well made action movie. It reminds many other similar action films, like 'Mission Impossible', gets together a bunch of very good actors, is well filmed and succeeds to be rather logical in its Hollywood incredibility. However, it fails to create any kind of real artistic suspense. Even as summer entertainment, it repeats too much of the already seen cliches to be really a good entertainment. Good rental choice, but only if you have sen all the other more original similar movies on the shelves."

","First of all you can never do a remake of a movie that starred Sinatra and than expect it to live up to the original. And could they have picked a lamer cast to replace the great Rat Pack? All the actors lacked any enthusiasm and gave off the image like they were all emotionless robots with absolutely no personality. This movie was so dull and unrealistic. Not too mention ho much I missed hearing Sammy Davis Jr. singing Eee-Ooo Eleven and Dean Martin crooning to all the wide-eyed women. Do yourself a favor and pick up the original 'Ocean's Eleven' with the cast that was made to be in this movie, unless of course you enjoy watching a bunch of Hollywood pretty boys showing us yet again just how pathetic their acting skills are. They are better off just standing around looking pretty, oh wait, that's what they do in this movie.

"scubergmu","Null","0","1","7 August 2002"," Seriously Missing Something
","I tell you this movie had everything going for it, big budget, big stars, proven director, a cool 60's flick to remake, and everything just seemed to fall flat just the same.  I really had high expectations for this film, seeing as how I'm a huge fan of Steven Soderbergh, George Clooney, heist movies, ensemble casts, Las Vegas, and The Rat Pack.  Amazingly it was still two of the least entertaining hours I've spent at the movies in years. Given what I am used to seeing from Soderbergh and Clooney (at least recently), I would have expected this film to be so more much more than it was.<br/><br/>
Honestly I think that Ocean's Eleven suffered the most because it lacked restraint in the most superficial areas, leaving the rest of the movie severely lacking.  They didn't seem to feel the need to present interesting characters because it had so many of them to take up the screen.  Most of the eleven aren't all that important, they just have their little part of it and that's it.  The two important ones outside of the eleven, are naturally more ubiquitous.  Still quite disappointingly, those played by Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia, remain a mystery throughout.  They were simply there, one character to be gotten and one to be beaten.  Would it have been too much of a task to show us why Harry Benedict (Garcia) is supposed to be such a loathsome villain, or why Tess (Roberts) is supposed to be so desirable? These two are as one-dimensional as they come in movies, and that is a far cry from what we've seen in Erin Brockovich (2000), Out of Sight (1998), or Traffic (2000).<br/><br/>Surely the biggest disappointment however was the lack of restraint involving the heist on the casino itself.  I mean honestly, one has to admit that too much of anything is a bad thing and too much elaboration is no exception.  The heist that the gang sets up and attempts crosses the line from clever and cool to way-too-complicated-to-be-real long before its done. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot as I watched it played out.  If Danny Ocean (Clooney) could come up with a scam like this, as intricate as it is, you wouldn't think he wouldn't be just getting out of prison. You'd think he'd be running an organized crime family, or he'd be in Congress or something like that. Watching the scam, it was all simply too much.  It was like watching a clever rant that runs on and becomes long-winded and you find yourself checking your watch and staring at the floor (see Good Will Hunting).  In this case, less certainly would have been more.  If I am going to give the movie any praise it would have to be directed almost completely at Elliot Gould's character who provided the only funny scene with his re-telling of the most successful heists in Vegas history.  That was amusing and that was about it.<br/><br/>I fully understand there are movies out there that just serve to entertain and do not deserve to be scrutinized because there's really nothing there but style and show (see the whole Bruckheimer collection).  If only Ocean's Eleven could have deviated from this formula a little more.  If the audience could have gotten into the characters and legitimately related to them, empathized with them, rooted for them, whatever, then the events of the movie would have carried some real weight.  Ocean's Eleven, in devoting so much time to showing this ridiculously complicated scam play out, didn't have any time left for the fine points like that.  All in all, it was too-big, too-stylish, and seriously too-forgettable.  Damn, what a disappointment."

George Clooney stars as a con just out of prison getting ready to pull another score.  Brad Pitt stars as his buddy getting the whole thing set up.

It wasn't until recently that I realized he did other things other than Vincent Mancini roles.

If she didn't care about those things, she would have stayed with Garcia.<br/><br/>
I'm often criticized for my lack of ability to suspend my disbelief and that I think too much about things that seem minor to others. But why are these guys even<br/><br/>being made to look cool and heroic anyway? They just ripped off 3 casinos of<br/><br/>many, MANY millions. Doesn't a lot of this money go to pay wages of lots of<br/><br/>workers who need the money more? Doesn't a lot of it pay taxes in the state<br/><br/>that serve the citizens of Nevada? Who's going to make up the loss? If the<br/><br/>casinos get reimbursed by insurance, won't that mean higher premiums for<br/><br/>those who can afford it the least? <br/><br/>Another thing that bugged me is how can they even get away with it? I assume<br/><br/>that the casinos aren't really run by only Andy Garcia. Wouldn't the mob have a strong hold in it as well? I doubt they would appreciate the loss and would use all their power and influence to find the thieves. <br/><br/>How did these guys build an exact replica of the vault? Why did Andy Garcia<br/><br/>allow Matt Damon to go the room alone? Why did he release George Clooney to<br/><br/>the police? If he really suspected Clooney and was as heartless as we're<br/><br/>supposed to think he is, why wasn't the truth tortured out of Clooney?<br/><br/>
The answer to all these questions is that the movie is just there to pander to the audience and make them think they're cool. We're made to like them from<br/><br/>the start because they're good-looking, friendly, use hip language, dress well, drink and eat the best liquor and food, hang around with celebrities, and know how to gamble against boring kids. <br/><br/>I like Sodenberg's movies otherwise. I'm a fan of SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE;<br/><br/>OUT OF SIGHT; ERIN BRONKOVICH; and especially TRAFFIC. And I really have to<br/><br/>get around to check out KING OF THE HILL and KAFKA. But this movie was<br/><br/>beneath him. Take away the slick camera works and the moving subtitles and<br/><br/>credits and you have a very lame story."

","Ocean's 11 is the story of 11 con artists/thieves getting together to rip off a wealthy casino magnate in Las Vegas.  After we get to know everybody a theme of Robin Hood against the Sheriff of Nottingham comes to mind.  Then the heist--although their methods can be explained as impossible to pull off by any stretch of the imagination one doesn't care because we are lifted away to a place where rooting for the bad guy is mandatory--kind of like in the Sting only about a tenth as convincing or enjoyable.  Conversely, it's not fair to compare this film to the Sting because the Sting has a sound track that compliments the thoughts and actions of the characters, the era, scenes and locations.  In O-11, The entire look and feel of the movie is back ground to, or is over shadowed by, a loud thumping repetitive bass and drum track which evokes nothing to the imagination but perhaps annoying car or jeans TV commercials. Las Vegas overflows with a rainbow of diverse music--none of which resemble the sounds in the O-11.  Only twice, and very briefly, does the sound track support the locations, scenes and characters: the entrance of Sahl (played by Carl Reiner), and the very end of the movie.  Gen-X folks will most likely be the only folks who can relate to this sound track.  This movie, unlike the Sting, will never be a classic because of the irritating, emotionally devoid, dated, loud, frustratingly repetitive sound track (which one can not call music).  In addition, because the history or magnitude of the relationship between Roberts and Clooney is never apparent, we never really care about the Julia Robert character--it is unimportant to the movie and her performance is week and boring not to mention there is no chemistry at all between her and Clooney.  In fact, all the characters (with the exception of Reiner, Damon, and Garcia) seem to be acting or pretending and thus are not convincing.  On the bright side, the script is clever and humorous.  And there are some fun twists that surprise you.  If you enjoy repetitive, loud, bass and drums, you will like this movie. If you like a good mystery/adventure/heist movie--try watching with the captions on and the sound off--it's much better that way.    C+"

","I just saw this movie at a sneak preview and have already recommended it to a large group of friends, most of whom are in their 30s and 40s. The younger crowd, with their video-game, smash-and-bash, the-louder-the-better mentality might not appreciate this film, but if you are looking for a solid 2 hours of intelligent entertainment, this movie is worth the money.<br/><br/> First of all, you have to appreciate and respect a movie that doesn't substitute direct violence; gratuitous nudity, sex or swearing; or drug use for plot. As a parent, I'd feel comfortable bringing my kids to this movie -- if I thought they would ""get it."" Don't leave your brain at the door; you're going to need it.<br/><br/> Now, I haven't seen the original ""Ocean's 11"" in its entirety, but I'm willing to bet that this one is much more engrossing.<br/><br/>The basic plot is simple -- George Clooney's a career con man planning a major heist of 3 Las Vegas casinos; Brad Pitt helps him round up the usual gang of suspects to help them pull it off. It's the execution of their plan, and the twists and turns the gang encounters on the way, that will make the two hours fly by. Pay attention to everything you see and hear.<br/><br/> With such a large cast, you don't learn much about the characters, but the movie is such a lark you don't need to ""care"" about them. Watching the talented actors put their own little spins on stock roles is a lot of fun. Granted, Clooney and Pitt can do charming in their sleep, but there's nothing wrong with watching a pro strut his stuff. Matt Damon doesn't get much to do but chew gum for quite awhile, but when it's time for him to break out of his slacker rookie role, he's slyly funny, especially when he gets his big job as part of the heist.  A special shout-out to Scott Caan and Casey Affleck, who lend some great touches of humor as the two ""go-to"" guys of the gang, and to Elliott Gould, who shows the pretty boys who's boss whenever he's on screen. (He should win a special Oscar for bravery, based on his wardrobe alone.)<br/><br/> Steven Soderbergh does a great job of keeping the action moving, epitomizing the never-a-dull-moment ambience of Las Vegas, except for the mercifully brief scenes between Clooney and Roberts. Thankfully, Soderbergh and the writers kept the ""romantic"" subplot on the back burner, where it belonged. The music is fun and funky, and the whole movie is such a lark, you'll leave the theater greatly amused and almost wishing for a life on the lam; Soderbergh, Clooney and the boys make it look so fun."

Casey Affleck is really good, and Soderbergh does a good job at directing.  Some plot holes, but they didn't bother me too much.  My only complaint is the story line between Clooney and Roberts. There scenes together are good, especially their first encounter to the audience.  The story-line between the two, however, does not develop at all, and when it ends you are sitting there wondering what happened.  Other than that, good heist movie even if it has been done before.  The acting is done very well.  Although it does seem like an all-star basketball game where there are too many stars on the court."

This picture is what story tellers live for or at least should aim for.<br/><br/>The audience has the ability to live out fantasy.  Of course most of the cons used would never work, but, if you think to hard about it, your not letting yourself be told a fictional story.  As a film maker, I was taken away by the use of the camera and background action.<br/><br/>When Steven Soderbergh picks up a camera and runs with it, it's pure magic. I can not count the amount of times I said ""wow,"" or ""ahhh."" He has, once again, directed the best way he knows how.  Working in such an active city, Soderbergh surrounded himself with a great crew.  Producer Jerry Weintraub, the Pope of Las Vegas, was a true gem for this picture. His connections allowed for the cast and crew to shoot in the middle of the day, in crowded Hotel/Casinos.  My hat is off to him.<br/><br/>It's my belief that this cast was not pulled together to lure a fan filled audience, it was brought together to entertain us.

The pace does slow a bit after all the characters are introduced, but it picks up again rather quickly, and the second half of the movie--planning and executing the heist--is just plain fun. Julia Roberts fans are likely to be disappointed--first, because there wasn't more of her, and second, because she had only one good line in the whole film. On the other hand, ""mature"" movie-goers will probably get a kick seeing some faces they haven't seen for awhile (Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner).

Elliot Gold is more interesting and odd but gets very little screen time and the chinese guy amuses us a few moments. Brad Pitt has done many impressing roles (12 Monkeys, Kalifornia, Snatch, Fight Club and Seven just to mention some of his best movies)and the same can be said about Matt Damon but none of them get anything to work with in this movie. Andy Garcia is as good as he can be in his role as the bad guy, but why doesn't we get to see him actually do anything bad ? Julia Roberts character is only boring too see, she could have been replaced with any female actor and it would not have made any difference. But replaced with Halle Berry we would at least have had someone beautiful to look at.<br/><br/>
Ocean's Eleven is a remake of the 1960 movie with the same name. You can see the oldfashioned overlaping of scenes and you can here it from the oldfashioned crappy music.

No one would bother with this movie if the actors were not so famous.<br/><br/>I recommend that you watch The Score instead, it has the three greatest actors in the world and here the actors really make a difference, especially Edward Norton but it is always a pleasure too see De Niro and Brando as well.

No, instead I'll just say, how, like some others I naively believed that this would be as good as Out of Sight; George Clooney, Don Cheadle, music by David Holmes, and of course direction by the great Soderbergh himself. However, this film felt watered-down with most scenes too 'sitcom-friendly' for my liking. There were no great macabre moments like in the darker Out of Sight when White Boy Bob trips and shoots himself in the head. The laughs, for me, were instead very much 'popcorn laughs' (as in you only laugh because everyone else in the cinema is laughing). Garcia was a bit boring and non-threatening for my liking (he never showed any menace), and as for Roberts, well I've never been a fan, so OF COURSE I'd take the money instead! Cheadle's accent: It has to be said, why why why? They could have gotten anyone! Vas Blackwood from 'Lock Stock' or even Tricky(Fifth Element)- there are plenty of talented black cockney actor/rappers out there if that's what they were looking for!! What next?

The action part of the movie is better, but there's been lots of such robbery films and this one does not outstand. The robbery itself is filmed quite well and is surely the best part. Acting? Pitt, Clooney, Damon and Roberts are disappointing. Garcia not bad. To sum it up, I hoped Soderbergh wouldn't join the American mainstream (bad guy, good guy, some better or worse story, nice girl, at the end the good guy gets the nice girl). But he did :("

","Ocean's 11 *** ½<br/><br/>`If it's a remake of a classic, rent the classic!'  Jay `The Critic' Sherman.<br/><br/>OK, confession time.  I've never seen the original Ocean's 11.  This probably makes me a bad person, and makes your trust in my ability as a movie reviewer very, very shaky.  The original is, from what I'm told, a classic.  It had the Rat Pack.  Frank, Deano, Sammy.  It defined cool. Cool didn't even exist until the original came out.  Oh, people thought that they knew what cool was, but they were living lies.  Lame lies.  Square lies.<br/><br/>Now, I've never seen the original.  But, I liked the current version. Given the fact that the original is ALWAYS better than the remake, I can only assume that the original might even make me cool.  Might.<br/><br/>Synopsis time.  Danny Ocean (Clooney) just got out of prison for a con he pulled 6 years ago.  He's had a lot of time to think.  Lots.  And, he's come up with a plan.  A big plan.  A cool plan.  A crazy plan, man.  He's going to rob three casinos in Las Vegas on the same night.  But, to do this, he needs to get a team together.  A cool team.  A crazy team, man.  Not unlike Jake and Elwood Blues, he has to get the band back together.  First up: Frank Catton (Mac).  He's the inside man.  Next: Rusty Ryan (Pitt), a co-conspirator.  Now: how to make this plan work.  They'll need money. That's where Reuben Tishkoff (Gould) comes in.  He's a former casino owner, and, it just so happens that the three casinos Clooney & Company plan to rob belong to Terry Benedict (Garcia), the man who bought Reuben out.  Reuben doesn't like him, and gladly agrees.  They'll also need drivers and utility men' (my term).  Enter Turk (Caan) and Virgil (Affleck) Malloy, a couple of bored citizens of Utah.  Then we need some techies.  Livingston Dell (Jemison) is a hacker and Basher Tarr (Cheadle) is a demolitions expert. They need a grease man' (the movie's term)  someone who can get in and out of tight places easily.  Enter Yen (Qin), a Chinese acrobat.  Another inside man wouldn't be bad, so why not get Saul Bloom (Reiner)  he's got plenty of experience.  And, someone with quick hands and an ability to tail people. That would be Linus Caldwell (Damon).  Throw in a femme fatale named Tess Ocean (Roberts), make sure that she's the ex-wife of Danny Ocean, and man alive, it looks like we have us one heck of a movie!  Stuff is gonna get robbed, stuff is gonna blow up, there may be plot holes that we don't care about, and, by golly, we're gonna have fun!<br/><br/>I'm actually kind of glad that I went into Ocean's 11 with a blank slate. I was able to enjoy the movie without comparing it to the original.  I can only hope that this remake is able to stand on its own merits, rather than suffer constant comparisons to the original.  Much like The Shining or Fight Club  the books were excellent, and the movies based upon them were different, yet still excellent.  You don't say, `That's not the way it happened!' when watching the movie versions.  The books and the movies are two separate, yet equally rewarding experiences.  Hopefully, this will be the same with the two Ocean's 11.<br/><br/>What did I like about Ocean's 11 2001?  Plenty.  I like George Clooney. Especially when he's playing George Clooney.  He's a handsome man, he looks like a classic leading man, but he doesn't have a whole lot of range.  And that's just fine with me, frankly.  Brad Pitt does a George Clooney impersonation throughout the movie, and, that's cool too, man.  Andy Garcia isn't a bad guy' in the movie, but, he's a jerk, because he doesn't like Danny Ocean.  Julia Roberts plays Supporting Actress Julia Roberts, rather than Melodramatic Romantic Comedy Julia Roberts, and looks good doing it. She's not strictly eye candy, but she's not a major player in this flick. I'm not going to do a run-down of each and every character in the flick. That would be boring for you.  Just know that I didn't see a single bad performance.<br/><br/>Cinematically, I loved it.  Soderburgh seemed to blend 60s cinematography (French New Wave zooms,  Kubrick-esque tracking shots and angles,) with a... ummm... It's too early to say 21st Century style, so I'll just go with a television sensibility.  He knows when a shot should linger, he knows when to use a quick-cut, and he knows when to do a montage.  The style never overshadows the story or the characters.<br/><br/>What didn't I like about this movie?  Well, not much.  Personally, I think that classics should be left alone, so I guess I didn't like the fact that this was a remake.  I would have liked to have seen more of the planning of the heist, but that probably would have gone against the almost innocent' tone of the movie.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the original, by all means go and see this version. But only if you promise to see the 1960 version.  If you have seen the original, use your own best judgement."
"BryMan-4","5","0","1","4 December 2001"," Flashy but safe vanity piece
","Barely watchable, the first Ocean's Eleven was a vanity piece.  It was an excuse for some hepcats to get together, drink a few martinis, do a few numbers and film a caper movie in their favorite city, Las Vegas. Forty-one years later comes Steven Soderbergh's highly anticipated remake, which amounts to another vanity piece for Clooney and Company, albeit a more watchable one.  George Clooney and Brad Pitt swagger through the movie like a modern day Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra.  It's hard to say they add or subtract anything from the movie since it is all surface fluff and retro eye candy.  The biggest disappointment is Julia Roberts.  Her relationship with Clooney and Andy Garcia is never really fleshed out, so she seems little more than runway model for some slinky dresses.  It's a shame this talented actress is reduced to the worthless `love interest'.  It would have been more interesting to inject some estrogen into the film by making her one of the master thieves.  Soderbergh shows a deft hand in style.  This is one of the more colorful films he has directed.  It has a sort of 60's wacca-wacca feel.  Unfortunately he has a heavier hand with his actors.  Elliot Gould is allowed to go slightly over the top, but Carl Reiner is restrained like a prisoner on death row.  We know this veteran comic genius is capable of so much more.  I kept waiting for him to cut loose, but it never happened. The screenplay plays it too safe.  At no point do we sense that our heroes are in any danger or the job is in jeopardy.  We know they will succeed, so all the tension that drives the movie is gone.  What's left is the cleverness of the heist, and it is plenty clever.  There are a few laughs peppered here and there, but for the most part it's played too straight."

Then, yes, the actual robbery was cleverly worked out and quite cool. But what is it with this Hollywood need to include some love interest and happy romantic endings? This is a film that had great potential, but ended up being no more than ""good guys outwit bad guy"" plus ""good guy gets the girl"".<br/><br/>On the plus side, Andy Garcia was great, the only character you could really side with, as was Elliot Gould who stole the show every second he was on screen.

You could even analyze the underlying sexism in the story, but by doing so you're really missing the point: 'Ocean's Eleven' is not supposed to be deep or meaningful - it's just very fine entertainment.<br/><br/>Danny Ocean (George Clooney), master con-artist and thief, has just been given parole after a few years in prison for the one crime he got caught for. So naturally the first thing he does is get in touch with old partner Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), now teaching stupid Hollywood teen stars how to play poker, and they assemble a crew (his 'Eleven') for a stunningly audacious heist - he's going to break into the vault that holds the cash for three of Las Vegas's biggest casinos during a world heavyweight title fight. Ocean also plans to steal his ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts) off Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the owner of the casinos.<br/><br/>It's a heist movie, and as such there are a few basic elements - experienced pros, talented youth (Matt Damon), beautiful love interest, evil villain, super-secure safe. Yes, it's predictable in its basic plot, but the real pleasure in the movie comes from watching the ingenious robbery unfold, twists, turns, problems and all, and the considerable charm of the stellar cast. The deadpan Pitt and Clooney  and the snakelike Andy Garcia are particularly good, and there are some excellent lines:<br/><br/>Clooney: 'What happened to Billy X?' Pitt: 'Dead.' C: 'He got shot?'

True, (as in M:I) there's nothing surprising or remarkably original, but at least the atmosphere of overall coolness of these apparently very amateurish casino robbers who will succeed against all odds AND, accordingly, without much regard for plot credibility, is made thoroughly enjoyable simply by fun dialogues and actors who, yes, all play the type of character they're most well-known for --- and best at.

","Spoiler warning, of course. When cinema historians look back on the late nineties/early noughties work of Steve Soderbergh they will surely marvel that any director could have such a rich and fertile few years, producing hit after hit, charming both critics and audiences alike.  How long can this last?  Who cares, when the stuff he comes up with is as exciting and entertaining as this?  ""The Limey"", ""Erin Brockovich"", ""Traffic"" and now ""Ocean's Eleven"".  Every one of them, in their own way and on their own terms, a classic.  Soderbergh, as director and - under a pseudonym - cinematographer, creates in each of his recent films a richly-textured, brilliantly-coloured, thoroughly watchable entertainment.  For what it's worth, this is Soderbergh in full-on Hollywood mode, packing his film with regulars Clooney, Roberts and Cheadle, along with newcomers to the fold - Pitt, Damon, Garcia and - holy cow - Elliot f**ckin Gould.  How could this film be anything other than fantastic? Easily, actually, in the hands of just about anyone else.  Imagine if this were your standard Hollywood fare, full of fast, meaningless action, pointless violence, desperately unamusing dialogue, crap sentiment and, probably, unnecessary sex.  How cool would that be?  But, in the hands of Soderbergh, the come-back kid himself, this is subtle, fast-paced yet somehow leisurely, effortlessly cool and crammed with smart dialogue: check out the two scenes with Clooney and Roberts - the first is non-stop back-and-forth, harking back to the great days of Howard Hawks without being irritating or post-f**cking-modern, while the second seems to be heading in the same direction when Clooney suddenly stops it in its tracks with the great line: ""I just came to say goodbye"".  And there's a shot of the two of them, in profile, looking at each other, and the film pauses to let us savour this moment, and it is, quite simply, superb. All involved seem to be aware this is the chance to make something entertaining and memorable and - yes, I'll say it again - cool.  Clooney is breathtaking to watch.  Pitt is hilarious.  Roberts is either falling to bits (are her lips natural? It seems unlikely) or gorgeous, depending on the lighting.  Is this Soderbergh's little joke?  Cheadle is great value, as always, as the cockney electronics expert (I'm not making this up).  His accent is just one of the many incidental pleasures of this fine movie. Matt Damon is as unirritating as it's possible for Matt Damon to be.  Draw your own conclusions.  Elliott f**ckin Gould is f**ckin great, of course.<br/><br/>The robbery itself is meticulous and ridiculous and completely unbelievable, but in a good way.  Soderbergh and Ted Andrews (who wrote the damn thing and deserves a great deal of credit) are clever enough to realise that what really makes this film is the relationship between the chief protagonists.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Soderbergh's talents as a cinematographer are on full display again.  He must be getting bored with people going on about how great his films look, but really, is there anyone else out there (apart, maybe, from the Coen Brothers at their best, and Terry Zwigoff) who understands how to make a movie look so seductively brilliant (in both senses of the word)? That last sentence is a mess, but I kind of like it, so I'm keeping it in. I have to go now - parole hearing - but I'll leave you with one final message: see ""Ocean's Eleven"" and remind yourself how great Hollywood populist art can be."

All in all, I enjoyed the movie. It was well paced by Soderbergh (any more of some of the minor characters such as the Mormon Brothers and they would have got annoying), with excellent performances by Clooney and Pitt, and finally completed by an ace David Holmes soundtrack. However, reflecting on the film afterwards, I realised some of its gaping plot holes. Damon's transformation from bungling amatuer to suave super-thief in a matter of minutes was highly unbelievable, despite a fine performance Julia Roberts was wooden (although to be fair it was an underwritten role) and the less said about Don Cheadle's cockney accent the better - what's wrong with casting a real Brit?

","Like me start off by saying I'm a fan of Steven Soderbergh. I think both ""Erin Brockovich"" & ""Traffic"" were two of the best films of 2000! But, ""Ocean's Eleven"", just didn't work for me. I didn't want to go see this film in the first place, but, a friend of mine dragged me to go see it. I admit, I did like it more than I expected, but, it's not something I would recommend that people I know should go see. ""Ocean's Eleven"" tries to keep the spirit of the original. It tries to stay loose and free-spirited. Witty, and intelligent. But, somewhere along the line, we're just not buying what it's selling. It tries to be serious and aloof whenever it feels like it. That's a mistake. There's an old saying that goes, you can't have your cake and eat it too! Make up your mind! Which way do you want this film to go? I don't mind if they wanted the film to be a fun, silly homage to the original, but don't try to get all serious on me! Like how the ending tries. The screenplay by Ted Griffin at times is sharp and funny. The character are not dumbed down. They know what they are doing, and they do it well. The acting between everyone however seems, sorta stiff. I didn't feel a connection between everyone on screen. I mean, I'm sure they had fun while making the movie, but that doesn't completely show on-screen. I didn't feel a lost romance between Clooney and Roberts at all. And it's like that for all the characters. Another problem I had with the film is, there are too, too many character, so many infact that no one has anything to work with! Clooney, Pitt, Roberts, Garcia, Damon, Cheadle, Gould, Reiner, Affleck, Mac, & Caan are all struggling for screen time. The so called ""supporting"" cast actually has just as much time as the supposed ""stars"" of the film. Carl Reiner, who is probably billed as the 20th person, actually has more screen time and a greater importance to the story then Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia,& Elliot Gould! Infact it's Reiner's, Gould's and Roberts' show all the way! That's right! Forget Clooney and Pitt. I had more fun watching Carl Reiner, then any of them. I would love to see him nominated for a ""Best Supporting Actor"" Oscar, and believe it or not, but, that buzz is flying around. Elliot Gould is someone I enjoyed watching as well. These guys (Reiner and Gould) are such pros that, they don't need to seem over-pushy to steal scenes. They do it by remaining subtle. They may seem like they are doing very little, but, when the film is over, you'll probably remember them more then the other characters. As for Julia Roberts, well, I like for the obvious reasons. Plus she's the only female in the cast. But other wise, there's nothing here for her. For someone who's just won an Oscar, she's been playing very bland roles lately. This and ""America's Sweethearts"". The directing by Soderbergh admittedly does have it's moments. But, this film is just a walk in the park for everyone. This seems to be the reason why everyone likes this movie. To me, this is trying to turn a negative into a positive. I've seen much worst films this year, but, for all the hype to one got, I would of thought this would of turned out better. ** 1\2 out of ****"

If 'Gone in 60 Seconds' can have Angelina Jolie, couldn't we have had one or two women in the 'gang'? I liked the cast, but if this movie had been made 30 years ago, the likes of Newman and McQueen would have insisted on a greater female presence, I'm sure. And the soundtrack. Where was it? It needed an injection of music and glitz to really get it going. Apart from these side issues, I enjoyed it, but couldn't help feeling that it could have been so much more, with the ingredients on show. The highlight had to be the 'outtake', if that's what it was originally, between Clooney and Pitt. I'd like to think that it was an ad-lib which they left in.

Of the actors on display Clooney and Pitt are good, Don Cheadle sports a horrible cockney accent (at least, that's what it's supposed to be). Andy Garcia is superb -as usual, although I don't recall him playing a villain very often.<br/><br/> And maybe this is the thing - because Andy Garcia plays his part so well - as the highly professional, no-nonsense casino owner, he actually manages to become the most likeable character. Whilst he's supposed to be the 'baddie', he is of course actually the one getting f... getting screwed over. Of course he's made out to be the devil incarnate when he says he'd take $160 mil over Julia Roberts but then...well so would I! (mind you, in a strange way they both come to the same thing). However, since the last scene shows his two goons following Brad, George and Jules, it is intimated that he may yet have the last laugh (basically - you decide).<br/><br/> Other than that, many of the film's jokes are rather weak; in fact Soderburgh seems to simply rely on Clooney and Pitt's facial expressions to generate humour, which probably works well in the US, but maybe not so well here. Oh - and the Chinese bloke, because as we all know the Chinese are simply there for our amusement. Humour aside, the technical details of the heist are absurd: ""Yeah well we'll use part of a nuclear bomb to disable all of Vegas for a minute or so, to turn off the power to laser detecting things, and once we're in the vault, we'll phone Andy up and tell him he can have half his money if he lets us out, only...we aren't really there. We're the SWAT team that Andy calls to sort out the situation and................zzzzzzzzzz<br/><br/> Ultimately the film has a certain gloss that is rather attractive, and the robbery sequence (a good half hour of the film, maybe more) is involving enough to elevate Ocean's 11 in to the 'watch but don't buy category'."

Ok, I don't like them very much and this almost 2 hour movie has them too much.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts has bad role. She just seems to hang around in the movie and she tries to make everything out of her minimalistic and pointless role. She is very capable actress as you can see in Erin Brockovich.<br/><br/>
Otherwise acting of the whole crew is good, too bad they don't have good roles.

","... as, for that matter, are guys like Elliot Gould's decadent mentor and Andy Garcia's ruthless casino boss. Every (male) member of the cast comes together to contribute tellingly to a very entertaining movie. Okay, there are flaws; Don Cheadle's Cockney accent is needless and inconsistent, and the character of Tess Ocean takes a backseat to the boys schemes, but these minor quibbles don't prevent enjoyment in watching an audacious job so slickly executed. For both the central conceit and the movie itself could have proved to be nothing more than a daring folly committed by people with ideas above their station. Thankfully, in both cases everything goes off without a hitch, and the result is a fun watch.<br/><br/>There is little to be said about the two considered 'leads' of the movie.<br/><br/>Both Clooney and Pitt are rarely dull in their on screen endeavours, and this is no exception, it's just that the effect is doubled by having both in the cast at once. Matt Damon is great to watch in a different role from his often brash characters. Cheadle is OK, but if anything is the weak link in the team (he is definitely not helped by his odd patois.) It is nice to see Roberts here, but did she really need to be in this? I don't think so. Her presence only clutters up an already complicated roster and is ultimately an unnecessary distraction to both lead characters and audience.<br/><br/>Garcia shows just what a class act he is, and Reiner is nothing less than amazing in such exalted company. Director Soderbergh makes control of the film look like second nature, which probably means that every single shot was painstaking and laborious. Even though I personally was one of the few who failed to be charmed by ""Out of Sight"", it was clear from watching THAT effort that the helmer was enormously talented. With films such as ""Erin Brockovitch"" and now ""Ocean's 11"", he adds yet more credence to that theory.<br/><br/>At times the film almost becomes TOO cool. This at first seems like an absurd criticism to level at the film, but the brains behind the operation are so self assured and confident that they will succeed, there is never any doubt about the outcome. ""This is Hollywood"", you cry, ""and therefore it is obvious they will win in the end"". That may be so, but most movies make concessions to dramatic tension, this one doesn't really bother.<br/><br/>This is best illustrated by Clooney/Ocean's capitulation towards the end.<br/><br/>The character gets caught for very specific reasons that are revealed before the film draws to a close, and it is made obvious that this needn't have happened unless it was planned by the crook, since the other 10 get away scott free. It is this cheeky jab in the face of authority that makes you feel like nothing could go wrong for the gang, except if they wanted it to; and it doesn't.<br/><br/>This development also brings up the only other minor flaw that I can think of. I am prepared to accept the notion that Ocean (oops, poet and don't know it!) is willing to endure prison in order to win back his 'lost love', and I can even understand why Tess leaves Benedict after seeing him prepared to ditch her for his money. Why, however, does Tess not being with Benedict suddenly in one swoop resolve all her differences with Ocean? Why? Because this is Hollywood, that's why; and it's a plot element that needed a little more attention in order to be convincing, but because it is so near the end, this problem gets neglected in the rush to conclude.<br/><br/>I've only mentioned two major flaws, and it's a stretch to even ATTEMPT to come up with any more, because by and large the job done is so professional. The cast and crew obviously put a lot of effort, craft and fun into making this, so you should reward them for their efforts by checking it out. See it."

","This is not a bad film  but neither is it particularly good. On the plus side, how pleasant to have a caper movie that doesn't involve guns, violence and multifarious `things exploding'. On the down side, however, if it is a caper then it really needs a bit more tension and suspense to engage our attention. The eleven crooks of the title are all OK guys (allowing that Don Cheadle obviously learnt his accent at the Dick Van Dyke School of Cockney). Wouldn't it have been so much more enjoyable if one of the eleven had been incompetent, or even better, a potential traitor in their midst? That really would have injected some tension. But the casino owner (Garcia) is not an OK guy so the outcome can be guessed without too much difficulty.<br/><br/>
Then it's all a matter of hi-tech skulduggery as the thieves plot to make their way into the casino vaults in an attempt to help themselves to a cool $160m. The plot has as many holes as a Swiss cheese. But who cares when the whole caper nearly grinds to a halt for want of a couple of AA batteries just after they've managed to black out the whole of Las Vegas.<br/><br/>
Many will see this film for no other reason than the star cast list  just like the original version of some 40 years ago. Most of the crew seem to be enjoying themselves and Elliot Gould steals every scene he's in. Julia Roberts wanders in and out, although quite why is anyone's guess. She looks lost and confused for much of the time. But then she does appear in the credits as `Introducing Julia Roberts' so maybe she's right to look perplexed by all that's going on around her.<br/><br/>If you've nothing to better to do on a wet Wednesday in Wigan this would be a harmless and reasonably enjoyable way of whiling away a couple of hours. But if it's real excitement or suspense you're after don't bother. It ends on a worrying note  a potential sequel seems to be lined up. Let's hope it's another 40 years before it gets made. That way I, for one, won't give a damn, by then being in the great movie (rather than casino) vault in the sky."

","The remake of Oceans 11 turned out to be more like the original one than I had thought.  The best thing about this movie is the banter between the actors, just like in the original.  There are a lot of really funny lines (some of them aren't delivered well though).  That and some nice cinematography is basically the only thing I really liked about this movie. The plot is very slick, too slick if you ask me.  After explaining how impossible it will be to get into a mega-vault in order to steal $160 million from three Las Vegas casinos, the 11 guys proceed to do it almost without breaking a sweat.  There are only a few brief sequences where they fear that something may actually go wrong, and even in those scenes the tension doesn't seem as intense as it should be.  Maybe that's because the lead guy, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) can do  prison time with no trouble at all.  When the movie starts, Ocean has just been released after 4 years in prison but there is only a slight mention of how hard prison life was for him.  He even has some banter with the parole board as he's being released. As for the characters, all the actors do suitable jobs but there is no character development.  They try to create some by giving some of the characters a quirky habit (one guy sweats a lot, Brad Pitt is constantly eating, etc).  Plus, these guys must be the cleanest criminals the world has ever known.  They're clean cut, well dressed, and they don't even swear a lot.  Even the stripper in one scene is fully dressed. So it seems, despite their denials that's it's a totally different movie than the original, the more things change the more they stay the same."
"venkat_rs","6","0","1","17 February 2002"," Entertaining
","The casting coup, though not quite matching up to K3G, would still draw big crowds. Hopping onto the bandwagon is Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brockovich), the flavour of the year 2000.<br/><br/>
The movie is a re-make of a 1960s one with same name, starring the 'Ratpack' led by Frank Sinatra. In short, the story deals with eleven men joining hands to loot three casinos in Las Vegas (where else?). The plot and cast arousing a good deal of interest, Soderbergh wouldn't need to worry about marketing. <br/><br/>After an initial good pace, the movie slightly slows down and then picks up steam in the second half. The planning and execution of the robbery are impressive, with some surprises and subtle humour packed in. Some glaring loop-holes and cliches in the screenplay become forgivable. <br/><br/>Clooney strides his part like a king, while Pitt is stylish. The rest are adequate in their small roles. Soderbergh maintains his trademark slick and realistic narration, aided by intelligent editing.<br/><br/>
Overall, an enjoyable movie, enhanced by the presence of big stars."

","I thoroughly enjoyed this film except for one glaring blemish. Contrary to the summary given by Duncan Gowars, I thought that Don Cheadle rendered one of the worst English accents I've heard since Dick van Dyke in 'Mary Poppins'. Years ago it may have been difficult to find English actors to fit specific characters, but I find it hard to believe that a more suitable candidate could not be found to fill this role - especially when English films/actors are so abundant and popular. I did, however, happily remove my fingers from my ears when the dialogue did not involve Cheadle; the rest of the cast gave wonderful performances."
"abhishek-1","6","0","1","6 February 2002"," Eleven guys on a joyride!!!
","'Ocean's Eleven', a film that was originally made in 1960 with: Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack; and without: success, took someone of a calibre and grit that only Steven Soderbergh possesses; to be remade. But this time around, the film turns out to be an interesting ride, thanks mainly to an amazingly cool and hip cast and an improved script. Using James Bond-like gadgetry and an unreal approach to the proceedings, the film makes for interesting and arrested viewing.<br/><br/>The story of 'Ocean's Eleven' revolves around Danny Ocean(George Clooney), a thief just out of prison and ready for his next heist: robbing three Las Vegas casinos in one night. As much impossible as this sounds, it is but obvious that he needs to assemble probably the world's best men on this project. Here begins the search for the best of the best. It is this phase of the movie and the subsequent preparation for the big night that is probably the most entertaining. This assimilation of various people, excellent at what they do, includes Rusty(Brad Pitt), Linus Caldwell(Matt Damon), Basher Tarr(Don Cheadle), Tishkoff(Elliot Gould), Frankie(Bernie Mac), the Malloy brothers(Scott Caan, Casey Affleck), a Chinese acrobat(Shaobo Qin), a computer wizard(Edward Jemison), and an old-timer Bloom(Carl Reiner). As each one of them prepares for their respective roles in this ""biggest heist ever"", Rusty begins to suspect Ocean's real motives: acquisition of the money or the retrieval of his lost love Tess(Julia Roberts), now with the owner of these three casinos; Terry Benedict(Andy Garcia). How the story moves from here till the ultimate robbery is brilliantly held together by a tight script and an awesome climax with a twist, if you may call it so!<br/><br/>The high point of this movie, apart from the studded star cast, is the performance put in by each actor. Everyone performs their role with effortless ease. Also, none of the cast appears to be affected by the presence of the other. This works wonderfully for the movie, as not only does the cast have a lot of fun but every single member of the audience feels comfortable. The other thing that works in this movie's favour is that it doesn't stick only to the heist but dwelves into other seemingly less-important but highly effective areas like the moments of interaction between Clooney and Roberts, with the latter trying to resist the charms of the former. The dialogues are void of profanity, which makes these characters innocent and hence, likable. Almost midway through the movie, you begin to view the ""11"" not as crooks but as your friends trying to make through an examination that you very much feel a part of yourself. At times, one does wonder at the ease at which these guys go through their work. But, then considering that most of the film proceeds like a fantasy, you might as well let it be a fable.<br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh clearly showcases his variety of talent by making a movie as commercial and racy as this, especially after movies like 'Erin Brockovich' and 'Traffic'. This is one person who has every right to swagger. He does let his trademark penchant for quirky visuals creep in, in those frequent flashes and the scene with the entire 'Eleven"" at the end. Mr. Soderbergh, take a bow!<br/><br/>From the cast, it is Pitt who excels as he suavely walks through his portrayal of Rusty. George Clooney does his part with all earnest. This is one man who can make audiences(read ""women"") swoon just by giving a tilt to his head. Julia Roberts and Matt Damon are wasted in roles that were underwritten, but this doesn't stop them from bringing themselves to the notice of everyone. Andy Garcia does good enough to be liked in the role of the only unlikeable character in the movie. The others perform their roles honestly, but the surprise package comes from Carl Reiner as the old and worn-out Bloom. His screen-presence makes you feel as warm as the cookies prepared by your Grandma. Just for this cast, that will almost definitely never be reassembled, this movie's worth a watch.<br/><br/>Rating- ***<br/><br/>* Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent"

","We've all seen and heard great and not-so-great stories or films about big thefts, great robbers and their abilities (in most of the cases) to fulfill impossible missions and also making us (in some good way) identify ourselves with characters not supposed to be doing good things after all. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1970), Bonnie and Clyde (1968), Bandits (2001) are only few samples of such lovely connection.<br/><br/>This time we have ""Ocean's Eleven"" the follow-up and highly anticipated film from the critically acclaimed and academy award winning director of ""Traffic"", Steven Soderbergh who makes a truly enjoyable movie and accepts the challenge (like not so many directors) to take this group of big stars to work this good as a big team for a big production.<br/><br/>The story is simple. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is a nice modern gangster who rounds up a gang of associates to make a huge theft of the three major Las Vegas casino's (Bellagio, The Mirage, and the MGM Grand) simultaneously during a boxing event. These gang associates are form by good actors such as Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould among others.<br/><br/>Director Soderbergh makes a very light and all-around well-done film with a very nice comic atmosphere that has no exaggerations in its plot.<br/><br/>
The cinematography is very elegant and pretty effective for night-time in Las Vegas' environment. And finally, but not the least, the actors performances which without any hesitation you could say that are one of the better all-around cast performances seen for a long time.<br/><br/>The only observation I would say it is the fact that there are very few sections of the movie where there's a little bit of extra fantasy for certain situations but Mr. Soderbergh cover them all with a sense of humor that is truly magical.<br/><br/>Robinson Almanzar."

"nowonmai42","Null","0","1","3 February 2002"," A wasted opportunity that should be much more fun than it is
","Ocean's Eleven<br/><br/>`Ocean's Eleven' is like a party with no beer. All the elements for a great time are in place - fun folks, nice scenery, a lighthearted mood. But no one there will have the cubes to let loose and have a really good time without a little help from the friendly neighborhood liquor store. In this case, the beer is the script, and it's far less substantive than a pint of Guiness, although possibly more thick-headed. I guess the draw for all the big names above the title was the chance to work with a lot of other big names, but even toned, finely tanned celebrity bungholes can't make crap smell like potpourri. Everyone is trying way too hard to prove they can relax and have a good time. It's a shame, because there's far too much talent here for this film to be so flat and uninteresting. George Clooney is Danny Ocean, yet another thief who begins planning a job immediately after being paroled. Ripping off a few casinos seems like a good idea because A) they're owned by the greaseball who's tagging his ex-wife, and 2) he'll need a large cast of famous actors, each with a criminal forte, to help him do it. Matt Damon is the best pickpocket in the country. Don Cheadle not only knows explosives, but is also the only living Cockney who translates his rhyming slang for the tragically un-hip. Elliot Gould is the financier. And Brad Pitt is the fleshy-jowled, perfectly stubbled co-George Clooney. Now you might think, as I did, that an eleven-man crew is a pretty large assembly for a robbery. However, this particular heist seems to have room for virtually every crime there is, and therefore room for lots of stars to commit them. They're all so at ease in their specialties, in fact, that they have plenty of time for all sorts of witty quips and bawdy ripostes. The script, unfortunately, provides them with mostly pedestrian stuff. The rhythm of their banter is so predictable, their wisecracks so telegraphed, that I wondered if anyone had actually read any of it prior to signing on. Worst of all, `Ocean's Eleven' focuses entirely on its central heist. Director Steven Soderbergh here dispenses with his trademark quick, overlapping-cuts and other directorial flair, apparently under the assumption that star power is enough. Or perhaps he didn't give this film the care of his past superb work under the pretense of `just having fun.' The heist genre is by now hackneyed enough that any flick will be just that unless one brings some new perspective to it. There's none of that here, just a lot of acid-lounge funk in the background to remind us how cool everyone and everything is. Why? Because they steal things? Poor Julia Roberts, as the highbrow object of Ocean's Affection - her choices are between a millionaire sleaze or a slick ex-con? This script never considers allowing her to make the choice that screams to be recognized in the mind of anyone watching, namely a condescending rejection of both these losers. No, her thankless role requires her to remember all over again why she fell for that piercing, over-the-brow Clooney stare in the first place. Amazing how $150 million can refresh the memory. The journey from elegant casino `curator' to the world's most expensive escort is a large one to make in two hours, but `Ocean's Eleven' proves it can be done if you don't bother with pesky character development. `Ocean's Eleven' is bound to make a box office killing, despite being released between `Harry Potter' and `The Lord of the Rings.' It will also probably be praised for allowing its all-star cast to let their pompadours down for a bit and have a good time. What it really is, though, is a colossal missed opportunity that won't define the subsequent work of anyone involved, if we're lucky."

I bet the excellent cast (by reputation) had a wonderful time as so much great actors were combined in one film. It is not that I did not enjoy this film, but rather that it leaves a very odd taste in my nervous system. This is a film without much suspense, many thrills, laughs or anything above normal rate and despite some flaws still manages to entertain. It just has a certain something I cannot really name, although I suspect what it is. It is the fact that the job is pulled by decent criminals, led by the most decent, gentleman - like villain there ever was in film history, George Clooney. The fact that he is around gives this film extra charm that makes it worth seeing. George Clooney puts in that certain something.<br/><br/>

","Ocean's Eleven is a cover of a story we've all seen a billion times. A bunch of gentle, smart, mostly good looking thieves robs the world's safest safe in the world's brightest city. A stars parade like few other, with an intricate and highly unrealistic plot, with far too many details and characters. I think director Steve Soderbergh and the cast can't fully control so much, and everything turns out as entertaining and light, but dull and easily forgotten. This is perfect if you want to spend a couple of hours in a pleasant, relaxing way. Pitt, Clooney, and Gould look like they had lots of fun, all the other actors are a bit suffocated by the story."

","Having been listening to all the good reviews I was so looking forward to seeing this film, with its cast of handsome men and all, but was quite disappointed.  I have not seen the original so I guess I went in expecting a much better story -- expectations set by the more recent and much better heist movies like The Score.<br/><br/>I was also expecting it to be funny.  It wasn't.  There may have been a couple of amusing lines but none that I can remember. And it took forever to gather up those 11 characters -- and none of those meetings were in any way memorable.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts looked awful (almost as bad as she looked when she played Tinkerbell in Hook) and there was NO chemistry between her and Clooney, or between her and Garcia for that matter.  As for the handsome men -- Clooney was so much more interesting as the erudite convict in O Brother, and Pitt has had more appeal in just about every other movie I can think of that he's played in.  <br/><br/>Also, in most movies of this ilk, one is supposed to find oneself rooting for the lovable crooks because they are doing it to someone really evil or they are at least morally superior.  But I didn't find Terry Benedict (Garcia)to be that bad of a guy -- he was just an aggressive businessman minding his business, or these guys to be that lovable.  So, there was no big satisfaction in seeing him getting ripped off big time.<br/><br/>It wasn't awful, but was a lot less satisfying than I expected, and I did have trouble staying awake.  5/10"

","Oceans Eleven is a classic flick that should  never have been remade. No offence to the creators of this film but you destroyed a classic. I'm certain that the rat pack are all turning in their graves right now. The first major problem with this remake is its new cast. Simply, too many big stars in the one picture. If you are a fan of Julia Roberts for example, don't see this movie as her screen time doesn't last long. The other problem with this film is the fact that it tries to be like ""Out Of Sight"" to much. With fast cuts and tight frames, etc I felt it to be very similar. On a positive note, it is a fun movie and will deliver satisfaction to those who have never seen the original. Do yourself a favor, check out the original on video/dvd."

","You expect a lot with a cast like the one in this movie, which probably is one reason you may end up disappointed. Somehow all these good actors just didn't work. Can't remember the original, though I saw it years ago, and can say the same about this one. Remakes very seldom work, but apparently lack of good original scripts makes the studios shoot out all these remakes. The funny notion was that Julia Roberts walked on the high heels like a farm girl. She could've have had heavy boots on just the same. Otherwise a fantastic actress, but if she isn't used to heels like that, why make her wear them. For me this was a waste of time and money."

The whole thing amounted to absolutely nothing - equalling, some cruel observationalists might nominate, Julia Roberts' contribution to the flick!<br/><br/>So far LESS than the sum of its parts OCEANS ELEVEN is only marginally better than the lack-luster original which had much the same effect on me in 1961!

One of the major problems I believe is the rather disjointed and episodic mini-drama intercuts that Soderbergh has cobbled together as a hi-tech film. For me, it just didn't work, in fact I was amusing myself mentally in the theater,  wondering just how much difference it would have made to the film if the laborious ""lead-up"" vignettes as they basically are, were edited together in a totally different order. I doubt anyone would either notice or care! <br/><br/>Hell of a waste of Clooney - he carried himself AND Danny Ocean quite brilliantly. I hope they make THE RETURN OF DANNY OCEAN one day with John Frankenheimer directing! Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict, the fantatically cashed up and soulless triple Casino owner was great, while Elliot Gould pulled off the role of his career, despite minimal screen time, as rival Casino owner Reuben Tishkoff.<br/><br/>Pitt has managed rave notices for his role - why I can't imagine? and Damon and the rest of the (almost) dirty dozen are simply on-hand. The last mega embarrassing five minutes of the flick totally sink it, with the chummy group gazing up into the sky on cue waiting desperately for someone to make some worthwhile comment.

","In this eagerly awaited, star-studded remake of the 60s rat-pack crime-caper of the same name, Soderbergh manages to combine his dry sense of wit, beautifully stilized camerawork and a few enjoyable performances in a very pleasant way. Admittedly, Soderbergh ignores the fact that his plot doesn't really hold together at times, also the insertion of various catchy one-liners feels fabricated and forced on a few occasions, but all things considered there's a lot of fun to be had here if you don't take it all too seriously as some critics have. Granted, Ocean's Eleven doesn't tacklesocial problematics (nor did Soderbergh aim to in the first place of course)  and it certainly isn't a masterpiece but it creates a very uncomplicated, laid-back vibe that is really enjoyable most of the time. This must be largely accredited to the dialogue which is very witty most of the time. The actors all seem very at ease and it is easy to sympathise with these charming crooks, a special notice goes to Versace-clad ex-casino bigshot Elliot Gould. Which leaves for a few minor mishaps which I will address briefly. First of all the character of Julia Roberts isn't very essential to the plot, nor is her appearance special in any way. Therefore it's a shame her storyline with George Clooney takes up so much time in the later part of the story, which concludes in an unnecessarily predictable and well rounded ending. I believe a cameo-appearance would have been more than enough and I'm afraid the scribes were forced to squeeze Roberts into the story. Secondly there is very little character-development or motivation for that matter. Also, no effort is taken to bring any nuance to the 'villain'-character of Andy Garcia, whereas it would have been more interesting to see any redeeming traits in his personality. Garcia delivers a very unremarkable performance that won't raise any eyebrows. Just don't expect Ocean's Eleven to change cinematic landscape for the years to come and you will be fine after two hours well spent."

The acting is excellent and serves the plot very well. And last but not least there is a moving romantic touch concerning the relationship between the chief crook and his ex-wife now dating the owner of the held-up casino.

This is a remake of an earlier Rat Pack movie-although I have not seen the movie, I enjoyed this remake very much. The plotline is fairly simple: George Clooney (as Danny Ocean), recently released from prison, has a plan to steal $150 million from a  group of casinos. He enlists 11 men to aid him in this: hence the title, Ocean's 11. To say much more would tend to give away a few of the better twists to the plot, so I will simply end by saying: looking for a great movie to see with a friend, a date, or even by yourself? An intelligent movie, with something to offer everyone? And best of all, a movie without gore, or excessive profanity, a movie appropriate for anyone? Make Ocean's 11 your choice!"

","I watched the original OCEAN'S 11 about six years ago when I was in my Las Vegas kick.  I enjoyed the plot of eleven men trying to rob five casino's (Flamingo, Sands, Desert Inn, Rivera, and Sahara) at the same time on New Year's Eve.  The problem is that the movie took about an hour to get started talking about the heist and once it was done it was like, ho-hum. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie more the more times I watched it, but seeing Ol' Blue Eyes, Dean, Sammy, Peter, and Pal Joey pulling pranks on the Russian boss who is put together the heist and and playing pranks on each other, it reminded me of party crashing someone's party, or watching a party that happened eons ago.  I thought that a remake of OCEAN'S 11 would be a great movie, if it is done in a caper-heist style.  Steve Soddenberg thought so also, and now his latest film is the remake of OCEAN'S 11. Instead of a modern ""Rat Pack"" Soddenberg casted well played actors for his version.  Replacing ""One Take Frank"" is George Clooney as Danny Ocean. That is a perfect casting choice, I can't think of another actor out there who is super-cooler than Clooney.  Ocean is just released from a minimum New Jersey State Prison after serving five years.  He immediately violates parole by seeing his old partner Dusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) in Hollywood.  Danny suggests to Dusty to not rob one but three casinos in Las Vegas (Belliago, Mirage, & MGM Grand), the three biggest money making casinos all owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia).  Danny wants to get revenge on Terry because Terry is engaged to Danny's ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts) which Danny is still in love with, and Danny wants to win Tess back.  Danny and Dusty put together a team fianced by Ruben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) a former casino manager, who's casino was bought out by Benedict to have it be demolished in a ground-breaking ceremony.  The team includes Danny, Dusty, Ruben, Frank (Bernie Mac) a blackjack dealer, Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle) a demolitions expert, Virgil and Turk Malloy (Casey Affleck & Scott Cann) two screwball mechanics, Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) a gambler, a electronics expert (Edward Jenison), a carnival trapeeze artist (Shaobo Quin), and Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) a master pickpocket.  Together these 11 men try to pull off a heist that has never been done in Las Vegas, up against a man who will not only ruin the lives of those trying to rob him, but also the lives of the would-be robber's family. OCEAN'S 11 is a film that Soddenberg made only for ""entertainment purposes.""  OCEAN'S does pull something off that has never been done in Hollywood in a long time: IT'S BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL!!!!  This movie is fast, funny, exciting, and entertaining all at the same time.  I just watched the original OCEAN'S 11 again last week, I think it will be a while before I can sit down and watch the Rat Pack again.  This version I have already seen twice and plan on seeing it again!      Soddenberg chops out all the slow romance borning parts of the original, and the sub-plot involving Ceaser Romero and makes this version very enjoyable.  I was amazed that Soddenberg got permission to shoot this movie inside the Belliago casino, since it is the target of getting robbed in the film. The shots of Las Vegas are beautiful (like Dean Martin sang in ""Ain't That A Kick In the Head."")  There is one shot in the movie of a Las Vegas blackout that blew my mind away, how many of you could imagine a complete blackout in Las Vegas?      The acting and dialogue between the actors is another major standout. Lines like, Ocean: ""Does he (Terry) make you laugh?""  Tess: ""He doesn't make me cry the way I use to.""  Ouch!  Sharp dialogue even from the heroine, that is very rare.  The dialogue between the 11 guys, Tess, and Terry are all enjoyable, it's the kind of dialogue that made PULP FICTION and JERRY MAGUIRE well liked and famous movies that are still being quoted today. Clooney and Pitt do stand out with their acting from the crew, but Gould and Reiner also do impressive jobs also stealing the show from Clooney and Pitt that it shows that old dogs still have what it takes to run the show. <br/><br/>     Is OCEAN'S 11 the best movie of the year?  No, is it the most entertaining?  You betcha!  This is the kind of popcorn movie that I enjoy: big stars, flashy locations, sharp dialogue, and wonderful plot twists.  Now I think Michael Bay, Simon West, Jan De Bont, and Stephen Sommers need to all sit down and watch this movie.  That way they can get an idea on how to make a big budget entertaining film that works, and not fizzles (i.e. TOMB RAIDER, MUMMY RETURNS, THE HAUNTING, etc.)  Classic film, no, enjoyable and watchable more than once? definitly! ***** (out of five)"

"johnprestonevans","7","0","1","27 December 2001"," 11 Reason to See Ocean's 11
","1. Its Funny.  The banter between the characters is sometimes labored at being clever and cool - a fallout from Pulp Fiction.  Some of the discusion is funny and the quirks and talents of its players will bring a smile to your face from time to time.<br/><br/>2. Brad Pitt.  The ever-eating, sharply dressed brain of the outfit is played well by Pitt, who serves up a couple of laughs and cool handed tricks to make ladies eyes dilate.<br/><br/>3. Clever twists.  The typical moviegoer will applaud the antics and mastery of these elite thieves, and just when we think we have everything figured out, there is one more trick to make us applaud again.<br/><br/>4. George Clooney.  His dry and cool maner is great in his role as the lead idea man.  His suave moves and slick lines are enough to win back a reluctant ex-love-interest, and fool the tough alter-ego alpha male.<br/><br/>5. Cameos.  There are more than a few cameos of A and B list movie stars who appear in small supporting scenes in the film.  Most of them however, are probably just happy to say that they were in a movie with Pitt, Clooney and Roberts.<br/><br/>6. Matt Damon.  A chameleon of an actor who joins Ocean's crew as a young inexperienced, yet talented con artist and spy.  Damon brings a nice prescence of awkward overconfidence to the all-cool cast of experienced thieves.<br/><br/>7. The Music.  The bright lights of Vegas would be nothing without the big sounds and shows of lounge singers and classic vocalists.  The soundtrack mixes these old school showstoping numbers, with exciting, tense classical music for the more intense robbery scenes.<br/><br/>8. The clothes.  Almost every player in this movie is a picture out of GQ or Cosmopolitan magazine.  Its a wonder if designers lined up at Steven Sodderberg's door begging him to let his glorious cast wear their latest chinos and hipcat suits.<br/><br/>9. The gadgets.  New technology gives way to more ingenious and exciting ways to illustrate a hiest.  In the way that James Bond and Mission Impossible uped the anti with cool gadgets, Oceans 11 finds ways to move the plot along by introducing cutting edge technology.<br/><br/>10. Andy Garcia.

","OCEAN'S ELEVEN  ***_  / Caper Comedy / Dir: Steven Soderbergh George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon<br/><br/>Eleven guys undertake the biggest casino heist in Las Vegas history. A remake of the 1960s Rat Pack film, this version is even better. It is an improbable tale, combining elements of HOW TO STEAL A MILLION and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.

Diversions are nice every now and then.<br/><br/>A great cast that is strengthened by the smaller roles (Bernie Mac, Elliott Gould, Don Cheadle, et. al.), and the big names did not serve as distractions.

Brad Pitt's character is the veteran teaching them and describes it as one of the longest hours of his life.

","Ocean's 11 is another ensemble all-star-cast caper movie.  As such, it is one of the best of that lot, but overall that lot is a sorry lot.  Ocean's 11 reminded most recently of a similar ensemble caper flick of a few year's back, ""Sneakers"" (1992)with Robert Redford and Sidney Poitier.  The reason ensemble cast caper films don't work is that there are too many characters for any of them to get developed in the course of a 2 hour movie.  Both of these films (Ocean's 11 and Sneakers) therefore come off as shallow, undeveloped, and slight.  One of the big attractions of Ocean's 11, that gets us into the theater in the first place, is Julia Roberts, but her character is so poorly developed here that she is little more than window dressing and we never understand her motivations (in fact, she doesn't actually do anything in this movie, when you come right down to it.)  The saving grace of Ocean's 11 is the stylish, sophisticated filmic style brought to it by Steven Soderbergh.  Is is so, so refreshing to see a crime picture without a lot of gunfire.  Still, my wife complained as we left the theater that the film didn't have a climax.  You be the judge--the whole film is a mixed bag that way."

","Director Steven Soderbergh (who won an Oscar for 2000's Traffic) achieved what most film-makers probably couldn't do:  knock Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone out of the #1 box office spot after only 3 weeks on top. Soderbergh's film, Ocean's Eleven grossed $38.1 million on it's opening weekend, devastating Potter's $14.7 million.  How exactly did he perform this feat?  Well, being able to put names like George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon on the bill couldn't have hurt.<br/><br/>The television commercials for Ocean's Eleven manage to introduce 4 or 5 of the main characters, but that doesn't totally do the cast justice.  George Clooney (who previously worked with Soderbergh on 1998's Out of Sight) stars as recently released prisoner, Danny Ocean.  Ocean and partner, Dusty Ryan (played by Brad Pitt), assemble an all-star group of differently-skilled criminals to aid in their robbery of 3 major Las Vegas casinos.  Ocean's Eleven consists of Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle and 5 more names you'll probably recognize.  That 70's Show's Topher Grace (who appeared in Traffic) and Dawson's Creek's Joshua Jackson briefly appear as themselves in a poker game in one of the opening scenes.  Andy Garcia also shines as the owner of the 3 target casinos.  The cast is truly massive, and many of the stars go underused, most notably Julia Roberts who plays Danny's ex-wife Tess, who happens to be dating Andy Garcias character.  Roberts is, for reasons unbeknownst to me, listed proceeding an `and introducing' in the closing credits. Now, if you've seen the commercials, you probably noticed that they're quite unorthodox.  The first time I saw one, I didn't know what to make of it.  The plot was totally unclear, and it was so hip and stylish it would make Quentin Tarintino green with envy.  Well, that hip style is not only represented in the casting but also (more so, even) in the editing. There's a few chic-looking cuts on image/shape, several split screens, and more fancy cuts than you can shake a stick at.  The soundtrack is mostly cool-sounding jazz, which is a reasonable update from the Rat Pack-era that the original film was made in.   The costumes are practically taken straight from the pages of GQ.  The budget on sunglasses alone in this movie would probably rival that of the entire filming of The Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it's divided into three main sections:  the opening (character introductions, plot development, etc.), the middle (planning of the heist and training of the crew) and the ending (the execution of the robbery).  The movie as a whole is quite fast paced.  I didn't stop to look at my watch once during its approximately 100 minute duration.  Each of the three parts of the movie are consistently stylish, funny, action-packed and just plain entertaining.  The dialogue has it's moments of cliché, but those don't take away from the overall likability of the movie.  Screenplay writer Ted Griffin more than successfully updated the 1960 version of this movie for a suave, modern audience. Overall, Ocean's Eleven is the kind of movie you can just sit back and enjoy.  The pacing is quick, and the dialogue is funny, the action is, well, also funny, and it's so packed with stars that Carl Sagan may come back from the dead just to study it.  7.5 out of a possible 10."

","For me Oceans eleven (there is some spoiler info below) epitomizes my reaction to many modern movies with good directing, good acting, but sub par writing.  Either the original was inherently difficult to adapt or it was simply poorly done, because the dialogue is sparse and cliche'd at points. At times they sound like a Dr. Evil parody astounded by the possibility for '1 million' dollars.   Pitt is good, as is clooney (although he still hasn't achieved his potential with a really good movie), but Andy Garcia is way too one dimensional and it's not believable that julila roberts would date him, even it just for the money & lifestyle.  And even the dimension Garcia has ( the nobody's fool anal tough guy) turns out not to be true, as he lets clooney off easy after it should be clear he is implicated in the heist. And speaking of overdone, don't get me started on the chief financer character.  Ocean's eleven attempts to ooze coolness like pulp fiction, but the script just doesn't back it up."
"nromancer","Null","0","1","7 December 2001"," Lightweight but enjoyable.
","After directing gritty movies like ""Traffic"", ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Out of Sight"", Steven Soderbergh decided to take it easy and create a movie whose sole purpose was to entertain.  He's done exactly that with ""Ocean's 11"", an entertaining piece of fluff that mostly delivers.<br/><br/>George Clooney's Danny Ocean leads an all-star ensemble cast in this remake of the 1960 Rat Pack caper picture.  Thief and ex-con Ocean has been recently released from prison and is already planning his magnum opus: the theft of $150 million from three Las Vegas casinos owned by Terry Benedict (a glowering Andy Garcia).<br/><br/>Complicating things is the fact that Benedict is bedding Ocean's soon-to-be-ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts).  But he can't do it alone, so he recruits his friend Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) and a motley group of shady characters, including Cockney demolitions expert ""Basher"" Tarr (Don Cheadle), con man Saul Bloom (a scene-stealing Carl Reiner) and light-fingered pickpocket Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon).  The larcenous crew is rounded out by Bernie Mac, Elliott Gould, Shaobo Qin, Scott Caan and Casey Affleck.  The latter two are frequently hilarious as bickering fraternal twins.<br/><br/>""Ocean's 11"" unfolds smoothly through the standard caper-movie set pieces: the setup, the heist and the getaway.  There's lots of snappy patter, played very nicely by the talented cast.  Clooney is all charm and hipster cool as ringleader Ocean; it contrasts well with the smoldering Garcia.  Cheadle's Tarr is a hoot, if vastly under-used.  Brad Pitt especially manages to act rather than just coasting on his good looks.  <br/><br/>The only real stumbling block is the romantic triangle involving Danny, Tess and Terry.  Roberts and Clooney just don't click.  There simply are no sparks between them, as there were between, say, Clooney and Jennifer Lopez in Out of Sight.  This made it difficult to care about their fractured relationship, and whether or not they would ever make up.  In fact, it was pretty much the only sour note in the movie, but it was a big one; to me, it felt tacked on (pretty much like Frank Sinatra and Angie Dickinson in the original).<br/><br/>And so, to sum up this too-long review:  ""Ocean's 11"" is an enjoyable trifle.  It's not a classic like ""The Sting"", but it could have been much worse.  My grade:  B."
"Kurzbein","7","0","1","27 December 2001"," Well done fluff
","This remake of the Rat Pack original is about what you'd expect out of the material and director.  It possesses a good pace, isn't too indulgent and has a certain style to it.  That it's almost completely predictable is beside the point.<br/><br/>With Pitt, Clooney and Garcia in this film, my wife couldn't have been happier.  The one with whom she's most enamored, Clooney, smirks a lot, can't act and isn't believable.  Luckily Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould and Brad Pitt CAN act, and along with Andy Garcia they put on quite a show.  Reiner, in particular, hits just the right note, and given that he was hired to replace Alan Arkin just days before they started shooting (Arkin had become unavailable due to illness), it's all the more impressive.  Gould, fitted with the perfect wardrobe, was born to play this role.  Years ago Pitt met the fork in his career path and chose ""actor"" over ""movie star"", and that choice is evident here.<br/><br/>More could have been done with the screenplay, particularly the dialogue. It doesn't percolate the way you'd expect it to in a film like this.  Even so, the story telling is tight, and the editing paces the film just right. Soderbergh directs with a sense of style, particularly the post-caper seen in front of the waterfall which is a clever, if incongruous, way to let the actors take a bow.  Basically, this film is fluff, but it's well done fluff."
"CHendri887","Null","0","1","25 December 2001"," I want my money back, Soderbergh
","What was Steven Soderbergh thinking by making this film?  It is just plain awful.  In my opinion, Soderbergh has always been an uneven filmmaker at best--someone who shows great creativity and promise in some ways, but in others just makes really mediocre movies.  This remake of the original ""Ocean's 11"" is definitely one of his more mediocre outings, perhaps his most.  I can't figure out why Soderbergh would be interested in remaking a film such as ""Ocean's 11"" in the first place, but I guess he has a soft spot in his director's genes for crime genre-type flicks (""The Underneath"", ""Out of Sight"").  What doesn't work for me in this film is everything.  It's all so very flat and pointless.  The plot is rushed, boring, and has several holes; the acting is not very engaging; the underlying sexism in the Julia Roberts' character (""O find me a man, a rich man or a gambling criminal or just any man!"")is disturbing (especially considering how fond Soderbergh usually is of more self-assured female characters); and the soundtrack, devoid of longtime co-worker Cliff Martinez's usually engaging ambient musical genius, is more like that of a 70s porn film than anything else. This film is also devoid, for the most part, of two of Soderbergh's most powerful stylistic features:  flashbacks and those visual time distortion things he is so fond of, where characters are having dialogue at one point in time, but the visuals are moving forwards and backwards in time.  I always hope for the best when I watch a movie by Steven Soderbergh, but I usually come away with a mixed and unsatisfied reaction to what I experience.  ""Ocean's 11"" was definitely a Soderbergh low point for me."

","Ocean's Eleven is a boring, smug, lifeless film.  The real shame is that it could have been oh so much better.  All the elements of a great film are there: intriguing premise, incredible cast, and an Oscar winning, stylistic director.  So what went wrong?  The premise really is never interesting as it seems.  The heist goes off so smoothly that the film never builds any tension whatsoever.  The bad guys are never as bad as they are made out to be and stealing from Vegas seems to be as easy as taking candy from a baby. The cast is all star, however they have all been better elsewhere or they aren't given much to do.  Clooney has played this role before in Out of Sight (a much better Soderberg film).  Brad Pitt is cool but he never adds much to the film other than a handsome set piece.  Andy Garcia is the much feared baddie who does nothing but turn the other cheek when his fortune is being robbed.  Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, and Elliot Gould are woefully misused as set dressing rather than full fledged characters.  The film would have been much better had it focused on these characters rather than Clooney and Pitt.  Julia Roberts' skeleton has a mere cameo role and really adds nothing to the picture.  That said, Ocean's Eleven is not a bad film.  It has a few moments of genuine cleverness and a couple of chuckles. But it could have been so much better.  Mamet's Heist, Richie's Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, and Soderberg's own Out of Sight are much better at the robbery game.  I really hope this is a minor stumble in the career of Soderberg and it isn't the Oscar curse that is overtaking him.  We shall see."

The characters were not necessarily dynamic (you do not learn a whole lot about them), but the dialogue helped make them interesting and likeable and the idea of successfully robbing three casinos was intriguing enough to make you want them to succeed in the end.

She is obviously just in the movie for name sake.  George Clooney is adequate as well, and he and Brad Pitt have excellent chemistry and timing.  Unfortunately the dialogue isn't quite up to par with the talent that they bring to the table.  The only thing in this movie that I loved was the poker game at the beginning of the film with Topher Grace, Joshua Jackson and Holly Marie Combs(I think thats her).

","I haven't seen the original ""Ocean's 11,"" and I tried to find it at my local video store, but I couldn't.  However, so far many people who I've heard from who did see the original think that the remake is much better.  And as Richard Roeper said, ""The original 'Ocean's 11' was more popular because of what happened behind the camera than what happened on camera.""  Rarely, do I see a remake that people appraise much more than the original.  I have an English teacher who cringed when she found out they were remaking ""Great Expectations"" with Gwyneth Paltrow and Ethan Hawke.  Not because of the actors, but because they were remaking such a great story.  I like the Rat Pack, both as actors and singers, so I'm still curious about the 1960's version--no matter how campy they say it is.<br/><br/>All I know is I don't think too highly of this remake.  It's not bad, but it's dull.  And I usually like Stephen Soderbergh's work.  I still say his low-budget sleeper ""sex, lies and videotape"" is his best work up-to-date. ""Traffic"" is his second best, ""Out of Sight"" is his third and ""Erin Brockovich"" is his fourth.  I haven't seen ""The Limey,"" but I've heard good things about it, so I'll probably get around to seeing it soon.  But so far, I would place ""Ocean's 11"" on the bottom of the list.<br/><br/>
One of Soderbergh's talents is bringing out the richness of his characters. The problem this time around is there are too many damn characters!  Some of them just seem thrown in for the hell of it--or better yet, so the movie can be called ""Ocean's 11"" as opposed to ""Ocean's 8.""  Bernie Mac seems useless, his only purpose being to serve as the ""black guy"" in the group and blurt out a few ""puttin' da black man down"" jokes.  Scott Caan and Casey Affleck, as the constantly-brawling twin brothers, really seem useless.  Their annoying characters serve no purpose whatsoever--other than to help fill the running time of two hours and fifteen minutes.  I usually like Brad Pitt, but in this movie he looks as if he's in a coma--he probably knows how the audience feels.  Don Cheadle is fairly amusing, and I thought his British accent was convincing--and I'm a stickler for accents.  George Clooney is smooth and charismatic, like always, and so is Julia Roberts--though she only appears on screen for about ten minutes.  I really wish their relationship subplot could've been developed more.  There is a great scene of dialogue where they first meet in a restaurant, after years of separation.  The dialogue is delivered with great timing--in the spirit of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in ""His Girl Friday.""  But the relationship is trivialized to Hollywood fluff.  Roberts is going out with Andy Garcia, who's rich and powerful, but they never establish any sort of chemistry. So it comes as no surprise that she's going to break up with him and run off with Clooney.  But why was she going with Andy in the first place???  No one knows.  It's part of a stupid, meaningless formula.<br/><br/>Because of the abundance of characters, they're reduced to caricatures.  I just got finished watching ""Out of Sight"" and it's interesting how these two movies contradict each other.  In that movie, I was deeply engaged because of the development of the colorful characters.  In this movie, I was dozing off because of the lack of character development.<br/><br/>The story is scant, and the whole movie basically revolves around the planning of the heist.  Thin characters and thin story?  It's not my fault I couldn't get into the film, occasionally dozing off.  In my film class, my professor made a good point:  ""A good film director doesn't waste a single bit of footage.""  Soderbergh is generally a good director, who doesn't waste footage, but he struck out this time.  Can anyone explain why we needed that stupid card game with all the teen stars from the WB?  That's right, you heard me right.  Brad Pitt playing cards with Topher Grace, Holly Marie Combs, Barry Watson, Shane West and rest of those young studs who grace the covers of ""Teen People.""  Serves a purpose?  I think not.  OK, so this movie doesn't take itself seriously, but the humor falls flat.  Some good laughs would've helped me overlook the film's shortcomings, but even the great Carl Reiner didn't deliver any laughs.  Hey, what can ya do?<br/><br/>

The legendary stories behind the ""making"" of the Sinatra film are well known, especially how Sinatra would yell ""Move on"" after the first take on almost every scene. he and Dino and Joey Bishop and Lawford were soused during most of it and the film is fun to watch in a kitschy Rat Pack kinda way but it is a bad movie. So, this one is better. There are some genuinely funny scenes, some fine performances and Soderbergh shoots all the action well, but, when all is said and done, it seems like Clooney put on a tux and said ""Let's just have some fun"". But the movie so falls apart and you have to just go along for the ride, but the ending OR endings really were strange. Orchestral music swells as it follows Julia Roberts out of the casino for no particular reason and after you pull off a very risky heist, would you just hang around, together, as a group, and watch a casino fountain??? Weird. And then the final tagged on scene where Pitt comes to pick up Clooney from prison - uh....so Garcia's men are just going to follow him for the rest of his life? Or only until he leaves Nevada? Not clear, not needed, not good. And Cheadle, who is so brilliant in Devil In A Blue Dress, Traffic, Out Of Sight and so many others, gives a bad performance. I couldn't believe it. He and the director must have become such good friends that when he said ""Lemme do an English accent"" no one had the heart to tell him it sucked. He makes Costner's accents sound good. I am a huge fan of Soderbergh's work (from Sex, Lies & Videotape to what I consider his best film, The period drama, King Of The Hill) and this little trinket won't hurt him. He makes it move as best he can, but overall, why??? There are so many better heist films (Riffifi). Or even Thunderbolt & Lightfoot for that matter. If you catch it on cable, you might have fun, but if you get a babysitter, shell out close to 20 bucks, popcorn, big box of Goobers, I think you might feel as taken as Andy Garcia's character."

This remake uses legitimate actors rather than entertainers, serious writing over hacked pulp fiction and a public fond of nostalgic cool instead of the vain attempt to revive a flagging Vegas casino scene. Ironically, Vegas is hurting after the 9/11 tragedy, and this film may help revive the luster of the crap tables and slots in that famous desert.<br/><br/>This is an amazing assemblage of talent assisted by special effects and tight scripting which carries the action forward and seldom droops. We want to see these bad guys succeed, simply because they're faced with insurmountable odds, evil capitalists and a wholesome goal of recapturing a lost love. This combination could be cloying, but it isn't in this film.<br/><br/>We have no clear idea of how the O-11 bunch plans to escape with their loot, even though their strategy to sneak in is quite clear. And that element of surprise sustains your interest. There's action, humorous repartee suspense and tenderness. It's fun, but there's not much here to inspire this reviewer.

","Having never seen the original ""Ocean's Eleven"" and considering myself lucky, I was a bit skeptical when I heard that Soderbergh was remaking this Rat Pack hack.  But Soderbergh breathes life into the heist movie genre and creates a complex and enjoyable tour de force.  Since there are at least eleven characters that need to be introduced, each character is given his mini-moment scene to steal.  Elliot Gould is a hoot as Ruben Tischkoff and his shameless hairiness is almost as difficult to watch as a Rupert Pupkin film festival.  George Clooney's Danny Ocean is slick, smart and a little dangerous, a part he can play blindfolded, let's face it.  But he can still command the screen and there aren't too many actors that can do that these days.  Brad Pitt is a pretty boy, no doubt about that.  But he gives a cool (if not fattening - eating in every scene.) performance.  Don Cheadle, as Roscoe Means, covers his privates as he detonates a transformer that blows the lights in Vegas.  Whether or not that was a bit of actorly improvisation or it was written into the script, doesn't matter much.  It was a stroke of genius.  Matt Damon, looking rather Ripleyesque, holds his own with these Soderbergh regulars.  Bernie Mack shows a good deal of range for a stand-up comic. Casey Affleck (brother of Ben) and Scott Caan (son of James) are dumb and dumber as brothers who drive the truck, kind of.  The one weakness in this frat pack flick was Julia Roberts.  Unfortunately, there was not much chemistry between her and Clooney.  Just watch ""Out of Sight"" if you want a movie definition of ""chemistry.""  The sparks between J-Lo and Clooney fly off the screen.  But for all their off-screen comraderie, (in endless interviews) Roberts and Clooney seemed more like siblings than ex-lovers.<br/><br/> Soderbergh, behind the camera as well as directing, has developed a signature look to his films.  His humor and his sensibility make an interesting combination.  The scene with ""That Seventies Show"" Topher Grace and ""Dawson's Creek's"" Joshua Jackson playing with the big boys is wonderfully loopy.  ""Ocean's Eleven"" is one remake that makes the original pale by comparison."
"RolloTomasi","7","0","1","13 December 2001"," Easy money
","Danny Ocean and his co-conspirators are looking to do the impossible. They're not even as careful as they should be about it. They want to see just how far they can push their luck. So it's appropriate that the establishment they are knocking over is a casino (actually, three casinos that share one ridiculously secure vault). <br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh is trying to continue a streak of great directorial efforts, to give us an encore after winning an Academy Award. To do it, he's assembled a cast that reads more like a producer's wish list. Soderbergh got all of 'em. Knocking over three casinos in one night? Impossible. The guy responsible for two out of five Best Picture nominees last year making a movie that people will want to watch starring Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Matt Damon? Well heck, that's just easy. Whether it's good or not is a different proposition and, perhaps, a moot one.     <br/><br/>
The film takes no time to explore what's at stake for any of the eleven, except Ocean himself. Each man's take is not that much in movie terms, roughly $13.6 million. So why risk it? Even exploring the lives of three of four characters would have sufficed. So I guess they just want money. For what? Well, because--the house always wins. Elliott Gould's character, when the idea is proposed to him, tells Ocean he'll need a crew just as crazy as he is. So assemble he does, many crazy fellows. But what exactly makes them so crazy? Why are they selected? Soderbergh didn't want to spend too much time on assembling the group, so he had to leave much crucial information out. And it hurts. <br/><br/>Not that Soderbergh and HIS crew don't put on a good show anyway. He's brought several actors together who are used to carrying films by themselves and asked them to play minor character roles. Budget plummets, net profits soar. This move should represent something very positive in the filmmaking community--the idea that acting is fun and work is work (though even the reduced rate each A-lister here was paid is more than the average American makes in ten lifetimes). The problem is they risked nothing. This film could not miss. Everyone involved is obviously having a blast, but the film never finds a soul. It's too busy being cool and clever.   <br/><br/>So cool is ""Ocean's Eleven"" in fact, that I missed that there's barely a curse word, no sex, no violence. Nil. A caper movie like this typically has plenty of each, but not this. Not that  Soderbergh seems to be necessarily avoiding them. These things that are meant to add something to films--sex, violence, profanity--are like a subject in a conversation that just never comes up. <br/><br/>Soderbergh shoots this one himself, as he did with ""Traffic."" I wonder how much the guy actually directed on this one. With this kind of acting talent, who tries to direct? Even before he won his Best Director Oscar, he was probably thinking about a project in which he could be mostly a cameraman. That's why ""Eleven"" falls far short of ""Traffic,"" ""The Limey,"" and ""Out of Sight."" But then, you can't hit one out of the park every time you step up to the plate.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

","The grand caper has long been a staple of film and book. Stories ranging from the `Great Train Robbery', `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance ' and even the recent `Bandits' have chronicled the exploits of so called gentlemen bandits. They earned this nickname by being charismatic individuals who the public see as doing no harm to the average person but rather an institution in an us against them mentality. Such is the case in the remake of the `Oceans 11'. The film stars George Clooney as Danny Ocean. A recently paroled, and recently divorced crook who blames his recent arrest on stress caused by a failing marriage. No sooner is Danny released from prison, than he starts to contact his old gang and recruit a few new members in order to pull of a heist to end all heists. Assisting Danny is Dusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), a smooth and confident operator who is very much Danny's right hand man. During a meeting with a prospective financier, Ruben Tischkoff (Elliott Gould), Danny and Dusty reveal that they intend to rob three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously by robbing the central vault that the three casino share. The fact that a casino robbery has never been successful is of little concern to them, as they believe they have the perfect plan. As the team is assembled it is determined that 11 people are needed to pull off the heist ranging from an acrobat, computer techs, drivers, decoys and a pickpocket named Linus (Matt Damon). The targeted hotels are run by Harry Benedict(Andy Garcia), who is known for his brutal practices both in and out of the business arena and has more than a few people who want to settle old scores with him.  Ruben wants to get back at him for forcing him to close his casino years back, and Danny wants to get him as he is sleeping with his ex-wife Tess(Julia Roberts).<br/><br/>What follows is the predictable plot device where the impenetrable vault and its security systems are displayed as the group plans the various phases of the heist, and encounter problems along the way such as Ocean being identified by the casino and flagged to be followed causing another person to be needed in his role and his pursuit of his ex-wife. What could have been an enjoyable film falls flat and becomes very stale and forgettable. Clooney once again is playing himself and his suave charmer role is getting very stale. As the brains behind the operation, Clooney plays Ocean as if he were sleepwalking in the role. Clooney and Roberts have very little chemistry and their scenes with one another are forced and stiff. Brad Pitt is the supporting player in the piece who does little more than stand around stiffly with a smirk looking like he is in on an inside joke and like the majority of the cast, displays as much range as a Daisy air rifle in a wind storm. Unlike his great supporting roles in `Spy Games' and `Snatch' Pitt is reduced to being little more than a background fixture and a substitute for Danny when Danny is not in a scene.  Sadly the same holds true for the remainder of the cast. There is little to no character development, chemistry or motivation amongst the characters. The $150 Million take is the motivation of the characters for the robbery, but we hear nothing about there plans for the money, why they want to risk their lives when there are easier targets and why they believe they can trust one another. We know that Danny has worked with some of them in the past, but that does not explain why the new people follow their assignments without question and trust Danny blindly. As the villain, Garcia's character is badly underwritten. We see that he is dangerous to those who would cross him, but tell me what person would not be when they have $150 million and the reputation of their business at stake especially in such a high stakes industry? The ending of the film is also a disappointment as events unfold in what is a predictable manner only to have a sequence at the end where the audience at the press screener was asking `what about the Â…..'?  `Oceans 11' unfolds more like a pet project as it seems that the actors were winging it and portraying characterizations of other characters from their past careers and from generic heist films. What results is a stale and lifeless film, that has many of its jokes fail and features a total lack of chemistry amongst the cast resulting in little for the audience to care about much less route for.<br/><br/>2 stars out of 5 Gareth Von Kallenbach"

This modern version of ""Ocean's 11"" is vast improvement over the original boring version with the original crassy players known as the Rat Pack. Why they were considered ""cool"" must've been a baby boomer thing but I'll tell you this: Frank Sinatra never wore a suit with such elan as Brad Pitt does. Thank god for George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh who were smart enough to throw out everything that was wrong with the first one and got it right with the second one. All of the actors obviously had a blast making this movie and it shows. They are also perfectly casted, except for Julia Roberts, who is too plain-looking to be a casino owner's girlfriend (she also needs to learn how to walk in high heels). As an interesting aside: Clooney has more screen chemistry with Pitt than he does with Roberts. Every scene that either Clooney or Pitt is in is thoroughly entertaining. I hope that the scene-stealing older actors, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner, were giving out free actling lessons to the young'uns: Affleck, Damon, and Caan. With this movie, it is easy to see why Clooney and Pitt are movie stars and easier still to see that Steven Soderbergh is the new ""Steven"" any smart actor in Hollywood should be knocking down the door to work with.

","...than I or 99% of the population will ever know. Steven Soderbergh's remake of the Ratpack's prior outing is a weightless exercise in cool for the new millennium. The entire cast are nearly flawless contributors to this effort, but Clooney, Pitt, Damon, and Reiner really outdo themselves. Wardrobes, locations, and the soundtrack all complement the actors and plot superbly. In the future I can only hope to dress half as well as Pitt and Clooney do in this film. The soundtrack is an outstandingly modern and refreshing blend of jazz and electronica that is used to great effect throughout the film's varied scenes.<br/><br/>I also admired the dialog and its delivery throughout the film. November's 'Heist' delivered excellent dialog, but at many points the delivery was forced and it became hard to believe so many people delivering so many one-liners one after the other. In 'Ocean's 11' the humor in the dialog is superbly employed to break the tension developed in certain scenes. I would imagine a great deal of this difference is the product of Mamet and Soderbergh's differing styles of writing and directing.<br/><br/>Those reading this may believe I am excessively exuberant about this film and they would be correct in that belief. I cannot recall a single film that put such a huge smile on my face for nearly two hours.<br/><br/>I do have one nitpick with the film, but it is extremely minor and probably due to my slight fatigue as I viewed the film. As others have mentioned the film can be a bit slow in spots. Modern audiences may have this feeling after being exposed to years of crowd-pleasing explosions and effects wizardry. When seeing this film it is important to remember Ocean's is a HEIST film rather than an ACTION film. In the end, I found it very satisfying to watch the well-planned and executed heist develop with a minimum of violence and no deaths!<br/><br/>Others may gripe regarding the 'Pinch' device, but militaries around the world have been researching these units since the '80s and are working to bring them into active service as I write. However, the packaging of the device in the movie was certainly more fanciful than the olive drab that would be used by a defense arm.<br/><br/>In summary, Clooney and Co. explode the mystique of the Ratpack, redefine 'cool' for the third millennium, and manage to put a huge smile on my face while doing so.

","Ocean's 11 is nothing less than the most fun I've had in a movie theater this year.  It doesn't have huge laughs, or gigantic stunts, or expensive effects.  It's got a tight script, great stars in top form, and some snazzy photography.<br/><br/>I'm probably biased; Steven Soderbergh is my favorite working director. After a year with the phenomenal Traffic and the underrated Erin Brockavich (Both nominated for Best Picture Oscars), he aims for nothing less than a pure entertainment movie.  And he flat out succeeds.  There are few scenes in Ocean's 11 that don't burst off the screen; and after the fifteen minute mark of the film, it doesn't rest until the epilogue.  In between, it's a pure heist picture that will gratify fans of the genre and probably just about anyone else.<br/><br/>In the amoral world of the film our heroes are a (almost) dozen crooks, thieves, scam artists, cons, and experts, led by Daniel Ocean (George Clooney), recently released from prison and out for some serious cash.  His crew's played with flair and a lot of cool by (among others) Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, and Don Cheadle with a nasty British accent.  They're looking to knock off three casinos owned by the nasty Terry Benedict (the glowering Andy Garcia).  Since he's really mean, and he's with Danny's ex-wife Tess (The glowing Julia Roberts) casino robbings made both fun and right.<br/><br/>I kid; it really doesn't matter that these guys are crooks.  They, along with the whole film, are so likeable, it doesn't matter.  Soderbergh and screenwriter Ted Griffith pull off surprise after surprise, constantly wratcheting up the pressure on the heist.  Kudos also to the precise, calculated editing.  The movie is a manipulative ride, and it never stops working.<br/><br/>You walk out of the movie feeling cooler just by seeing it.

","Good performances by George Clooney and Carl Reiner.  SPOILER: The ending was flat.  There were no scenes of ya-hoo nor hurrah after they pulled off the heist.  No scenes of them counting the money.  And we do not get to see all the money they stolen afterwards. There was no emotional nor dramatic pay-off for the audience.                                               What really unnerved me was that old let's-move-the-camera-fast around the room trick.  The cameo appearance of Angie Dickinson was all to quick and then the camera rushed over to Wayne Newton.  I would have loved to have seen Angie Dickinson a little bit more than just a blink of an eye.  They should have given Ms. Dickinson a good, juicy role to play in this film.  I missed other cameos too. They must have been all too quick.  I am all for happy endings, but the very last scene (""three to six months later"") was dull.  Only a sequel could make up for it.  Could they make a sequel?  Would we love to see this cast together again make another casino heist?   You betcha!  But considering all the trouble and red tape it took to get this film made and the voluntary pay cuts the actors allowed to help get this film made, I think a sequel is highly unlikely.  I hope a DVD version or a special video version will ADD more unseen scenes INTO the film."
"scorpio678","10","0","1","11 December 2001"," Lots of fun
","I think we all knew that this movie wasn't going to be a ""Citizen Kane"" or provide some great social commentary, but it is a lot of fun and is a great way to spend two hours at the movies.  The characters are all likable, the dialogue is snappy and clever, and it just oozes ""cool"".  The only weak point in the movie to me was Julia Roberts' character, where she has weak chemistry with George Clooney (who is as cool as he's ever been), and there's no real reason given to why George's Danny Ocean character would be so devoted to her.  This movie is never boring and is FAR better than most of the dreck that Hollywood puts out.<br/><br/>So, are you in or out?"
"mikekreein","7","0","1","10 December 2001"," An American Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels...
","Ocean's 11 reminded me a lot of Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, both by Guy Ritchie.  Ocean's 11 had the unique and humorous characters like the Ritchie movies, but unlike Ritchie's movies, I felt that Soderbergh did not use each character to their full potential.  For example, the two young getaway drivers in Ocean's 11 were hired (in the film) not so much for their skills, but for their antics.  I do not ever recall a car chase in the movie in which they were showing off their driving skills.<br/><br/>I also did not like the romance part of the story in Ocean's 11.  The movie was up and down between the humor and action of the heist and the relationship between Tess and Danny.  These parts between them slow the movie down heavily.  Also, the ending of Ocean's 11 could have really been improved upon.<br/><br/>Regardless, Ocean's 11 was a breath of fresh air for the movie industry. I really enjoyed it, but I would recommend Snatch or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels over it."

","First off, I've never seen the original so take that for what it's worth. You'll have to suspend reality in parts but c'mon...It's fun, it's fast paced, clever.  Great entertainment, not too deep but you weren't expecting American Beauty, were you?  The acting is decent although Don Cheadle's British accent is god-awful.  Basically, if you're in the mood for a fun two hour ride, you won't be disappointed."
"dgeiser13","5","0","1","10 December 2001"," Almost As Boring As Billy Ocean
","Let me start by saying that the idea of remaking a Rat Pack movie is brilliant and I couldn't think of a better director, Steven Soderbergh, or lead actor, George Clooney, to handle the job. Or so I thought...<br/><br/>It's hard to pinpoint specifically why Ocean's Eleven didn't work as good as it should have for me. The performances were uniformly good and each of the characters got their chance to shine. Great portions of the dialogue were snappy, witty and snide and quite funny. The cinematography was great, the movie looked awesome, and the direction was spot on solid.<br/><br/>But in general the movie was boring. That's the only way I can describe it. This was just a regular movie with a regular plot and all of the awesome talent arrayed around it couldn't make it shine like it should've.<br/><br/>Here are two examples, I'm sure I could come up with more, of things that put the kibosh on this film working for me:<br/><br/>One was the motivation of the characters. Hardly any of the characters besides Clooney, Garcia and Roberts' character seemed to be doing, behaving and saying what they should've given the circumstance. All of the supporting characters in the ""love story"" plot thread (Damon and Pitt) even after finding out Danny's real reason for going to Vegas seemed too accepting. I guess the money and the ""brilliant"" plan along with the thrill of its execution we're supposed to be their motivators but if that was it then it wasn't conveyed very well.<br/><br/>The second is a logistical thing. I still cannot see, for the life of me, how they got the bags (the ones with the Big White X's on the end) and their contents (the sex flyers) into the vault. The chinese acrobat definitely didn't have them. Clooney and Damon didn't appear to have them. Yet they had everything bagged and waiting for the casino employees to carry out to the first white van. If you can explain it to me I would appreciate it.<br/><br/>As I said these are just two examples. I think a critical film forum could easily come up with many more.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Do not be enticed by the pedigree of this film. It is not very good."
"dpmoretti","6","0","1","11 December 2001"," What Could Have Been
","This viewed like a very competent workman's like effort with almost no passion. I found myself truly bored while watching the planning and execution of the biggest heist in history.<br/><br/>There were few surprises and little suspense. And I really didn't like the mental flashbacks, ala Spike Jones' ""Three Kings.""<br/><br/>Yes, it's making tons of money at the box-office, but nobody claims the restaurant that's served billions has the best cuisine."

","I was so excited to see Ocean's Eleven after hearing all of the big names that were in it.  But unfortunately, all those big names didn't make the movie exciting or enjoyable.  There was absolutely no character development and no good dialogue.  Just alot of tricks and visual effects. Blah."
"blackberrylaw","7","0","1","9 December 2001"," Contrived, just another pretty face
","You should see the old Rat Pack version of Oceans 11, since it certainly stands a chance of being better than the new one.  I've never been a fan of George Cloony, but I'll admit that I liked him better in Oceans 11 than in anything else so far.  I usually like Brad Pitt, but his performance, along with that of Matt Damon's, was less than noteworthy.  Julia Roberts was entirely inappropriate for the supposedly-dazzling ""ex-wife"" role, as she was most definitely not dazzling.  The whole technical aspects of robbing the casinos were interesting, but not enough to support the entire film as much of it was contrived and unplausible.  The most-redeeming factor about the film was its reasonably good reversal at the end.  While it was no Usual Suspects, the reversal surprised and entertained me."
"luvlucy","9","0","1","5 December 2001"," What a fun movie!!!
","I was priviledged to see an advance screening of this movie and I loved it!! It is just a fun, clever, witty movie with no social statement that it needs to make.  If you want to escape this uncertain world, then this is the movie.  If the kids have Harry Potter and Monsters Inc., then the adults out there have Ocean's Eleven. Plus, it's not hard on the eyes (George, Brad, Matt, etc.) :-)<br/><br/>And really, what is wrong with that???<br/><br/>P.S.  I am seeing it again this weekend (there were things I missed and clever dialogue missed because of all the laughing) and I will be glad to fork over the money to see this movie.  How many times can you really say that nowadays?"
"besttom","7","0","1","10 December 2001"," Worth it
","Great flick, great ensemble cast, entertaining as hell!<br/><br/>Clooney and Roberts' relationship is not well-developed and Andy Garcia's role is underdefined (he seems weak in the end), but all-in-all, it's a very entertaining movie and worth the trip!"
"Belgand-4","Null","0","1","10 December 2001"," Horribly wasted potential
","Going in I was rather interested in this film, but any interest dropped off shortly after it started. No one seemed to really bother acting instead walking around and going through the motions and while the script had some amusing moments on the whole it was very bland and lifeless. The final 20 minutes are predictable to anyone who's ever seen a film before and the scenes with Julia Roberts seemed tacked on and unnecessary.<br/><br/>The weakest point, however, was definitely the pacing. It simply moves far too quickly to allow the audience to really become interested or allow the rather simplistic plan to be planned out and executed.  The concept of even robbing three casinos is quickly pulled away when you learn that they'll only be robbing one vault containing the money from all three. A film requiring a synchronized robbery of three casinos at once using a large, largely talented cast could have been very enjoyable, but at present the film disappoints in almost every way. See it at a matinee if everything good is sold out, but otherwise wait til it's overplayed on HBO. 4/10"
"Don Stephens","6","0","1","5 December 2001"," When it turned into a remake of ""Entrapment,"" I tensed up.
","Steven Soderbergh is one of America's best directors, which is why it shocked me that he would willingly direct such easy entertainment.  His success with ""Traffic"" at the box office proves that his usual analytical art can make a hell of a lot of money.  ""Ocean's Eleven"" is an all-star remake of the 1960's Rat Pack classic about a daring casino heist.  Not exactly ""sex, lies, and videotape II,"" now, is it?<br/><br/>The first ninety minutes of the film is very entertaining as Soderbergh returns to the verve that he had with ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Limey,"" with very good performances by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and a shocker from Bernie Mac.  The first half of the film is stylish and surprisingly believable, but then descends into what can be referred to irrationally as a remake of ""Entrapment"", complete with sporty silver suits, and laser beam sensors.  Soderbergh should have known better.<br/><br/>An even bigger bright note though:  Julia Roberts is in the film and she doesn't smile once.  There is a God.<br/><br/>*** out of 4"
"cinemaofdreams","7","0","1","9 December 2001"," Just No Cool
","The closest thing to cool about this film is Brad Pitt. That was a mistake, George Clooney should have been the cool one. The music is cool (way cool) but it just doesn't make up for the cool that should be emanating from the screen. Brad Pitt's clothes are cool (and He plays a role that's really beyond his years). To be fair, the second half of the film picks up some steam and Soderbergh has some great moments towards the end of the film (and Thank God he didn't carry on the actual end of the film beyond its natural conclusion - too much, as has been the case lately in Hollywood). Overall, though no one can replace the rat pack, it's still decent. 7/10."
"bruno-51","6","0","1","10 December 2001"," The audience as dupes (SPOILERS!)
","Brilliantly shot, edited, paced.  The actors functioned well as an ensemble, though Clooney is clearly in a class by himself.<br/><br/>Two beefs.  The first minor one, Julia Roberts did not carry the weight necessary for her role.  She's supposed to be the great unattainable prize, and she's just too folksy and plain jane for this role.  Many consider her glamorous, I consider her equine.<br/><br/>My main problem with this film is the complete lack of obstacles our protagonists face.  Sure, they are foiled by the power grid scenario, but within TEN SECONDS Don Cheadle's character has the solution.  Yes, Matt Damon almost gets stuck at the University lab, but the two guards give lame pursuit, and nobody cares to call the cops when the multimillion dollar piece of gear is carted off.  Perhaps you could consider it an obstacle that the gymnast gets his hand stuck, but realize that he could have blown up with the door and it wouldn't have screwed up the plan any.  Or when Saul is nearly recognized...but nothing ever comes of it.  Very lame.<br/><br/>No, our eleven heroes waltz in, are in control the ENTIRE time, and even when it seems they are foiled, they had the double-dupe planned all along. I was miffed that the only conflict in this film is not with the characters and their circumstances, but with the audience and a lack of information. There is the weak illusion of a challenge only because we weren't told what all of the eleven knew regarding the plan.  It really would have been great to see Andy Garcia's character throw them a serious curve, but Soderbergh just lets him play right into their hands.  That is really cheap.<br/><br/>As an aside, I saw this in digital projection and nearly wet my pants at how good it was.  Great color, no pixellation, no dirt, and sharp, sharp, sharp!"
"len-21","7","0","1","10 December 2001"," 7 on a scale of 10
","I went into this movie expecting it to be great. It wasn't even close to great. Other than the fact that it had one of the most recognizable casts in history and the fact that it was very slick, it lacked quite a bit. As a ""theft"" movie, it really offered nothing new. The twist was interesting, but not one of those things where you hear yourself say, ""wow"".<br/><br/>I like this type of movie and I like the actors, so I don't feel cheated. A 7 is better than everything below it! Nevertheless, the chemistry was notably lacking in my opinion. Also, since I was miserably assaulted by TRAFFIC not all that long ago, any movie made my Soderbergh will, at least for awhile, have the Soderbergh stench.<br/><br/>If you are interested only in movies that have even the slightest amount of believability, don't bother watching this one. Far too many implausible actions.<br/><br/>Still, if you want to just sit back, turn off the brain and appreciate the star power and the continuous activity, it wasn't half bad."
"sseidne1","Null","0","1","9 December 2001"," Something missing

","The impressive cast of Ocean's Eleven drew me to see the movie on its opening weekend.  However, common sense and past experience should have told me that there was no way sufficient time could be given to the development of the several characters without shifting emphasis from the plot; it seems that when a film bills this many well known, talented actors, the best for which one can hope is either a well developed plot or a well developed cast of characters--in this case we get neither.  What a shame too.  Garcia, Pitt, and Damon have tremendous depth to offer this film."

One thing that really struck me was the whole 60's vibe present in the film.  While it takes place in modern day Vegas, the look, feel and sound of hay-day of the Vegas strip is somehow present.  Great supporting roles by everyone from Casey Afleck to Carl Reiner, and a quick but appreciated cameo by original Rat Pack Gal, Angie Dickenson makes this a great ride.<br/><br/>Are you in or out?  IN, Baby, Definitely IN!"
