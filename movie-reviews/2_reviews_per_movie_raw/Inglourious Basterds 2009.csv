","This review gives everything away, so see the movie first.<br/><br/>It is neither allegory nor satire, the two finest categories in both fiction and cinema, and yet it approaches perfection anyway. It is of a nature I have no name for, but it is a nature that reveals truth and undermines falsehoods. <br/><br/>Nothing is more cloaked in falsehood than the victor's depiction of past wars. It is especially true of the children of the victors--especially the children of US WWII veterans, like myself.<br/><br/>We get our view of the war from movies like Audi Murphy in To Hell and Back or Saving Private Ryan. Nothing but praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy. <br/><br/>But QT exposes this hypocrisy by engineering a film where we are disgusted first by the excesses of the enemy and then by the excesses of our heroes. That is the first instance. The hypocrisy is slammed home in the second instance where we are first disgusted by the sight of American after American being shot dead by by a German sniper hero and secondly brought to revel in the butchery of several hundred enemy at the hands of our heroes. Tit for tat.<br/><br/>It fits the pattern of praise for our heroes and cheers for killing the enemy, but because it is presented both ways the hypocrisy becomes self- evident. This is why so many people hate the movie--even if they fail to realize it. High art, true art, 10 of 10."

","That's what I thought, when I heard about the cast of Inglorious Basterds. And I'm both from Germany and into movies.<br/><br/>That guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre TV series - and even there he didn't play the main parts. Obviously nobody ever noticed, what he's capable of. Now, thanks to QT, he got one shot to change that - and - let's put it this way - that was a bingo! He is the living proof of what a great caster Tarrantino is.<br/><br/>By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a German - being able to understand everything. And the German dialog is written almost as good as the English.<br/><br/>Now I could repeat, what many others have written here before. I'll put it short: Finally, QT is back."

","After watching Inglorious Basterds i was really surprised when i saw ratings on IMDb. Didn't expected high ratings and top 250 place. If we can only isolate and rate Christoph Waltz's acting performance i would agree that this movie deserves 10. But he is not alone, and his performance can't cover horrible plot, boring conversations, unfunny characters, alternative QT WW2 fantasy and Eli Roth as Jew bear. <br/><br/>The opening scene with Denis Menochet as farmer and Christoph Waltz as SS officer is best part of the movie. Only part that have same quality and connects tension from that scene with the rest of the movie is a basement scene. Basement scene was crossroad for me. Michael Fassbender was great in role of British spy and his character adds some new layer of logic and realism in movie. In moments you can actually see some plot finally breaking through the rubbish you watched after the farm scene. After the basement chapter, movie is going nowhere. <br/><br/>Empty space. A lot of empty space for movie that last 153 minutes. Long and boring scenes with boring characters and conversations. Childish fantasy mixed up with Spaghetti western movies and some atmosphere that don't belong to WW2 period. Thats why we have basterds to fill everything else and patch the rest of movie. They failed. Basterds are weakest/undeveloped and most boring part of movie. Movie is named by them, yes - Brad is on Movie poster ... but they are horrible. Worst role of Mr Pitt and i hope last one from Eli Roth. <br/><br/>Cinema/Shosanna story with David Bowie music was just another QT patch v1.1 to fill huge empty space between farm and basement. Extremely boring scenes with Mélanie Laurent (taking off cinema letters, red dresses, secret love Marcel...) will blast your brain. Yes - headache is a must. <br/><br/>Beside 2 good scenes, i really enjoyed listening smooth gradient of German, French and English language. But again, this is connected to Waltz and Fassbender and their personal knowledge that Tarantino used for his fantasy. <br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds is Hybrid movie where gangsters are replaced with Nazis adding them wild west background layer with Brad Pitt on movie poster just to sell tickets. It doesn't work in this case.<br/><br/>5/10 - only for Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender."
"laurylou-1","10","522","909","23 July 2009"," Waltz is a Genius!!!!!
","I had the PRIVILEGE of attending the UK premier of Inglorious Basterds this evening! Having seen the trailers i had high hopes but had doubts due to a string of self indulgent films (c'mon lets be honest, self indulgence is his tarantinos middle name)<br/><br/>I was surprised to find though that he had pulled the cat out of the bag with this one. The film is rich with interesting dialogue, Perfect timed comedy with a dash of brutal assassination.<br/><br/>The crowning glory of this film though lies with Christoph Waltz whom no fault or error can be found. He manages to create a real tension in the audience whilst remaining quite ""theatrical"" (couldn't think of a better word). He definitely deserved his prize at Cannes and is heading for an Oscar no doubt!!!! Hoping to see him in something again soon!"
"htabbara","1","970","1770","22 September 2009"," Read ""Hated it"" reviews before watching
","I will just start with some quotes from other reviewers that describes it the best.<br/><br/>""This is easily one of the most overrated films of the year and probably the worst film Tarantino has ever done."" ""The ONLY good thing in this movie was the performance of Mr. Waltz"".<br/><br/>""So I was really disappointed, and seeing this movie on place #40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this, that leaves me with my mouth opened"" Now for more details go and read ""Hated it"" reviews.<br/><br/>One thing I hate about a movie is when it treats audience as bunch of dumb people. (Spoiler ahead). Now I know Tarantino's style is based on fantasy and fictitious plots, but come on, Adolf Hitler and 200 top Nazis Officers will be in attendance of a movie premier in occupied France and you have only two guards in the whole theater and the surroundings? Where also an American-African walks around freely with steel pipes locking doors and setting fire. These 2 guards are then executed in seconds opening the door for our 2 ""heroes"" to slay Hitler at point blank with around 100 rounds... very dumb. At least, challenge our intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time (Go watch Valkyrie). Besides, Mike Myers impersonation of a British general is more realistic and authentic than the guy doing Hitler, just picture that.<br/><br/>What ruined it further, is that the only smart and powerful character, which nailed everyone in the movie, with his psychological and mind bending interrogations, ends up to be effortlessly tricked by the most mindless character in the movie.<br/><br/>After watching the movie, I was sympathizing with Nazis, who were portrayed to have more bravery and humanity than our Basterds!!! Imagine that.<br/><br/>My recommendations, if you have insomnia, 2hrs 33 min to waste or you want to give your mind a break, go watch this movie."
"uhmartinez-phd","8","158","272","7 October 2009"," A Rip Roaring Yarn
","An fun, engrossing, beautifully crafted piece of nonsense, the likes of which we hadn't seen in a long long time. The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilized monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating (hilariously) an Italian? I thought so. His character's name sounds like Aldo Ray and I'm sure that's no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970's sexpot, Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino's trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He's clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don't read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That's how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time. For better or worse this are Tarantino times."
"Llakor","9","561","1018","30 July 2009"," Dark but Funny Comic Fantasy
","Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy, gloriously so. Built on the framework of The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds ditches the elongated training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to plunge into the action right away. In the process, Tarantino fixes one of The Dirty Dozen's major flaws by giving the bad guys screen time to remind us just how bad the Nazis were. The Nazis with the most screen time end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film, which ironically makes them even worse monsters.<br/><br/>Bu ditching the training sequences, Tarantino is also able to give us a picture of the entire war, showing us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also giving us glimpses into the world of French and German civilians, both collaborators and Resistance.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that any Tarantino film is going to have fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino made the decision to have the French characters speak French and the Germans speak German, beyond adding a level of authenticity, Tarantino also somehow ensured that his dialogue in French was as sharp and funny and clever as his English dialogue.<br/><br/>Case in point, during the opening sequence the Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christian Waltz) is interrogating French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa suspects that LaPadite is hiding a family of Jews. While subtly pressuring LaPadite, Landa asks for a glass of milk. After greedily gulping it down, Landa compliments LaPadite on his daughters and his cows, ""à votre famille et à vos vaches, je dis bravo."" The thing of it is, in French ""vache"" means cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If reprimanded for this vulgar pun, Landa could quite convincingly claim not to understand French well enough to have meant it that way, but Landa does mean it that way and he means it as a threat. And LaPadite understands his meaning all too well.<br/><br/>That is a really subtle piece of acting and word-play that many audiences would never catch, or at least they might understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The film is rich with that kind of detail. All of the French and English dialogue is chosen with that same attention to detail and while I can't swear to the German, I would suspect that it shows a similar level of craft.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds opens with the phrase, ""Once Upon a Time... in Nazi-Occupied France."" Personally, this reminds me of the opening of every Asterix book and movie, another comic fantasy in a war-torn occupied France. Like Asterix, Inglorious Basterds is howlingly funny in places, although the film also turns darkly serious.<br/><br/>In its more serious moments, Inglorious Basterds reminds us that the first casualties of war are compassion and the ability to relax, as in almost every elongated sequence of the film, Tarantino finds a new way to build cruel tension to almost unbearable levels.<br/><br/>Tarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous, even inflammable and that its power deserves respect.<br/><br/>If you can see this film as I did in a packed theatre filled with knowledgeable fans who get every joke, that you will see this masterful film the way that it was meant to be seen. If you are not that lucky, all that you will see is a great, great film that delivers a darkly funny punch."
"leodipaolis","7","165","288","6 October 2009"," He loves his movies, doesn't he?
","Everything is forgiven because ""Inglorious Basterds"" is so entertaining and at the end of the day that'ìs what matters. I think it's a pity that certain critics, specially in Italy, are determined to transform this clever pulp director into some kind of god. Maybe, partly, because Tarantino has been very clever, elevating some of the Italian pulp movies of the 60's and 70's to a sort of cult status. Italy is very grateful for that, he's rewarded with interminable praise. I fear that's the wrong approach, it's also confusing. He makes popcorn movies, brilliantly. The characters have never anything important to say, Burger King, Superman, that's the extent of its depth and I think he's tapping into a society that's getting shallower and shallower with every passing year. But, if I'm mentioning this instead of talking about all the great things I could be saying about his movie is because there is a strange force trying to brain wash me into believing that Tarantino is the most important influence in movies since time immemorial. No, he's a great director of inconsequential fun movies. I consider myself a fan and I intend to see all his future movies. This one has some wonderful touches, winking at other movies by John Sturges, Robert Aldrich etc. Brad Pitt and in particular Christoph Waltz give wonderful performances. Waltz is at the center of my favorite scenes in the film. Enjoy this movies for what it is and not for what critics are saying it is. You'll enjoy it even more that way."
"abelardo64","9","287","514","3 October 2009"," A Comedy Of Horrors
","Brad Pitt sticks his index finger in Diane Kruger's leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, horribly so. The invented yarn takes ""The Dirty Dozen"" for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies. Lots of fun. Even ""Paris when it sizzles"" is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog. I was thrilled by Christoph Waltzer's character and by his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a true original. I love the actor's lack of vanity. There's a quirk in the character that is pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe but. fortunately, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible all over the place."
"motta80-2","8","861","1603","23 July 2009"," Great fun, a real surprise
","It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill films (although i preferred the second) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven't hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.<br/><br/>Then i read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and i hated it! Sure it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on page it was more juvenile rubbish, largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a Tarantino Q&A following in London. I figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in Q&A as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person.<br/><br/>So little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds.<br/><br/>Easily Mr Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown it is a triumph.<br/><br/>Yes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunt casting but he works fine, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared. While i admired Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof in order to amp-up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino's own appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote.<br/><br/>What really makes this work is how BIG it is. The spaghetti western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so big. The audacity so big. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers the Hitler moment and Pitt's performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune's blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn vibe to him, and of course a suitably Lee Marvin edge.<br/><br/>Christoph Waltz (who i did not previously known) and Melanie Laurent (who i first noticed in a brilliant French-language British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future. Tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting, which seemed to desert him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally large in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here.<br/><br/>That every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems pulled directly from the mold of Attenborough's Great Escape leader.<br/><br/>All the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes, but ones that work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger's Hugo Stiglitz is a riot. After a sensational slow-burn opening and a glorious intro to those inglourious Basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by.<br/><br/>It also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to real film-making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired from Morricone on.<br/><br/>The film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining, but also involving and impressive film should be this one, when i would never have believed it from script form. Welcome back QT."
"terrygiu2000","7","118","203","5 October 2009"," The Jewish Scalphunters of Quentin Tarantino
","Once again, revenge is at the center of a Quentin Tarantino movie. This time a Jewish dirty dozen takes things on their own hands. Tarantino re-writes history and shortens WWII with a comic stroke that is as entertaining as it is vacuous. A fantasy that re-arranges some controversial historical points. Okay, it's a movie and as such it works for most of its two and a half hours. Christoph Waltz opens things up in the most promising way. The opening sequence is filled with a subtle but unbearable tension. Weltz amalgamates all the Nazi villains we have loved and hated in the movies into one glorious creation. (I will advise my countrymen to see it in its original multi-language version - the Italian version is another movie altogether. Some of the extra pleasures are in the dialog that, naturally, are not to be found in the Italian version) Brad Pitt, rapidly becoming one of the best character actors in the world, with a leading man's face and billing, is truly fantastic. Diane Kruger makes a credible Barbara Bouchet (one of Tarantino's muses from trash action Italian movies from the 70's) and the rest of the cast has some exquisite touches like Rod Taylor as Winston Churchill. Highly recommended for a Sunday afternoon."

","...""Inglorious"" as our local theater decided to display its title on their marquee, minus the second word. It is terrific cinema.<br/><br/>I don't hesitate to recommend this film to all but the over-squeamish. Let them never know what they're missing.<br/><br/>I did hesitate to give it ten stars because of my experience of Tarantino's previous films. In every case, save ""Reservoir Dogs,"" they have improved with additional watching.<br/><br/>So although I gave it ten stars, I did so reluctantly. It leaves me no ""up"" to go to.<br/><br/>Yes Christoph Waltz is the Nazi we've all imagined the worst to be. He is cultured, sophisticated, suave and most sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who puts out his cigarette abruptly in a strudel, grinding it into the whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim.<br/><br/>To understand Tarantino's films, you need only have a sense of dialogue, color and pacing. The colors are as bright as necessary and when necessary, brighter yet. In the French farmhouse of the opening scene, they are muted and dark, but excessively so. Outside a brilliant sun is shining, but in the one room of the house, everything is bathed in shadows and black.<br/><br/>It is a brilliant setting for an interrogation by Waltz, as the ""Jew Hunter"" of the SS, who dangles his host French farmer over the precipice of revealing what he cannot reveal numerous times, then pulls him back with obsequious lines of friendship and understanding.<br/><br/>A second sadistic German, well-played by August Diehl, later functions as important actor in the final plot twist. Diehl's Nazi Major, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz....almost.<br/><br/>Film classes will study much from this movie. They should look lovingly at the superb pacing. Tarantino knows just how long to draw out a scene, building suspense in the manner of Hitchcock, then at just the breaking point, suddenly coming to a resolution.<br/><br/>For color, look for a final shot at a French Theater, where its secretly Jewish proprietor is staging a surprise for the upper reaches of Nazi leadership.<br/><br/>We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, awaiting the hated German dignataries who will arrive for a film preview of the latest Deutsch film masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious accomplishments.<br/><br/>Laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the gorgeous theater, her red lips and low cut dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of her designs on her guests. It is a single shot that would be worth an entire film.<br/><br/>There are thankfully many more such images, many more paced scenes of exquisite dialog and suspense.<br/><br/>In short, see it. I'm sure you'll see it again and again."
"produpp","10","1048","1980","2 June 2009"," Brave, unique and just sheer brilliant!
","Inglorious Basterds makes no apologies, asks for no forgiveness, it's a  no holds barred assault on the senses. Tarantino doesn't care if he  offends, if he steps all over stereotypes and clichés, this is film  making at it purest. It's great to see a film maker whose work clearly  isn't interfeared with by the powers that be. Tarantino is a master of  effortlessly cranking up immense tension and suddenly mixing it with  laugh out loud moments; you're not sure if you should be looking away  in disgust or rolling around laughing, either way it's a roller coaster  and one not to be missed! It's not for everyone, certainly if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, this may be a little hard to swallow, but  never-the-less, it is a film which simply has to be seen. No self  respecting film fan should miss this. And the performance of Christoph  Waltz... Oscar don't you dare ignore him!!"
"Billy_Costigan","Null","560","1042","23 August 2009"," Quentin Tarantino is a Crazy Basterd
","I can't imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than Quentin Tarantino's. (At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics, such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since, he has been a disappointment for some. Well, I am relieved to say, Tarantino has not lost his touch. He brings us his best since Pulp Fiction and thankfully so.<br/><br/>We know the story, a WWII tale told only as Tarantino can. (Fictional of course) A war film hasn't been done like this before. Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine leads the Basterds in Nazi occupied France. Their goal - killin' Nazi's. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He's know as the ""Jew Hunter"" and goes about his business as ruthless as no other. The third sub story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who witnesses the slaughter of her family. And she, of course, wishes to plot revenge on the Germans for her devastating lose. There actually is three stories here intertwining and connecting with each other. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, this is nothing new for him.<br/><br/>War has never been been so fun. The Basterds, are haunting, but at the same time, very funny, at times even hilarious. The dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other Tarantino films. The entertainment and hilarity is led by Brad Pitt. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. I couldn't wait to see him on screen again. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. Also making great impressions were Mélanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were tremendous. The film was filled with noteworthy performances.<br/><br/>The story itself, has so many historical inaccuracies to even count, but so what? It isn't meant to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun with, as should we. The cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film. You've really got to love the last line in the film... but Pulp Fiction remains his masterpiece.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino among all other things, is an entertainer. WWII, is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino some how manages to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun film, it's tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, suspenseful, and funny at the same time. Jam packed with everything you look for in a movie, done with that certain Tarantino style, it's worth being checked out. It's time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino."
"derwunderbaremandarin","1","480","892","23 February 2010"," A waste of time and money
","This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>What is the purpose of this movie? A bunch of Americans enters Nazi-occupied France and starts slaughtering Germans. You see them scalping their enemies and beating them to death with baseball bats. While making jokes, of course.<br/><br/>Some will say that this movie is a parody of a certain genre. For a parody, it is neither witty nor funny. The contents is zero. It is exceptionally brutal and disgusting. Underneath lies a subtle political message, because it is again ""the good guys"" killing ""bad Nazis"". The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around. Could you imagine a storyline where Nazis (while making jokes) kill everybody in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not, but this movie is exactly about that, with the exception that is satisfies the weird moral expectations of a certain audience: slaughtering people is so cool when done by the right people.<br/><br/>This movie only works because of the hidden Nazi-ideology underneath. It does not regard the enemy as people. And if the latter is supposed to be an element of the fun, I am happy to say that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me.<br/><br/>Another mystery is how such violence can fascinate the American crowd while a bit of nudity will freak them out. But if a naked body is pornography, this movie with all its brutality is pure pornography at its very worst.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds is a pointless, boring and tasteless waste of time and money."

","This usually all sounds a lot better in my head (so forgive me for rambling) I'm hardly Tarantino's biggest fan (and will *try* not to stoop to calling him a 'hack'....which is quite hard) I don't like to mock or critique a movie before seeing it. So with cautious hesitation, i walked to the cinema today to watch 'Inglorious Basterds'<br/><br/>Now, to call it a 'rip-off of a rip-off' would be unfair here. Tarantino is happy enough to take the title from Enzo Castellari's (less than spectacular) Dirty Dozen clone, but not it's plot points (that, he takes from all other genre of movies) 'Inglorious' opens with a Nazi officer and his lengthy interrogation against a farmer who is hiding Jews in his basement. This is such an anti-climax, in that, it's dialogue is stale, and outcome signposted a mile off. Of course, one of the hidden Jews makes her escape (but more of her later) We (the obviously, easily pleased) audience are treated to the introduction of Lt. Aldo Raine (ha-ha, that name almost sounds like B-movie king ALDO RAY....ha-ha Quentin...keep those 'tributes' coming) and this character is played by none other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt (sorry, DALLAS was about the only good thing he's ever starred in) and with jaw-jutting, Mr Jolie treats us to a hound-dogged, southern drawled, smirking Nazi-killer. Meanwhile Mr Tarantino forgets that actual grown-ups may be in attendance, so assumes that the teenyboppers won't have heard of the 'Dirty Dozen'?<br/><br/>Raines 'platoon' consists of (John Cassavettes looking) blood-thirsty Jewish soldiers, all looking to get the big payback on Adolf Hitler. Tarantino in all his superior knowledge, pays special attention to two of these men, by casting his long time best buddy (and fellow homage-sycophant) Eli Roth (as the baseball bat wielding 'Bear Jew') The other man is called Hugo Stiglitz (and i'll wager more than half the QT fan-boys had never heard this name before this movie) Keep up the good work Tarantino, you've managed about 6 or 7 'hommages' so far (in the first 15 minutes) keep adding them, and it may detract from the plot (or lack of?)<br/><br/>Anyhow, cutting a long (and extremely boring and protracted) story short, both Raine and his men (the 'Inglorious Basterds') and the sole survivor from chapter one, both have separate plots to kill Hitler at the showing of a Nazi-propaganda movie, in a french cinema (owned by the fore-mentioned survivor, now grown up)<br/><br/>More boring (and pointless) conversations follow two and fro, as Pitt mugs away at an audience past caring. And any genuine suspense, leading to the assassination of the most deadly tyrant of all time, is thrown-away by the directors insistence of placing a 1980's David Bowie song in a WWII movie.<br/><br/>My problems (and there are many) with this movie, is the re-occurring problem i have with most Tarantino product.....he rarely knows when to either start or stop. I don't need 'homage' after 'homage' to get the *joke* (whatever it may be) I knew of Inglorious Bastards, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Ray, Hugo Stiglitz (and the ultimate crime of the entire movie) Ennio Morricone's haunting score from REVOLVER. I go to the cinema to see the stars.....if the best you can do is the dire Barad Pitt, i'll assume You (Mr Tarantino) are the main draw here? I don't want the audience directing the movie. I pay to see YOUR vision, your ideas, your creativity....NOT how you can patchwork (time and time again) endless scenes from endless movies. It's high time the fan-boys (on IMDb) employed some 'tough love' on your 'idol' (god knows, if you don't....the studios should?)<br/><br/>The tired old argument with Tarantino worshippers is ""well, if you can do better...do so"" Let me tell you, if i was a 46 year old director, with the (unfortunate) pull QT has.....i'd want to offer YOU a lot more than a warmed up muddled re-hash of better WWII movies than this tripe. The directors he attempts to emulate, made movies so bad by accident, or due to budgetary constraints. It's a cop out, time and time again, to hear his fans campaign his lack of imagination as 'art'. I'm sure he's capable of better (but after giving him the benefit of the doubt, once more....and not to mention 2 and a half hours of my life.....) maybe he isn't?"
"mr_chatila","1","505","952","26 September 2009"," Worst movie I've seen in a long time - AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS!!!
","Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing. It isn't Inglorious, its disgusting.<br/><br/>I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterds. The entire point of a film is to entertain - if u call bashing people's heads and removing their scalps entertaining!!!! - and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit, it is extreme boredom or disgust.<br/><br/>The movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages. There is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table, before, thankfully they are all shot. I wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to shut the F**K up.<br/><br/>This table talk style is a Tarantino hallmark, but in other films, I actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking. Here, I couldn't care less. All of Quentin's films display an enormous confidence, particularly Jackie Brown. But here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene, Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film.<br/><br/>Is it violent? Sure there's torture and scalping galore, but you'd have to remind me. Thankfully, the film was so thin, I didn't even remember I had seen it earlier in the day when until I saw a review headline on MSNBC.<br/><br/>He's out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel. But do us a favor QT and spare us the movie.<br/><br/>I walked out of this movie halfway through and I would never recommend anyone seeing it no matter what a die-hard quarantino fan he or she is.<br/><br/>I give it 0 / 10."

","For those that have studied WWII, and unfortunately, seen real human brains on the ground, this movie is a travesty, a sadistic farce, and a complete waste of time like most of Tarantino's other questionable work. I do admit to liking ""Reservoir Dogs"" to a point. However, this thing does not even have an original title.<br/><br/>I (unfortunately) received this DVD by mistake and see this project as a new low for Brad Pitt and the other actors taking part in this joke of making jews more barbaric than the Nazis. It perpetuates blame on the common German soldiers while covering up the major part US and UK bankers like Prescott Bush had in funding Hitler, as well as, the now confirmed part that British Intelligence had in bringing Hitler and Mussolini to power beginning immediately at the end of WWI.<br/><br/>WWII was a complex and tragic event, and the real world history deserves better than this self serving, mythological blood feast served up for fools too lazy to look for the truth and try to prevent a recurrence. History can repeat itself when we become manipulated by propaganda, desensitized to inhumane actions, and self righteous.<br/><br/>If you want to look at atrocities, many can argue that Stalin made Hitler and the Nazis look like rank amateurs in the business of murdering innocent people, as well as, the drug crazed gangs of Niger roping off streets with human intestines. Where does it end? We need to be getting the multitude of shadowy intelligence agencies under control and accountability instead of getting a cheap emotional thrill about perpetuating their myths in Hollywood and our capitol cities."

","I will never go to another Tarantino movie again. The entire film was worthless. My wife and I both regret that we didn't get up and walk out at the first indication of what the film was really going to be about (which is still hard to determine since it was such a ridiculous storyline...blood, guts, and violence seemed to be the only real theme), but we kept hoping there'd be something redeeming just around the corner. Unfortunately, there wasn't because there wasn't anything that made sense! We, along with a lot of the other people in the audience walked out of the theater muttering ""that was disgusting"", ""what a waste of time"", ""I should've walked out"", ""where was the comedy"", ""that was pathetic"", etc. It actually made us, the audience, voice our disgust and the feeling that we had just been thoroughly ripped off. The only thing of merit in the film was the costuming and the acting ability of almost everyone in the film....there just wasn't a plot/script worthy of their talents. I rate this a 1 because there isn't a 0. I can't quite understand how anyone could rate this higher than a 0!"
"nikki_wire","1","272","505","4 February 2010"," Appalling
","I simply cannot believe this movie's current rating on IMDb.<br/><br/>It is currently sitting in the IMDb top 100, nestled closely with The Bridge on the River Kwai, Raging Bull and the Prestige.<br/><br/>To find this movie in the same standing as those three is truly staggering to me. Hence I am taking the time to give this film 1 star, to hopefully help get it down towards its rightful place among the other pieces of truly worthless cinema with which it belongs.<br/><br/>I can understand that this is a movie that you either love or hate - it is certainly true that it is both a provocative and original film. However, what surprises me is the massive bias towards the ""love"" side, given the film's content - which can be summarised as an unashamedly unrealistic and soulless collection of sadistic/casual mindless violence, strangely blended with dramatic scenes of the kind of things that genuinely took place under the Nazis.<br/><br/>What I am trying to say is that combining very tense, well written SS interrogation scenes (which evoke some genuine emotional investment in the film) with comic book character British generals/Nazi leaders/Jewish soldiers makes for an extremely uncomfortable combination for me. At times it feels like someone has spliced together Schindlers List with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.<br/><br/>My best guess is that the film's originality and uncompromising approach is refreshing to people bored of the same old Hollywood formulae. Certainly the film is unpredictable. The plot (such as it is) is extremely meandering and many of the characters' actions are pretty much inexplicable. *SPOILER* (I point here towards Colonel Landa's killing of Bridget and his non-killing of Shosanna.) But then again every single character is so one dimensional that it leaves you with no idea which characters you are supposed to actually care about anyway. There is no real shock when anyone gets killed because you don't know who anyone is or what makes them tick.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt gets the award here for the most wooden and pointless character to appear - he is truly awful throughout the film and finds himself in a role where he does not have to portray a single emotion throughout the film. Nothing.<br/><br/>My final point is that originality on its own does not make a great film. Yes, Tarantino has made a movie where you see things that you have never seen before in a major Hollywood release, but that is not any sort of achievement. The reason a high budget film has not been made before where the entire German high command has a day at the cinema in occupied France with almost no guards or security is because that idea is stupid. Yes, the film is stupid - and no amount of brushing over with ""Tarantino is being postmodern"" or ""he's being ironic"" will overcome that plain fact.<br/><br/>In summary this is a film that takes an exploitation film script, (that would ordinarily be filed under ""trash cinema"") gives it a big name director/very high quality cast and then takes the plaudits for being ground breaking.<br/><br/>It is not. It is simply a steaming turd given a coat of gloss paint."

","Very entertaining, that's for sure. Great little moments ""inspired"" by other movies. ""The Guns Of Navarone"", ""Operation Crossbow"" and a myriad of 70's B exploitation Italian movies. Tarantino is certainly clever and knows how to use the camera but then, I have to say it, nothing. The childish ""divertimento"" dressed in smart ass dialog remains there. The entertainment value is, perhaps, the most one should expect from a movie but it seems a damn shame that such a talent should be put at the service of something so one dimensional. I can't help but remember Ernst Lubitch's ""To Be Or Not To Be"" that was also a comedy with remarkable, inventive dialog but it also had so many other layers that ""To Be Or Not To Be"" after 70 years still resonates with whoever has seen it. Christoph Waltz is terrific and Brad Pitt is always great fun to watch but the experience is purely epidermic in spite of some truly gruesome moments. Am I expecting oranges from an apple tree? If that's so forget what I've just said and run to meet Tarantino's basterds."
"allanharley01","1","191","350","13 March 2010"," Self indulgent and reliant on reputation
","Reviews of this film are largely split into 2 camps; it's good because, or it's bad despite, it's direction by Tarantino.<br/><br/>The question I asked myself after this was would this have been made without the Pitt/ Tarantino stamp? The answer was no; and the result was a film that made me so irate that I was moved to post my first review on IMDb...<br/><br/>I found everything about this film treated the film goer with something approaching contempt. The script was thin with the exception of one well written character - Landa. Scripting for other characters was anodyne or non-existent, or, in the case of the ""Jew-Bear"", simply a bit weird. Same for the other aspects of characterisation, that was formulaic and thin in nearly every case, especially the made-for-Pitt Aldo Raine and the other Basterds. Style pastiching that normally works didn't; subject matter was treated with either insufficient levity or indifference; scenes were badly edited or irrelevant. The redeeming aspects were cinematography and production values - style over content.<br/><br/>So - am I taking it too seriously? No; this is not a funny film (though occasionally it seems to try) and the violence that is shown sits uneasily between cartoonish and unnecessary - a prime example is that of the surrendered German who was beaten to death; added nothing, in any way. In fact the tone of the film was so inconsistent in the way it considered the material that it made me very uneasy.<br/><br/>For me - Tarantino needs to start making films to impress others, not just himself. Obviously (most of) the rest of the world disagrees, but that's something either Mr T or I will have to learn to live with...<br/><br/>One of the most disappointing films I've seen."

","I am sorry folks, but I have to say I really cannot understand the overwhelming feelings everybody gets by seeing this movie...<br/><br/>When I saw it I looked at my watch to know how much more time I had to spend with this Kindergarten nonsense.<br/><br/>So why this verdict?<br/><br/>First of all: The movie tells a story that doesn't deliver any excitement! It is not even the amusingly distorted reality of a Quentin Tarantino we used to know. This story could have come out of every little kid's head. It doesn't have anything intelligent in it, neither anything inventive and it goes on for hours... the story has appropriate content for about 30 min. The rest is just awfully enhanced scenes that are supposed to leave a somewhat cool image. Doesn't work. Even the previously seen cutbacks that Tarantino often uses just confuse and are not in any way cool. <br/><br/>Second: Some guys go to Germany and kill Nazis. Ah really? Do they? The only Nazis they killed were a handful of guys, one of them being man enough to rather die than betray his companions. Is this the ugly face Tarantino wanted to give the Nazis? A brave soldier that is more valiant than any of the ""Basterds""? Certainly not --> fail And what happens to the terrible Nazi-killing Basterds? Well they all get killed by Nazis except two who are taken hostages --> wow, what terrible revengeful monsters they are...<br/><br/>Third: Any characters? Yes one! The only role and the only gleam of hope for the entire movie is Chritoph Waltz who is building a truly deep and very detailed character here. Great acting! Brad Pitt really sucks and is completely out-acted by Waltz. Never seen a such a weak performance by Pitt... And the rest? Well, some Germans you've never seen before and will never see after. When the movie started and I saw the group of the seven Basterds I hoped to see something like the ""Magnificent Seven"": A group of extraordinary guys, each one with a distinct character, making their way to their destiny fearless and knowing... I was then very disappointed, when I saw the ""inglourious Basterds"". No details at all, no characters, no real men, just some random guys you won't remember who were not given any chance to differentiate themselves... But in fact you don't even need to differentiate, cause the ""Inglourious Basterds"" except Pitt hardly play any role in this movie...<br/><br/>So I was really disappointed, and seeing this movie on place #40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this, that leaves me with my mouth opened..."
"claudiaeilcinema","6","187","343","4 October 2009"," Tarantino and His Italian Critics
","You should hear the Italian critics talking about Tarantino and ""Inglorious Bastards"". They run out of superlatives. One of them last night actually shouted ""Tarantino is my God"". Wow! I, personally, suspect that Tarantino is the result of a generation of TV and bad (now cult) exploitation movies. I enjoy him, don't get me wrong, but I'm not shouting miracle when I still have ""The Great Escape"", for instance, so fresh in my mind. ""Inglorious Basterds"" more than any of the other Tarantino films is all about appearances. There is nothing underneath other than references to other movies. Nothing wrong with that in fact I like it but I refuse to treat Quentin Tarantino as a sort of Deity. I can't buy it. I think he should be placed exactly where he belongs among the best of his kind but what kind is that? Never mind, it works. Italian critics who are so prepared to destroy their own - you should read some of the reviews for ""Baaria"" - are prepared to fall to their knees in front of Tarantino. This are the same critics that last year, the year of ""Milk"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"" ""Edge Of Heaven"", The Wrestler"" etc, gave the David de Donatello Award for best picture to ""Grand Torino"" I want to make sure that I'm making my point clearly. ""Inglorious Bastards"" is a terrific comedy with most of Tarantino's trademark tricks in place. You'll have a great time with Brad Pitt and an incredible Christoph Waltz as the ultimate Nazi villain but don't expect a masterpiece as declared by some critics. That kind of review damages the film and me the spectator. It forces something on me. As if I was suppose to feel the same otherwise there is something wrong with me. No. I liked it, I recommend it for what it is. Period."

","""Inglorious Basterds"" is a movie so clueless, so sloppy, so jam-packed full of half-ass characters and shock-value violence, so relentlessly terrible that I can't even muster the rage and indignation that most intelligent film fans feel toward Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>I just pity him.<br/><br/>American soldiers engaging in acts of deplorable violence against Nazi soldiers is not only justified- it's hilarious! And admirable. Just look at Hugo Stiglitz' statistics from the 1942-43 season in a flashback segment narrated by Samuel L. Jackson. Yes, Samuel L. Jackson. The idea that we're supposed to derive satisfaction from the torture of Nazis is just as abhorrent as a Nazi relishing the torture of a Jew. Let me tell Quentin something he should have learned in grade school: two loathsome evils do not make a right.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt- one of my favorite actors- gives the worst performance of his career as a loudmouth macho bloodthirsty cartoon... I'll never look at him the same way again. He also looked particularly angry... for some reason I get the feeling he and Tarantino didn't quite get along. I can picture Brad slapping him silly between takes. Next time slap harder.<br/><br/>Quentin has finally gone off the deep end and become the hack we all feared he would. He doesn't know if he's making a war movie, a parody of a war movie, an outrageous B-movie bloodbath or a documentary about milk & strudel. This is the definitive shrug by an artist who has nothing to say and insists on saying it loud.<br/><br/>The one standout in the film is supposed to be Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa, the icy, intelligent, brutally-violent Nazi commander. (There's a character we've never seen before.) His only crime seems to be the masterful use of conversation as an indirect threat of violence. The only reason for this of course is that Tarantino hasn't bothered to create any genuine tension or conflict, so we as an audience are forced to watch characters being forced to listen to Landa's menacing monologues. Dinner with a Nazi is scary enough... but by the time we get to his fifth interrogation I simply stopped caring.<br/><br/>Who gets the award for worst stunt casting: human dingleberry BJ Novak from ""The Office"" or Mike Myers as British General Winthorp J. Starchington, III? I'd have to give the award to Myers, since his absurd makeup and wandering accent are funnier than Austin Powers on his best day.<br/><br/>By the film's finale even the fundamentals of film-making have been abandoned and all sense of reality obliterated. We enter a small French movie theater so full of Nazi officers and SS propaganda that it might as well be Hitler's disco. Quentin has forgotten to introduce key characters earlier in the film, so now he compensates by scrawling their names in on-screen title cards, using hand-drawn arrows to identify them in the crowd shots. (Even with this pathetically sloppy device we have no idea who these people are- or why we should care.) Then Tarantino plays a David Bowie song on the soundtrack that was recorded 40 years after the film takes place! Your guess is as good as mine.<br/><br/>A movie this awful does raise a lot of questions: Do most teenage refugees own and operate their own cinema? Are nonstop subtitles good for your eyes? Do war heroes play themselves in motion pictures? Do Nazis kidnap women and buy them dinner? Does Der Fuhrer pay full price for a matinée?<br/><br/>Does a dying German soldier have just enough energy left to shoot our heroine? Would any high-ranking Nazi ever surrender to enemy soldiers after HE captured THEM? Should you try to masquerade as Italian when you can't speak the language?<br/><br/>Was Hitler really gunned down in a movie theater?<br/><br/>Of course not.<br/><br/>Of course not.<br/><br/>GRADE: F"
"thommickel","Null","94","168","12 September 2009"," The most overrated film ever?
","""Inglourious Basterds"" is supposed to be Quentin Tarantino's homage to the Spaghetti Western. And here's what is interesting: Tarantino has had 40 years to improve on Sergio Leone's 1960s masterpieces. And he's failed miserably.<br/><br/>""Basterds"" is a rambling, incoherent mess of a movie. It's obvious that Tarantino desperately wants to be the ultimate ""bad boy"" of cinema who makes ""controversial"" films. But if Tarantino really wanted to be controversial in making a war film, he'd tackle the horrors of the Iraq War, instead of World War II, a long-ago war that already has been re-hashed over and over from every conceivable angle over the decades.<br/><br/>Tarantino deeply wants to shock us, to outrage us and to create disturbing art. And he fails miserably. The fact is, Leone was infinitely more daring and controversial way back in 1968 than Tarantino ever has been. When Leone depicted the vicious cold-blooded gunning down of a child in ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"" he created a scene that Tarantino would never, ever have the courage to film. Compared to scenes like that, everything in ""Basterds"" is tame and predictable (as is the case with all of Tarantino's work).<br/><br/>Last, but not least, I really can't understand why anyone would be interested in Tarantino's take on the 1960s Spaghetti Western film genre. I mean, why not just watch the stunning originals? The original Italian directors did vastly more with their tiny budgets than Tarantino can do with his bloated $80 million budgets.<br/><br/>If you want truly challenging and original film-making these days, I urge you to check out the best of what East Asian cinema has to offer. (Takashi Miike is infinitely more daring, dangerous and talented than Tarantino). Tarantino is a grossly overrated director and the fact that his work is praised in the U.S. shows just how utterly creatively bankrupt Hollywood is these days."

","Tarantino continues to make idiotic cartoons that at best glorify and at worst encourage violence. Next time there's a mass shooting somewhere, consider whether movies like this one have made violence fashionable, dramatic, cool, newsworthy, glorious or even a little less than totally unacceptable.<br/><br/>Suspension of disbelief can't possibly include fantasizing that the Nazis would be stupid enough to send all four of its top leaders into a tiny Jewish-run cinema in Paris. Comic book authors usually won't insult their readers to that extent. On the contrary, they tend to write with a level of logic and intelligence far above Tarantino.<br/><br/>Production, acting, music, cinematography in the film are very good, but they can't counteract the insipid premise, plot, and overall concept. Speaking of music, the borrowed Morricone pieces are very good, but the rock, r&b, etc., are totally out of place and tear down the facade of a period piece.<br/><br/>Similarly, Christoph Waltz as SS detective Hans Landa gave an amazing performance which was ruined by psychotic leaps out of character as written by Tarantino. Yes it showed Waltz's amazing acting range, but it also destroyed the integrity of his character.<br/><br/>There are numerous ""artistic"" continuity errors in the film, no doubt created to give a cleaner looking shot. When Landa strangles von Hammersmark, both of their chairs mysteriously disappear. When Raine carves Landa's forehead, Landa's handcuffs disappear so he can grasp at the grass in pain, etc. Again this reinforces the notion that these are comics, and rather bad ones at that."

","Hooray for Title Misspellings! After reading reviews and contemplating, my girlfriend and I confirmed that this movie is an utter piece of trash. This movie lost her as one of those Rare Tarantino fans.I wish it were made on nitrate film, and all the copies piled neatly underneath a chain-smoking Tarantino fanboy. The literally needless violence, the plot holes, Tarantino's table-itis sans drama, and absent character development made this a thoroughly painful, glorified montage. <br/><br/>What acting was there? And how much of that was just because I was too busy reading the subtitles? I watch my share of fansubbed anime, and kudos for the attempt at authenticity, but it was overdone for an English-language movie. With the glaring historical inadequacies, the constant reading killed what acting there was.<br/><br/>Why pay money for a narrator who will have absolutely no tie to any of the characters, plot, themes, setting, or anything involved in the movie? When the movie needs that sort of off hand explanation, it's foreshadowing the utter filth that follows.<br/><br/>Historical Research - while it was sprinkled with interesting factiods, used the proper costumes and props for the soldiers, this movie stretched the truth beyond belief even for historical fiction. Kudos on Mata Hari reference, though using it as foreshadowing was a bit much. Mata Hari was executed by a firing squad, not choked in an isolated room. This ruined any sense that the reference may have had.<br/><br/>Other reviews mention more than half a dozen homages to other artists in the first 15 minutes. Considering the audience, all these and other references were completely lost on many who would bother to see this movie, and all who would enjoy it.<br/><br/>I'm confused by his choices of when to start a scene, end it, and what needs to be included. In a movie promoted as an action film, why did it take nearly 20 minutes to set up any sort of testosterone? <br/><br/>What I believe to be the message was trite. The idea of rats and how we act on a primal nature against them, and ""who is the rat?"" were at best clichéd, but at worst not realized. Mention of American camps for the Japanese and German Americans would have added legitimacy to this question to the moral high ground. Literally every character in the film that gets a speaking role was caught up in their own legend. Is that the world in which Tarantino lives?<br/><br/>I'm glad I didn't pay to see this one. I regret that I bothered to view it at all, even with well-meaning hosts. There was a rich base of ideas to develop, but none were realized."

","I must admit when I saw the preview for ""Inglorious Basterds"" I gave myself big expectations. THIS FILM DID NOT Disappoint.<br/><br/>Rarely when I watch a movie with such high-expectations do I have those expectations met or exceeded; this film did that and more. Even more rarely do I clap at the end of a movie, this I and everyone else in the theater did.<br/><br/>I have to say I am a little biased towards Quentin, I grew up with ""Pulp Fiction."" I watched it when I was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film.<br/><br/>However, since then Quentin has not really lived up to his billing. His style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar, the quality honestly wasn't there (I never watched Jackie Brown, and then there's Grindhouse). That is until ""Inglorious Basterds."" What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but seeing how Leone is dead, Tarantino's the self appointed guy on this masterpiece.<br/><br/>So let's look at the movie which I won't give away. The writing was spot on, a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie. Not to mention this movie was set up in the classic Tarantino mold, great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action.<br/><br/>The acting was superb!! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, seriously. I don't say that often, but honestly the man should get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie, and delivered with such amazing touch and poise. He stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive.<br/><br/>I have no problem building this movie up, because this movie is the best film I've seen all year, and probably all of next year. Quite frankly the more I think about it, this movie may crack my top films of all time, and is Quentin's best movie since ""Pulp Fiction."" Take it from me, watch this film. I loved it doesn't do this movie enough justice.<br/><br/>I watched it yesterday and I'm still blown away. Thank you Quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie.

Even his best work, Reservoir Dogs, wasn't a 'masterpiece.' The trouble is that claiming that you like Tarantino's work has become trendy. As soon as that happens, you get boatloads of people ready and willing to hop on another bandwagon. They will ignore laughably terrible acting, and utterly self-indulgent writing just so they can be part of the exclusive club called ""everyone."" This movie is so terrible, that I swear it must be some sort of twisted joke by Tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him. Like another reviewer has already said: ""Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing."" I couldn't agree more. This movie is nothing more than self-indulgent and in-joke riddled writing paired with acting ability taken right out of a high school play.

Less than Stalin though. Perhaps one of the new Russian billionaires will finance a film about stalin? And it is still true, as in the film, that Jewish people run the movie making industry in America so where is the irony?

"doughelo","1","70","125","1 April 2010"," I don't know WHAT this film was supposed to be
","This was by far the worst and sickest Tarantino film I've seen, and I've seen all but one. It's an ungainly mix of cartoony revenge fantasy and sub-Eli Roth torture porn. <br/><br/>The Basterds roam around France without any apparent source of supplies, ammunition, or command of any language other than English. Their actions are hideous, scalping bodies (with vivid sound effects and exposed brains), carving swastikas in foreheads..slowly.., sticking fingers in bullet holes, yet these are the good guys and the torture is played for laughs. Tarantino doesn't know any difference between ordinary (e.g. drafted) German soldiers and Nazis, and thus any amount of carving up is OK as long as it's done by Jews or their redneck leader. I guess he thinks it'd be equally OK if the Germans scalped American bodies and carved stars in their foreheads? <br/><br/>Tarantino is good at dialog and set pieces, but fails to weave them together into a coherent narrative. There are basically two revenge fantasies coming together in the Paris movie premiere, but neither one affects the other. There is zero character establishment or development. We're not told how a penniless Jewish girl came to own a fabulous movie theater a few years later in occupied Paris, or even how she established a false identity. None of the Basterds have separable personalities or life histories (we don't even find out why Aldo has a rope burn on his neck). Compare and contrast with ""The Dirty Dozen.""<br/><br/>The climactic premiere sequence is so absurd it's not even laughable. Sometime after the Allied invasion (which is never referred to, although we've been told it's June 1944), the entire German high command takes off for a gala film event in Paris, about 300 miles from the front lines (it's not like they had any pressing business). At the theater, Hitler is protected by a grand total of TWO guards. When you can't even be as realistic as a Mel Brooks movie (""To Be or Not To Be""), you're just insulting the audience. I've seen better security at the library.<br/><br/>Hmm, what else? <br/><br/><ul><li>Why aren't the Basterds surprised when the theater catches on fire? That wasn't part of their plan. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why did Landa completely lose control and strangle the actress? It's wildly out of character from every other scene. If he's angry she's a traitor, he already has it in mind to become an even bigger traitor himself. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why does every German they meet speak English? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>What was the point of scalping the driver at the end? The war was about to be over, who were they trying to freak out? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Does Tarantino even know what Goebbels looked like?</li></ul><br/><br/>I could go on, but it's like picking apart the physics of Bugs Bunny.

","PLOT (or lack thereof): A group of Jewish American soldiers, led by Brad Pitt, go overseas to during World War 2 to terrorize and massacre Nazis while a Jewish cinema owner, the only survivor of her family, having barely escaped a German soldier known as ""The Jew Hunter"" played Christopher Waltz, who now plots to have her revenge when a film about a German sharp shooter is forced upon her to debut at her theater, while Waltz plans defection.<br/><br/>The film is really nothing but another exercise on director Quentin Tarantino's part to see just how much useless dialogue he can cram into a scene and see how long he can drag a scene out before the audience gives up and turns the film off (similar to his misguided ""Death Proof""). Where Tarantino's earlier films, affectionate deconstructions of the noir genre, had enough chaotic energy to keep the viewer engaged while his characters blathered nonsense, much of it pop culture and cinema laced, this time around, like Death Proof, Tarantino fails to bring any of that lost energy to the proceedings. The film is dull, inert, and lifeless. Scenes drag on pointlessly with no real tension, in no small part because the characters are cardboard cut outs. Even Christopher Waltz's much ballyhooed and frankly overrated performance as the ""Jew Hunter"" Nazi fails to set off any sparks. The fact that the character is more annoying than interesting doesn't help.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and his ""Basterds"" aren't even in the film that much. While the marketing campaign suggested a darkly comic take on the Magnificent Seven formula, the truth is the that Pitt and the ""Basterds"" are barely plot devices.<br/><br/>Trust me, you won't miss much by skipping this inglorious mess."

","When I saw the trailers for Inglorious Basterds, I was less than impressed. I have a (very) soft spot in my heart for Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but the movie seemed ridiculous. So I watched it with very low expectations. <br/><br/>I sadly found out that I was correct in my assumptions. The movie manages to feel like 5 hours and still be very thin, both in plot and characterization. Tarantino tried to cram in a 12 hours long movie into 150 minutes and it failed - miserably. The Basterds storyline is by far the weakest. We are treated to a short speech about the Nazi killers, a few few short scenes and montages and then the final massacre at the theater. I feel that Tarantino would have been better off leaving them as shadowy figures in the background, as a real band of vengeful and silent assassins, instead of making them appear as unlikable cretins. Give them less screen time, but make it count. <br/><br/>The Shosanna storyline is as thin, but at least Laurent's character's back story is given to the viewer (in parts, at least). The love story with Marcel also felt tacked on at all moments. <br/><br/>What is even sadder is that the movie started out great. The farm scene is up there with Tarantino's best offerings. Much of that praise can be attributed to Waltz's performance as Lauda which is simply stunning and frightening. Too bad the movie started going downhill afterward, what with wooden 40 minutes dialogs (nothing new for Tarantino there, but at least the long conversations used to be funny or clever) and superfluous/masturbatory references that only served to remind the viewer that he was watching a QT flick.<br/><br/>Still, the movie merits a viewing if only for Col. Lauda, but it certainly won't become a classic."
"laojim","1","43","74","20 April 2010"," Propaganda
","This is the sort of thing that you expect during a war and in America we have one every few years so there are plenty of them to compare this dog of a film to.<br/><br/>This is, above all, a propaganda film made, apparently, to demonstrate that all cruelty and savagery is permitted as long as it is in the interest of the Hollywood master race, the American. We are treated to psychopathic war criminals who extract their arbitrary vengeance on anyone they see as inferior and subhuman. This is supposed to be inspiring or amusing because the chosen villains are Nazis. This appears to be the the gist of the action.<br/><br/>There are a couple of obvious problems with this. First, of course, is the nature of evil. St. Ignatius in his spiritual exercises suggested imagining the army of good lined up against the army of evil so that one might contemplate the differences. This exercise has some problems as Thomas Merton pointed out, saying that he couldn't do it because it became much too much like Cecil B. Demille's Hollywood epics. Here, however, the legions of the good are apparently headed by a fellow playing a Cherokee descended country bumpkin who wants nothing more than to kill Nazis and who has, as a right hand man, a deranged Bostonian Jew who beats people to death while babbling about the Red Sox, for reasons I was never clear about. Clearly this is not what St. Ignatius had in mind and does not seem to partake of any essence of the good.<br/><br/>Second, having been raised by German Nazis in post war America I am in a position to point out that while Nazi ideology is fairly hideous, the Nazis themselves were, like other people, real people with faults and virtues. It was, I believe, Brownowski who said that the horror of the death camps was not that people were led to their deaths by Germans, but that they were led to their deaths by people whistling Mozart.<br/><br/>In the beginning of this film the countryside is being scoured by a German officer in a well pressed uniform looking for Jews using a small notebook. We know that, in fact, the ""final solution"" was implemented by means of an IBM machine leased from the company in America. All very modern and civilized. The Nazis were not Neanderthals who dined on the blood of babies every evening, they were among the most civilized people that the world had to offer at the time.<br/><br/>The lunatics in this film are, in large part, Americans and, in particular, Jewish Americans. We are presented with a gallery of Jewish criminals being given a last chance at redemption by the country boy who wants to have them scalp Nazis. Scalping is credited in the movie to the Apaches, a tribe of native Americans who lived in the hills of western Arizona and who did not practice scalping, at least not until they learned it from the inventors of the practice, the English. So the scalp hunting Jews are portrayed as sympathetic because of what they or their kin suffered from the Germans. This is a familiar type reminiscent of some of Leon Uris' characters who survived the war to become terrorists for the yet unfounded state of Israel in Exodus.<br/><br/>All of this and much more, is just the sort of thing one expects in wartime. It is called propaganda. The enemy, in this case the Nazi, is portrayed as less than human or as a defective human who can be killed in amusing ways by any form of cruelty or savagery because it is clothed in the armor of rightness. It's all OK, because it's just a country boy's attempt, to distribute a little justice in a confused and possibly mad world and if the Bear Jew and some of the others get a little carried away, well, it's all in a good cause.<br/><br/>Of course, it is all in the past and in Europe. No Iraqi's, Afghanis, or Palestinians are killed by the glorious bastards, and no reference oblique or direct is made that I noticed, although I admit my attention wandered rather badly in the second half. Still, with those wars under way this is the move that is offered to us as a paean to the rightness of the American and for that it is should be clearly labeled as propaganda.<br/><br/>I find all this to be a far more than I care to spend an hour and a half watching and I do not recommend it to you."

","I really found this film so bad, the main reason I found it very offensive is that it has a theme of sadistic punishment being carried out against German soldiers by the American Jewish ""heroes"", and this is supposed to be ""justice"". Smashing captured German soldiers heads off with a baseball bat, carving swastikas into their foreheads. In Germany everyone age 16-60 had to join the army and most were just decent ordinary people and they in no way deserved to be tortured. Yet this film wants its audience to get satisfaction from seeing German people, any German, being tortured, by a jew. <br/><br/>Mentions of Jewish persecution are also overdone and constant references to the holocaust and stigma over ""anti-semitism"" is even used as a political tool for Zionist war crimes in Israel today. Did the film show any disabled, homosexuals, gypsies etc being persecuted? Is the film a sob story about the 20 million Russians killed during the war? Of course not it focused 100% on jews and they are the one and only we must feel sorry for, once again as all you can expect from American films.<br/><br/>This has been called a ""Jewish revenge movie"". The holocaust has been propagandised and used to justify crimes which Jewish supremacists commit today. When you consider the fanatical actions of Zionists against people who are against their racist ideologies (which even includes assassinating holocaust survivors who speak out against Zionist ideology), when you consider the Zionist war crimes against the Palestinian people and then even netanyahu trying to justify this by blaming Palestinians for the holocaust, it is terrible that a violent Jewish revenge/torture and propaganda movie has been made to cater to this bloodlust which does exist in zionists/Jewish extremists today (just watch israelis who watch the bombing of Gaza whilst cheering). <br/><br/>So rather than this (""yeah jews torture and murder those Germans yeah thats what they deserve!"") how about a movie like Schindlers list but instead set in occupied Palestine and showing the suffering of the people there today?! Because that's what I'd like to see. Not a film which once again tells everyone to feel sorry for Jewish people and that violence and torture committed by Jewish people is OK.

There are two scenes in this movie that are striking and worthy -- the opening scene where Christopher Walz (Col. Landa) was looking for hidden Jews, and the second when a number of the ""Basterds"" are in a cellar pub trying to make contact with a defecting actress, but are interrupted by unforeseen events.

As they enter the theatre we don;t really care if they will live or die. <br/><br/>We have the traditional Mexican stand-off, a staple of Tarantino when he is too lazy to be creative. A German war hero becomes smitten with the owner of the theatre, the survivor of the family tragedy. He tries to woo her, and when she tells him that she is not interested, for about the fourth time, he suddenly becomes aggressive and completely out of character....but at least out of character is better than no character at all, as the players in this movie drift in and out of dialogue without displaying any sense of who they are.<br/><br/>For a movie to run two and a half hours, one would think the characters would be well defined and make us care about them. One wonders just what the hell Tarantino spent his time on...endless chatter that amounted to one third of the film's plot, repeated ad nauseum in three languages."

Killing unarmed kneeing people with baseball bat's is tough? The Nazi sign on the head is nothing else as the Yellow star (even worse cause its not removable). The story is simple, also the characters - only a little thrill and the rest is very very dumb. Nazis killing is fun,Nazis are no humans - before 60 years it was the same, only with Jews instead of Nazis. Looks like you've learned exactly NOTHING! So who are the real Nazis in this movie? So many people like this crap, i'm really afraid!"
"runeba5","1","50","89","25 September 2010"," Inglorious Failure
","The failure of ""Inglourious Basterds"" is the failure of ""Death Proof"" and the ""Kill Bill"" films. After ""Jackie Brown"" Tarantino jettisoned any concern with gripping storytelling and decided to focus on constructing fan-boyish collages, like an amateur film maker recreating his favorite moments from the movies. Perhaps though this change of direction for Tarantino isn't merely a matter of choice–he may simply be burned out in terms of generating story ideas. After all, one can't be gifted in every facet. Tarantino can direct and construct involving, musical dialog–but the man may no longer be capable of originating good stories, and his best work — Pulp Fiction — may have been a fluke as far as HIS contribution to the story of the film is concerned. After all, Roger Avery wrote a third of the script, though he merely gets a ""stories"" co-credit. ""Reservoir Dogs"" lifted its most important plot and story elements from the Hong Kong film ""City On Fire"" from the late 80s. And ""Jackie Brown"" — his second best work — was an adaptation of a work by a writer who Tarantino drew a lot of inspiration from. But Tarantino has given several interviews in which he claimed that he is very distanced from ""Jackie Brown,"" a distance that no doubt stems from the fact that when audiences see it they can't help but appreciate Elmore Leonard as much as Tarantino. In Hollywood, the writer-director is the most prestigious position. But many of the greatest directors have, of course, depended for ideas on novelists and screen-writers. Perhaps Tarantino doesn't care to stoop so low as them again.<br/><br/>In Kill Bill, what happened to the Bride, and her subsequent quest, was largely goofy. Rather than taking a true risk and making an actual film which involved revenge, Tarantino chose a cheaper, satirical route, so that the revenge quest was treated so satirically and frivolously as to preempt any criticism of the film's plot or characters, i.e, the ""it's bad on purpose!"" defense. The only way to criticize the film was to take issue with the whole cold exercise and observe that Tim Roth getting shot in the stomach in ""Reservoir Dogs"" and the audience squirming in their seats as he bled profusely was preferable to Sofie Fatale getting her arm chopped off and the audience laughing.<br/><br/>There is no good story in Inglourious Basterds either, and just as in Kill Bill the revenge and dealing out of justice are treated too outlandishly to be taken seriously as plots. It isn't that the lack of seriousness which undermines the story but that the lack of seriousness covers up the poor nature of the storytelling. We are asked to accept the premise of The Basterds solely on the basis of such a group of characters having been featured in World War 2 films previously. There is no reason for the ""Basterds"" to be comprised primarily of Jews except that Tarantino requires it to fit in with the revenge theme. And it is not required that the film be replete with overt verbal allusions to cinematic figures other that Tarantino wants to be too cute by half.<br/><br/>The use of chapter breaks in Pulp Fiction elegantly delineated the separate plot threads. Tarantino in Inglourious Basterds (and in Kill Bill) has become dependent on chapter breaks as a way to cut into any scene without having to get there through a narrative. Why establish the details of how Shoshana came to possess her a new identity and a theater? Just cut to the exact place the character needs to be to enact her revenge! Why, indeed, bother with the details of how to get from one set piece to another? Just give each one it's own ""chapter"" to relieve the director/writer and the audience of the bothersome details of a smooth narrative.<br/><br/>Gratuitousness abounds. We aren't shown the bodies of the murdered Jews, yet we're given full view of the scalping of Nazi soldiers. Did Tarantino think that the former undercut his whole ""lolzviolence!"" shtick? In two instances a narrator intrudes and embellishes arbitrary details. Michael Fassbender's character is painstakingly introducedonly to lamely die the next scene. Tarantino kills of Shoshana in an anti-climatic fashion just so he can resurrect her on the big screen. Two of the Basterds get so carried away in pummeling the Nazis at the theater with bullets that they forget the bombs they're strapped to, but just why they would be suicidal isn't made clear.<br/><br/>But it doesn't make sense, I suppose, to get too worked up over any of its details. As said before, the only recourse is to question the whole exercise and the artistic dead-end it represents. The films of the post-Jackie Brown Tarantino will not inspire anyone. They are the products of a fearful film maker aware that, like Orson Wells, he made his greatest film too young. And rather than settling into a comfortable routine of Jackie Brown like films–i.e, substantive and effective thrillers not stylistically overdone based on novels or screenplays not by him– he has opted to produce a flow of pastiches whose failure on a storytelling and character level critics won't hold him accountable for due to the -mere exercise- nature of the films. But at least he gets sole credit."

","I have been feeling a little disappointed by Tarantino ever since death proof. But i insist it was only a little, because i can appreciate the amount of work in producing such an homage to stunts people. Inglorious Basterds has definitely propelled Tarantino to the top ranks in my universe. This movie can be summed up (albeit inadequately) in one word : ""RAW"". <br/><br/>There is an intense emotion in every scene. Revenge and justice seem to be the main themes, From the start of the movie one feels compassion towards the victims of the Nazis, and is placed in Tarantino's fictional dimension of the WW2 historical context. <br/><br/>Characters are unpredictiable, fun, scary, brutal, sexy, and other adjectives i am sure are escaping my mind that are just as fitting and positive. I won't go in to an appreciation of each character, but the other comments by fellow users sum up the appreciation of the various performances. <br/><br/>Dialogue has evolved from the classic Tarantino ""bad ass"" provocative style as seen in Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. One can feel in the dialogues that Tarantino is making more open references to other movies. Indeed, many dialogues were near lessons in cinema to the audience, the setting partly takes place at a movie premiere ; a reference to a movie is close around every corner. <br/><br/>It is nice to see that each language presented (German, French, and English) is employed rather equally and naturally. I speak both French and English very fluently, and am frequently disappointed in how English speaking characters in french movies act poorly, and how french speaking characters in English/American movies act poorly. Amazingly enough, Tarantino managed to make his actors pull off a natural and graceful performance from his actors. It helps put the audience in context of the historical context. Indeed ; soldiers, spies and civilans rarely understood soldiers/spies/civilians from other countries.<br/><br/>The visuals/photography are beautiful, with sceneries convincingly conveying a 1940s WWII Europe. The outfits are perfect, and the violence orgasmically/realistically conveyed. No punches are held back, and the Nazis are often shown being tortured. This makes the movie not open to all audiences ; the graphic violence can shock the more sensitive demographic. <br/><br/>volumes can be written about this movie. But the movie is so good, that during the North American Inglorious Basterds premiere at the Fantasia Festival in Montreal, i had to pee, but refused to go so as to not miss one single scene. I hope that image conveys how strongly i feel about this movie, and i'm a hard audience to please."

","This movie is nothing but a ""What If"" movie and not a good one at that. Spoilers throughout! What if we let soldiers run loose as a blood thirsty mob hacking away and beating the enemy to a pulp with a baseball bat, scalping them, mutilating them with no regard to the Geneva Conventions in regard to treatment of prisoners. What if the Germans were complete idiots when it came to security. Let's get real folks, do you believe that three Americans posing as Italians but not being able to speak Italian would have been let within 100 miles of Adolf Hitler. The whole idea of Adolf Hitler attending a movie in occupied France is pretty far fetched in itself, let alone throw in all the security blunders such as not having guards posted at all entrance and exit points, the roof, basement and inside the theater itself. That Hitler would have been seated with the rest and not had a private viewing spot that was also heavily guarded. That there would not have been any K9's to sniff out bombs. Then the final insult, what if Hitler had been killed, no mutilated with a slurry of machine gun fire along with the rest of his elite officers. So much for history, we are now in fantasy land. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a complete fantasy but at least there was plot that made it a great movie. I might as well have been watching my nephew play one of his war video games. Big Spoiler Here! The movie was suppose to be about a group of men who took on the German army but there were only a few scenes of them. Those scenes were bloody and brutal and if anything left you feeling sorry for the Germans. Somehow this group blundered in on a secret mission that would get rid of the entire German leadership. The whole spy thing goes bad when an SS officer detects the English accent of the spy posing as a German officer, duh. To make matters worse three of the Basterds then take the spot of the spys that were killed and we are suppose to believe that these three Americans who spoke only a few words of Italian passed without incident to sit only a few rows away from Hitler himself. Then with only the barest of security our Basterds are able to plow down the entire German military leadership along with Hitler himself. Really, I've told better tales than this. I was really hoping for something more intelligent than this. I'm trying to figure out how this movie rated so well, did we watch the same movie or has the audience just forgotten what a good movie is?"

","A review by Dr. Joseph Suglia Thanks to Quentin Tarantino, the succeeding generation will believe that Hitler was assassinated. Thanks to Quentin Tarantino, they will believe that the Jews overcame the Nazis. They will not know that around six million Jews – not to mention gays and political dissidents -- were funneled into factories of death, where they were stripped, shorn, shot, gassed, shoved into ovens, burned.<br/><br/>No Jews are incinerated in Inglourious Basterds (2009), Tarantino's most malevolent travesty and perhaps the most ethically reprehensible motion picture ever made. Nazis are incinerated. Machine-gunned and set aflame. In a cinema. In Vichy France. In 1944. By a band of Jewish-American soldiers and French resistance fighters.<br/><br/>What, precisely, was Tarantino hoping to accomplish by this fusillade of historical revisionism? Is this nothing more than a puerile time-machine fantasy? To deprive Hitler of the right to be killed by his own hand? Tarantino's own remarks belie this interpretation: ""The power of the cinema is going to bring down the Third Reich. I get a kick out of that!"" When the Nazis are cremated in the cinema, then, Tarantino is cinematically cremating the memory of their dominion. The burning cinema is the central metaphor of the film. It is a self-reflexive metaphor.<br/><br/>Predictably, few Americans seem to have a problem with this dehistoricization and rehistoricization of the Holocaust. After all, America is a country without much of a history of its own. Most of us are afflicted with historical amnesia. To demonstrate my point, let me adduce a personal example. I posted the first sentence of this review on MySpace last year: ""Thanks to Quentin Tarantino, the succeeding generation will believe that Hitler was assassinated."" I received this in response (the grammatical mistakes have been retained for the sake of authenticity): ""Aint it grand though!"" If this is what most Americans believe, then we are lost. The entire culture is lost.<br/><br/>What no one seems to recognize is that the film is an insult both to those who survived the Holocaust and to those who died in it.<br/><br/>The destruction of history is politically dangerous. It is also a form of ethical rape, especially when that history is fraught with so much hideousness, so much carnage, so much death, so much sorrow. To the supporters of the film, let me ask: Do you honestly think that survivors of the Shoah would approve of this film? Though Tarantino may claim that his film revolts against the Third Reich, it does nothing of the sort. Inglorious Basterds does not combat fascism. By liquidating history, it allies itself with fascism. It is a film that uses the same totalitarian methods as the Nazi propagandists, despite Tarantino's misguided intentions. Holocaust revisionists such as Ingrid Rimland (and so many others) would applaud what Tarantino has done in this film. After all, he has created a film in which the Nazis lose, the Jews win, and the Holocaust never takes place. Is that not what the fascist ""historians"" have been saying all along? Permit me to make a few remarks about Tarantino's method of presentation.<br/><br/>No one has described Tarantino better than the brilliant English novelist and critic Will Self. The filmmaker is a ""pasticheur and an artistic fraud,"" Self writes. Indeed he is all of that and much worse. Nearly every image in Tarantino's cinema is derivative or evocative of something else. The climax of Death Proof (2007)—in which a misogynist is surrounded by a ring of femmes fatales and pummeled into unconsciousness—blatantly and uninventively reconstitutes a formally identical moment in Russ Meyer's Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965). Another scene in Death Proof—in which the female leads are surreptitiously photographed—repeats one of Dario Argento's lavish set-pieces in The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1969). Even the same Ennio Morricone music is deployed.<br/><br/>In Inglorious Basterds there are references to many films, such as Revolver (1973), another film scored by Morricone, and Clouzot's Le Corbeau (1943). Curiously, none of these allusions add to the film. Tarantino merely showcases the cultural references. He seems incapable of communicating himself cinematically except by way of derivations from other works of cinema. He does not create. He does not originate. He does not imagine. He does not conceive. He ventriloquizes.<br/><br/>I could not help but feel a certain depression after viewing this abominable film. I recalled that in the 1990s Tarantino was given carte blanche – the whitest of white cards – from critics for his use of racist language. Here we have a work not of anti-Semitism, but of anti-Judaism.<br/><br/>How is it that Michael Haneke's elegantly chilling The White Ribbon (2009), a film that casts a dark light on some of the conditions that led to National Socialism, is largely unseen and this atrocity is surrounded by a cavalcade of approval? Inglourious Basterds is slime.<br/><br/>Dr. Joseph Suglia"
"marklv","3","29","49","20 December 2009"," Ridiculous cartoon strip movie
","This must be Tarantino's worst movie. Not only is the storyline utterly absurd and implausible, but the characters are straight out of a comic book for 10-14 year old boys. I cannot understand why this loathsome piece of cinematic garbage gets such good reviews from people who really should know better. What is so great about a bunch of American Jews, hellbent on violent revenge, who go into occupied France to kill (murder) as many Germans as possible? And the idea that the entire Nazi leadership, including Hitler, would gather to a cinema in Paris to watch the premiere of a new Nazi movie, is so stupid and implausible that it's not even funny. At least Tarantino's previous films, though as insanely violent as this one, did have good story lines and were credible. This one is straight from the mind of an inmate of some lunatic asylum. Fans of Tarantino will praise everything he does, but this creation is well below his best. The only positive thing about the movie is the superb performance of Christoph Waltz."
"lana-masenko","10","59","108","2 October 2009"," Who are you calling a basterd?
","First of all some general phrases about 'Inglourious Basterds' that every fan of this movie says: great plot, great actors and unforgettable performances (yes, especially by Christoph Waltz), great cinematography and great soundtrack Is that really it? No, there's definitely more to 'Inglourious Basterds' then what was mentioned above, there is something that makes this movie special. If one would want to summarise the whole story depicted in 'Basterds' with one phrase then it would probably be this one: 'Things are not as they appear to be, nor are they otherwise.' But it happens to be that I have a little more to say than one phrase. And so<br/><br/>The great moral of this movie or the great lesson that it gives us is this: our world is not just black and white, it's not the mixture of only good and bad, both 'good' and 'bad' things can be found in everyone and everything, and who is a hero and who is a villain depends totally on your perspective. Don't get me wrong, I am not talking about Hitler; but let's for example take Perrier LaPadite, how should we feel towards him? Is he a hero or a villain? He knows that if he doesn't collaborate with the Germans he and his family will be arrested and/or killed, but the Jewish family will die any way, whether he collaborates or not. And now let's look at a German Sgt. Werner Rachtman who finds himself in a similar position, and yet he shows unbelievable courage in the face of inevitable death. So should we despise him just because he's a German soldier and admire the clownish psychopath Donny Donowitz just because he's a Jew? Hardly. At least in my modest opinion. And then there are Hans Landa and Aldo Raine. I suppose that when trying to understand Landa or to express our feelings towards him we (the audience) should be very careful and we should also keep in mind that there is a very clear line between the actor and the character. Christoph Waltz was absolutely brilliant, but I guess his brilliant performance 'tricks' the audience into liking Col. Landa but if you take a second look at him you realize that no matter what intelligence and sophisticated manners (although Bridget von Hammersmark would disagree) he possesses there is not much left to like about him. As to Brad Pitt's Lt. Raine, we must like him because he's an American soldier fighting for a great cause, and so we forgive him for lacking both charm and manners and and then we take a closer look at him too. And what we find is that there is not much to like about him either, because in reality Raine is much more similar to Landa then it might appear at a first glance. Take the interrogation scenes for example: both are quite similar (Hans Landa interrogating the French farmer/ Aldo Raine interrogating the German sergeant), the behaviour of both Landa and Raine is actually identical: the things they demand – point where the Jews are hiding = point (on the map) where the German positions are; the things they offer – give me information and we'll leave your family alone = give me information and will let you go; the way they behave – actually both Landa and Raine behave rather friendly only Landa seams to be more glamorous and sophisticated; the way they both deceive their victim/captive – they both start a seemingly innocent conversation (rats and hawks and squirrels = what are you going to do after the war) and than –bang! – either kill the hiding Jews or carve a swastika on a soldier's forehead. As to the movie's title I've read in some other comments that it's inappropriate because 'the Basterds are given so little time in the movie', well, to my mind it depends on who are you calling a 'basterd'; it seams to me that none of the characters is innocent, everyone is a basterd: the French farmer who (although under the great pressure) betrays the Jewish family, the German actress who betrays her country (yes, betrays, for as Landa points out she only spied for the British for money), Shoshanna who threatens to bury an axe in a man's head and kill his wife and children, a somewhat shy and innocent-looking German sniper and yes , of course , Col. Landa, Lt. Raine and the (original) Basterds, Gestapo major and all the rest of German soldiers, Goebbels and Francesca Mondino, Hitler, but 'that goes without saying' and those people in the audience who jeer while the 'bad guys' are being scalped... <br/><br/>I would also like to say a couple of words about the so-called historical inaccuracy. Well, first of all, this is not a historic movie and it does not pretend to be one. The thing is, when we see a movie/read a book like 'The three musketeers' or something similar with a lot of (intended) historical inaccuracies we have no problem with that because, obviously, it all happened a long time a go, so who cares? The problem with the 'Basterds' is that the story is set against the background of WW 2 and this is still a rather sensitive topic – you can do whatever you like with the French kings but you cannot touch Hitler. I personally find this rather odd.<br/><br/>Now to draw up the conclusion I'll have to repeat something I've already said before: we are too accustomed to take things shown in the movie idealistically, meaning we always tend to classify, to label facts, people, ideas, etc. as either good or bad, right or wrong and we keep forgetting that there's always the other side of the coin, the other perspective"

","It's one of those movies that's difficult to evaluate because it's as inconsistent as it is. The plot is ludicrous yet there are very suspenseful moments embedded in it. Nobody could have made this except Quentin Tarantino -- it's that original -- and yet it rips off bits of business and entire subplots from a dozen or more other sources.<br/><br/>Any enthusiasm I felt for it is limited because some scenes -- the entirety of ""Chapter One"" -- approach a kind of pornography of torture that's in danger of becoming a genre unto itself, and Tarantino, the writer and director, seems to get too much of a kick out what is some pretty ugly stuff.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is an American officer with an atrocious mountain accent who recruits a half dozen men to be inserted into France with the object of killing Nazis. The men are Jewish. The reasoning goes: the Nazis kill Jews, therefore we will kill Nazis. The collateral killing of any innocents is beside the point. The innocent must be punished along with the guilty. See ""The Dirty Dozen"" is you want a classier presentation of this moral nihilism.<br/><br/>Not only do Pitt and his men kill the Nazis they capture. They scalp them too, and Tarantino treats the audience several times to explicit scenes of the men slicing the scalps of hair from the skulls of the dead.<br/><br/>One captured officer is told to indicate where his unit is and how well armed and refuses, saying he will not yield information that will endanger the lives of German soldiers. There's a scene in ""Reservoir Dogs,"" in which Michael Madsen is left alone with an innocent policeman and caresses his razor as he describes the pleasure he's going to get from torturing the prisoner. In ""Reservoir Dogs,"" Madsen is the sadistic madman and the cop is the terrified captive who winds up being mutilated. In ""Inglorious Bastards,"" the German officer who refuses to give up the information is told he will have his brains beaten out by a Jew wielding a baseball bat -- ""The Bear Jew."" The scene is long and drawn out. The camera cuts between the blackness of the cave from with The Bear Jew will emerge -- we hear the bat banging against the wall and coming close -- and close ups of the horrified face of the officer awaiting his own death. The horror is justified. The point is that the sadistic lunatic of ""Reservoir Dogs"" has become the hero now.<br/><br/>Well -- what's the point of this scene? Just killing the recalcitrant officer is a violation of the Geneva Conventions. But why draw the scene out with such relish? What does Tarantino expect from the viewer? Chills, thrills -- exaltation -- during the anticipation of the grisly murder? LAUGHTER? That's the kind of crap I'd expect in a cheap slasher movie before the pretty girl in the underwear gets her throat cut and blood splashes all over the walls.<br/><br/>""Pulp Fiction"" was a true original, even if it was a couple of sub-plots slapped together. ""Reservoir Dogs"" had some fine acting, though it ended pointlessly. Both were essentially well-done in their own shocking ways.<br/><br/>But I can't forgive Tarantino for this one. I don't mind the in-jokes. (The name of Pitt's officer is ""Aldo Raine."") There is even some intentional comedy that works. Pitt is trying to pass himself off as a native Italian, and you ought to hear him mangle the word ""arrivederci."" But not even the scenes that embody suspense, the genuinely well-staged episode in the basement night club, can lift this effort out of the teen-aged trash can.<br/><br/>Good performances for the most part, especially from Melanie Laurent who is unmistakably French, Christoph Waltz as the chief Nazi villain, and Daniel Bruhl as the fresh-faced young German hero who is given some inexplicable and uncharacteristically villainous lines just before he's done in.<br/><br/>The climax is a fantasy, which is okay, but there are signs of outright carelessness in the direction. (I don't want to call it stupidity.) The audience of high-ranking Nazis is sitting there watching a movie about a heroic sniper and everyone -- der Fuhrer included -- is laughing out loud as hundreds of American soldiers are shot and killed in a strictly Hollywood manner, twirling around, stunt men tumbling down stairs, anachronistic squibs exploding. Does anyone actually believe that an audience of sophisticates would laugh during a movie like this? Or -- let me put it differently. We made the same kind of movie, ""To Hell And Back,"" in which Audie Murphy played his historically heroic self and slaughtered hundreds of Germans. Did anyone laugh? <br/><br/>Tarantino unquestionably has a lot of movie-making skill. Maybe it's time for him to reconsider the parameters of his morality."

It was hard to shake the feeling that this film was adapted from a short story written by a 14 year old boy trying to shock his parents, and make his friends think that he is cool. The strudel scene made me ill. Here's the overdone cliché: let's make the bad guy eat food and talk with his mouth full. How many times have we seen this in a film? This film was yawn from one end to the other. When I wasn't rolling my eyes at the ridiculous scenes of violence, I was yawning at the drawn out conversations, and the obvious efforts that went into 'building tension.' I cannot believe that so many people have raved on about how great this film is, when it is one of the worst films ever made. I guarantee that all the people who claim to love it won't bother to watch it again on DVD."

","This movie was so bad that after years of using IMDb, I finally registered purely to write this comment.<br/><br/>Crap doesn't begin to describe it.<br/><br/>The most compelling evidence yet as to why Hollywood should be banned from making war movies.<br/><br/>French and German are used as if trying to give some vague impression that Tarantino isn't completely full of ""unchecked ego"" - I would think that paying more attention to the plot and actual history would have been wise if I'd wanted to retain some semblance of accuracy - otherwise, sod it - why not have all characters speak English for the US audience (let's face it, no one else will be watching this)? A bit of escapism is all well and good, but this isn't even that, just purile nonsense. I'm not even that bothered by Hollywood's usual bending/rewriting/falsification of history for it's own ends - we all expect that - American hero, European baddies (at best numpties) - but this wasn't just unresearched childish adventure rubbish, but also cinematically juvenile - no subtlety, no nuance, just clumsy - like someone handed a 12 year old a camera and said, ""Make a film about WWII - let you imagination run wild"".<br/><br/>What is cinema coming to when people rate this rubbish?"
"Fredolow","1","101","199","23 November 2009"," Downhill since PF
","Seeing this film with an 8.5 rating beggars belief. Tarantino's finest moment was undoubtedly Pulp Fiction. Clever story, interesting characters, roller coaster ride and a well thought out, interwoven plot. This film is quite the opposite. Almost lazy. Weak and insulting script, AWFUL acting from Brad Pitt (embarrassingly bad given how much he's manage to shine in other, more challenging roles (i.e. Snatch), and predictable throughout. So, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and downhill ever since. Where's the spark gone? Or perhaps QT's just lost it for good. Pity.<br/><br/>It seems many people these days are just happy to hail any old tripe he roles out as 'original and daring', when in reality it's quite the opposite - shallow and intellectually insulting. There were a couple of moments when the dialogue started to show some of the old sparkle, but generally (apart from the main German officer) performances were weak or, worse, comical. Each film he brings out I hope for a return to form, but what once was concentrate now just seems to be over-diluted tripe."

His accent was awful and he overacted like an amateur. The scene where his bluff of being an Italian should have been called, but for some weird reason is not, is absolutely laughable, but nevertheless not funny.<br/><br/>We were a bunch of guys watching that movie and none, seriously none liked it.

","No words can describe how dreadful this movie is. Brad Pitt can't really act. That's evident from watching this. He thinks that he needs to pull a lip like Benjamin Buford Blue from Forrest Gump for the whole film. There are no real characters, just caricatures. The rewriting of history is the most objectionable bit. If the real Nazis were as oafish as portrayed here, the war would have lasted a week. The part that I cannot stand is the way that Quentin makes no apologies for setting up scenes of inordinate length, with no editing, and leaden dialogue. Every director has their own style, but Quentin does this kind of stuff in every film. He's no master like Scorcese. No thanks to Quentin for his ridiculous take on history.

"madbeast","1","83","163","30 August 2009"," A disgusting travesty
","This is a disgusting travesty of a film that does its best to re-imagine the Holocaust as a comic book that was conceived by a 12-year old boy. There are a myriad of films that portray World War II in a fanciful light, but ""Inglorious Basterds"" is one of the few that I can recall that uses the extermination of the Jews as a launching pad for an outlandish Sam Peckenpaugh -inspired cartoon which depicts historical figures like Adolph Hitler and Joseph Goebbels - monsters who were responsible for the murder of millions of people - on the same level as Lex Luthor or The Joker.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and his crew of seemingly invincible marauders cut through the German lines with such ease that it's a wonder that the war lasted as long as it did, and with such a sadistic bloodthirstiness that they seemed likely subjects for a war crimes trial at the conflict's end. Tarantino crudely and artlessly tries to take the narrative between their bloody and far-fetched ""heroics"" and more genuine atrocities suffered by victims of the Nazis, so the line between Tarantino's outlandish fairy tale and the real-life horrors of the Holocaust are blurred to a degree that made me feel like the director was exploiting the brutal death of six million people in order to splash a lot of cool, fake blood on a movie set. That's perfectly fine if you're making a flight of fantasy like ""Kill Bill"", but the blood that was spilled in the Holocaust wasn't supplied by Hollywood special effects wizards and deserves more respect than it's given here."
"juego07","10","183","379","6 August 2009"," Inglorious? Quite the opposite in fact
","I screened this movie tonight at USC, and I've needed the past few hours to organize my thoughts well enough to coherently describe the obscenely beautiful cinematic achievement that is Inglorious Basterds. Have you ever seen a movie and been struck nearly speechless when you're walking out of the theater? This movie blows those out of the proverbial water. I would have said speechless, but I was able to say the word wow, which I said an ungodly number of times. It wasn't until around now that I find myself able to at least write a slightly more aesthetically pleasing grouping of words. As usual Tarantino has given me deeper insight into the art form that is cinema, but even when compared to his previous, outstanding work, this film stands out. I would go into the depths of his work, analyzing the intricate beauty of each individual shot, but there isn't nearly enough room in this forum to do that. I will tell you that throughout this film you will be amazed. Brad Pitt delivers an amazing performance that is equal parts knee-slapping ""good ole boy"" and unrepentant mass murderer. You'll certainly laugh at his Tennessee accented minimalist Italian, and you'll definitely cringe at his inspired cranial ""artwork"". Christoph Waltz defines the phrase ""stand and deliver"" with his portrayal of Col. Hans Landa, an SS officer and noted Jew hunter. He'll make you cringe with his speeches, both at their content and the calm yet weighted manner with which he presents them. His manner has the feel of a kindly uncle, but you can feel the immense tension that each word he utters carries, as if a monster is lurking just below the surface, waiting to be released. Finally we have Eli Roth. To call his performance of Sgt. Donny Donowitz impressive would be a disservice. Even in the trailer his rage is palpable, but in the film it emanates from the screen, reaching out and touching the audience. With each swing of his already infamous baseball bat, this ""Bear Jew"" radiates that much more of his righteous anger. These performances would be more than enough to make this a great film, but they're just the tip of the iceberg. Supported by amazing actors such as Til Schweiger, Diane Kruger, Mélanie Laurent, B.J. Novak, and Daniel Brühl, these roles are pushed from simply great to truly inspiring. If you believe in the raw and awesome power of cinema then this is a film for you. If you just want to be entertained for a few hours then this is also a film for you. Regardless of how you feel about Quentin Tarantino I urge you to see this film, to be open to its powerful energy. This film will not only entertain, and teach, but will also provoke many philosophical discussions about the ethics, or lack thereof, displayed by its many characters. In closing I will merely say I intend to see this movie again, in theaters, and I hope you'll do that same."

","*may contain spoilers* I probably was expecting better from Tarantino because I have to say this is his worst. I prefer Jackie Brown and Pulp Fiction to this rubbish. Brad Pitt stuck out like a sore thumb, only bigger-his character is a real jerk and as far as I'm concerned is absolutely useless to the story. This is trying too hard to be funny. I liked certain characters (Fassbender's Lt. and Kruger's actress) far more than I enjoyed the story. In fact, what WAS the story? The film editing was so choppy. Quite frankly after the scene in the bar with Fassbender and Kruger, the whole film just goes downhill from there. I'm a fan of war films and films that portray the German side, but this certainly cannot be taked seriously with others. This movie got so much undeserved hype."

The more the movie progressed the more annoying it became and the more bizarre and contrived the storyline became.

","Stupid me, I didn't even notice who the director was before I sat down to watch this really peculiar film.<br/><br/>With the possible exception of the first segment, the film - despite what the storyline is saying - is entirely in the here and now. A fantasy of revenge played out amid - not just gratuitous - but completely surreal, graphic, sickening violence. The carnage is so over-the-top that it quickly doesn't even garner a raised eyebrow, it becomes simply wallpaper behind a really vapid, simple fairytale. And the sets and costumes, though I guess not entirely inappropriate for WWII, never feel like anything more than just what they are - sets and costumes. The ambiance being much more akin to gangsta rap than Glen Miller. ""Forties"" it definitely is NOT.<br/><br/>Though I initially was interested in the story, it devolved quickly into a nonsensical race to the bottom in trying to outdo itself for sheer in-your-face, amoral brutality. Is this Tarrantino thinks passes for entertainment? God, I can't imagine what a twisted, jaded, socio-pathological mind can produce such disgusting, visually repellent images.<br/><br/>And then for a finale, QT decides to completely rewrite history, and two members of a ragtag troop of misfits - with the help of a theatre owner and her projectionist - defeat the entire German high command. No armies required, TYVM. What a joke.<br/><br/>In the end I found myself somewhat ashamed for having sat and watched this.

"derekjones2222","1","80","157","15 December 2009"," I'm confused... Which one is the evil side again?
","The message of the film is clear. Americans can do everything better than the ""evil"" ones of the world: Americans are tougher than you, smarter, more clever, fight harder, and you'd better believe if we can't torture more sadistically than you too. Of course, as a rile-up-the-righteous-masses kind of film, it succeeds rather well. However, in demonstrating the ""better than thou"" virtues of the Jewish-American soldiers of the film's focus, the film paints them as reprehensibly worse than their enemy. They are committing atrocities as bad as their enemy, all in the name of fighting evil. The sickening and disgusting depiction of the actions (scalping, etc.) of this renegade group certainly does not help endear viewers to their cause (unless the viewer is either well propagandized or sick in the head).<br/><br/>Remember that in real history, no allied forces knew of the Nazi atrocities until near the end of the war, when the first internment camps were found. Therefore, this group of soldiers would be brutalizing Germans out of pure sadistic pleasure, not yet knowing the reasons which we as viewers today apply retrospectively to rationalize their actions. Most today have been sufficiently preconditioned to seeing the Nazis as the evil oppressors, and to seeing Jewish people as perpetually afflicted, so that any outburst of evil by Jewish soldiers is reflexively taken as a 'hurrah!', root-for-the-underdog moment. However, in complete contrast to its supposed goal, this film does not present the virtues of liberators, but rather the virtues that brought us Abu Ghraib and Guantanimo. The presentation of this film is one thing the American nation can well do without."

It had ""Pop up"" windows telling dimwits in the audience when a famous nazi would come on-screen.

"Jawsphobia","Null","162","335","22 August 2009"," Not for critics, but people who love a good movie
","Some critics might claim to need a code key to interpret what Tarantino means by this revisionist adventure film, but I'd say it's right under their up-turned noses: There's a great little scene where Mike Meyers plays a British military man who anticipates attacking a Nazi film premiere so he brings in an a film critic as an adviser. This may or may not be necessary but it does allow for a dialogue exchange like: Meyers: What do you do? Critic: I am a film critic.<br/><br/>Meyers: What are your accomplishments? Even though the critic goes on to list some compilation books, it may as well be a rhetorical question.<br/><br/>Tarantino thumbs his nose at convention and that is part of the movie's appeal. His movies are often about movies as much as they are about the content at hand. Yet he still manages to sustain genuine tension. The opening Nazi interrogation of a French farmer and a later a tavern basement guessing game scene must have had whopping page counts but they play out as chapters and remain engrossing high stakes set pieces. In the same film he can introduce a character by throwing a title onto the screen as if this member of the ""Basterds"" was cool enough to have his own movie, or play a 1980's David Bowie song while a woman prepares to do battle in her own way while Nazi flags hang outside the window.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in an alternate universe that could either be a dream or the unreality of the grind-house era Tarantino has celebrated in Kill Bill and, well, Grindhouse. Anyone with a brain will get that. If that sounds good, see it. I notice now there are blurbs about ""how Jewish critics feel"" about the movie. Well, those who go to a movie with a deliberately misspelled title knowing it is a revisionist fantasy and can't bear to see the character of Hitler as the butt of the joke don't have an opinion worthy of note. If you are an expert on NASA, your views on George Lucas' Star Wars movies are not necessarily of use to me. In fact it's a little galling that such a critic-proof designation as ""Jewish critic"" should be trotted out. They can say what they like about a sensitive document with the intentions of Schindler's List and God bless them. But if someone gets his boxers in a bunch over slapstick Nazis or clueless Hitler autographing the Grain Diary for Indiana Jones, then they just aren't going to be the right audience for Inglourious Basterds. In fact they shouldn't be watching fun movies at all. They should try staring at a blank wall and talking to themselves rather than type up their blather.<br/><br/>But it's not all fun. Sad things do happen and unfortunate events occur in this movie. The tension even in dialogue does come from the danger of having a Nazi at the table or someone daring to ask him to leave. But when you get reviewers comparing the Basterds to Al Qaida I think we can excuse those critics from the table as well. Or call Eli Roth over to them and yell ""Play ball!"""

","Firstly, my comments and my marking in no way reflect my opinion of the ability of the actors. It's the substance I take exception to. I'm appalled to find that this film is intended to be funny. Several contributors to the 'comments' section have used the adjectives 'humourous','hilarious' etc to describe it. Warfare may be many things - awful, soul destroying, mentally scaring at the same time as being honourable and even uplifting if done in a worthy cause. Under no circumstances can it, or should it, be funny. Quite honestly, I find it a sad reflection on the malaise of our culture that so many (I'm sure otherwise good people) should want to find it so, even in cinematic format. I found the film to be a repulsive and awful attempt to achieve a large audience at the expense of appealing to the darkest elements within our psyche. What are we to take from this? That the Allied side in a what was one of the few justifiable conflicts in world history contained the very same sadistic and homicidal element that existed in the evil we were trying to defeat? This film is an insult to those who fought and died. They deserve a better epitaph than this skin-flick for closet psychopaths.

I love Pulp Fiction, Snatch, The Long Good Friday, Kill Bills, Lock Stock, Layer Cake and many other 'violent' films. In each case there are excellent story lines woven with genuine humour.

Or the time WWII lasted from the invasion of Poland to the surrender of Japan. He doesn't, but there are people that know. If he wants to make some sort of what if historic film better do it with something that wasn't so dramatic and involved so many suffering and death.<br/><br/>A film where people laugh at every shot like if they were a moronic audience in the US in the present??.<br/><br/>An African as a projectionist in Paris under Nazi rule (???).<br/><br/>He probably arrived Paris after Senegal independence.

Since there have been few if any good films produced in the last decade, I guess Americans et al. are starved for entertainment.

"basilisksamuk","5","19","32","4 August 2010"," Frustrating Experience
","Utterly frustrating viewing experience. There is an excellent film in here but it's ruined by the way in which Tarantino breaks the contract with the viewer. There is absolutely no need to vandalise the viewing experience by insulting the intelligence of the viewer and by scribbling (literally) over the images on screen in a way that further implies the viewer is an idiot who could not follow a simple story without the guidance from an unseen hand.<br/><br/>The obvious thing to do to improve this film by 100% is to get rid of the Inglorious Basterds. They are completely irrelevant to the action and the storyline. You need an American covert presence in Europe to carry the story but the basterds team in no way fulfils this requirement, rather it detracts. For one thing the whole scalping and torturing your enemy storyline makes the basterds no better than the Nazis; for another the Brad Pitt character is an embarrassment from start to finish. I do not blame Pitt for this as he is clearly playing the part as the cartoon character that was defined by the script.<br/><br/>I'm not averse to doing things differently and I think the unexplained change to the real historical timeline and the use of contemporary music works well. The first ""chapter"" is a master class in creating tension as is the sequence in the cellar. As others have commented the acting of Christoph Waltz is astonishing and quite the best thing in the film. But there are other beautiful sequences such as the opening of chapter five with its superb framing and use of the colour red. Such a pity that the rest of the film is so poorly done.<br/><br/>Whilst I know that few will agree with me, the director Tarantino most reminds me of is Stanley Kubrick. Like Kubrick he can produce scenes of breath-taking originality but he is unable to sustain the vision over an entire film. If Tarantino could shed his sometimes infantile interjections into his own film-making process he could produce a work of true genius. Inglorious basterds is half genius, half embarrassing nonsense."

","The answer: Having to READ about 2 hours of it! Yes, the man is talented. And yes, there are parts of this overly-lengthy film that are terrific, but I've just come to the point where the thrill is gone. Gone is my appetite for Tarantino's style with excessive homages to an era of films I never saw, and neither did many of his hard-core fans. Gone (if it ever was truly there) is my desire for endless conversations that seldom lead anywhere or advance what little plot his films often have. It's all pretty much gone. Tarantino has been doing this to us for almost twenty years now, and its time that either himself or myself moves on.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is marketed to the masses as somewhat of a revenge film about Jewish commandos slaughtering Nazi troops behind enemy lines with Brad Pitt as their leader. Some of this lengthy film will in fact actually deal with that story line. But so much more of it is window dressing with long, subtitled conversations in either French or German. Many of our characters are not believable... even in a Tarantino universe. Nothing we see is plausible. And very little of it is tense. Many have pointed to Christoph Waltz's portrayal of a kind of SS detective as being the lone good aspect of this film. That's pretty much the case. This guy grabs the film and runs away with it. Pitt is tolerable for once, but his character doesn't have to do much in terms of acting range. Thank Goodness. Diane Kruger has some nice moments, and its good to see her in something other than National Treasure movies. I guess... watch if you must, but this is not the director's best work. His breed of film peaked with the Kill Bill movies, and it isn't clear if he is capable of doing anything that isn't just a patchwork of what others have done. Inglourious Basterds is a long, talky waste of 153 minutes. Its few good scenes aren't enough to justify the rest. 5 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."
"CineCritic2517","1","77","154","11 September 2009"," A failure to fuse different movie genres into one feature.
","Tarantino was in my opinion a master in fusing different movie genres into one. But he miserably and painfully fails to do so in Inglourious Bastards (IB). <br/><br/>Where in the past in movies like Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill saga there is a constant mix of both comical and gritty scenes which are consistently applied throughout these movies, in IB Tarantino tried to only loosely paste them together. The result is an unfocused string of scenes in which each displays another facet of the different genre. In one scene it's drama and violence followed by one that would have perfectly fitted into a Naked Gun type of film. This simply doesn't work and I found myself being highly irritated watching this failed experiment ruin an otherwise fine movie idea.<br/><br/>Another failure of the movie is to not present the viewer dialogs which are actually worth the elaborate time it takes to conclude them. The dialog often proceeds at glacial speeds and likewise just as easily melds and vaporises as time progresses, leaving a pile of scattered moraine in stead of something actually contributing to the, as it already stands, paper thin plot. <br/><br/>In the end IB is nothing more than a mismatch of ideas with a steal from Pulp Fiction here and a pinch from Reservoir Dogs there. These rehashed ideas, far superiorly employed in the past, will perhaps fool the younger moviegoer into believing they are watching something fresh and innovative, but people who have seen these other movies by QT surely wont be impressed. The movie ends at two and a half hours featuring long, drawn-out scenes that could have been easily compressed into one and a half. And like with Death Proof, there is far too little pay off to warrant stealing people's time and attention over these all-heard-before and talky routines.<br/><br/>Through most of the duration of the film I contemplated suggesting to my friend, who was clearly not being entertained either, to leave, but I decided to see it through till the end. Suffice to say I have never been so glad the ending credits finally rolled so I could get up and make my way to the exit.<br/><br/>The pro's:<br/><br/>Excellent acting (apart from a horrible Pitt who was clearly miscast) and good cinematography in a film with some solid and interesting ideas.<br/><br/>The con's:<br/><br/>The film's criminally in need of an editor and serves perhaps a bit too much dialog in a foreign language for the average moviegoer to swallow. Not enough suspense to justify bludgeoning the audience with endless routines of mere dialog and no character development to make the audience care about whatever outcome these scenes, and ultimately the whole movie, might bring.<br/><br/>3.5/10"

I think every school kid knows he shot himself in a bunker a coward's death. This movie not only glorifies Hilter's death but also glorifies mutilation of enemy soldiers. Also unless I am wrong, ""Nazi"" was a word pertaining to a political party. Much like democrat or republican, if you were to think about it not all German soldiers were in the Nazi party they got drafted, and shot if they fled. This movies like many others paints the German race as pure evil and messes with history. There is a lot of subtitles that fly by so if you are a slow reader as I am, keep the DVD remote handy to pause it. Most of the movie is spoken in French and German with very little English. I wouldn't call this an ""Action Movie"" since most of the movie is coffee talk. One scene is about strudel it goes on too long as many of the talking scenes are nothing about the plot...<br/><br/>Also if you are watching it expecting a remake of the 1978 Italian movie of the same title, it is not.

","I have used IMDM for years and never felt compelled to write a review, that's how bad this movie was. I really am getting quite fed-up with some of the pretentious garbage Quentin Tarantino tries to ram down his audiences' throats. In fact the only good thing I have to say about this movie is that he refrains from making another of those really poorly acted cameo's he insists on. Don't get me wrong, I love some of the techniques he has incorporated in the past and his odd cadence was often refreshing but over-employment has tarnished my respect for him. The credit sequence at the beginning where the font changed every few frames was typical Tarantino archetype but was so long it felt like a tedious exercise by the director to flaunt his ""artistic merits"". It was a fore-shadow of what was to come. A feeling of dread overcame me as the first scene dragged its way through predictable boring sermon to the inevitable Tarantino bloodbath. This movie is 2½ hours long and I could already see why. His long drawn-out scenes of pointless dialogue to emphasize a violent conclusion are way too frequently employed in this movie. Philosophical diatribes are just one of the many techniques I loved in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction but is now quite ""Old Hat"" for the director, here he uses it liberally, eating up most of the movie's time with tricks we've all seen before. Other predictable bits are his Mexican stand-off, kitsch movie techniques from the 70's, long pauses, sporadic over indulgent violence and soundtracks that don't seem to flow (I know he regards himself as a music lover and sometimes that has really provided a good soundtrack for his movies, but in this period flick his choices seem forced and out of place). These techniques may have been innovative in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction & Desperado but are getting a little old. By Kill Bill Tarantino was really offering nothing new to cinema, his technique was established and predictable. The one saving grace of Kill Bill was it had the action to keep things interesting but Inglourious Basterds is painfully slow. It drives me nuts when people talk about how much they loved his movie because it's so very obvious they are wearing his name like a badge just because he's made some good movies in the past. I'm sorry but Inglourious Basterds isn't the art-house film it tries to be, it offers nothing new or interesting. I have never walked out on a movie because I figure they all deserve a chance, I should have here. About an hour in I was uncomfortable in my seat, trying to stay awake through another long, tedious Tarantino oration with an actor struggling to wax philosophic. And what was with that idiotic ending? You want to see a good movie this summer with intelligent undercurrents go see District 9. It's a much more reasonable length, has an interesting directing, has way more action, the characters are engaging, the actors convincing and the story is so much more intelligent without seeming ""preachy"". Avoid Inglourious Basterds like the bubonic plague. It's just about as painful as an abscess."

","Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing. It isn't Inglorious, its disgusting.<br/><br/>I saw Pulp Fiction at 14 years old, and I saw it 6 times in the theater. I have an original Reservoir Dogs poster and I think Jackie Brown is a timeless achievement and Quentin Tarantino's best movie. Kill Bill was a huge mess, but it was entertaining.<br/><br/>I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterds. The entire point of a film is to entertain and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit, it is boredom. The movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring scenes of people talking at tables in various languages. There is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table, before, thankfully they are all shot. I wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to shut the F**K up. <br/><br/>This table talk style is a Tarantino hallmark, but in other films, I actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking. Here, I couldn't care less. All of Quentin's films display an enormous confidence, particularly Jackie Brown. But here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene, Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film. <br/><br/>Is it violent? Sure there's torture and scalping galore, but you'd have to remind me. Thankfully, the film was so thin, I didn't even remember I had seen it earlier in the day when until I saw a review headline on MSNBC. <br/><br/>He's out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel.

And another thing: why do the opening credits have to be modeled after a film from the 60s or 70s? For what possible reason? In Jackie Brown and Death Proof it made sense, as each was an homage to styles past. But why do it for this one? Yes, Quentin, we know what a big fan of these eras you are. We get it. Move on. And why the cartoon title over Hugo what's-his-name? Tarantino didn't do much else like this in the film. It just threw it off balance for me. What'd he make this stuff up as he went along? And is it true that Tarantino rushed production to get the movie done in time to compete at Cannes? If so, that is the dumbest and most narcissistic thing I've ever heard. I'm tired of listening to this guy talk about how much god-given talent he has. Make an entertaining movie, for pete's sake! Reign yourself in!

","Just come out the cinema and felt the need to review this fabulous movie. I really didn't enjoy Tarantino's last movie (""Deathproof"") so I didn't enter this one with high expectations. But it was phenomenal. From the opening scenes, I could see Tarantino had taken the Sergio Leone formula (""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"") and cleverly transposed it into the WW2 era in Nazi-occupied France. In fact, the opening scenes at the milk farm are incredibly similar in tone and feel to the opening scenes of Leone's GBU. Every scene of this movie is beautifully shot and wonderful to watch. Tarantino has returned to form here and works the camera like a master. I was reminded of the kind of suspense you get from Alfred Hitchcock's best suspenseful scenes. Much of this movie is like that, an ever increasing build-up of suspense taking the audience to cracking point before letting off the steam. Brad Pitt's performance as Aldo Raines is terrific and leaves you begging for more, and the guy who played the main Nazi villain, and the cinema owner girl. All terrific. Even Eli Roth didn't bother me in his role which I thought he would. The use of movie music was great (especially BATTLE OF ALGIERS in the prison break scene) and moments of typical Tarantino humour made me smile throughout. I didn't know what was going to happen next and that's what makes a great movie for me. He has made a really top World War 2 movie here, without resorting to barely any clichés or action at all. I don't wanna give anything away but this has gone straight into my top 10 favourite movies of all time. Even the use of contemporary music (David Bowie for example) doesn't seem as odd as it sounds and works really well. I'll be getting the soundtrack and the DVD.

","The film looks like it could be fun, if edgy. Bradd Pitt has a magnetic screen presence. Quentin Tarantino is multi-talented even if line between effect and sensation for its own sake does not seem clearly drawn for him. The notion of the film's plot was reasonably amusing. So there was no hesitation in buying tickets to go and see it. Now I admit I cannot comment on the whole film. I managed to stay in my seat until the scene where a German officer is murdered with a baseball bat. The convention of showing rampant sex or brutal violence on screen or stage has always been justified by the notion that it was essential for the integrity of the plot. Fair enough. A sensible notion! Then why am I so angry? The reason is simple. The portrayal of the murder of a courageous German officer was of course a piece of film. It was not real. Nobody was hurt. However, the mentality which could regard this scene as entertaining and even in part comical is simply wicked. It is no better than making a film of the horrors of Al Ghraib prison to titillate and entertain us. The parallels are there. The US troops in that prison were the bad guys supposedly representing the good powers in what was viewed as evil Irak. Pitt's gang are bad guys on the good side in fictional Germany. My family and teachers were involved in mopping up the horrors of Nazi Germany. I was brought up with first hand accounts of people who had been on the ground and experienced the evil and despair created by those evil folk. My fury is the worse because it is fired by a scene in a commercial film which actually made me feel some sympathy for the Nazis. It seems that there is no awareness as to how dangerous this sort of production is. Those few who produce this work may become rich and self indulgent which can be satisfying, at least in the short term. However, no spirit of decency or generosity could possibly have been involved in the production of this obscene piece of cinema. I'm fairly sure this is not a direction of behavior, culture, art or politics which will lead to any lasting benefit. We need decency, mutual respect and a generosity of spirit if we are to survive as a species. Without it we will self destruct in a slow orgy of internecine beastliness."

","WARNING: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS IN HERE.<br/><br/>I finally broke down and watched this train wreck of a movie after the obviously rigged Oscars, out of a morbid curiosity as to why Christoph Waltz won an award over what should have been a clearly superior performance by Christopher Plummer as Tolstoy in a clearly superior movie. After all, it doesn't take great acting ability to play a Nazi. just the right uniform and with his accent, Waltz is already at least half way there. He has a long future ahead of him recycling old Conrad Veidt roles (that Veidt did so much better 60 years ago).<br/><br/>Yes, I held my nose and watched this ""movie"". Although I do think Tarentino has made some great (and violent) movies such as ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Kill Bill 1&2"" in the past, this one absolutely reeks like rotting vegetation in a methane swamp. ""Inglourious Basterds"" has literally no saving merit or grace whatsoever, except possibly cinematography. The story line is ridiculous, the script is poorly written and makes little sense, the dialogue is achingly boring and pointless, the performances collectively are as wooden as Pinocchio's nuts. In a movie, the scenes are supposed to have a point and move the plot forward, but apparently Tarentino has progressed beyond either plots or points in his film-making as most of the scenes were endless and didn't flow into each other as much as collide. I honestly cannot find a single thing to recommend in this movie - the characters were so badly written and acted that I cannot comprehend how anyone could remotely care about them other than to feel some sense of relief when they died some horrible death and were thereby removed from the screen.<br/><br/>The worst part of the movie however, is the emphasis upon torture, and it is THIS, that reveals the great moral and ethical (as well as artistic) decline of America. I have known Holocaust survivors and their families, and have read of others, and I have NEVER heard or read of any of them supporting the use of torture, against even the fiendish Nazis. People who endured the horrors they did, were consumed not with a desire for a brutal revenge, but a desire for life and to build a better society, and Israel, for one thing, is the result of that desire for a wholesome life, and a belief in the future that ultimately was stronger than the Nazi cult of death.<br/><br/>Actions like scalping prisoners of war, beating them to death with baseball bats, sticking fingers in a woman's gunshot wounds - these are all CONTEMPTIBLE and anyone who would support or encourage such practices, even against those who are evil, is CONTEMPTIBLE. When people engage in degrading practices, they inevitably become degraded themselves, and that such activity would not only be shown on a screen, but APPLAUDED, or at best, overlooked, by an audience or reviewers, is a grave sign of moral and ethical collapse. Our WW2 soldiers did not do such horrible things, and any who might have would have been severely punished in a society that, unlike ours, still had standards of behavior, even in wartime. That was what distinguished us from the barbarism and brutality of the Germans and Japanese in WW2. Now, however, we glorify it on the screen in the name of a revenge fantasy. What's next - ripping out people's entrails? Feeding them to wild beasts? Where does this end? <br/><br/>When you watch this garbage, what you are ultimately doing is POISONING YOUR OWN MIND AND CHARACTER. This isn't just ""fun"", it becomes part of who you are and what you think and are willing to accept.<br/><br/>We have had a plethora in the past 10 years or so of movies that feature what I would call torture porn, such as the ""Saw"" series, and it is only a degraded and barbarous audience that would watch this dehumanizing garbage. These are the same degenerates who applaud waterboarding and other forms of torture because they have fallen into a moral abyss and don't even realize how far they have declined. ""Inglorious Basterds"" is INDEED inglorious and reflects the shame of a nation.<br/><br/>If you want to see a well written, sophisticated, thinking, well acted, uplifting movie about World War 2, go back to ""Casablanca"" which was actually created during a generation that actually FOUGHT a war against the Nazis - and won - instead of creating sadistic fantasies about it. Then tell me why the two should be ranked in the same league. Of if you want something bloodier - take a look at the original ""The Dirty Dozen"" that Tarentino ripped off to make this abortion. ""The Dirty Dozen"" had the same basic plot of an officer building an elite force to take on a mission to kill the top Nazi brass, but did it in a way to make you interested in the characters and care about their mission. The great irony about ""Inglourious Basterds"" is that ultimately the most sympathetic characters in the movie... became the Nazis who were tortured and murdered. Was that really the intent?"

To be honest I have real excuse for missing Tarantino's INGLOURIOUS except that it never popped up in front of my radar until now . After finally getting round to seeing the movie I can put my hand on my heart and say I didn't miss all that much <br/><br/>It's interesting that so many professional critics agreed that the best thing about the film was Christoph Waltz performance * and that this was qualified by the critics saying stuff along the lines of "" I found my interest waning when Waltz wasn't on screen "" . This sums up the entire problem with the movie - the scenes go on for far too long and lack a brevity of storytelling .A character sits down at a table and talks . And talks . And talks . There's a saying that jaw jaw is better than war war .

There's certainly very little action to the movie and most of the film is composed of characters sitting down and talking in German or French or English . Just because a film contains subtitles doesn't make it worthy and you're left feeling there's no way this film would have been produced if it wasn't for the name of Tarantino . Little of importance happens in the narrative except to illustrate the film's own underserved self importance <br/><br/>* Strangely enough when DJANGO UNCHAINED was released the critics once again praised Waltz as being the best thing about the movie .

When every character and action is a joke, why give a shoot for over 2 and a half hours of shtick and schlock. There is no acting. It is all acting out. Tarantino is impressed with anyone who can speak or read a non-English language. There are only 6 billion such humans in the world. <br/><br/>Tarantino has such a warped concept of what is good acting, good writing. He can frame a shot. The first scene is what made the movie with critics. They left after the first 20 minutes and assumed the rest was as good. <br/><br/>What is worst of all is that Tarantino betrays his extreme ignorance of all realities of WW2. In order to take liberties with the truth you need to at least understand where the facts stop and fantasy begins. Tarantino misses the boat completely, so the entire premise of the movie is totally flawed. How could he miss depicting the Nazis as vampires? Why didn't he show Hitler's 30 inch ebony dildo and his crypt under the Brandenburg Gate? Also, the real Inglorious Basterds were not Jews, they were escapees from an insane asylum. They all had extreme physical deformities. Obviously, Hollywood wasn't prepared for the sight of freaks. Those facts should have been included. No legitimate WW2 movie would neglect to include them."

It is a crime to subject sensitive minds to an exhibition of this kind of cruelty, horror and explicit and gruesome torture. The film may cause certain vulnerable sections of human society to believe that violence and cruelty are sanctioned.<br/><br/>My strongest objection is that the film sensationalizes violence.

","I don't usually trust reviews and ratings, but IMDb had never failed me, until now. I used to think that enough intelligent people vote over time, to get the rating about right. I've changed my mind.<br/><br/>I don't care one bit about the brilliant performance of the SS officer, the colors, the pace, or the jokes. The message is so disturbingly wrong, that it trumps any of the positive aspects of this piece of trash. If over 90% of the people who watched the film can not see anything wrong with it, then this world is certainly doomed.<br/><br/>I have enjoyed many of Tarantino's films, regardless of the violence. Up until now, the violence was due to personal and largely justified revenge, or part of the character of very sick individuals. Putting Vermacht foot soldiers in the same basket with SS and Gestapo officers is just plain wrong. I wonder how this film would be rated if it were about a Palestinian squad scalping Jews or marking their foreheads with the star of David. <br/><br/>These issues are not to be trifled with. Not all Germans were Nazis deserving the wrath of Jehovah. Any attempt at generalizations about a large group of people should be condemned, first of all by the Jewish people, who know what discrimination and persecution is. Hateful films like this would barely make it as war-time propaganda and you hail it as one of the best films of all time?

"ElMaruecan82","4","12","19","11 March 2011"," A dangerous and irresponsible film from a director who used to be great...
","Reviewing ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a moral dilemma. I know it has everything to please the fans, it's entertaining, masterfully directed and edited, and features memorable characters portrayed by a big-star cast, and the whole film is carried by one of the greatest supporting and villainous performance of the last ten years. Christoph Waltz, as Hans Landa, is an unforgettable character, magnetic even in one blink or a crazy smirk. But this is a supporting performance, not enough to redeem the film.<br/><br/>""Inglourious Basterds"" is the living proof that Tarantino lost his touch. The ""Kill Bill"" series is a masterpiece of movie homage, something that worked because you could feel that Tarantino made this film with his heart, he grew up with Asian Kung-Fu films, and made a masterpiece out of it. But now, why does he feel the need to rely all his movies on that concept? After the drive-in B-movies in ""Death Proof"" which beyond the action, was just an exercise of testosterone stimulation, and a tentative to resurrect Kurt Russel's character as he did for Travolta, I started thinking Tarantino was slipping. But I didn't take the movie that seriously and I thought even Tarantino is allowed to loosen up a bit, and please the fans of the genre, with a fun to watch and well-crafted action flick.<br/><br/>But now, we have a film nominated in the Cannes' festival, in many glorious competitions, including the Oscars. It's something presented as a new ""Pulp Fiction"", so the movie takes itself so seriously before its release, it deserves a serious and honest critic  and all I can say is that I will probably never get the love for ""Inglourious Basterds"", a film where Tarantino caricatures himself, disguising barbarity and cruelty under the fallacious legitimacy of fighting the quintessential evil enemy, the Nazis. Done intelligently, it could have been an interesting film, but in this world where violence is preached by fanatics and fantasized by lunatics, this is (despite Waltz and his hilarious Italian scene) an irresponsible film whose plot twist made it even more dangerous, as it conveyed the dangerous message that this was the way it should have been done, therefore, this is the way WE should treat our enemies.<br/><br/>And if violence, even in the cruelest and barbaric form is legitimated when you fight evil, you've got to question yourself about the meaning of that word. Is it right to carve a swastika in a soldier's forehead to condemn him for perpetual shame when he was just doing his duty. Were we supposed to cheer during the scalping? Or the scene where an officer's head was reduced to a pulp with a baseball bat? Were we supposed to cheer when Diane Kruger's character shot the guy she had just guaranteed his safety, or the soldier who was mercilessly shot at the end and then inevitably scalped? These scenes made me nauseous and hating the movie because it just encouraged the most odious and dangerous racist fantasies, in such a patronizing way, I wonder how come no fan felt insulted.<br/><br/>This is a dangerous film, definitely glorifying violence by making it cool, bad-ass, and legitimate just because there's something ""naturally"" evil in the enemy, and it's not just violence, it's the graphicness, the cold-blooded horrific way of killing, and the fact that it's supposed to make people clap and enjoy the gruesomeness ... this is an irresponsible case of glorifying violence, and the script's biggest flaw. I guess the Shoshanna's subplot was a way to inject the eternal revenge story, supposedly the heart of the film. But for some reason, the actress didn't touch me, she was playing it too cool and aggressive, and the part that definitely killed the character was the glamorous sequence that looked more like an advertisement for cosmetics than anything else. Shosanna who witnessed the killing of her family, behaves like some kind of sexy James Bond girl. Probably not bad acting, but a too coldly artificial writing to be believable.<br/><br/>(And if a great performance can't redeem a film I guess, a bad one can also ruin it... like the guy who played the projectionist, Marcel, his delivery of lines was so laughable I wonder if Tarantino was really behind the camera when it was shot)<br/><br/>Now, I know the fans will over-analyze the film talking about its self-referential aspect, our approach to violence, a great homage to classic war films and I must concede that when I watched the opening scene, I thought it would be a masterpiece, but this 'homage' thing must stop now, it's okay for one or two scenes, but basing the whole movie structure on that has been a little bit overused by Tarantino ... it's time now to come with something more original, and less irresponsible.<br/><br/>I say 'irresponsible' because Tarantino became like a cinematic label, as if any of his movies would automatically please the fans, I don't mean this as an insult, Tarantino was my favorite director five years ago, I've always thought the guy defined ""coolness"" in films, he was for me the-coolest-director-in-the-world and whatever he made, said and touched, was cool and entertaining. That's why I think this movie is irresponsible, because Tarantino uses his undeniable talent and creativity to communicate an extremely dangerous message, and many of his younger fans will think it's cool and bad-ass to scalp the evil enemy, because Tarantino said so, and Brad Pitt did it.<br/><br/>To conclude, ""That's NOT a bingo!"" and the popularity of this film is revealing of a very sad reality where movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" are considered as one of the greatest war films ever, and ""Inglourious Basterds"" praised as a masterpiece, even by Tarantino, in his pretentious closing lines  a movie I expected to like, and I ended up hating it with intensity."

The reflexive filmic quotations are amusing if somewhat corny but there is much to savor in the characterization of Christoph Waltz (bravo!). Still, a turkey is a turkey. Quite frankly I'm surprised that fans are giving him a free pass on this one. I don't hear too many people defending DEATH PROOF, which has about as much substance as BASTERDS.

For me.<br/><br/>Given the movie's success and rave reviews, mine is obviously a minority opinion. Which is fine and congratulations to all of you who enjoyed it.

Occasional glimpses of good acting can't save this train wreck of a movie. The references to classic films are too many, too obvious and utterly pointless. The violence is speculative without being the least bit satirical, it's just violence-porn. Finally there is the unpleasant feeling that the ""message"" of the movie is actually very close to that of the real life Nazis, even though the roles are reversed.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to say that Tarrantino is way past his peak and if this film is any indication he might want to consider doing something else for a while.<br/><br/>The contradictory positive reviews are puzzling, I can only assume there are lots of QT fan-boys out there who just can't criticize their idol."

","Going into this movie, I expected and hoped for ""Tarantino kills Natzis"", just like we were promised in the trailer. Unfortunately, that was exactly what we didn't get. This was a ludicrously plotted, overly long movie filled with inane and useless chatter. It was full of 20 minute scenes showing characters eating strudel, 30 minutes drinking milk, and 45 minutes failing to get out a simple message until everyone gets mercifully shot. Some say that builds tension. I say this shows the director doesn't know what the hell he's doing.<br/><br/>In all, I estimate that 90 minutes of the movie was utterly boring dialog, and the other 60 minutes was one of the weakest war movies I've ever seen. **EDIT** I think the most offensively BAD part of this movie was how little the Basterds were in it. They had maybe two scenes of mayhem, then the finale. They could have been dropped completely and the movie would have ended exactly the same. <br/><br/>If you want to see a good war movie, rent anything but this off the top war movies list. This wasn't a war movie, this was awful. It was the first movie where I walked out furious that I sat through it, and I vowed to never see another new Tarantino movie after this EVER.

","There is one scene that stands out in this movie and in fact, in the entire body of Tarantino's work. The Nazi propaganda film at the end where a fictional German soldier effortlessly massacres his enemies. This scene, directed by Eli Roth, is perhaps the most politically interesting scene in any of Tarantino's films to date. That is, until you realize it's true purpose.<br/><br/>Let's quickly review the essential elements of the mise en abyme which is 'Pride of the Nation':<br/><br/>1. incompetent enemy soldiers die in droves 2. incompetent enemy commander makes unrealistically poor decisions 3. cowardly enemies use innocents as human shields 4. hero is outnumbered but prevails due to patriotism and/or desire for revenge<br/><br/>We may as well be watching The Patriot, American Sniper, Fury, Defiance, or any other war-glorifying, American piece of propaganda. And this is exactly the point we are supposed to take away from the ridiculousness of 'Pride of the Nation'. But, it should then occur to the viewer that the movie we have just watched, Inglorious Basterds, is itself just one of these pointless, war-mongering films with all of the above listed elements.<br/><br/>Never have I seen such callous disrespect of a filmmaker for his own audience. Tarantino is spitting in the face of his fans for enjoying the brutal murder of Hitler (and having enjoyed such a pointlessly violent WWII revenge film) all while 'Pride of the Nation' plays in the background. ""You gullible idiots"" says he as he laughs at his fans. The audience in the fictional theater in Paris is the audience of Inglorious Basterds.<br/><br/>I would be inclined not to condemn this motif so harshly if the movie itself had more substance to it. Unfortunately, Tarantino whips out all the old stops in this clichéd time waster. Contrived, poorly written dialogue meant to be witty is followed by intense violence which is followed by screaming - end scene.

Memo to Brad Pitt: Your imitation of Warren Oates leaves much to be desired.

None of the ""basterds"" is a character; instead they've been picked for a ""Jewish"" cast to their face. How repellant is that. The two chicks are more than degraded by the script, the plot is silly.

Garrulous dialogue scenes, erratic characters and a convoluted plot that all defy good taste, much less credibility,undermine what might have been an acceptable movie. <br/><br/>Initially, the action—which Tarantino breaks into five chapters--opens during 1941 in the scenic French countryside. Unctuous Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) arrives at a farm house with several German soldiers and questions the owner, Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet of ""Hannibal Rising""), about Jews. Landa succeeds so well at ingratiating himself with LaPadite that the poor Frenchman breaks down and exposes the helpless Jewish family holed up down in his basement. The Nazis turn the basement into Swiss cheese with fusillades of machine gun fire. Miraculously, as only miracles in a movie can happen, one of the Jews, a young woman, Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent of ""Snowboarder""), manages to escape. <br/><br/>In the next scene, U.S. Army Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt of ""Ocean's Thirteen"") assembles a team of Jewish Americans to infiltrate enemy lines and slaughter as many Nazis as possible. In fact, Raine demands that Sergeant Donny Donowitz (""Hostel"" director Eli Roth), Private Smithson Utivich (B.J. Novak of TV's ""The Office""), Private Omar Ulmer (Omar Doom of ""Death Proof""), Private Gerold Hirschberg (Samm Levine of ""Club Dread""), Private Andy Kagan (Paul Rust of ""Semi-Pro""), and Private Michael Zimmerman (Michael Bacall of ""Undertow"") take 100 Nazi scalps. So much for the time-honored Geneva Convention!<br/><br/>In the next scene, Adolph Hitler (Martin Wuttke) clamors that their troops must stop talking about the ""Bear Jew."" The Fuehrer rants that the nickname German soldiers have saddled Sergeant Donowitz with is undermining Nazi morale. Indeed, Donowitz wields a baseball bat with ghoulish gusto. In one scene, he takes sadistic pleasure in smashing the skull of a Nazi soldier with a Louisville slugger. Moreover, Raine and his 'Holocaust' dogs display no qualms in scalping dead Nazis. When Tarantino isn't showing Americans carving the scalps off the fallen enemy, he has them slashing swastikas in the foreheads of live prisoners. <br/><br/>Our psychopathic heroes have even gone so far as to rescue a renegade Nazi, Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger of ""Driven""), who has acquired a notorious reputation as a serial killer among his own ranks. Mind you, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is too comically cretinous to distinguish between good Germans and bad Nazis. Like the politically incorrect cavalry westerns of yesteryear, the only good Germans in ""Inglourious Basterds"" are a dead Germans.<br/><br/>Three years have elapsed since Shosanna eluded Colonel Landa. She resides now in Paris and owns a cinema. A lonely Nazi soldier, Frederick Zoller (Christopher Reeve lookalike Daniel Brühl of ""The Bourne Ultimatum""), befriends her. Shosanna doesn't know Zoller is a war hero. Singlehandedly, he shot over 200 American G.I.s dead from his sniper's lair atop a bell tower. Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth of ""Stalingrad"") has produced a movie about Zoller's exploits with Zoller playing himself. Moreover, Goebbels plans to premiere this epic in Paris for the high-ranking Nazi elite. Among those scheduled to attend are Hitler, Martin Bormann, Reich Marshal Hermann Göring, and famous German actor Emil Jannings. Of course, when Goebbels imposes on Shosanna to show the movie, she has no alternative. She does, however, have quite a barbecue cooked up for the cream of the Third Reich.<br/><br/>Meantime, British Intelligence General Ed Fenech (Michael Meyers of the ""Austin Powers"" movies) and Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Rod Taylor of ""The Time Machine"") have concocted their own secret mission. They plan to send British Lieutenant Arch Hicox (Daniel Day-Lewis lookalike Michael Fassbender of ""300"") behind enemy lines to masquerade as a Nazi. He will accompany one of their most trusted double-agents, German film starlet Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger of the ""National Treasure"" movies), to the film premiere. Unfortunately, things go awry for Bridget and Hicox before they can rendezvous with Raine. They encounter a suspicious Gestapo officer in a basement tavern and a massacre ensues that nearly scuttles the mission.<br/><br/>Evidently, the last thing Tarantino wanted to make was a patriotic World War II movie. Instead, he has tweaked history so that ""Inglourious Basterds"" amounts to a revisionist Holocaust fantasy of far-fetched proportions. Ridiculing the Nazis as supremely stupid swine is one thing, but it is quite another to depict Americans as murderous morons. Colonel Landa's outlandish incompetence at the premiere where he thwarts one plot but wholly overlooks another is hilariously awful. Brad Pitt's Lt. Aldo Raine, a clownish Tennessee hillbilly with an ersatz Jethro Bodine drawl, is Tarantino's homage to late B-movie hunk Aldo Ray. Actually, Ray starred in the Italian WWII thriller ""Suicide Commandos."" Pitt plays the leader of this scummy little band of scalphunters without a shred of subtlety. Indeed, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is about as subtle as a baseball bat to the brains. The only thing Tarantino forgot to do was dress his Jewish-American commandos up in grease paint, wigs, and phony accents like the Marx Brothers."

","This movie shows Tarantino's deterioration, clumping together his predilection for gory violence with comic book approaches to story and character. This is sad, because the bits and pieces of the movie and the acting are quite good, but the scenes add up to an unpleasant mess. Add to that the ridiculous story line--a successful assassination of Hitler, Goering, Goebbels, and Bormann at a movie premiere in Nazi occupied Paris after D-Day--as if any of those would travel to Paris at that point! What's more, Tarantino doesn't even care enough to keep his dates and the count of years right from scene to scene.<br/><br/>Tarantino has always been a self-indulgent writer/director, but somehow in the early films it worked. Even Kill Bill worked, particularly part 1, despite his stretching it to a four hour film. But the sort of weaknesses that always lurked close to or at the surface in those and other films clearly have taken over if Inglorious Basterds is a harbinger of the future. Quentin, let's get a little realism into your film making."

","I have watched several other QT movies and I liked all of them. Not this one though. I thought QT had a dark but intelligent sense of humor. Seeing this movie has convinced me that it's dark only. He takes a subject as tragic as WW2 and makes not one single effort to honor the very real suffering that millions of people had to experience. No show of empathy, compassion or mercy. The bloodthirsty revenge theme worked for Kill Bill but that was one messed up woman hunting a bunch of even more messed up freaks and the visual art and music were the main quality anyway. I'm actually starting to question QT's emotional health. This movie makes him appear as a sadistic narcissist. It's simply disgusting. One point goes to Waltz' performance which was amazing and really wasted on a film like this. I wish I hadn't seen it, it made me depressed and disillusioned with parts of humanity. The emotional response this movie invoked in me is pretty much the straight opposite of what I got from Avatar, which I also saw recently. Then again, I guess the universe isn't quite done yet with its need to manifest nihilism and violence and that's probably why these lame movies keep being made. But maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm just too stupid to understand QT's genius. If that is the case so be it, I'd rather focus on other perspectives of reality than this one."

","After seeing many Tarantino films and understanding and enjoying much of his darker humour and intellect, I was hugely disappointed in this movie and the way it was presented. Although many of his films are depicted with violence which is graphically portrayed this time seemed a bit out of the ordinary and over the top. Maybe after seeing so many of his films I was wasn't expecting the level of violence as it was portrayed or maybe I'm just tired of seeing the same old thing from him. The film opens up well and cements Christoph Waltz's character beautifully as the Sly, calculating and deadly SS officer, a character the was so well developed that you really hate him and just want some him to get what is deserved. Daniel Brühl also plays his annoying and persistent character well and although you want him to get what he does, you also feel some pity for him. But for the rest, well they just filled the gaps in some very long drawn out scenes that by the next scene you have try and remember what the hell is going on. Story was less about the Inglorious Basterds and their exploits and more about the plight of a young Jewish girl whom escapes from the murderous (Christoph Waltz). So where this title comes from is unknown. Brad Pitt just rolls with the punches and doesn't deliver anything extraordinary. Nice touch to use an old Universal Logo at the beginning and roman numerals under the title like a 1960's war movie. But thats where the similarities end. Tarantinos effort to cross a war drama of old with his own unique style failed in my eyes by using Scalping and other various violence to make it entertaining. Very disappointed in this."

But QT has often managed to do amazing things with such plots. Problem is: It is intensely boring. there is this thing that happens to famous directors. They forget there is this concept called editing. They come to believe that their vision, their every second of imagery is heavenly treasure; that to cut a line of dialog out of, for instance, the third 20-minute conversation around a table, is to cut the heart out of their child. We're here, folks. QT has become boring. His once masterful dialog may be in there somewhere, but it's buried in stuff that would make George Lucas reach for the scissors. And that is all this movie is--talking. Sure, there's some blood and explosions, but QT dashes through the action so that he can get back to yet another stilted, pointless conversation among characters who, frequently have no role save for that conversation.

There were lots of other reasons for me not to like Inglourious Basterds. <br/><br/>I didn't have high expectations, but still it was very disappointing. I was surprised how little action this had and how boring it all was. The plot is very thin and there are a lot of absolutely pointless and painfully long scenes. Some may be fooled by this into thinking the movie actually had depth. But I think Tarantino really didn't know what he was doing. Despite the huge amount of dialogue the characters remained one dimensional and boring (with maybe one or two exceptions). <br/><br/>The violence in-between all that boredom seemed misplaced, unnecessary and therefor really disgusted me. Want an example? There's a scene where a German officer gets brutally beaten to death with a baseball bat for not providing strategic information. He was only protecting his fellow soldiers and was actually very brave. Are we supposed to think this is perfectly acceptable because he was a Nazi? Or was this even supposed to be funny? <br/><br/>This movie also failed from an artistic point of few. The direction and camera work was underwhelming at best. The music was horrible and didn't fit at all. Overall, there wasn't any consistent style to this movie, just a lot of pieces that didn't match.<br/><br/>I'd rate this even lower if it weren't for Christoph Waltz's great performance as Hans Landa and a few good laughs.

Somehow I did not expect to find comedy in a movie about Nazi Germany. Add in the over-long drawn out scenes showing a strudel dessert, or a hat w/veil being put on...painfully 'artistic'. The storyline of getting even with vicious killers by viciously killing them seems contradictory in a sense. Somehow it makes a mockery of what the holocaust victims endured. I think this movie is only being applauded because it was made by Tarantino. IF anyone else had directed it, it wouldn't even be on the radar. Maybe the only ones impressed by this film needed to be Tarantino diehards. If that is true, there is no need for criticism as ANYTHING would satisfy.

Sheesh, there was once a time when a film like this could be made with a running time of about 90 minutes, and would be a good film with plenty of action and character development. Instead, we get a two and a half hour plus turkey with overlong scenes and almost no action that for some reason is all the way up there in the top 250. (At least it still is at the time this is written). I know I mentioned the overlong scenes already, but wow! The first scene was at least fifteen minutes long, and by the end of it, I was sure I would hate this film. I wouldn't mind a talky film if I saw it coming, but I expected an action filled revenge story, not talky nonsense.

","I really don't like this movie. I think right now I'm rating it like a 2 or 3. I haven't seen ""Death Proof"" but I think I've seen all the other ones he's directed and this is definitely the worst. In fact his films have been getting worse all the time and the last respectable thing he did was ""Jackie Brown"" as far as I'm concerned. I'm pretty much through with him. His credit is totally gone with me. As far as I can tell he makes movies to feed the fantasies of 14 year old boys. It seems like his early movies were fun and different, even if they used a lot of stuff from older movies they put it together in a different way. But this movie and ""Kill Bill"", these are just stupid movies to me. Pornography of violence basically.<br/><br/>There's something to be said for the old exploitation movies. I'm not entirely ignorant on this subject. He used a lot of ideas from the B-crime movies of the 50s with ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"", and then he did I guess his version of ""blaxpoloitation"" with ""Jackie Brown."" But the thing is, that movie was made with respect to black people. It's not even really a blaxploitation movie at all, just a decent modern caper movie that uses music from the 70s movies. But with this ""Inglorious Basterds"" thing, it's really like he's trying to make his own ""Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS"" movie. But he's trying to have his cake by making it ""Ilsa, She Wolf of the Jewish resistance."" And ultimately he just presents this sad tableau where every character and every scene is dehumanized and dehumanizing. If he had actually wanted to make a movie that would have entertained Hitler, he couldn't have done better.<br/><br/>I want to give this movie points for being different, but how can you reward somebody just for being worse than others, for daring to go further into violence for the sake of violence and justifying it with some lame-arse stuff like ""oh they're all Nazis, who cares what happens to Nazis?"" It's still dehumanizing in my opinion, it debases us to be encouraged to fantasize about committing this kind of violence to anyone. Movies like this are what makes me scared for the future of America, which I love dearly. Don't try to say that the ""Basterds"" are presented in some kind of negative light, or the film is a parody of American Exceptionalism. That's just an excuse that Tarantino built into the film with a few throw-away lines like ""watching the Jew Bear bash a Nazi is the closest thing we get to a movie."" Just to be self conscious about using violence and hate as a cinematic value (like the most base and disgusting exploitation films Tarantino apparently adores in a different way than I ever could) is not to justify it, not even in an aesthetic sense."

","Anticipating the release of what was supposed to be Quentin Tarantino's return to form, but not necessarily fooled by the almost-radioactively-glowing praise it had received from contributors to IMDb, I had optimistically imagined the film would be strewn with witty dialogue, high tension and atmospheric camera-work. What I saw instead was shallow, indulgent and pretentious. The characters had all the depth of bad comic book caricatures, and scene after scene involved actors having to explain the inconsistencies and downright unlikelihoods in the plot to each other. Any tension intended by the constant interrogations was drowned by repetition of questions and painfully obvious answers. I always knew Bande Apart's latest offering would gain an almost automatic entry into the IMDb Top 250, deserving or otherwise, but its current ranking of 68 shocks me. Tarantino's easily-pleased and over-loyal fans, by enjoying this movie as much as they profess, must share the eroded attention spans of the coked-up sycophants that appear to make up Tarantino's inner circle... seals, faithfully honking their applause for a steady degeneration from one of the world's most exciting directors into the washed-up hack he is quickly becoming. I will stop short of pointing out the Top 250's other most undeserving inclusions, let alone it's many glaring omissions ... movies whose thorough production ethics shame most modern efforts... but I can recommend (especially to any other film lovers out there on this cusp, who suspect the emperor has no clothes) that outgrowing Tarantino, at least, will probably coincide with a major leap forward in their ability to correctly assess the merits of a film.

"Naurya","1","24","45","14 September 2009"," Glorification of violence and unnecessary reanimation of old hostilities!
","Yesterday, watched ""Inglorious Basterds"" together with my boyfriend and as a German, I really have to comment about it! My expectations were really quite high because I had read that all the characters would be portrayed by actors of the matching nationality, which I regarded as a brilliant idea! I also knew that the story wouldn't be historically correct, but I didn't bother. In my opinion, the cinema is free to alter history, as long as it's good entertainment.<br/><br/>Well, the movie started with the scene about the French guy being visited by SS Colonel Landa - brilliant acting, especially on the part of Christoph Waltz, good story and I loved the switching of languages. (I was a little bit disappointed though that the Americans didn't speak English in the German version, but also German - why not be consistent and let every character speak their mother tongue? - Perhaps that would be to daring for a mainstream movie and you can't expect the average audience to read that many subtitles? I would have appreciated it to hear English spoken in the movie!) Anyway, so far I enjoyed the movie, but the moment those ""Inglorious Basterds"" entered the screen, that soon changed. Brad Pitt's speech full of hatred already made me frown. Take Nazi's scalps? Be as brutal as possible? - Excuse me, are those the guys I am supposed to sympathize with? - Okay, I thought, it's a Quentin Tarantino movie, so you're bound to hear a lot of language and and see graphic violence. I really enjoyed the plot line with the Jewish cinema owner and the Nazi officer / actor and the whole movie would have been brilliant, if they had just made this the main plot and left out the whole stupid Inglorious Basterds thing! What really gave me the creeps was this scene with the German soldier being beaten to death with a baseball batter. Don't get me wrong, I'm not generally against portraying violence in movies, but it always depends on the context! And it's really unacceptable to portray this violent execution as fun, with cheering and laughing people around, without ever questioning if this is the right thing to do. The ""Inglorious Basterds"" are the characters the audience is supposed to sympathize with because, obviously, they don't want to be on the side of the bad Nazis, though you see them committing much less bloody crimes on screen than the Basterds. Therefore the audience is supposed to enjoy the beating and take it as a righteous action! Pure mischievous joy! I can see all those teenagers laughing who the next day on the school ground stand by a fight, film it with their mobile phone and then upload it on youtube to have a laugh with millions of users who are just as stupid as themselves! I really couldn't believe it! Come on, in which century are we living, Americans? - Do you first need to have your very own Third Reich before you finally get the fact that such violence is NEVER EVER justified? When will you get it that you stop being the good guys the moment you take up the methods of the bad guys and use them against them? - It's the same all over: Iraq, Abu Ghraib, Inglorious Basterds! It is NOT funny to kill and mutilate people, whatever it is they did! Of course movies can portray people who think killing is funny, but they should never portray them as being good and right! And especially not in the context of the Third Reich! And by the way, does there have to be a ""funny"" insult against Germans every five minutes? - Why do you so reanimate the old hostilities of World War II? I thought we were over that! In Germany, we have learned our lesson of tolerance and peacefulness. Everyone who enjoys the movie has proved they haven't learned it yet!<br/><br/>Though I certainly don't sympathize with Nazis, the truest moment of the movie was the scene at the premiere of the movie ""Stolz der Nation"". Three American members of the ""Basterds"" tried to pretend to be Italians because they thought the Nazis wouldn't notice that they can't really speak Italian. But then Nazi officer Landa turned out to speak Italian fluently, to which Brad Pitt's character could only reply ""Grazie"". I just thought: ""Serves you right, ignorant Americans!"" I mean, they have no clue about Germans or Italians or Frenchmen, but they just think they can go into some other countries and kill a lot of people and have fun making a bloody mess in the presumed name of justice.<br/><br/>It's really a pity that a movie with such brilliant ideas has to be so awful, just because it glorifies violence and encourages intolerance! Inglorious Basterds certainly didn't improve my opinion about America and it certainly doesn't improve anybody's opinion about Germany. In recent years, Germany has produced sensitive storys about conflicts of conscience like ""The Reader"" - the U.S. gives us senseless beating and cheering about violence! Congratulation, Tarantino, for your contribution to international understanding! :("

It really feels as though these films simply detract from honest history and In my opinion telling FANTASY - such as this film - only works against Truth.<br/><br/>I'm not against Fiction! I love some of Tarantino's work. Yes! Pulp Fiction, LOVE IT! But, we must have balance."

","This movie easily could have been really good but fails miserable. Probably because Tarantino did not put any effort in writing and making it good, there are so little of substance in this movie that it is embarrassing. Characterbuilding is almost non existing, logic is nowhere to be found and most of the actors do a terrible job. I was surprised to find that even the Oscar wining Nazi was totally non believable and laughably overacting all through the movie. The only redeeming factor of the whole movie is Mlle Laurent who does a decent job of looking fabulous. I grew up on the type of b-movies which Tarantino says that Basterds is a tribute to. But those movies were all far superior to this piece of drivel even though they cost peanuts to do compared to this D-movie."
"Quebec_Dragon","4","22","41","5 October 2009"," Bring on the hate
","I might be one of the only people crying foul but aren't we getting diminishing returns with Tarantino since Kill Bill 2 ? I was majorly disappointed with Inglourious Basterds. I found the film weak, unsatisfying and plain long. It seems that Tarantino is writing longer and longer (and longer) conversation pieces or monologues about mundane or inane subjects with a very short (or no) payoff at the end. In his earlier filmography, those parts used to be clever, somewhat brilliant despite their outward superficiality but he did limit them, pace them better and they were nowhere near as self-indulgent as in Basterds. He relies on the quality of his actors to keep our collective interest but that can only go so far. I suppose those drawn-out conversations can build up a certain tension if you're patient enough and that Tarantino delights in doing the unexpected even with characters you think might be major. I'll give him some credit for subverting usual movie clichés, which might be due to his extensive movie knowledge.<br/><br/>Regarding the featured Basterds commando, they were a disappointment. Besides their leader (Brad Pitt's character) who sounds and looks more like a southern redneck than a Jewish American, the other members of the commando have extremely little screen time, even less talking time and zero personality. Being angry and killing Nazis with a baseball bat is not good characterization. If you were expecting some kind of over-the-top revenge trip on Nazis by the Jews, you'll get very little satisfaction even at the end as the Jews themselves are basically superfluous. I would argue that the German characters shown here are, in general, more interesting, likable and/or multifaceted. You almost feel sorry for some of them (which perhaps was Tarentino's intention but then he should have worked more on the Jewish characters to compensate). The actions scenes are usually quick and cringe-worthy with a longer set-piece at the end that was not particularly exhilarating or well shot. I know violence in real life is probably like that but their shortness was accentuated by the very static overly long conversations.<br/><br/>The most memorable character by far is the SS colonel Hans Landa. Beyond his amazing linguistic skills (my native language is french and his was very good), you'll enjoy his suave friendly unpredictable antics. He manages to make extremely long conversations somewhat bearable through sheer screen presence. I also liked very much Brad Pitt's enthusiastic and fun portrayal of Aldo Raine even though he's caricatured and not particularly believable. The 2 characters above are mostly responsible for the few funny bits. The cast in general was very good especially the 2 female leading roles. Certain trends (or trademarks) in Tarentino's film-making are getting worse and you should avoid this if you're looking for great action, comedy or war film unless you're really keen on overlong Tarentino-type dialogue and want to see great multilingual acting.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 out of 10"
"jessvisser","1","13","22","4 October 2017"," Horrific anti-German hate propaganda
","(To offer a different perspective on this movie, it takes some background reading/research, so please keep an open mind when reading as you may come across things you have never heard of or considered). To begin, this movie sets the cliché and tired notion that Jews=automatically good guys, and all ""Nadzees""=automatically evil non-humans who deserve whatever comes to them. This movie serves as propaganda to justify the inhumane treatment of, and genocide of, the Germans - by dehumanizing them like any effective hate propaganda does to those it deems the ""enemy"". As someone who detests senseless violence, gore and death, I found this movie not even worth the lowest one gold star rating.<br/><br/>While this movie is classified as fiction, it attempts to appear as though some parts are not fiction by twisting the events, people, etc. of WW2 into a deranged fantasy. In certain ways, ways that may not be common knowledge, this movie does have an element of truth to it - the brutality and inhumane treatment of ""evil Nadzees"" by Jewish supremacist fanatics, and others.* For context: Since the 1800s, within Jewish supremacist circles, the idea of eradicating all Germans (and whites along with Western civilization and Christianity in general) can be found in various quotes from the early Zionist and Communist movement leaders (Moses Hess, Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, etc). As a result, this sentiment grew so much that the Daily Express from March 24, 1934 featured the headline, ""Judea declares War on Germany"". This hatred of Germans and whites in general did not begin due to WW2, but still today we are told to view these groups in a negative light, through movies like this.<br/><br/>*In particular, part of this movie may be based off of the actions of a Jewish supremacist group called Nakam. After WW2, not being satisfied with the already-high number of deaths from the War, Abba Kovner wanted more Germans dead. To accomplish this, his Nakam terrorist group went and abducted random Europeans and drove them out to a forest, where they then shot the innocent Europeans. Another genocidal act was when Abba Kovner's Nakam domestic terrorist group members broke into the concentration camp where German POWs were being held, and coated the bread with arsenic to kill the German POW inmates (called ""Plan B""). This was after the failed attempt to poison the water supply to kill German civilians in cities such as Hamburg and Munich (""Plan A""). Also, Jewish partisan gangs roamed around post-WW2 occupied Germany, seizing and occupying the homes of German refugees. <br/><br/>In addition to all this, Churchill ordered the expulsion of 15 million Germans from their land, causing 3 million of them to die. From 1939-1945, nearly 7 million German POWs were sent to Soviet gulags, most of them to never return, and anyone fighting the Soviets (including Russians) were deemed ""Nazi collaborators"" were also sentenced to mutilation, rape, torture and death. Also, Eisenhower's camps held 1.7 million Germans who were not fed, not given shelter, were tortured, maimed and murdered at will by the Allied guards. If that wasn't enough to satisfy the sadistic psychopaths who hold a genocidal anti-German rage, after WW2, the Soviets invaded Germany and occupied the eastern half of the country. The brutal rape and murder of 2 million German women and girls took place by mainly Jewish and oriental Soviet units, causing many other German women and their children to commit suicide to avoid that same fate. Why weren't all these events accounted for in the movie? Why was the German male made out to be some evil nonhuman worthy of the most horrific torture, when the average German had no part in war crimes? <br/><br/>At the end of WW2, Eisenhower said of the Germans, ""It's a pity we could not we have killed more"". The war crimes committed by Jewish supremacists, the Allied leaders and the Soviets should have been acknowledged in this movie, to make it more accurate with reality, and reduce the glaringly-obvious bias of the movie. The Dresden terror bombings were another example of war crimes perpetrated against the German civilians, which scorched a non-military/civilian city, killing countless men, women and children. Incorporating these facts into the movie would impart a more rounded perspective to the viewers, even in a fictionalized genre. Or is the goal to leave the viewers with an ignorant and highly-skewed perspective of history, along with a supposedly- justified hatred for Germans? <br/><br/>But some more things don't add up. Knowing what we know now: Why was there no mention of the horrors that the Communists/Bolsheviks committed against millions of innocent civilians, under the direction of certain leaders who just happened to be Jewish, in East European countries? For example, all the death and suffering caused by Communists in places like the (then) USSR, Ukraine (esp. Holodomor which killed 8 million people), Katyn Forest Massacre, etc.? Why did Quentin Torrentino not make a similar-themed revenge movie, with the antagonists as Communists? Quentin Torrentino seems to have a penchant for revenge fantasies, but this one was just tasteless. I doubt anyone who went through the horrors of WW2 would ever want their horrors twisted into a ""fun"" or ""funny"" perspective. Disgusting trash."
"cbcradiotwoandme","1","13","22","11 March 2017"," What absolute trash this movie is. Quentin Tarantino needs adult supervision.
","At a certain point in their careers film directors may acquire enough clout in Hollywood that they are given carte blanche to direct their movies as they see fit. Quentin Tarantino has clearly reached this point.<br/><br/>Tarantino obviously requires some adult supervision and perhaps psychiatric counselling as well. This film is utter trash. The first clue is the opening titles. Tarantino has taken a shine to styling the titles after the B-movies of the '60s and '70s in a sign that things are about to get much, much worse.<br/><br/>The opening scenes - or, as Tarantino grandiosely proclaims - ""Chapter One"" - aren't that bad. Although I had to wonder why the French dairy farmer is randomly pounding his axe into a stump. There's no wood being split, so why is he working up such a sweat? We never find out. And why does the stump seem to be made of metal, from the ringing sound that the axe makes when it hits it?<br/><br/>""Chapter Two"" introduces us to Lieutenant Aldo Raine, played by Brad Pitt. Brad seems in on the joke with his over-the-top accent and portrayal of a U.S. commando leader out to spread terror among the German soldiers in occupied France by killing them and taking their scalps. Yes, scalps. As in an old '50s cowboy western. Pitt tells his team of commandos - which, by the way, are all of the Jewish faith - that he wants each of them to take 100 scalps. Can you picture just how heavy 100 scalps would be, not to mention messy to carry around with you? I'm surprised U.S. veterans weren't up in arms to complain that Tarantino was maligning their reputation.<br/><br/>Indeed, we are treated to a scene in which one of Raine's commandos slices off the top of a (presumably) dead German. Followed by a soundtrack featuring a Mexican guitar - in Germany. In the 1940's. Followed by a cartoonish title introducing an evil German. At this point - or even earlier - the discerning viewer may wish to follow my lead and end viewing."

","O.M.G. is it wrong to be BORED by this film? What has happened to my cute Brad baby? Can ya tell? I hated this movie. The two women were the only redeeming factors for me. Tarantino is a juvenile fan-boy of violence and shows it lovingly on the screen, in close up and long takes. But his fan base loves it all too, so he will keep getting funds to make these piles of dung. The opening sequence at the farm house is suspenseful and starts things off well. We dread what we know will happen to the Jews hiding under the floor boards. But by the time the young woman is running across the field, and it just ends with the officer yelling at her, things have already started to go wrong. At least to me. So much of the rest is just disjointed and makes you want to scream - get on with it! - too many long meaningful looks, too many in jokes that I for one didn't get. 4/10 only for his good actors doing their best."

"tobydale","5","12","20","15 November 2010"," Disappointing to the point of irritation
","First of all let me say that in general I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino movies. But this one left me cold. I've given it a day or 2 to think about it and I've decided that this is not a very good film.<br/><br/>Now we all know that Tarantino knows his cellulose - and there is homage throughout all of his movies to some of the greatest films of all time. We know already Quentin! Why keep doing it! Isn't it about time you moved on? <br/><br/>For me the worst point of this movie was its counterfactual content. Everyone of a certain age and intelligence knows that Hitler blew his brains out in a bunker in Berlin in 1945. But I wouldn't mind betting that many watchers would have skipped out of the cinema thinking that World War II came to an end in 1944 because of some huge explosion in a cinema! Not so.<br/><br/>Now defenders of this movie will probably claim that ""it's an art movie - anything goes"". Okay fine. But it is still a movie. Art films don't have to be counterfactual, but they can be fictional, example, Babettes Feast, Jean de Florette, Once upon a time in the West, they still tell stories fantastically well and look brilliant. You can also have art movies that are factual, for example, the Passion of Joan of Arc, Amadeus. These are some great movies! But Inglorious Basterds doesn't hold a candle to any of these - not even in the same league. Why? On this showing Tarantino has reduced the war movie to a comedy. It's a very odd comedy, a violent comedy, a character's larger-than-life comedy. But it's a comedy nonetheless.<br/><br/>Tarantino is trying to do a lot of things with this film. For one thing, he is making a statement about the power of film and its propaganda qualities. For another he's trying to say, "" yeah, the Jews had it rough"". Yes Quintin, we know already. He's also trying to say people will sell each other out if the price is right. Okay, we know. You told us before.<br/><br/>The film just doesn't hang together. But then Tarantino films can have separate stories running within them, Pulp Fiction being the classic of this type. Pulp Fiction contains larger-than-life characters and is hysterically funny. I didn't want for this movie to be a comedy especially since it begins with the brazen ( and predictable) murder of a basement full of Jews hiding from the Nazis. Okay Quentin you got my attention. But then the film descends into comedy and parody and homage and we've seen it all before.<br/><br/>One thing you can say about this film is that it is full of tension - there are long scenes with dialogue. Always nice in a movie that - dialogue, and usually Tarantino films have quite good dialogue. But this just doesn't go anywhere - it's just unbelievable silly nonsense. The only character we care about - Soshanna - is somewhat surprisingly gunned down.<br/><br/>Tarantino is a very gifted filmmaker and storyteller. But I think he needs to get over himself. He needs to stop taking the film watcher for granted. Even the music, good though it is, is borrowed. War has in the past been been a vehicle to some of the greatest movies ever made. But this most certainly is not one of them. <br/><br/>Disappointing."
"RJBurke1942","4","12","20","18 February 2010"," Where Tarantino fantasizes about dirty war in war
","Okay – here's the story, in a paragraph: a bunch of American soldiers terrorize German infantry for years, in France, behind enemy lines. They become infamous to the Nazis, resorting to intense cruelty to the Germans. Even der Führer wants them caught. Meanwhile, in a French town, a lovely French-Jewish femme fatale plans to blow up her cinema when a famous German action flick is shown to the German hierarchy – including Hitler, Goering, Goebbels and Borman. Coincidentally, those infamous American soldiers are sent to do the same job. Also, there's a very nasty Nazi colonel who just loves to hunt down and kill Jews – and he smells a rat in the House of Cinema. How it all turns out, I'll leave up to you to discover – that is, if you see this film.<br/><br/>But, I don't recommend at all. Let me tell you why.<br/><br/>First, it's billed as drama/thriller/war. Well, I guess it does contain all of those attributes, but they forgot about fantasy. Because, this story is, at core, a spoof about war and sheer fantasy, in addition.<br/><br/>Second, in its effort to establish and develop character, it's often boring because it's way too talky for a thriller; you see character from what people do, not from what they say. Brad Pitt (as Aldo Raine) is okay as an over-the-top parody of hill-billy Americana – and he does it well. But, even his character becomes too talky. The nasty Nazi, Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) is talky also, but at least he's a detective (in his own words), so he has to ask a lot of questions. The rest of the cast do their best with a script that varies between intense dread, only occasionally, to high camp, often – especially concerning the German hierarchy.<br/><br/>Third, the whole story is preposterous. Let's face it – any war story that purports to show the entire German hierarchy being blown up in a cinema can only be regarded as coming from another planet Earth in another universe. And the (way too long) card game scene in the café basement is screechingly contrived coincidence and just too stupid for words. So, if you do see it, leave believability (the prime requirement for good stories, especially war) at the door. You've been warned.<br/><br/>And, finally, although Quentin Tarantino started well with his filmic revelation, Reservoir Dogs (1992), and followed up with his much better Elmore Leonard story, Jackie Brown (1997) – his best to date – this one is his nadir, in my opinion. Technically very good, especially with the editing, this basterd of a story nevertheless kills the whole experience. If he was trying to show war in the raw, look no further than the battle scenes in The Thin Red Line (1998). If he was trying to create a thriller, stay with the Bourne franchise. If he was attempting drama in war, watch From Here to Eternity (1953) or Twelve O'Clock High (1949), and too many other superior films.<br/><br/>To be fair, it has its moments: the frenetic shootout in the café basement is editing at its best. And the opening scenes at the French farm are a tour de force in building dread. However, the cardboard cutout characters left me totally indifferent to the fate of any of them: in sum, a dead story about death at its worst. It'll be interesting to see if Christoph Waltz gets the Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor. Miracles do happen, though.<br/><br/>I note that Roger Ebert gave it four stars. Is that out of ten? I hope so – I give it four also.<br/><br/>Oh, heck, see it if you must, but just keep in mind it's a fantastic spoof."

"GeeZee117","2","10","16","26 December 2015"," Sadistic
","he first thing you see on the screen in Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is a title card that says, ""Once upon a time in Nazi- occupied France"". In film geek shorthand that's a nod to Sergio Leone's masterpiece of the spaghetti western genre Once Upon a Time in the West, and Tarantino has said in interviews that this is a spaghetti western that just happens to take place during World War II. But more importantly, as with Leone's film Tarantino uses ""Once Upon a Time"" to let the audience know up front that what they are about to watch is a fairy tale, and any expectations of realism or historical accuracy should be left at the door. Because believe me, realism and historical accuracy are the least of this movie's concerns.<br/><br/>The story proper begins with Nazi Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) intimidating and manipulating a French farmer via trademark Tarantino dialog into revealing where he has hidden a Jewish family. Landa then has his soldiers kill the family, but the girl Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) manages (and to at least some degree is allowed by Landa) to escape. Meanwhile, a special unit of Jewish-American soldiers has been assembled by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). Their mission is to go undercover in France and kill as many Nazis as possible, in the most horrific ways they can think of. In addition, every member of the Basterds is expected to scalp their victims.<br/><br/>Returning to Shosanna, we find her now living undercover in Paris as a theater owner. She winds up hosting the premiere of a new Nazi propaganda film after a chance meeting with its star, Nazi war hero Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl). When Shosanna discovers that all the highest ranking members of the Third Reich will be attending the premiere, she comes up with a plan to take them all out. The Basterds learn of the premiere as well, and not knowing of Shosanna's plan set one of their own in motion.<br/><br/>Okay, for those of you who just want to know if the movie is fun, and don't really care to dig too deep: yes, the movie is a lot of fun. It's everything you expect from Tarantino – the great dialog, memorable characters, references to obscure pop culture trivia (my favorite this time being one character using the alias ""Antonio Margheriti "" – look it up), near perfect use of music, and of course the crazy, over the top violence and action. But like Kill Bill Volume 2, this is a more mature Tarantino. Basterds feels more personal, and although he still borrows from other movies, it's done in a less obtrusive way. <br/><br/>Despite what you may have been led to believe by the trailers, Brad Pitt is not the star here. He's a blast hamming it up, but his Lieutenant Rayne is more of a large supporting role. The real star of the film is Melanie Laurent, and her strong, believable performance anchors the film and gives it a much needed sense of weight to balance the exploitation movie antics of Pitt and his crew. Christoph Waltz has gotten the lion's share of acting praise for his portrayal of Landa, and it's certainly deserved. However, I was also impressed with Bruhl, who has the difficult task of playing a character you dislike yet still need to feel some sympathy for.<br/><br/>Okay, now to go looking for deeper meaning in a movie that most people probably just want to sit back and enjoy with a bag of popcorn and a coke. Most critics have seized on a quote from Tarantino that the film is about ""the power of cinema bringing down the Third Reich"". That's true up to a point, but I see Basterds as being just as much, if not more, about the power of film to do evil, specifically in the form of propaganda.<br/><br/>There are overt references in Basterds to Leni Riefenstahl, the female director who made the infamous German propaganda films Triumph of the Will and Olympia. And then there is Stolz der Nation, the faux German propaganda film-within-a-film we see in Basterds. Stolz heroically depicts how Zoller single-handedly kills hundreds of American soldiers. In one of the few moments in Basterds to humanize a German character, we see that Zoller is clearly uncomfortable with this cinematic depiction of his deeds, even as the audience cheers. Later there is a scene involving Zoller and Shosanna where the film exerts its power over Shosanna at a critical moment. She knows the film is a lie, and knows Zoller for what he is, but for just a split second it affects her and she pays a price for it.<br/><br/>Stolz is the kind of thing we are used to seeing as propaganda, but is it really so different from watching the Basterds beat, scalp, and gun down dehumanized Germans while making wise cracks? What are The Basterds if not a kind of propaganda? They are essentially cartoon characters, calling to mind the covers of WWII era comic books (almost without exception drawn by Jewish artists) where Captain America or the like would deliver a roundhouse punch to Hitler, or some bespectacled caricature of a Japanese soldier. Of course when the propaganda is on our side, we tend to look at it as just harmless entertainment. <br/><br/>Yep, torture, murder, is kosher and now funny. Goy lives matter. Expect<br/><br/>nothing less from JollyWood. Soon 60 shades of pedo and other movies will also be kosher.<br/><br/>The fake ratings of such a terrible movie who shill on social media. Same sheep who glorify Schindler List that was always Fiction."

","I tried 4 times to make it through this movie. 3 times I watched the captivating first scene, which is Tarantino at his best. This scene, wonderfully shot, paced and acted with rich homage to the classic films that inspired Tarantino, is one of the best set-ups for a story that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>But then the movie diverges into Tarantino's awkward, adolescent cocaine-edged ultraviolent fantasy world of cartoonish characters, exaggerated theatrics, lack of plot and supposedly justified violence and I just couldn't keep watching. It isn't that the violence bothers me so much (though I still have trouble understanding why people love to watch this kind of violence so much) as the utter pointlessness. 3 times I looked to see that there was still about 2 hours to go and just couldn't do it.<br/><br/>Last night I finally made it through the movie this time and for a couple of reasons am glad that I did. The ""basement scene"" was just as good as the opening scene with great acting, subtlety, twists and turns, great period sets, a patient and deliberate pacing that you just don't see in modern movies, and really just great cinema and story telling. The end of this scene spoiled it slightly for me, I just don't know why Tarantino has to always resolve tension with some ridiculous over-the-top violence, but still worthwhile viewing.<br/><br/>The other bright spot was Christoph Waltz, who kept turning in a ""who is this guy?"" performance. Exhibiting charm, great acting chops, and moving the story along he was a pleasure to watch. Later in the movie when he suddenly broke into fluent Italian I almost fell off the couch and now am a major fan of his.<br/><br/>But the rest of the movie was just barely watchable. Re-writing an alternate version of some of the best-known events in history is ridiculous to begin with, but to write it in a way that completely lacks logic or adherence to any believable actions is beyond stupid. He could have at least made an interesting plot of it. It assumes the audience is ignorant of the events and their consequences and impacts on millions of people worldwide.<br/><br/>Indeed it must be ignorance and stupidity that rates this film among the best of all time. I can only imagine young, ignorant, bloodthirsty Tarantio fans drinking up the violence and cheeky on-liners and rushing to IMDb to pay homage to their only favorite director.

In essence it is a German soldier politely but forcefully interrogating a Frenchman who he believes to be harbouring Jews, so I'll leave the description at that, because Tarantino makes it so much more that trying to describe it in more detail would be pointless.<br/><br/>In broad terms though it has crackling dialogue, the tension builds throughout and the scene is allowed to play out over about 20 minutes, where other directors might give it 3, get to the payoff and move on.<br/><br/>In Chapter Two we meet the Basterds – in another example of ""taking their word for it"", as we are informed that the Basterds are an elite team of vicious, mostly Jewish, soldiers hellbent on killing as many Nazis as possible and striking fear into enemy ranks.<br/><br/>We are introduced to a couple of Basterds, a German named Hugo Stiglitz who is infamous and feared (again because we are told so) and the ""Bear Jew"", a man who carries a baseball bat and beats his victims to a bloody pulp, but mostly they remain a faceless bunch headed by one Bradley Pitt - you might have heard of him.<br/><br/>Speaking of baseball bats, in the real life game of ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" I'd take a machine gun over a baseball bat every time. What does the Bear Jew do in combat, hang in the background until someone runs out of bullets? Or wait until a German soldier shows up with a club or bat so it is a fair fight? Seems a pretty inadequate weapon 99% of the time.<br/><br/>We are given a couple of examples as to how the Basterds work, and EVERYONE has seen the speech Aldo Raine (Pitt) gives to his squad applicants, ""And I want my scalps!"" but they just don't seem that scary or menacing really. Nonetheless (because the plot says so) their reputation gets all the way to Mr Hitler himself, who deems them trouble enough that he takes time out of running a conflict involving several million soldiers to consider how he might deal with them.<br/><br/>The remaining Chapters involve events that bring the main combatants into close proximity so that we might have some sort of climax to the film. In this case a Nazi propaganda film is to be premiered in a small French cinema, with many German dignitaries in attendance, including a man with an abbreviated mustache.<br/><br/>This gives a small window of opportunity for assassins to kill most of the Nazi war machine in one crack, thereby ending the war (apparently). At least in this circumstance Tarantino didn't think small! Of course it leaks out that the premiere is happening and the British intelligence formulate a plan to bring in the Basterds and have them meet with a liaison to crash the premiere and do what they do best.<br/><br/>Need I mention at this point we are about an hour and 40 minutes into the film, and the titular Inglourious Basterds have two on screen kills? Seems a little light in a war movie when they are the most feared soldiers in the entire war doesn't it? This movie isn't overlong, just ""over-nothing-worthwhile-happening"". I can sit through 2 and a half hours standing on my head if the movie justifies it, but I can't say that Inglourious Basterds gave me sufficient reward for my time, let alone ""Bang"" for my buck. There were almost more rounds fired in the standoff at the conclusion of Reservoir Dogs! Nazi Colonel Hans Landa, as the ""Jew Hunter"", is the best thing in the film and it is no surprise that he gets the best dialogue. The scenes in which he features provide some tension and menace that is not really tangible for the remainder of the film.<br/><br/>As mentioned before the Basterds are largely under-utilised but that is also reflective in the fact that they are soldiers and this is a movie largely without battles and action.<br/><br/>Tarantino sticks to his guns though and IB is again a movie made solely on his terms, the long drawn out scenes (many of them boring), considerable use of subtitles - even a bizarre section with a voice-over by Samuel L. Jackson for some reason - the music at times is also way too contemporary for a WW2 film, and if I bagged 300 for that then I must definitely point it out here.<br/><br/>I think it's interesting that Tarantino chose to plot his film in an alternate version of WW2, because in an alternate universe Inglourious Basterds would have far more action and be a far superior film.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. As a director Tarantino aims for ""cool"" above all else. This just ain't that cool, regardless of what the sweaty palmed fanboys think.<br/><br/>P.S. When I looked to IMDb to make sure I spelt a couple names right I saw that IB is currently in the top 100 ranked films of all time. This is surely just a sad joke.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"
"Corky1984","Null","10","16","4 February 2010"," Disappointing and overly self-indulgent
","As a fan of Tarantino's 90s gangster flicks, especially Pulp Fiction, I really wanted to like his latest offering. I wasn't all that impressed by Kill Bill, so was hoping this would be a return to form. Sadly, it didn't quite do it for me. The story is an interesting one: a team of Jewish American soldiers are sent to Vichy France to hunt down Nazis. There were a few entertaining set-piece action scenes and the odd bit of snappy dialogue. Overall, though, the film seemed to drag on at an achingly-slow pace. I could see that Tarantino was trying to build some tension etc, and the opening scene where a Nazi interrogator spends some time in inane banter with a man harbouring Jewish refugees was really well-played. The nerves increased as I wondered whether he would find the Jews hiding under the floorboards and there was some decent suspense. What undid the film, though, was that such scenes were more or less replayed several times over. I felt that Tarantino was too concerned with paying homage to various things/people/music, rather than directing a tightly-scripted film. This could have been really punchy at about 90 minutes, but it rambled on for over 2 and a half hours. The finale was pretty good and made up for that somewhat, but when it was over I just felt a bit empty: this could have been so much better. I don't think Tarantino will be able to match his earlier achievements and I probably shouldn't compare films which are admittedly different. Yet I couldn't help feeling disappointed that this latest Tarantino movie wasn't on the same level as Reservoir Dogs: we know he is capable of greatness, but maybe he's got nothing left in the tank..."

I enjoyed the drama in the bar when the inglorious bastards met the German actress (the informer), and everything went wrong. I enjoyed the drama around the theater and that the Germany's best Marksman fell in low with the Jewish girl boasting about his many kills (without consideration to whether her relatives or friends would be among the victims) and how the circle is closed at the end.<br/><br/>But after seeing the mass murder scene in the theater I cannot help to be disgusted by the glorification of hatred, murder and revenge.

","Peoples reaction to this movie scares me. Despite Mr. Tarantino's obvious talent, his lack of good taste and infantile world view are what shine through here. He reduce a historical tragedy, the holocaust, into an opportunity to create a bloody revenge fantasy. He disregards historical fact as easily as he rips off or should I say ""quotes"" more original filmmakers. What he does do well is create set pieces that stand out and write snappy dialogue. However, there is not one character here that is more than a cartoon cut out. Positive reaction to this film is a sign that people are checking their brains at the door."
"timrichardsondxb","1","20","37","31 December 2010"," Unwatchable
","Tarantino has shown himself as a master at building dramatic tension through dialog. In its finest moments, this film showcases this talent; unfortunately for me, too much of the film is spent indulging the director in his less admirable qualities. His scenes of shocking violence are irreverent and integral to the cartoon story he portrays in Reservoir Dogs (in my opinion his only significant work), however they are wholly inappropriate here. He manages the incredibly difficult task of insulting the memory of the honorable men and women that served on both sides of this despicable conflict. Having said that, if the director's role is to encourage his cast to deliver exceptional performances, then I hope Christopher Waltz surpasses this performance in a film worth recognizing for its quality. He was superb."

I'm not sure how long the actual film runs, but even in my sped up version it was tedious as well as nauseating. I agree there was some amusing silliness in some of the scenes, but the near total lack of coherence, other than the Nazi-hating sadism that attempts to hold it together, made it difficult to appreciate.

"eaydin79","1","17","31","3 December 2010"," what the hell is that
","Tarantino is worst director in the world. Even he's not director or some kind of creative person. It's not true that you take real events in history and use them to make movie like cartoon or funny story. You have to show respect to Jewish people's suffer. It's not your job that take revenge from history. I think real problem about Tarantino is that his observation come from movies not real world, i mean his inspiration is cinema not reality. It's wrong when subject is making film about historical truth. You may say that ""come on it's just a movie"", but nowadays many people learn history from cinema, if more people say that ""This is my imaginary, i can put into it everything i want"" and make stupid films about history like this then next generations believe fact that actually did not happen. For instance Will Smith's movie Wild Wild West. How sick people put black agent or detective (whatever) in that century of America. I mean that you cant distort history or reality. Germans killed Jews (Yes, Germans because they voted for Hitler and after the war everyone said ""i am not one of them they forced me..."" nobody buying this) and Jews did not do anything, they just waited to die. And Americans use blacks for slave. You cant change all of this historical truths. If you wanna do movie you have to open your eyes and look what happening in the world or what happened in the past.

I think the film is founded on rather shallow ideas, which are conveyed with typical Tarantino slickness, but in a crass way.

","Inglourious Basterds is cinema of the immature, of the man-child, of the loser film geek, of the fan-boy.<br/><br/>It does not nourish the soul nor does it feed the mind. It's masturbatory and narcissistic... it might be the perfect reflection of what American culture has become. It's empty macabre fun, it's the cinematic equivalent of binge drinking.<br/><br/>Basterds is very well made bad film. Tarrantino's script is overly wordy and strains at being clever. Clichéd lines abound - see anything the Superstar Celebrity and terrible actor Brad Pitt spoke.<br/><br/>The film's biggest sin is that it is, yet again, a movie about movies. Tarrantino's last three films have been the same thing. When will he stop cribbing from the genres he loves and think up an original idea for a film? My guess is never. Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs were audacious flukes by a young video store clerk. The middle aged man who wants to re-imagine movies from his favorite film genres bores me.<br/><br/>Tarrantino chronologically- One Good movie, one great movie, one fair movie and the rest are garbage. His movies are overly examined and justified by sycophantic fans trying to find a touchstone to the ""true cinema"". A bit of advice to them- go watch the movies Tarrantino steals from for touchstones. His synthesis of regurgitated cinematic genres gives us nothing new... except for shining a light on the excesses of our pop culture -""oh dude! Did u see how that guys head came off with a samurai sword in Kill Bill 2?! AWESOME!"" This is what happens when a video store clerk/film geek/pot head gets to live out his fantasy.<br/><br/>The night of the 2010 Golden Globes, as Scorsese is receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award for a lifetime of achievement in film, the cutaway to Tarrantino after the film clips from Scorsese's career is jolting. Tarrantino is scowling. He looks as if something sour flashed across his palate. I then realized that Tarrantino barely belonged in the same room as Scorsese. Maybe he realized it too."

The prologue is vintage Tarantino. The way the tension is build up throughout that opening scene is truly magnificent, and the camera pans down just at the right time. And by that time you've already learned to absolutely despise Landa, probably the most disgusting character Tarantino ever came up with. He's truly a man you love to hate, and his charming persona just makes him seem even more evil. He's if possible even more threatening than Jules Winfield was in the infamous breakfast scene from ""Pulp Fiction"". The segments with the basterds are probably the ones Tarantino had the most fun with, and these segments really know no boundaries in any way. Not only are they hilariously violent (the baseball bat!), they also ignore every possible historic fact. I wouldn't really want it any other way really. Another highlight is the bar scene, which illustrates perfectly how unpredictable this movie is. There are too many good moments to be naming them all, but this movie benefits so much from its outrageousness you really need to see everything for yourself."

"mesircow","8","37","77","8 August 2009"," Inglourious Basterds Review from Melbourne Film Festival
","Last night I caught a screening of Inglourious Basterds as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival. Before the movie even begun, I'll say that there was a great atmosphere by being surrounded by two cinemas filled exclusively with excited Tarantino fans. A film like this is always going to be much more enjoyable if you're watching it together with like-minded individuals.<br/><br/>So as the trailers show, the film is basically a spaghetti western set in Nazi-occupied France from 1941-1944. The trailers would also have you believe that this is Brad Pitt's movie and that he and his Basterds are the stars of the show. However, the Basterds themselves are only one of many parts that make up the story, as there is a very large ensemble cast that all have different narratives, only linking up towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>One of the highlights of this film for me was Christoph Waltz as the sadistic Nazi Jew Hunter Hans Landa. You can really see why he was rewarded with a Best Actor Award at Cannes for his effort here, as he truly dominates the film. The first scene of the movie in particular, where he slowly interrogates a Jewish family to find if they are hiding anybody or anything, is truly thrilling, suspenseful and possibly my favorite part of the movie.<br/><br/>Violence is used sparingly, but effectively. Some of it is jarringly realistic (yes, there is some scalping) but most of it is done in a darkly humorous way. There is also a great shootout scene that is so fast and choreographed so well that it is a real blast to watch. It's not Tarantino's most violent film, in fact it would probably be one of his tamer movies, but you've got to remember who we're talking about here. When things do get bloody, it makes for a bloody great time at the movies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, some things don't work out quite as well. The main thing that bothered me is that the cast is so large, that it feels like we don't get to know the characters as well as what we would like. The film is split up into five different chapters, and these chapters are generally made up a scene of lengthy dialogue that eventually leads towards a vicious conclusion. While this is enjoyable to sit through and it feels as though the dialogue is always taking us towards a relevant ending, it also makes us feel as though we have only really sat through 5 scenes and then the movie is over. In fact, despite the two and a half hour running time, I could have been happy if this movie went for an extra hour or more. Even if he split it into two films or made it into a miniseries it might have been more satisfying.<br/><br/>The ending was good, but a little underwhelming. This didn't leave me with the same emotional high as the ending of something like Reservoir Dogs. In fact, when the credits came up I just felt a little disappointed that it had finished so soon. However, if two and half hours go by that fast, with your eyes glued to the screen the whole time, I guess you can't complain too much. I suppose I was just hoping for a little more of an exclamation mark in the movies final moments.<br/><br/>The music is always a very important part of a Tarantino movie, and in Inglourious Basterds I felt it was a bit of a mixed bag. Some of it was sublimely awesome, such as David Bowie's Cat People, while some of it felt a little autopilot. For example, some of the music that Tarantino uses he has also used in his Kill Bill films. I know that the music is not original to those films to begin with, but hearing it again so recently from another film from the same director, I found it a little distracting. Then again, that might just be because I have seen the Kill Bill films so many times that I now find the music attached to those scenes. If I watch Inglourious Basterds a few more times then perhaps my opinion might change.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a great movie, but it wasn't up there with Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction. Still, if you are looking forward to seeing this I don't think that you will be disappointed. This is truly an event film and something that will work at its best on a big screen with a big audience. I'm already excited about seeing it for a second time."

They kill Nazis, and plan to kill all the Nazis and Adolf Hitler at a theatre during a Nazi fest.

","A lot of people are raving about Quentin Tarantino's latest movie and I'm sure you'll all end up watching it eventually whether you really want to or not. I watched it just to find out what all the fuss is about and I wish I now had those 2 and a half precious hours of my life back. It sucked! Here are my ten reasons why. 1. They can't even spell the name of the film correctly. It should be ""Inglorious Bastards"". Even with the differences between British and American English neither word in the title is spelled properly. Not that I expect much more from the land of ""Dunkin' Donuts"", ""Kwik Fill"" and ""Toys'R'Us"" anyway. 2. Apart from the first 30 minutes or so, the rest of the movie is just a load of talky nonsense with no action at all. If people aren't being scalped, beaten to death with baseball bats or shot then I have no interest in watching a movie like this anyway. I couldn't care less about the second World War. 3. Yes, it's a war film. I have no interest in war films whatsoever. It's not even a good or realistic war film such as ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Das Boot"" or even ""The Great Escape"". It's also far too much like ""The Dirty Dozen"" and so it sucks on all levels that pertain to originality or historical accuracy. 4. Did I mention that it's 153 minutes long? That's actually over 2 and a half hours (by three minutes). WTF? Who has the patience to watch anything that long unless it's porn? Not me. And how are you expected to watch something like this in a movie theatre with a Coke the size of a bucket without needing the toilet at least 8 times? I probably missed any good bits (if there were any good bits) after the first bit of brutality because I was too busy draining my little Quentin in the bathroom. 5. There just weren't enough subtitles. I don't need them for the French and German but I do for anything Brad Pitt says in any of his movies. How the hell did he become a Hollywood star when he can't even speak properly? I can't even blame it on his fake teeth this time like I did when he was slurring his way through ""Interview with the Vampire"". Having also just watched ""Benjamin Button"" with the subtitles on all the way through (because I couldn't understand anybody in it), I think it's down to his ludicrous attempt at a hillbilly accent. I think it's time for him to get some elocution lessons and then use his own voice in future. Some acting lessons wouldn't hurt either. 6. I've got nothing against Eli Roth as a director except that all his horror movies suck but now he thinks that he's an actor. Based on his whiny performance in ""Inglourious Basterds"", he can think again. Oh yeah, and he looks fat too. 7. I've never seen a single Quentin Tarantino movie that I liked. This was a chance for him to redeem himself but yet again he failed. Too much dialogue, too little action, and it looked as if it was knocked together in a week. Finding out later that Quentin Tarantino spent ten years on the story doesn't do much to help his case. Ten years to come up with this crap? I've written better blogs than his screenplays and they only take me about 5 minutes. If he'd come clean and admitted that it took him all of an hour then I'd have more respect for him. But then again, maybe not. 8. The only thing that would have made ""Inglourious Basterds"" memorable would have been if the characters played by Diane Kruger and Melanie Laurent had got nakedly gang-banged in all directions several times throughout or whenever the story lagged. Actually if it had just been 2 hours of Diane Kruger and Melanie Laurent naked then it would have been worth $10 of anybody's money even if they just stood there and did absolutely nothing at all. As it was, both actresses were wasted and this dismal failure of a movie has raped their careers no matter what the box office returns are. 9. There are no characters to care about in ""Inglourious Basterds"" because all they do is yap meaningless drivel rather than give any insights into themselves for the audience to empathise with. You actually get more characterisation in 3 minutes of a Bugs Bunny cartoon than in the whole of the this movie. So anyone who tells you how brilliant Tarantino is at creating caricatures is just insulting real artists (even animators) the whole world over. Even a blank piece of paper has more emotional depth than a Quentin Tarantino script. 10. Everything you want to know about this movie is shown in the trailer. How long is the trailer? About 3 minutes. That means that the rest of ""Inglourious Basterds"" is entirely padding. 2 and a half hours of padding!!! My verdict: 0 out of 10. If you have $10 and a bored afternoon then I do NOT suggest that you watch this movie at all. Just buy a can of paint, find a room in need of decoration, get out your brush and do a wall. Yeah, watching paint dry will be far more beneficial."

","As many others have commented on the film, and I don't want to rehash what they've submitted. The problem I have with this film was that I saw it on DVDm and the English subtitles for the Germans-speaking-German were so minuscule I couldn't read them. The English subtitles for Englanders-speaking-English were standard DVD fare and easy to read. But since the film depends so much on Subtitled German-to-English translations, having them be unreadable was insufferable. I had to scan back three and four times to read what the Germans were saying. and this eventually got frustrating. So I didn't enjoy the DVD version of the film at all..."

"GethinVanH","Null","18","34","18 November 2009"," Not so glorious violence
","The first half of this movie was quite good. It was interesting and suspenseful. The second half was pretty bad. The comic book revenge story came full circle and we see lots of comic Nazi characters and some badly acted ""good guys"" blowing them away. There's a lot of violence in this movie. I'm not squeamish about violence but I think it should at least have some purpose in a movie. There was little purpose to the violence here except to create a genre film where we see lots of people getting mowed down with rifles. We're somehow supposed to be amused by this.<br/><br/>I watched Reservoir Dogs recently. There was a movie where violence was employed effectively. It was realistic within the world the movie created. There were never any over-the-top sound effect. It was a crime movie which played it straight. Inglorious Basterds should have played it straight but didn't. I was rolling my eyes at how the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and extra bullets to the head and face.<br/><br/>None of the back-story of any of the Basterds is really explained either, they're simply Nazi hunters. We don't really get to like any of them either because they're too busy cutting scalps off and shooting people in the face. It's all about ""revenge"" and very little else.<br/><br/>There was 2 1/2 hours to work with here but few of the Basterds were really examined in depth. This seems like it was simply a revenge flick pure and simple. We saw that in Tarantino's last flick, ""Death Proof"" which I didn't care for either. It suffered the same problems. The characters were almost interchangeable.<br/><br/>The first half again, was pretty good. I wanted to see the exploits of the Inglorious Basterds across Europe. I was presented with a much lamer movie about the resistance movement plotting revenge against some comic book Nazis when they all go to one movie premiere in France."
"Captain_Couth","5","42","90","21 August 2009"," A mediocre effort from Tarantino. Nothing but a pastiche of films and silly sitcom dialog
","I saw Inglourious Basterds at a midnight screening and I was unimpressed with the movie. Seems like Tarantino has run out of ideas and sharp dialog. He promised a war movie in the style of an Italian western. All I saw was a pastiche of Italian westerns, bad humor and long drawn out dialog that lacked any of his previous films unique wit. Being a fan of pop culture Tarantino peppers the script with a lot of it from the 30's and 40's (yes it seems really forced). If you have seen a lot of Italian westerns, then you'll know what you're in for. Long panning camera shots, close ups of eyes and even longer wide shots. The actions scenes are few and scattered throughout the film. What I really didn't like about the film itself was that it's too helter skelter. One minute it's serious and the second it's silly with a lot of inane dialog and boring chatter that took over ten years to write (according to QT)..<br/><br/>The characters were not that interesting. Shoshana (played by Melanie Laurent) is the main character and the film centers around her involvement in the underground. She come off cold and not all that interesting. Colonel Landa (Christoph Waltz) is the ""Jew Hunter"" but he comes off like a Teutonic Columbo (I kid you not) and really mugs and overacts for the camera. The Basterds (led by Brad Pitt as Aldo Raine) are marketed as being the central characters of the film. But their appearances are too few and far between. Pitt's character's accent and personality comes off cartoonish and it really doesn't work. Eli Roth is not a very good actor and his character ""The Bear Jew""is very wooden. He's a good filmmaker who should stay behind the camera. Mike Myers guest role as a British officer is pretty bad and the audience was laughing along every time he spoke.<br/><br/>I wish the movie was made as a farce but I don't think that was Tarantino's intentions. He tried to make a ""spaghetti western war movie"". But it comes off like a real pedestrian effort that's caters to an audience that's not his. This film felt like his first ever mainstream movie. I was really stunned by how bad this movie is. The lighting is real annoying. I know Robert Richardson loves the whole ""halo light"" thing but it can be very distracting. The QT fan boys will fall all over themselves for this one because when he says jump they always say ""how high?"" I don't know how well this movie will do at he box office but what I do know is that he needs a hit big time to re coop the money lost for Grindhouse (which I really enjoyed). Tarantino used to fire on all cylinders, even in his so-so movies (Kill Bill Vol.2) but this one has my scratching my head going ""what the hell did I just watch?""<br/><br/>Several of Tarantino's trademarks appear in this film such as ""The Mexican Stand-Off"", pop culture references (albeit 30's and 40's), a bare foot scene (QT has a well known foot fetish) and the n-bomb is dropped a few times in the film (don't ask how they managed to work that into the movie)."

","Every Quentin Tarantino (QT) fan must see Inglorious Basterds, like every QT movie a person's unable to assign one drama, this movie is a perfect blend of war, comedy, action, thriller, drama, and romance. I was unable to take my eyes off of Christopher Waltz's performance as Colon Hans Landa or 'The Jew Hunter.' The story is a masterpiece, but I can tell that this movie, like most QT movies are going to be underrated and will lack in awards it deserves. I think Christopher Waltz should easily be a nominee. I think this movie should also win Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. But even if this incredible film doesn't get recognized in awards I can tell that it will go down as one of the best war movies ever made in history. I think its amazingly creative of QT not to follow the criteria that history gave him, he changes the actual history of the war with his characters. Pure Genius."

","The film was off to a firm start, with the whole interrogation scene acted well and believably, Setting the rest of the film up perfectly. Sadly, it all went downhill from there. The Second chapter was passable, but the third and forth are unnecessarily slow and dull. It is actually bad enough that you were relieved when chapter three ends, only to have to sit through another slow chapter straight after. This is all a shame, as the final chapter is very well executed, and a perfect finale to the film. Yes, I know it wasn't at all realistic, but come on people, this is Tarantino! However, it all comes down to the middle chapters, and I think if these had been reduced by about half, the film would be a 7-8, Yet it was not, and is therefore ultimately a disappointment."

Poor sarcasm and pretty shallow plot development are the most hurting parts of the movie which is giving you the hard time for two and a half hours!

It seemed to be saying if we treated the Germans more inhumanely we could have won the war sooner. Its portrayal of the Germany high command as stupid was silly. They were incredibly evil and definitely not stupid. I didn't mind the ending being different from history, but The Germans were not stupid, they would have never fallen into it. The only redeeming quality might have been that the Jews of WWII might have like seeing this ending taking place in real life no mater how unrealistic it was. The filming and acting were well done. I guess that is one reason the plot bothered me so much. I think with the talent that was available they could have produced a much better movie."
"phanatic1989","1","52","115","6 September 2009"," Grossly Hypocritical
","I went to see the movie because my boyfriend was raving about how much he wanted to see it, and how his friends had already been and loved it. So I came in with a neutral attitude, not really expecting the worst. Unfortunately, that is what I got. I could write a 15 page paper on why this is easily THE WORST movie I have ever seen. But for your benefit I will point out the pros and the endless supply of cons. To begin, the acting was very good, especially Christopher Waltz and Melanie Laurent. There were also a few lines that deserved a laugh, and a couple suspenseful scenes. Sadly, good acting, a little humor and suspense is where the good points end. The whole beginning story could have been great. A Jewish girl's family is butchered, she goes into hiding, later encounters the man responsible for her pain and then hatches a great plan for revenge. Sounds very good. But the movie wouldn't be quite as ""satisfying"" for the Americans and Jews craving Nazi blood. I have no problem with WWII movies or killing Nazis; I saw Defiance and like it very much. However, it's the way and attitude with which our would-be heroes kill. I'll give you a prime example of the kind of hypocrisy this movie oozes. Our hoodlum gang ambushes a German unit and kills/scalps all of them except a sergeant and two other soldiers (no problem so far). They ask the sergeant to divulge information on another German unit. When he ""respectfully refuses"" to betray the lives of his fellow soldiers they bash his head in a with a baseball bat, cheering, and swearing as if they were at a football game. They took that Nazi's head off yaaayy! Now let's look at the hypocrisy in that scene. Here's a hypothetical situation: a group of American soldiers are ambushed and taken captive by the enemy. The same scenario follows and the American commanding officer would rather die than betray his fellow soldier. The enemy bashes his head in with much celebration. This would infuriate an audience if this scene were in a movie. That American soldier was a hero for placing his men above himself, and those barbarians brutally murdered him! Wellwhat about the Nazi sergeant? Well he's a Nazi and deserves to die the cruelest death possible, right? Coincidentally, the Nazi's felt the same towards the Jews. See the hypocrisy? By celebrating the butcher of the Nazis we are placing ourselves on the same sadistic level. <br/><br/>Major hypocrisy #2: The Nazis make a propaganda movie about a German sniper who kills nearly 300 American soldiers. Near the end of the movie, the film is revealed. Hitler and his cohorts giggle with delight as they watch an American soldier get shot out of a window and fall into a fountain. The Nazis cheer as soldier after soldier falls to the snipers skill. This is supposed to enrage the American viewers of this scene. Those evil Nazis are laughing over the deaths of our brave men! Well the irony is, isn't that what we were doing (or supposed to be doing) the entire time we're watching Inglorious Basterds? Laughing over the pain of others simply because they were ""the bad guys."" How would we feel if Native Americans somehow made a hit film in which they reek bloody vengeance on the American settlers? Or what if blacks made a movie glorifying the Nat Turner Rebellion? OK enough about the hypocritical flaws. <br/><br/>I'll summarize other reasons for the 1 star rating. 1) There were view admirable characters throughout the movie. Brad Pitt even tortures a woman by sticking his finger in her gunshot wound because he suspects she betrayed him. He's the good guy? 2) Scenes dragged on way longer than they needed to. 3) Brad Pitt's southern, supposedly Tennessee accent is HORRIBLE and thoroughly annoying throughout the entire move. I'll quit now since I'm at 700 words. <br/><br/>Unfortunately it seems that the general population doesn't think anymore, they just want blood. And that is why this movie received such a high ranking. I recommend this movie for the ignorant or if you are Jewish and simply wanting to see a nice ""fantasy justice."" Personally, when I finally got out of the movie theater I felt like I had been scalped (or wish that I had so I wouldn't have suffered over 2 hours of mental rape)."

Is this entertainment? Is this what we watch to relax? Total crap. I stopped watching at that point. And we wonder why our kids are so violent, and why they go on killing rampages in school.

I'd rather watch an episode of Allo Allo for an insightful examination of wartime Europe than this turd of a movie. Tarantino, a triumph of style over substance. Just another vision of an American world view, can't wait to see him bring back the Vietnam war movie (no doubt with a cameo for Sly Stallone). P*** poor in every sense of the word POOR.

","I wish I could give this a zero. It's undeniable that Tarantino has some cinematic flair, though Jackie Brown is the only film of his I can tolerate. In this film he does create some interesting situations. But it's basically amoral trash that seeks to implicate the audience in its moronic inferno. It's the story-telling of someone who feels like an impressionable and highly unsophisticated adolescent. I can't really work my way into the world that Tarantino inhabits... His aesthetic is that of someone who has never lived, like some brilliant but tragically retarded child who has been deprived of humanity, locked alone in some film vault that happens to be filled with the best bad films ever made. The result is a series painstaking homages to exquisite awfulness. This film in particular is reprehensibly stupid and lacking in the basic human qualities that separate civilized people from the oh-so-evil Nazis. A fantasy orgy of revenge violence to what end? How is an audience that could enjoy a film like this any better than the people it parodies and so delights in tormenting?"

But the star clearly is Christoph Waltz, who not only speaks 4 languages brilliantly, but is up for an Oscar in his role as sweet, yet vicious ""Jew hunter"". Would Jews feel happy about this movie of REVENGE? I don't think so. Tarantino said before hand that this, his, movie will be the mother of all war movies. Clearly it is not. As always it is glorifying violence and thinking all conversation between men is amusing. Well.... He should have at least made sure, Pitt doesn't stumble over his own words constantly trying to get the Southern accent right. And why was Churchill (nice one there by Rod Taylor) sitting in a room clearly done in Hitler style fascist architecture? And the Paris cinema was really too much just Babelsberg film studios. And in an Indian newspaper I read that Basterds is spelled wrong because that is how Germans would pronounce it. Another big mistakes, Bastards!"
"eddie052010","6","5","7","19 March 2015"," A slight return to form for Tarantino, but there are still problems.
","Quentin Tarantino. While the majority of people would tell you that he is a genius filmmaker who hasn't one bad film to his name, there is a small, but vocal minority who will tell you that while he is talented, he hasn't made anything fantastic for a while. Sure, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are masterpieces and Jackie Brown is his most mature work, but his other work has been deeply disappointing to say the least. The Kill Bill movies were self- indulgent, badly written and overly sadistic, and Death Proof was just boring. So would Inglourious Basterds be a late return to form? Well, while good, it doesn't present Tarantino at his best, and the film is still problematic as a whole.<br/><br/>The story is that during their occupation of France, the Nazis premiere a propaganda film at a theater to celebrate their achievements. When this is found out, many use this as a plan to kill the Nazis once and for all, including the British army, the theater's owner Shoshanna who has a vendetta against the Nazis and a group known as the Basterds, a bunch of American Jews who have traveled to France in order to kill Nazis. <br/><br/>While the plot is non-linear like Tarantino's other films, it suffers from the fact that there is a lot of pointless material in the film. Many characters who have no effect on the story are killed off, some scenes go on for way too long & some of the protagonists are deeply unlikable. This mainly implies to the Basterds themselves, who despite their cause, are portrayed as sadistic psychopaths who kill and torture many Nazis, despite some of the Nazis having legitimate grievances (i.e. having a child, keeping quiet to protect their fellow men). I'm not expecting a film like this to portray Nazis with Downfall-esque sympathy, but considering that most of the Nazis in the film are shown to be more human than in other films, the constant sadism feels unnecessary, and you can't help but feel that the Basterds are no better than the Nazis themselves.<br/><br/>The film's sadism is a major problem. Tarantino has a weird love for extreme violence, which would be fine provided that this was a more tongue in cheek context, but considering that the movie has a mostly straight face, you can't help but feel that the movie goes too far in places. This includes cutting the scalps off Nazis, beating them to death with baseball bats, torturing an innocent witness by sticking their fingers into a bullet wound and seeing someone get strangled to death, made even more disturbing by how it is partially real (Tarantino actually strangled one of his actresses to make the film look more real). Lovely. <br/><br/>It's a shame that the film is bogged down by being overly long and overly sadistic, as there is some great stuff in there. As many others have pointed out, the opening scene is brilliant. Great acting, dialogue, cinematography and pacing. It's also a perfect example of how Tarantino should use his unique brand of dialogue, to be quirky and advance the story, instead of using it to ramble. It's definitely the best scene in the film, and continues 2009's tradition of having great opening scenes (i.e. Watchmen, Up) in films. <br/><br/>On top of this, some of the characters are very well done. Shoshanna is the best character in the film, being the most three-dimensional and interesting, and her story arc in the film is the most compelling because of it, essentially being the brilliant female revenge story that Kill Bill should have been. You just wish the whole movie was focused on her, but still, her scenes are where the film reaches its peak, and Melanie Laurent delivers one of the best (and sadly underrated) performances in recent memory. It's also a very well- made film. The cinematography is gorgeous, the sets and production design are well done, and the acting is very good from everybody, even though I feel that some are wasted, mainly that of Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz, the latter of whom does the absolute best with a weak character. If you want to see him at his best, watch The Zero Theorem instead. <br/><br/>It's because of these things that I feel that while Inglourious Basterds is a slight return to form for Tarantino, it's still dragged down by many of Tarantino's usual faults. From the overly sadistic violence of the film, to the overlong running time, to the self-indulgent touches to the film (i.e. having a Mike Myers cameo, or Samuel L. Jackson as a narrator, clearly his easiest paycheck yet), the film's positive attributes, while present, are still balanced out by the film's many faults. It's definitely a step forward, but there's still some work to be done."
"t_atzmueller","4","15","28","20 October 2010"," Christoph Waltz - an Oscar performance within a pile!
","It's a useless thing to post a review on a movie that already has more than a thousand reviews on IMDb. But the division between people who loved it and those who hated it is rather fascinating so I'll add my two cents.<br/><br/>I'm a person who's of the later opinion. I just don't like Tarantino and his way of making an ""homage"" to me just seems like a cheap way of stealing stuff, that's not known or obscure at best for a mainstream audience but insults the true fan.<br/><br/>I'm also a fan of 'alternate realities'-story lines (I recommend Ian McKellen in ""Richard III"", taking the age-old Shakespeare play into the time of WW2) and not necessarily too concerned with historic accuracy. In my mind, one could have done something with the story of ""Inglorious Basterds"" but what ruins it in this film is the horrible acting.<br/><br/>Not even talking about Brad Pitt hamming it up like it really was a real grind house film but what in the heavens could have provoked any director to put Eli Roth in front of a camera? I realise that there isn't much real acting involved in a homage to exploitation flicks but at least a little charisma, a little character for an protagonist in a mainstream movie – is that too much to ask for? We now move on to the German imports: Till Schweiger, Daniel Brühl and Gedeon Burkhard. Schweiger divides the audience in Germany. He's by fans depicted as the Ben Affleck of German cinemas; by adversaries he's considered as a German version of Ben Affleck who's performance is annoying but who can produce a sellable love comedy during Summer. Brühl is another actor who leaves critics divided. 'A great talent in the making', say some; 'an actor with a steady repertoire of four facial expressions', say the others (three of which are featured in ""Inglorious Basterds"". And of course Burkhard, prior to ""Inglorious Basterds"" a regular in many-a daily soap-opera that are geared toward pensioners and the unemployed. The rest of the cast is relatively unknown to me and I'm relative grateful for that. And, adding insult to injury for hammy acting and lazy direction: the caricature of Hitler and his regime, just a few years after an audience has applauded the performances of Bruno Ganz and others in ""Der Untergang"".<br/><br/>I give this film four stars  no, I give the actor Christoph Waltz four stars. And another Oscar  because he deserves it. Skills and a presence that rivals performances of contemporary roles like Heath Ledger as the Joker or Javier Badem in movies like ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""The Sea Inside"". That's the fascinating aspect about the movie: putting up 1st class actors against 2nd and 3rd rate: the result is ""Inglorious Basterds""."
"tain-5","3","15","28","27 September 2009"," Canned cheese
","Straight from the can. It combines the historical accuracy and realism of 300 with the premise of The Dirty Dozen. It's pulp fiction, true, but is it intentional kitsch. Having watched it, I thought it might have been but after I read an interview with Tarantino, I changed my mind.<br/><br/>It taps into that primeval want for doing bad things to people we don't like. Revenge, don't think so, well, maybe in case of the girl but she's not the audience, she's not even a basterd. Justice, not exactly that either, it's not a court in there and it's done from a contemporary and utterly simplified point of view. It does however provide a relief for that sense of powerlessness you might experience when confronted with ""the heavy stuff"", that is if you are ignorant enough to be able to talk yourself into it. And in the end, those cheers don't change anything or make you one of the ""good guys"".<br/><br/>I found the audiences reactions to be more amusing than the movie itself. Take the reactions people had to the scalping or ""batting"" scenes. On one hand the disgust and shock of some of the more sensitive of our brothers and sisters out there, just as highly emotional as the joy and bewilderment some of our domesticated animals have experienced. To be honest, the volume of graphic violence was rather small. Just a few rather short scenes in between all that talking and talking, French, German, Italian.<br/><br/>Getting to the one redeeming feature of the movie that I've managed to find, unintentional as it might have been, it made thousands of testosterone laden juveniles read subtitles. I find that hilarious.<br/><br/>How about this for a tag line: This is what the play from The Producers would have looked like had Germany won the war.<br/><br/>As a pulp violence showcase it's lackluster and as a serious war movie it's script is just ridiculous and mediocre, so except for the stylization and technical aspects, what's exactly supposed to be the movies appeal."
"Turfseer","5","15","28","31 August 2009"," Tarrantino shoots himself in the foot as 'Basterds' devolves into puerile wish fulfillment fantasy
","Inglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarrantino's homage to the entertaining World War II action films of the 60s and 70s. Of all such films, 'Basterds' mostly resembles the highly entertaining ""The Dirty Dozen"". In 'Chapter 1' (unquestionably the best scene in the movie), Tarrantino raises his 'Dirty Dozen' to a higher plane. In his World War II epic, the Nazis' hatred of the Jews is not ignored (unlike these earlier action films). At the outset, Tarrantino's SS man, Landa, is wholly believable as the charming sadist who ends up murdering a Jewish family hidden under the floorboards of a French dairy farmer's home. Like many of the scenes in the film, the opening scene is dialogue heavy but the tension is so palpable that one sits engrossed until the scene's brutal and harrowing outcome.<br/><br/>The reason why 'The Dirty Dozen' was so entertaining was that each convict 'misfit' had a distinct and extremely interesting personality. Tarrantino doesn't bother to develop any of his basterds as fleshed out people. Instead, all they can do is scalp Nazis or as one of them does (the so-called 'Bear Jew') beats Nazi brains out with a baseball bat. What's more, Tarrantino doesn't bother showing how they develop as a team and how they overcome obstacles leading to their reputation as professional killers. Instead, they're plopped down in occupied France and meet no real resistance. The whole charm of 'The Dirty Dozen' was that that they had to overcome not only the external obstacles of fighting the Nazis but deal with their own internal strife. In short, they were fairly plausible, believable characters. Not so with Tarrantino's group who are not only unbelievable but unsympathetic (they're as sadistic as their Nazi opponents).<br/><br/>The problem with Tarrantino's narrative is that it gradually becomes more and more implausible and incoherent. I was willing to suspend my disbelief when Shoshanna, the Jewish girl, escapes while Landa murders her family (did his gun jam?) but how does she become the owner of a movie theater a few years later? Wouldn't the Nazis have uncovered her Jewish heritage? Tarrantino's portrait of Goebbals as a dilettante in the world of German cinema rang true but I question the assertion that he was the #2 man (next to Hitler) in the Nazi hierarchy (certainly Bormann, Heydrich and Goring had a lot more power).<br/><br/>Visually, it was a nice touch in showing Hitler with an unflattering complexion as well as making fun of his out of control temper; but to reduce Hitler to a complete buffoon while other Nazi characters are quite believably scary, makes no sense whatsoever. Hitler, after all, was the brains behind the operation.<br/><br/>Tarrantino does serve up some juicy characters which were highly entertaining. I liked Pvt. Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) as he first appears to be a harmless, lovesick puppy dog, enamored with our Jewish cinema owner and actually exudes modesty despite having become a war hero and accidental movie star. And it makes perfect sense for him to morph into a sadistic stalker on the verge of rape when he shows his 'true colors' after confronting Shoshanna in the projection booth. In some ways, Zoller is more sinister than Landa.<br/><br/>Kudos also to Diane Kruger as Bridget Hammersmark, the movie actress who's also a double agent. Despite its unpleasantness, the scene of Kruger's demise at the hands of the sadistic Landa pulls you in. Perhaps the best character in the movie is Major Dieter Hellstrom, played by the brilliant August Diehl, who ends up exposing Michael Fassbender's film critic turned spy in the basement tavern face-off. The way Tarrantino has the diabolical Major deduce it's 'King Kong' during the card game is utterly brilliant. Through Hellstrom's 'deduction', Tarrantino demonstrates that he has a profound understanding of the sinister nature of Nazi politics and ideology.<br/><br/>Tarrantino, however, shoots himself in the foot in the final third of the movie. The Basterds are supposed to be a crackerjack professional outfit but allow themselves to be easily apprehended at the film premiere because no one speaks any languages except English. And despite Hitler showing up at the premiere, there's absolutely no security (Shoshanna's black lover who plans to set fire to the building has free rein to walk around without being stopped once). In Tarrantino's warped universe, he somehow feels some kind of perverse satisfaction in having Shoshanna laugh at the Nazis as they are being burned to a crisp in an on screen rant. <br/><br/>Finally, what really killed the film for me was the denouement where the sinister and charming Landa suddenly becomes a blithering idiot by offering to surrender to the Allies after allowing the Basterds' bomb plot to proceed. How could the ""Hangman"" of Occupied France suddenly deceive himself into believing that Lt. Aldo Raine, the notorious Nazi killer, would agree to his ludicrous demands and then keep his word?<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds contains a plethora of clever references to the history of cinema. Many of the scenes are overlong and talky but the dialogue is always crisp and never boring. Tarrantino's characters are a mixed bag—he's much more successful with his Nazi antagonists than his American protagonists. Particularly disappointing is Brad Pitt who has little to do except practice a Southern accent. With the exception of Hitler and SS Landa's final scenes, Tarrantino does a credible job of humanizing his Nazis. That doesn't mean he approves of them but it shows he knows what makes them tick. <br/><br/>Tarrantino should have consulted with Daniel Mendelsohn before making his mad revenge fantasy. Mendelsohn, writing in Newsweek, gets it right: ""An alternative, and morally superior, form of ""revenge"" for Jews would be to do precisely what Jews have been doing since World War II ended: that is, to preserve and perpetuate the memory of the destruction that was visited upon them, precisely in order to help prevent the recurrence of such mass horrors in the future."""
"christhjian","4","9","15","7 February 2011"," Pretty weak
","This was definitely one of the weakest films by Tarantino. And there was a simple reason why.<br/><br/>He chose too serious and dramatic topic for his style. Yes, it fitted perfectly for Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs but to rape World War II in that way is a bit too much. <br/><br/>First scene was very promising when the Nazi was explaining the French man why Nazi regime hates Jews. Secondly we were introduced to Inglorious Basterds. The group of brutal Jews killing Nazis. First I thought it was a fine idea but later it got pretty tiring.<br/><br/>Then everything started to go downwards. Too long table scene showed the Jew girl Emanuelle who had escaped in the beginning from Nazis thinking about showing the great Nazi movie in her cinema. Afterwards another very long and weak table scene came by which ended with shooting.<br/><br/>And then the finale where Emanuelle let her lover burn down the Nazis filled cinema including Adolf. <br/><br/>Some big mistakes were that the table scenes and empty discussions were awful. They didn't lead nowhere. History rewriting in such a way wasn't believable as well. All great Nazis including Hitler were killed in a movie theater. And finally of course Tarantino's jokes which for me have been usually fine but put in such a plot wentjust too far.<br/><br/>Still, if you can put it up you may enjoy this film. I wouldn't say it was a complete waste of time but Tarantino crossed the line from where it got controversial for even myself. <br/><br/>More on the plus site there was some fine acting, some laughs and overall interesting point of view. <br/><br/>So let's just say below average, don't expect it to be Pulp Fiction.. 4/10"
"dowsett1999","3","9","15","18 July 2010"," If you like blood and gore but lack intelligence this is for you!
","Violence for the sake of violence.<br/><br/>The film is a history re-write of World War 2. Does this mean that the plot is an exciting unknown which explores what could have happened if only....No!Its a re-write so nobody had to get off their ass and do some research. The plot is very simple and boring. You are made aware of what the plot is very early on in the film and basically have to wait ages for it to happen.<br/><br/>The film is compartmentalised into chapters. In doing this Quentin Tarintino is either being lazy, or is unable to make a ""fluid"" story. Each chapter/block doesn't quite line up with the one before it, which has the effect of creating a jerky storyline. A bit like a TV programme with advert-breaks in the middle of it. <br/><br/>There is a lot (most of the film in fact) of talking that has nothing to do with the progression of either the story or any character development. Whilst slightly entertaining you do get the feeling that it was just there to pad-out the film. <br/><br/>Its the sort of movie that, if you allow it, will grip you initially and pull you in for a bit, but then if you have any sort of intelligence you will suddenly snap out of it and say to yourself hang on a minute, WHY this, why that, why didn't they just, well that wouldn't happen. No one would do that! etc etc.<br/><br/>*************************SPOILERS****************************<br/><br/>There is a bar scene that lasts most of the film and adds NOTHING to the films story. What this bar-scene does do is get the two ex-Nazis and the British officer killed. You would think that the German ex-Nazis(now allies) would tell the British officer that his accent was a bit weird wouldn't you? Why was the British officer there at all? BOTH of the German Ex-Nazis would be far too valuable to jeopardise as well as the British officer as they were the only three that could speak German in the entire group.<br/><br/>A Jewish person owns a cinema. All of the Top Nazi military-brass including Hitler attend this cinema in order to watch a film of a Nazi-sniper killing 300 allied personnel. Rather unrealistic that the sniper managed to kill 300 people in three days whilst being so exposed. In addition it is also unrealistic that they were making such films during the war. further more it is also unrealistic that all of the Nazi top-brass would meet at such a vulnerable place with just two, yes, just two guards with machine-guns. The Cinema wasn't checked for explosives and none of the additional guests were checked or vetted. Indeed, neither was the Cinema owner.<br/><br/>The remaining ""Basterds"" with explosives strapped to their legs attend the Premier of this film with a German-speaking actress who is an allied spy. Due to the fact that none of the ""basterds"" speak German they decide to pretend to be Italian, because, apparently, Germans can't recognise an Italian accent, or lack of one. At the Cinema Brad Pitts character has to engage in conversation with a German officer. (Now remember that they are trying to be Italian)Brad Pitts character lets forth the strongest American accent ever,even for an American! let a lone for a so called Italian. He should have been shot on sight. (I think Germans, particularly an officer would recognise an American accent).<br/><br/>The thing I struggle with is why didn't just one or two Allied people meet with the cinema owner and rig the place with explosives? Why attend the premier at all? Especially if you can't speak the language. Talk about taking chances in ruining the mission. Why did they have to be suicide bombers? Why did the doors to the cinema bolt from the outside? Why did the Jewish person let that annoying Nazi into the projection room? you wouldn't do that! Your mind would be on the mission. I don't remember any communication between the cinema owner and the ""Basterds"".<br/><br/>This film could be edited to be under an hour in length. The Jewish cinema owner did a better job of killing the Nazis than the stupid ""Inglourious Basterds"". All the ""Basterds"" did was create a blood-bath and start shooting to bits Nazis that where going to die soon anyway. I am surprised Tarantino didn't make the cinema seats white to show the blood up more.<br/><br/>The Story/Plot is VERY BAD. The acting by some of the cast is VERY GOOD.<br/><br/>The ""acting"" by Brad Pitt is VERY BAD. He is charismatic in most of the films he does but unless he plays an American he is hopeless as he can't do accents at all (apart from a mumbling drunk Irish man in snatch). <br/><br/>The only good thing about this film as far as I was concerned was that the English-speakers spoke English, the Germans spoke German and the French spoke French. None of this all American nonsense where everyone sounds the same. (The language is important in most war movies because if an allied character can't speak it/understand it, or if they don't sound right, they get killed. It adds to the tension and suspense)."

","First of all, I am really an admirer of early Tarantino movies. I strongly suggest that everyone who didn't watch ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" do so. No lack of violence there also. Rest of his movies could easily be skipped although ""Kill Bill"" has some moments. This is my first review here and I am writing it because I am so disappointed in the movie and in the direction this author is going. I suppose the great reviews and rating of this movie is caused by new generation of movie goers admiration of pure gore and exaggeration. There is definitely not much left from the original artistic freshness and mastery in somewhat artificial (deliberately) but certainly intelligent and fluent Tarantino style dialogue.

","I saw the trailer and thought this movie would be fun. I knew I was in trouble at the opening scene where the visiting Nazi has a long chat with the farmer. I'd say 90% of this movie is long irrelevant chats in restaurants and other rooms. I mean who cares? This was advertised as a fun action-packed war movie about crazy guys that kill Nazis. Instead you get a snooze fest. <br/><br/>Every now and then I'd think ""OK now we're going to get to the good stuff. He's been torturing us so we'll really enjoy the good stuff"". But you know what? There was no good stuff. Sure there was a few war porn moments, but nothing that got me really engaged in the flick.<br/><br/>Gratuitous violence is part of a Tarantino movie experience. So I was not surprised to see it. But somehow it just seemed adolescent. It added nothing to the story. The military does have a command structure and they don't let their soldiers carve people up like a Thanksgiving goose for fun. This was the 2nd World War where the Allies were actually good guys.<br/><br/>I must admit after seeing numerous Hitler parodies on YouTube I'm rather spoiled. Every actor that plays Hitler must measure up to the YouTube parody version. This one does not. <br/><br/>And the ending - f'ing retarded. Like a frustrated cinema owner could bring down the entire Third Reich. The thing is so full of holes you'd think the Nazis were complete amateurs that couldn't guard an outhouse."
"david-phillips-4","5","14","26","22 September 2009"," Tarantino's World War II movie - I don't get it.
","The opening to the film is exquisitely shot. It carries a fantastic level of suspense and emotion that made me think that we were in the realms of greatness. I was misled. If anything, the opening to the film is the film's peak and everything subsequently meanders down hill. The story of the film, as put out in the media is of a rag tag bunch of men led by Brad Pitt on a marauding crusade into enemy territory with the sole purpose of killing as many Nazis as gruesomely as possible. And the film is, in part, about that. But there is a much more interesting story of revenge that begins in that very first sequence that I didn't feel was adequately explored, as it somehow became second fiddle to the Basterds of the title. I guess Tarantino has his pick of people to work with and that, it seems, may be his downfall. There is no doubting that in Christoph Waltz, he has unearthed a gem, but that is far outweighed by the bizarre turn of Brad Pitt and needless cameos. For some reason Brad Pitt plays his character with a conscious under bite, by which I mean it only seems to appear when he thinks about it needing to be there. Where Pitt's good friend George Clooney can excel in the screwball characterisation as a wannabe Clark Gable, Pitt flows and crashes and burns badly. Mike Myers appears in a pointless cameo and the use of Eli Roth seems questionable at best. All of this lends the film a boy's club smugness in the same way that the Ocean films seem more like a gas for the stars than the audience. So, it comes across as a big laugh-in for the actors, all, except the European trio of Waltz, Bruhl and Laurent, mugging to camera in what seems like an effort to get laughs. The dark humour and snappy dialogue of Tarantino's early movies has gone. To be replaced by laboured dialogue in the style of Tarantino – something we saw enough of in the 90s with the numerous Tarantino-esquire efforts. It felt much like a film student in the late 90's, wishing to be the next Tarantino, has gone a bit too far for his student film in trying to include snappy dialogue unrelated to the screen imageryexcept this is Tarantino and it no student movie. The film also produces too many nods to Tarantino nerds (if they even exist) with the shootout where you're not sure how everyone got shot to the use of Harvey Keitel and Samuel L Jackson as voice cameos and the endless ""all the characters looking down to the camera"" shots that would have once made it new and exciting. It now seems a little tired and is definitely too self-congratulatory. At times the film is beautiful to watch. The cinematography is immense and one thing Tarantino does still manage to do to a high standard is choose his music well. The film covers a range of music that is often used in other film first, but does not look out of place here. The audience, however, seemed to be tuned into the humour and the style much more than me. There were laughs and guffaws as Pitt stuck out his chin and I had the general feeling that everyone was really enjoying the show. So, perhaps it was me. Perhaps I was not in the mood for it or perhaps I just didn't get it. But from the opening sequence that, to me, showed so much promise and, more importantly, showed what Tarantino is capable of, the rest became a damp squib (many of which were used throughout, as you can imagine)."
"kensalman","8","42","93","3 August 2009"," War has never been so much fun
","Inglourious Basterds is a funny, bold and very well-acted tale about a group of Jewish-American soldiers targeting Nazis in France during World War II. I'd say it's easily Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction, and contains his trademark mix of serious violence, off-key comedy, and hair-raising drama.<br/><br/>It's also fuelled by Tarantino's favourite theme of revenge. The central characters are the highlight, and very well drawn; particularly the German Colonel Hans Landa, who's a mix of Hans Gruber and Dr, Evil. Equally standout is Brad Pitt's no nonsense Lt. Aldo Raine replete with thick southern accent, whose deadpan humour and stoicism run-up nicely against the film's macabre tone.<br/><br/>It's a long and dialogue-heavy film and some scenes run well beyond modern cinematic time norms, echoing the pace of 70s classics such as The Dirty Dozen or Bridge Over The River Kwai. It's also divided up into sequential chapters separating out characters' lives, but tells a story in a coherent way Kill Bill didn't.<br/><br/>There are a couple of scenes that are very long (particularly the basement rendezvous set-up) but they sort of torture with their tension and you remain hooked in. At times Inglourious Basterds is very violent and comically so, and that will turn some people off. It's also sort of flippant about serious themes (in the same way Guy Ritchie treats his subjects) and that might also bother some. Personally I laughed at the outrageous breaking of taboos and remixing of history and so did the audience. Tarantino shows in this film how much mastery he has in the difficult job of mixing the grotesque and the comedic.<br/><br/>There are also some nice, wry post-modern touches such as a film critic being recruited as an assassin. In Inglorious Basterds he does what he does best – great characters in extreme environments doing mad things in a funny and violent fashion Finally, the ending is excellent. Masterpiece indeed. I'd happily watch it again.<br/><br/>This was shown as a preview in London and Tarantino did a Q&A afterwards."

The inclusion of Mike Myers as an actor doing a serious role was truly laughable in and of itself. The fact that some US soldier liked to carve swastikas into German soldiers heads is something that I have never heard before and I have heard all kinds of WW2 stories. Well, big deal on that anyway, I could imagine lots of worse things to do to German soldiers in WW2 than giving them improvised tattoos and hitting them with baseball bats. The portrayal of Adolf Hitler as funny man and also the portrayal of Joseph Goebels as funny man treads a fine line dipping into the and of ass jokes with remarkable ease, showing a bit of true bad taste on the part of the film maker. Whats next-pratfall jokes with Joseph Stalin?, who by the way, killed 27 million people, out doing Hitler's period of distemper by quite a few more million dead persons. Boo hiss on this flap doodle. Only good bit is when two guys gets their testes shot off in a bar scene-and not a vampire in sight.I honestly think this film does not contribute to the body of work that deals with WW2.

","Note: this comment was edited to meet IMDb length guidelines.<br/><br/>I first saw ""Inglourious Basterds"" in late July and concluded that it would flop and Tarantino would never again be relevant. Needless to say, I didn't like it and didn't even expect to see it again. Late August and Tarantino certainly seems relevant again. His biggest opening at the box office, rapturous media reviews, and a surprising amount of hype. Word of mouth is excellent. It remains to be seen how steady the movie's box office performance will be, but after the tepid reception at Cannes, the movie proved an unlikely hit. Two viewings later and ""Inglourious Basterds"" is probably my favorite movie of the year.<br/><br/>Why I initially reacted the way I did is increasingly mysterious to me, was it expectations of a men-on-a-mission film unfulfilled, the then seemingly tedious and over-written verbal jousts? Consciously or subconsciously, I didn't want to like the movie. I tutted at the glee with which the movie portrayed the violence the basterds inflicted. I resisted the charm of the film's construct, acknowledging that it was more than I expected it to be while at the same time lamenting Tarantino's juvenile and silly handling of such serious subject matter.<br/><br/>The truth, which has been revealed to me by two further viewings of the film, is that ""Inglourious Basterds"" might very well be Tarantino's greatest film, eclipsing even his most mature work to date ""Jackie Brown"". This is a glorious subversion of the dreary holocaust drama, a Spaghetti Western with WWII iconography, a love letter to the movies, and it is, every step of the way, aware of exactly what it's doing. In the end it basically comes down to personal opinion on whether this was a success or not, but what seems plainly obvious to me is that there is absolutely nothing about this film that is clumsy. The time and care taken with the screenplay is obvious, as is the time taken to edit the film. The Cannes cut wasn't longer, but it was apparently different in construct and differently-woven. When we're talking about a movie which depends entirely on: a) tension built through dialogue and character interaction, and b) the pacing of those scenes and how the scenes fit together, this could explain the significant difference between the reception at Cannes and the critical reception upon actual release.<br/><br/>The performance of the cast collectively is probably the most obviously praise-worthy aspect of the film. The Basterds are lovable and humorous, but also portray just the right amount of savagery to make it clear that what they're doing isn't child's play, and Brad Pitt is a standout as Aldo Raine, giving a fun comic performance but also creating perhaps the most sympathetic character in the film outside Melanie Laurent, whose Shosanna Dreyfus is the emotional core of the film. She also feels more like a film character than a real person, something Tarantino is aware of, as she is written as a classical tragic hero, complete with a deliberately clichéd romance and a climax to her story which really sums up everything this movie is about in its self-aware artifice and theatrical grandeur. Diane Kruger impresses as Bridget von Hammersmark, despite being given the tricky job of playing an actress. Undoubtedly the performance of the film, of the year, is Christoph Waltz's Hans Landa. It's perfect. It's exactly what it needed to be, and the wrong actor in that role would have destroyed the film.<br/><br/>In Tarantino's own words, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is about the power of cinema bringing down the Third Reich. An even better description would be the power of words challenging the power of violence. Intentionally or not, that is one of the most interesting parallels drawn in ""Inglourious Basterds"". In more than one scene verbal battles turn into violence, but in as many scenes the threat of violence is kept at bay by the power of words and acting, a major component of cinema. Tarantino's wordplay here isn't just characters saying cool stuff to one another, it's the entire language of the movie, the weapon of choice for his characters. Many say Tarantino should write plays if he's just going to have characters talk to each other for ages, but that wouldn't make sense because he delights as much in the conversation and his actors' performance as he does in their context in his film, and his films always feature the cinematic, except for ""Reservoir Dogs"".<br/><br/>""Inglourious Basterds"" is all about the cinema, and where the movie references in ""Kill Bill"" were part of a pastiche of B-movie cinema, ""Inglourious Basterds"" works the references seamlessly into a genuinely involving story, albeit one with a healthy dose of silliness and dark humor. Where I initially thought Tarantino failed most significantly was where he succeeded most greatly: in his attempt to create a grand love letter to the power of cinema. Tarantino proves literate in more than just junk film here- for all the allusions to macaroni combat films and spaghetti westerns, it's ultimately a gonzo celebration of high art. The entire film is burlesque in nature, best seen as a deliberately artificial cinematic recreation of WWII rather than straightforwardly as a WWII war film of any nature.<br/><br/>More than any of his other movies, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is about cinema. It's not just subtext, it's the reality of the film which is so tied to the world of cinema. The film may be total fantasy, and it has no qualms about depicting the cathartic power of violence, but it's ultimately taut, tense, entertaining, funny, and most importantly sort of beautiful in its own grandiose, bizarre manner. As Aldo declares his final act of brutality in the film his masterpiece, Tarantino seems to be declaring this film his own. Call it kosher porn, call it whatever you like, what I ultimately see this as is a tribute to cinephilia made with far more heart than I expected."

But his love of movies also shows in the way he works with classic ideas and great visual strategies that come from decades of the best of Hollywood. The very first scene is like a remake from some classic Western--John Ford or Sergio Leone, take your pick--with the isolated family seeing trouble coming in, ever so gradually, from the far distance.<br/><br/>And then trouble arrives, and it unfolds here like a croissant in the morning sun, steam slowly rising into the French Provincial air. This, you'll see, or you know already, is film-making at its best, old-school or new-school, it doesn't matter. The suspense, the elegant and fluid camera-work, the astonishing writing and even more astonishing delivery by the two men at this very first juncture, playing a kind of ""I know what you are thinking"" kind of game, all drawn out in a breathtaking, poetic, nerve-wracking way.<br/><br/>Then all hell breaks loose. This is the other side of Tarantino, the violent violence, where the blood is too red and too balletic to be real. I don't have the ability to step out of this kind of on screen gore and so it shocks me every time, and it seems like the movie might work just as well (or better) with implied violence, rather than splattering it in your face. But this director, I think, sees all of it from a director's point of view--that everything is artifice, including the preceding scene with the two men, where I, for one, was impressed partly by believing it, by being completely sucked in. Which makes the offputting violence that follows all the more upending.<br/><br/>I have no doubt it is this push-pull effect that makes all of Tarantino's films have that energy few others can match. In this case, there is a lot of plain old fun built into seeing the bad guys get what they deserve (I felt a weird pleasure, which I confess and which I don't understand, in seeing one very particular bad guy shot to pieces near the end), and a lot of suspense as you root for the unlikely heroes. The archetypes, like Brad Pitt's good bad guy role with a Kentucky accent (better than your Italian, Brad), and the more original characters, like the young woman who owns the theater and is truly trapped by circumstances, equally make their scenes larger than life. <br/><br/>In fact, Inglourious Basterds is pure Hollywood in the way it makes everything on the screen larger than life. Isn't that what the golden age of Hollywood was all about? Yes. And it is exactly what some directors like Tarantino are still bent on pulling off. A great film. Whatever the problems and the gore, this strikes me as a perfect film the way Fargo is perfect, or Reservoir Dogs. Tastes aside, you have to see it."
"pefrss","3","44","100","24 August 2009"," Applauding to violence
","I usually avoid movies with violence. I went to see this film because I speak French and German and I was curious about the angle of the Jews getting revenge.<br/><br/>What a disappointment! If revenge is being as cruel as the Nazis, what is the point. Half of the movie I could not watch because of all the blood and violence. Human beings should come up with better solutions. After all we should by now be a little bit more sophisticated than the primitive men who clubbed each other over the head. But obviously not. There was constant laughter and applause for the violent scenes in this movie. I am ashamed for my fellow human beings.<br/><br/>I gave the movie three points because of the fact that the dialogue was in the original languages and some of the acting was good. I regret having spent the money on that film."
"Prichards12345","6","12","22","29 August 2010"," Slow and often stupid, but with some good acting
","Tarantino has produced a movie that is something of a curio, a would-be action movie without much action, long stretches of dialogue which sometimes work and other times merely bore, and acting which ranges from brilliant to terrible.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt, the leader of the Nazi hunters, is a cross between Ged Clampitt and Bruce Forsyth! He is bloody awful. Christopher Waltz, who plays Eric Lander, an SS ""Jew Hunter"" is terrific though, as is Melanie Laurent who coveys a wide range of emotions while saying little. Haven't a clue what Mike Myers was doing in the film; cod British accents are fine for comedy; here he was just crap. <br/><br/>The movie does have a long but excellent opening scene and a great last 30 minutes, problem is it takes too long to shift gears - the cellar scene in the bar is overlong and pretty stupid - crack behind enemy lines troops agree to meet in a cellar full of German soldiers???? Tarantino even brings up the stupidity several times but never answers it - why not just meet in a park or a hotel or something? Answer of course is so Tarantino can do a Mexican standoff...where the only survivor is someone who's vital to the plan. Yeah, right. Our crack team are actually extremely thick, as they leave evidence around all pointing to her as an enemy agent, and then come up with an explanation for the plaster cast which is so stupid the guy who wrote Springtime For Hitler would have seen through it. Would never have happened in Richard Burton's day!<br/><br/>I liked the fact that they actually kill Hitler et al! Although two guards for the German High Command in occupied France which has been invaded by the allies is a bit weak. It's strange that the film seems to go out of the way to avoid action while containing much off the cuff violence; and seriously under-develops the basterds, while lots of time is given over to more minor characters. I liked the German sharpshooter, though, and overall a good film - just not as good as Tarantino can be. A two out of four stars movie for me."
"Panaluke","5","12","22","3 July 2010"," Inglorious indeed
","I didn't see Inglourious Basterds when it came out first. After the huge hype it received, I did decide to give it a shot, and ordered it on demand. What can I tell you, I was really disappointed. Yes, the movie was fun in some parts, but mostly just boring and superficial. I talked my girlfriend in to watching the movie with me. She felt asleep after the first hour... Can't blame her. <br/><br/>I applaud Tarantinos approach, making a wild west style WW2 movie. The music and certain shots created an interesting ambiance. Very enjoyable was also Christoph Waltz' acting. That said, I don't have more positive things to share about this movie. <br/><br/>The rest was as mentioned very superficial, unrealistic, and in certain scenes just plainly boring. Other reviews have mentioned the ""table talks"". Seriously, there were scenes where I was like ""are you kidding me?"". I felt like a kid, waiting for the grown-ups to finish talking. Of course as a kid I didn't have a remote control with a fast-forward button..<br/><br/>Would I watch this movie again? Absolutely not. Would I recommend it to anybody else? Not really. But seeing the rating it gets here on IMDb, maybe thats just me.... So go ahead, give it a try and make your own judgment. But don't say I didn't warn you."
"foshtalicska","3","12","22","7 December 2009"," It's OK, but nothing special
","First of all, the movie portrays this ""jewish dirty dozen"" as anti-heroes, they're just a bunch of stupid psychos, who deserve to die, and i felt no sympathy whatsoever when they were slaughtered. On the other hand, the Nazis are portrayed as heroes, they are highly intelligent, brave and more human than the bastards. Although there are some pretty well developed characters and good acting in this movie, the script is just plain stupid. (What's the chance of a french dairy farmer speaking English in 1941? Give me a break.) It is as complicated as a Disney movie, and the story is very predictable. The conversations are too long and mainly pointless, just as the whole movie. Oh, and how was the main Nazi character punished by carving a swastika onto his forehead? Come on. We're talking about 1945, Americans were still hating, categorizing and discriminating people based on their color and ethnicity. If he had moved to Mississippi and wanted to join the KKK (with the medal of honor in his pocket), he would have been more than welcomed. People who hate Jews (and are afraid to admit even to themselves) will definitely enjoy this one, cause this movie is made for them."
"gregeichelberger","4","28","60","12 August 2009"," Typical Tarantino overwhelms World War II fantasy
","Whenever I view a Quentin Tarantino film I expect a quirky plot, decent acting and a cool soundtrack. Unfortunately, I also expect non-existent pacing, a confusing narrative and long, drawn-out talking sequences.<br/><br/>You get plenty of the above with his newest effort, the revenge fantasy, ""Inglourious Basterds, a remake of the 1978 Italian picture, ""Bastardi Senza Gloria"" (literally ""Bastards Without Glory""). It's ""The Dirty Dozen"" meets ""Valkyrie"" meets ""Kill Bill"" and tells the story of a small band of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers who are dropped behind enemy lines in German-occupied France and strike fear in the hearts of Hitler's military.<br/><br/>Led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), the group accomplishes this by raids and ambushes in which dead German soldiers are scalped (in some very gruesome scenes) and survivors have swastikas carved into their foreheads (think younger, more Teutonic versions of Charles Manson). While there are eight of these commandos, the two most interesting are Pfc. Omar ""The Bear Jew"" Ulmer (Omar), who beats Nazis with baseball bats; and Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), an ex-Wehrmacht soldier who killed a dozen of his own troops.<br/><br/>The trailers for the movie are really pushing this plot line, but that's a false premise. There are really only a few scenes of such carnage, instead the story revolves mostly around a lisping SS colonel, Hans ""The Jew-Hunter"" Landa (Christoph Waltz, a German actor appearing in a rare U.S. production) and a French Jew, Soshanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent, a French actress appearing in a rare U.S. production), whose family Landa had killed.<br/><br/>She owns a movie house in Paris and becomes acquainted with Frederick Zoller (Daniel Brühl), a war hero who supposedly killed over 100 U.S. soldiers in Italy. A film of this exploit, ""A Nation's Pride,"" was made by Nazi Minister of Propaganda, Josef Goebbels (Sylvester Groth). Of course, the premier of this film will take place at the picture show.<br/><br/>Also complicating matters is a British spy, Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) who is unintentionally hilariously briefed by Michael Myers (doing his worst Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake impersonation) and Winston Churchill (Rod Taylor, ""The Time Machine,"" ""The Birds""). Then, there's another subplot which has the Fuerher himself (Martin Wuttke) possibly attending the premier.<br/><br/>To complete these various story lines, Tarantino falls back on his habit of filming scene after scene of people sitting around tables, talking, talking and talking (see ""Grindhouse's Death Car""). Talking in taverns, talking in houses, talking in war rooms, talking in basements, talking in prisons. Mr. Tarantino, there is a person who toils on every film set that ever existed - this person called an ""editor."" Please make use of this person.<br/><br/>These sequences swallow up about 80 percent of the movie's 2-hour, 30-minute running time and leave precious little time for Pitt, who does well, albeit with a bad Southern accent, and his mercenaries.<br/><br/>There some good things about the film, however. The sets and costumes are wonderful and quite accurate as far as period detail goes; the location cinematography by Robert Richardson (""The Aviator,"" ""Kill Bill, Vols. 1 and 2"") is terrific; the movie uses authentic German, French and Italian (with subtitles); and Tarrantino knows his German cinema history, dropping names like Lili Riefenstahl, P.W. Pabst and Emil Jannings.<br/><br/>A good surgeon could have removed about 45-minutes from this movie, though, added a few more scenes of the Basterds and toned down the David Bowie. Then, it might have been the taut, compelling film I thought it could be."
"delete0013","Null","15","29","28 August 2010"," Pornography of violence against Nazis with prominent flashes
","Shortly I could describe this movie as a mess. A collection of barely connected scenes that seem to exist more for themselves than for the plot as a whole. It is unbelievable how one director can make a perfect dialogue scene and primitive vandalism of some barbaric group, one after another. Can't say whether that was by accident or intentional sarcasm. The dialogue scenes are simply wonderful, with tension so dense that could be cut with a knife, all concluded with a good endings and twists. Truly, scenes I unfortunately can't find in any modern American movie. Use of original languages must also not be forgotten. However the problems amount with the arrival of uncivilized Jewish-American death squad. Jews and Americans, no offense meant, but what's seen in this movie is simply ridiculous! A bunch of nobodies, hunting like rabbits, members of the world's most dreadful military machine since medieval Mongols!? A very cheap national morale boost in a manner ""if they can be dirty we can be even more"". It is making fun out of the whole Second world war tragedy. Being the story fictitious or not it does not justify the told. Curiously the movie offers a great irony by itself, lieutenant Raine, the leader of Inglorious Basterds, who is as I see it a parody of prevailing simplistic American misunderstanding of the World in which they take important part. Similarly, mentioned extremes of the movie offer no understanding for each other whatsoever. Deciding the rating is therefore impossible."
"gunnarspost","6","15","29","31 August 2009"," Very interesting to watch. Not the movie - but the audience.
","Two dimensions of this movie are discussed frequently: Its entertainment value and its political correctness.<br/><br/>Related to the first: The movie has some good elements – including the first scene, the use of multiple languages, as well as the acting of Christoph Waltz. For Tarantino fans, there are several additional typical features and for movie fans in general, there are lots of links to other movies. Personally, I'm not interested in these. Beyond this, I found the movie to be rather lengthy.<br/><br/>More importantly, there are two interpretations of the movie's moral and its political correctness.<br/><br/>Standpoint 1) (Similar to what I've read in some critical article about the movie). Tarantino is comparable to a porn producer. A porn builds up some story as an excuse to show sex. Tarantino builds up his stories as an excuse to show the maximum amount of violence accepted by the audience, without making any statement or revealing some deep moral or truth. If that's the case, Tarantino uses some of the most terrible part of history just to show ""porn"". Whether slaughtering Nazis is politically correct or not is one question. Whether illustrating the revenge fantasies of Jews (as which the movie can be regarded according to actress Eli Roth) in this way is politically correct or not, the other.<br/><br/>Standpoint 2) Rather than a movie, Tarantino produced a giant socio-psychological experiment. In making us (the audience) feel content about any cruelty or indignity done to anyone wearing a swastika, he makes us have the same inhuman perspective the Nazis had. This standpoint is supported in particular by the positive way Nazis are depicted as compared to the basterds. In one scene, the basterds – after having killed and scalped dozens of Nazis – offer freedom to a Nazi officer for betraying another unit of Nazis and telling the basterds about their position. The officer – threatened with torturous death – remains loyal and is killed cruelly with a baseball bat. The basterds cheer, of course – and so does the audience. Throughout the whole movie, the cruelty of the basterds' actions (against Nazis, as well as against their allies), seems to outweigh the cruelty of Nazis' actions. In two other scenes, the basterds' incompetence in speaking foreign languages (first German, then Italian) gets some of them killed and reveals their plans to the multilingual and intelligent SS officer Hans Landa. On a higher level, even the acting of the basterds (with their leader portrayed by superstar Brad Pitt showing one of his worst performances) proves to be more than outperformed by Hans Landa (little known Austrian Christoph Waltz). Finally, even the title of the movie does not – as one might expect – refer to the Nazis, but rather to the group of revenge seeking Jews, Americans and defected Germans.<br/><br/>In summary, without being exposed to a lot of negative actions by Nazis (relative to the basterds), the audience justifies whatever cruelty to anyone with a swastika, just as the Nazis made their followers justify inhumanities by the (self-invented) evil inside anyone wearing a Yellow Star. If we are pro Nazi slaughtering, how about torturing (self-declared) enemies of the Western world in Abu Ghraib or Guantanamo? How about assuming some other standpoint and arresting gays, disobedient women or oppositional journalists? Looking at some of his past movies, I doubt that Tarantino regards the movie from this perspective but rather (again) produced porn. Still: Go and watch the audience."
"banger_dv","1","27","58","31 August 2009"," Brutal, just Brutal
","To those calling this a masterpiece, all I have to say is get off Tarantino's d*ck. Are you ppl forgetting the point of movies? They are meant to entertain you. Inglorious Basterds does not entertain. In fact it annoys the heck out of you. Drawn out scenes that don't add to the plot or point of the movie. Example; the entire scene with mike myers. I've read every review and I love the point ppl are bringing up about how you don't care about any of the characters. This is so true. Certain characters die and ,as a viewer,you don't feel anything for them, because Tarantino doesn't dive into who they are. <br/><br/>Lack of focus is the best way to describe this movie. The one thing it does focus on is the most boring aspect of the movie; 1940's cinema! The references to 1940's directors are so annoying! I joined this site just to voice my hate for this film. I wanted to leave the theatre after the myers scene, but like any movie goer I thought i would give it a chance. I not only regret not doing this, I wish I had booed the movie and started protesting in the isels. I want my 11 bucks back Tarantino. I feel like a rich man's wife who just got played by some young hunk for all my husbands money. I feel like that young hunk (Tarantino) broke my heart and is now lauging at me, rolling around in my money; smirking while he rubs 100 dollar bills all over his chest. And that's what Tarantino has done ppl, he has dooped us all and is now laughing as ppl continue to see this movie and continue to give him more and more money for this piece of crap. Terrible, terrible movie!"
"big_d_008","6","11","20","4 October 2009"," Tarantino - settled down already??
","For the freshest and most important director of the past two decades, 'Inglourious Basterds' is not a step in the right direction. It's a step in the wrong direction. Though enjoyable at times and extremely well crafted, it is a smug and arrogant piece of work; one that has little maturity and is essentially a joke.<br/><br/>Having time to think about the film, it's not actually THAT bad. Just being a huge admirer of Tarantino (Though 'Jackie Brown' set me awry slightly) i expected so much more. I wanted a vision and more of Tarantino's desperately engaging dialogue, and instead i got a completely mediocre story with a mediocre (in fact quite a poor) script, with a director who seems to have stopped taking himself seriously! <br/><br/>The film ultimately revolves around killing Nazis. Killing, slaughtering and laughing at Nazis. Now, that seems like a cheap shot to me. I mean, I just think there has to be more to a film than just killing and making jokes about the tyranny of Hitler. That's just too easy. Of course everyone in the world would agree that that is acceptable and now, more than half a century later, OK to laugh at, but it just upsets me that a director with the power and class of Tarantino would go for such a simple and easy story. It just feels like he's giving in to film as an enterprise over film as an art-form. I'd hate to use the term 'sell-out', because the film isn't that bad exactly, but it's definitely a step in that direction.<br/><br/>Though amidst the (maybe slightly unfair) pounding and hammering I am giving Tarantino and this film, there are some great moments, and great new acting gems. Til Schweiger is definitely someone to look out for, as is B.J. Novak, though contrary to popular opinion, I really didn't think Christoph Waltz was that impressive. He just didn't add enough to the character of Col. Hans as a real great actor would do.<br/><br/>Tarantino found time to keep the film self-referential and stylish, with lots of French New-Wave and Western homages to appreciate, though it just failed on me with such a silly plot. I've not quite lost my faith in Tarantino, just jarred it a bit, and I won't expect as much when he makes another film.<br/><br/>So, overall, a good film if you don't take it too seriously; a very disappointing film if you had Tarantino on some sort of Godly pedestal. Because it really did make me upset. I don't think we'll see any improvement in his work from here on. 6/10"
"mikebinfinitum","2","56","133","26 August 2009"," Where did it all go wrong?.........
","Let's cut to the quick: Inglorious Basterds is an appallingly bad movie.<br/><br/>Given my level of expectation going in and Tarantino's proved track record, I am of the opinion that this could be the worst film of all time.<br/><br/>It's worst crime is it's just so BORING. Nothing happens until the screamingly predictable ending. Scene after scene is dragged out with woeful wasteful dialogue. There is nothing at all to recommend about this film. Where is Tarantino's verve? His wit? Charm, style, playfulness? It's like a film school student trying to ape Tarantino without any of his actual ability.<br/><br/>Tarantino has used a mash-up of styles previously to good effect, but here they just jar. It veers from slapstick humour to serious art film - it doesn't work. It has no identity. The plot is insane, it's stupid, it is illogical beyond belief - that would be fine if Tarantino played it for laughs and pushed the comedic element, but he doesn't, he keeps tracking back to a serious war film.<br/><br/>What's the POINT of the film? There's no great story here, there's no message. It's been described as a ""Jewish revenge fantasy"", yet it portrays the Jewish characters are at best amoral monsters and the Nazi's are jovial, funny, likable and sometimes even sympathetic characters.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt must have watched the final cut with hands over his face, sinking deeper into his seat through sheer embarrassment. It's certainly a career worst performance from him.<br/><br/>I don't know what you've got cooked up next Quentin, but you need to get back to the drawing board and re-discover that excitement and energy that crackles over your other films, and throw this one in the bin where it belongs."
"ferguson-6","8","21","44","25 August 2009"," Business is a-Boomin'
","Greetings again from the darkness. Quentin Tarantino and the Coen Brothers are whom I depend to always deliver something never previously seen on screen. Creativity of itself is not sufficient ... but when combined with a love and mastery of film-making, more often than not we are treated to something special. QT certainly delivers that with the Basterds.<br/><br/>I found Chapter One (of Five) to be a mini-spaghetti western film short replete with perfect music, anticipation, stare downs, word play, a shoot-out and ultimate escape. Christoph Waltz immediately seizes his role as Col Landa and never lets go. He envisions himself, not as the ""Jew Hunter"" (a moniker he relishes, nonetheless) but rather as a super sleuth in line with Sherlock Holmes (hence the pipe!).<br/><br/>Chapter Two introduces us to the titular Basterds led by Lt Aldo Raine with Brad Pitt as the hillbilly ring leader of the Dirty Dozen-type band of Nah-Zee killers. Pitt's exaggerated jaw and outlandish accent, coupled with his QT-penned dialogue, makes for one frightening cartoon character on a singular mission. And at the same time, it is a real hoot! The multiple story lines begin to intermingle in a fabulously intricate tavern scene. The dialgoue and approach to this remind a bit of Reservoir Dogs, but with the subtle facial gestures and multi-lingual word play, it goes to a whole different level. While many thought this scene dragged, I was fascinated.<br/><br/>The finale in the Cinema Paradiso (not really, but it was the first thing I thought of) is well paced and delivers a fabulous ending of dramatic violent intimacy in the projector room and flamboyant special effects in the main theatre. Let's just say Lincoln's last night at the theatre ended better than Hitler's and Goebbel's.<br/><br/>So many movie references in the 2 and a half hours that you can't help but tip your cap to Mr. Tarantino. For us movie lovers, he really is our leader. He is living out our fantasy and delivering just often enough to keep us fed. As an example, the lead up to the Cinderella scene is just pure torture as QT works in his foot fetish. Having previously mentioned the work of Pitt and the fantastic turn by Christoph Waltz, I must also say that Melanie Laurent in her red dress, helped capture the feel of 40's and 50's femme fatales. She was absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>While this one is not quite at the level of Pulp Fiction, it is purely a cinematic marvel. Though not the most accurate of history lessons, there is still a bit of message that sneaks in. But more importantly, the message of cinematic adoration can't be missed. Bravo Mr. Tarantino. And thank you again."

","OK, first up I have two admissions to make. Firstly, my ridiculously low vote is NOT an attempt to balance out the high marks that the Tarantinophiles have given this film and secondly that I am reviewing based only on the first half of the movie because it was so dire I gave up.<br/><br/>{Spoliers from here}<br/><br/>Quentin, a film is not a book, we do not need to be told where the chapters are. Nor do we need subtitles in the same language as the spoken words.<br/><br/>Here are a few more subtle tips for you: <br/><br/>Good actors can multi-task.<br/><br/>Even if you must have them read your horribly over-complex dialogue they should be able to cope with actions at the same time and don't need to always sit at a table and talk at each other. <br/><br/>If you are going to use multiple languages as a plot device so that the people hiding under the floorboards don't understand then don't use words that have been adopted across both languages (e.g. masquerade).<br/><br/>There are alternatives to extreme violence and verbose story-telling, but if these are the only tools in your ridiculously limited arsenal then feel free to blend them rather than just one, then the other, then back to the first one.<br/><br/>If you are so insecure that you need to leave messages to yourself in the movie then try to be a bit smoother than ""French people are great because they love directors"".<br/><br/>If you just do a half-baked job of stealing from and copy-catting icons who did a much better job of something in the first place, it is not an homage, it's an insult."

I think the actors did a good job at portraying their characters and the film was shot very well. But the story is just not up to the challenge. I never thought I would say this but you really wouldn't miss a thing if you don't see this Tarantino movie. Don't get me wrong. It's not the brutality that bothers me.

","I was so disappointed by this Tarantino film. He is one of my favourite film makers / writers, but I must say his films are so on and off. After seeing this film I've seriously began to consider boycotting any future films he releases. I feel as though the high rating on this film reflects the idiocy of the North American demographic. I couldn't believe that people would laugh at some of the ""funny"" moments of this film...totally uncalled for moments that were not funny at all. I considered leaving the film about 20 minutes into it, but thought perhaps it may get better....but no, that was not the case. I gave it a 4 / 10 only because I liked the end and Tarantino's vision of how he would have liked the war to end. Brad Pitt was terrible, and I can't believe he thought this was the greatest role of his acting career...he should be ashamed of himself.<br/><br/>The movie had so many pointless moments, offensive and just plain uneducated....I do not get the dark comedy aspect of this. If you want dark comedy don't be truly insulting. This film was terrible."
"libertyseek","1","41","95","25 August 2009"," And Bruno was offensive?
","And Bruno was offensive? I didn't believe the negative reviews (one even described this movie as an embarrassment to film-making), but I should have. There is no excuse for this film. Tarantino indulges his appetite for violence to no purpose. This movie is supposed to be a kind of homage to spaghetti westerns (background music emphasizes this with exclamatory relish), but as violent as those films were, there was always a moral dimension to them.<br/><br/>I have been bored by movies before, and offended, but never so bored and so offended at the same time, and by a filmmaker who knows better (I hope). I left early – maybe halfway through – so it might be argued I didn't give the movie a chance. But up to that point, there wasn't a single character I cared about. The one potentially sympathetic individual was plotting a scheme of grotesque mayhem. It's as though Tarantino was constantly trying to top himself in imagining novel ways to kill.

However, I had to leave this time.

"MovieFanGuyy","1","16","32","20 September 2009"," Am I the only guy who hated Inglourious Basterds? Doubtful. This is Quentin Tarantino's WORST film!
","I am a HUGE fan of Quentin Tarantino. I think that Reservoir Dogs is a great early 90's heist film. Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest films of the 1990s, Jackie Brown is a homage to early 70's blacksploitation films and very entertaining, Kill Bill, while a little on the long side, was really fun, and I absolutely loved Grindhouse, (both films) But, I am one of the few people who really found all the over the top historical revisions in Tarrentino's Inglorious Bastards to be a little too much nonsense for me, and therefore I have to admit I hated Tarantino's new film.<br/><br/>While I think Quentin Tarantino's over-the-top violent antics works in some genres, I just can't take an over the top violent World War II comedy like Inglorious Bastards the least bit seriously, and that's why I really didn't enjoy it. I really hate it when directors like Tarentino conveniently re-write history just to entertain themselves.<br/><br/>Another problem with the film is that it goes on for far too long. This is the first time I nearly fell asleep reading endless subtitles with people speaking in French and German. And, there is absolutely no way that a German commander would let a hillbilly speaking in crappy Italian into a theater full of SS people. And their is no way that Hitler would allow himself to be gunned down so easily by two of the bastards.<br/><br/>I love World War II films, such as Saving Private Ryan, and I think that Tarantino is one of our most unique directors, but the two don't match up at all. Perhaps, he can bless the world with a Pulp Fiction sequel someday. Perhaps....."

","I'm a big time QT fan, especially of his now classics such as Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. Kill Bill was downright awesome. Reservoir Dogs was brutal and amazing. The minute I saw his name on a movie, I knew I was in for something gutsy and cool.<br/><br/>Except for this one. Oh well, I guess even QT can suffer a misfire.<br/><br/>The long dialogs between characters were boring and did nothing to advance the plot. There were times during these long winded expositions and scenes that went nowhere that I felt like I was watching a made for TV mini-series rather than a QT flick (Winds Of War, anyone?). <br/><br/>I dunno, it just had a lot of the same old crap humming through it, with little substance behind it. People are brutally killed. War sucks. Psychopaths like killing people. Hitler sucks. Nazis suck. Blah, blah, blah. Homage to older movies. Lookit me, ma, I'm making a WWII movie! *sigh* Maybe it was the setting that was the problem--QT does well with eras from the seventies and onward, but I couldn't help but feel his tackling of the WWII era was forced and uncomfortable for him. The worst part is that it shows.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's performance was downright awful. If the film was more comedic in scope, his overdone accent would have worked, but as it was he looked like a cartoon character stuck into a serious drama. Uneven and all over the map, just like the rest of this film."
"srstolz","6","13","25","12 September 2009"," Inventive but unsatisfying
","Tarantino's technically in full form here-- the sly editing, quirky dialogue, subtle suspense, endless film references etc-- but the story is ultimately a hollow revenge fantasy that, like his Kill Bill series, doesn't really add up to much.<br/><br/>Superficially, it's great-- funny, violent, unusual-- but as a revenge story and a commentary on war, it's empty. There are dangling endings, characters minus any kind of depth, an odd lack of any kind of emotional texture to the proceedings. Where Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction perfectly balanced real characters with a witty, unpredictable and allusive story, Tarantino here simply comes off as playing games."
"jonathan-577","10","18","37","7 September 2009"," a master popularizer at his very best
","Tarantino was never much of a philosopher, humanist, or world historian – just someone so utterly immersed in cinema that he could translate his obsession into terms that seemed not just relevant but also emotionally engaged. Now, at a rather troublesome and ambiguous moment, he takes on the Nazi film, with Bowery Jews and Southern lieutenants teaming up in a simple-minded crusade against Evil. In so doing, he offers more evidence that he's drinking from a bottomless well – that the movies can, and should, do anything. This is especially propitious since it comes along at a moment when cinema history is going down the toilet almost as fast as world history. More than ever he's playing the film prof here, but unlike his Americanism, his cinephilia is not triumphalist: he knows too much about his subject to lie about it. Glorious tributes to Sergio Leone and Raiders of the Lost Ark (and King Kong!!) vie with articulate digs at Pabst and Jannings and nitrate film. And yet it's anything but an in-crowd movie; I'm sure I don't get half the references myself. Instead, he sculpts these elements as a master popularizer, boiling them down into a teeming, bizarre concoction that is both devastating and offhand, manic yet full of grace, a jokester who delivers the punchline as if his life depended on it. And while you can always hear him talking, it's the overtones and cross-rhythms of his superbly attuned cast that bring it to life. This is as close to profundity as this man will ever get - pretty damn close."

"SylvesterFox007","1","38","88","25 August 2009"," ""Inglourious"" (sic) Is Right!
","""Overrated"" and ""boring as hell."" These are the words that kept coming to mind during the three hours of monotony that my friends recommended to me as ""amazing."" Either they were lying to me, they saw a different ""Inglourious Basterds"", or I'm the only one who can see that the emperor is naked. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the three previous Quentin Tarantino films I've seen, ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", and ""Death Proof."" Not much happens, but there's a certain theatricality to the way Tarantino's often-nonlinear stories unfold.<br/><br/>""Basterds"" has all of the Tarantino trademarks: long stretches of mundane, but amusing, dialogue, larger than life characters, and occasional splatters of gore. But in his previous films, Tarantino was able to pull all this off with more panache. Every heavily-subtitled (most of the dialogue is either in German or French) scene drags its feet for what seems like forever, and only sometimes does the dialogue even approach being interesting. The plot, little there is, is divided into episodic chapters like a 1940's ""Pulp Fiction."" But this time, Tarantino exchanges depth for period detail, as if the historical significance of WWII will make up for all of the movie's shortcomings. The Basterds of the title, a team of Jewish American soldiers infiltrating German-occupied France to take brutal revenge on Nazi soldiers, actually get only a small percentage of the screen time. Most of the chapters focus on the film's German and French characters.<br/><br/>While Tarantino's previous efforts were made up of characters that started out resembling pulp creations and then grew in terms of complexity, all of the characters in ""Basterds"", both heroes and villains, are as flat as cardboard from beginning to end. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if the film was an action movie like the trailers seemed to suggest. But ""Basterds"" is completely dialogue and character driven. 90% of the movie is people having conversation while sitting at tables. <br/><br/>While ""Pulp Fiction"" featured an all-star cast led by Samuel L. Jackson (who lends his voice to ""Basterds"" as a narrator for a couple brief moments) and Bruce Willis, ""Basterds"" eschews stars for lesser known international character actors. Not to say any of them are bad actors. Christoph Waltz, Daniel Bruhl, and the haunting, enchanting Melanie Laurent are actually quite good. But none of them are able to entertain for any reasonable amount of time with the flat characters and even flatter dialogue they are given to work with. Diane Kruger (""National Treasure"") is pushed to the background for most of her scenes. Brad Pitt, effortlessly evoking a lazy Tennessee accent, is entertaining every minute he's on screen, but those minutes are actually few and far between. The most entertaining performance actually comes from Mike Myers, in one scene in the middle of ""Basterds"", as a British General.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is more boring than any film about a plot to assassinate Hitler has a right to be and offers little to the cinema other than a title that rolls off the tongue nicely."
"ianlouisiana","1","9","16","14 May 2012"," ""Nein,nein,nein,nein,nein"".....Adolf Hitler
","One thing straight away - this isn't ""les regles du jeu"",this is a ludicrously overcooked fantasy aimed at little boys who go ""kak-kak-kak"" whilst pretending to fire machine guns. The director - if that's not too strong a word - has ""cleverly""- if that's the word - appropriated almost every scene from some cinematic source and camped it up to the extent that ""Inglourios Basterds"" is what you might call a gay romp through post - D.Day Occupied France. There is no sense here of ""lions led by donkeys"",merely psychoes led by madmen. Mr Brad Pitt is dreadfully bad as Aldo Ray - yes,I got that thank you Mr Tarantino,surely the worst performance even Mr T has coaxed out of an established actor. He is i/c of a cadre of sadistic psychopathic Jewish ""soldiers"" whose main task seems to be murdering and desecrating the bodies of German soldiers who are far braver and more honourable than themselves. This of course is Tarantino ""irony"". There is a sub - plot involving a ""comic"" Hitler attending a movie premiere in Paris where Mr Pitt's brave lads slaughter virtually the entire audience whilst the cinema burns down (don't ask). The sad thing is there are one or two moments in the 2 and a half hours (and it seemed much longer)where you can see (or glimpse,anyway)that under all the self - indulgent post - modernism,Mr Tarantino has an eye for an image but it is buried under so much baggage and he is so deeply up his own bum that it hardly gets a look in. The opening sequence where a Nazi officer(clever,sophisticated.multi - lingual and quite,quite mad) questions a French farmer about his Jewish neighbours who have slipped the net,is by far the best thing in the movie.I even enjoyed the reference to the title sequence of ""The Sound of Music"" where the daughter runs across the fields like Julie Andrews, but that was quite enough references for me,thank you. Nobody said ""So they call me ""Concentration Camp"" Erhardt..""but they got too damned close for comfort."
"TheImitationWavess","Null","9","16","19 September 2009"," Where do I sign up?
","I watched Inglorious Basterds tonight after wanting to see if for weeks, because everyone was recommending this movie to me and it was absolutely awesome! I don't know how Tarantino does it. I love the postmodern nature of his work, his imagination, his storytelling and his absolute craziness. Nobody makes movies like him. Who else would take a WWII and rewrite history? Who else would kill some of the most evil people of the 20th century; Hitler and Goebbels? Who else would give power to a bunch of Jewish soldiers to bash out the brains of the Nazi scum that was killing so many people? As I exited the cinema with my friend, we said at the same time ""this is how it should have happened!"". I don't think any filmmaker has ever made me say that before. If Tarantino does not get some award nominations as best director, there is no fairness in this world! <br/><br/>Best Performances in the film: Christoph Waltz - brilliant...the reviews of his performance are spot-on. He is incredible as someone so evil he can kill people while smiling and still be somewhat charming. I can't see how he is not going to get nominated or win the Academy Award for his performance, it was stunning.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt - he was hilarious. If anyone doubts Pitt's range as an actor, this movie should shut them up. He has fantastic comedic timing and his facial expressions in the movie were priceless.<br/><br/>Eli Roth - I loved him as the Bear Jew! He was savage, but you can understand his anger and thirst for blood, because of what is being done to his people.<br/><br/>Melanie Laurent - She really is a very good young actress. Her subtle emotions, due of the horrific situation she finds herself in, are beautifully expressed. Her bad-ass nature as well. I hope to see more of her in on this side of the continent.<br/><br/>Biggest applause goes to Quentin Tarantion though, who is not afraid to take chances and tick people off with his storytelling. Bravo!"

But there is something about Tarantino's attempts that just fall flat. His films aren't clever. They're not chic. His films aren't anything worthwhile.<br/><br/>Maybe I can put it this way: do you remember the last sequence from Four Rooms and how you wanted your 20 minutes back after seeing the one joke wonder that Tarantino was spewing? Exactly.<br/><br/>If you thought Kill Bill and Grindhouse were amazing maybe you'll like this too. For everyone else - stay away from these long, wordy, tedious and boring films that Tarantino is turning out. Every character sounds just like self-important Tarantino himself. I call it ""diarrhea of the mouth."" <br/><br/>Oh yeah, and leave your history books at home. This is an alternate timeline. That's the only way it makes sense to have electric and heavy metal-esquire guitars back in the 40's. That kind of madness in turn paves the way for 80's disco favorite ""Cat People"" by David Bowie. Because, right - it was the 40's and everyone was REALLY into David Bowie back then.<br/><br/>Who was Tarantino trying to please with this terrible crap? Only his repentant investors know for sure..."

","The movie starts with promise. I knew enough about the movie to know that it involved Nazis. We see the proverbial dairy farm in France, a father and three daughters, then the Nazis make their debut. The opening scene is gripping and terse, very legitimate. It is also brutal and believable. All throughout Christoph Waltz shines as the brilliant and merciless Col. Landa. He is truly the bastard of the film. Others submit masterful performances: Mélanie Laurent, Diane Kruger, Daniel Brühl. I especially fell in love with Mélanie's character, her mix of strength and tragedy (and beauty) was very well done. That red dress!<br/><br/>There are some great looks (scenery) and some well crafted sets. Kudos to the set designers. There were moments when this movie had award-winning flair, dialogue, etc. But...<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was a buffoon, and this was intentional. It was painful to watch Pitt ruin the mood and the movie. His accent was ludicrous, his behavior entirely unbelievable. His character, as well as all the ""basterds,"" were wholly out of place. Theirs was a comedy, a joke, a mockery which had no place with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>So this movie gets a 5. It gets a perfect score for the serious parts of the film, a zero for the abject ridicule of the dire and serious subject matter. I may actually watch this movie again - but I will not tolerate the insolence Brad Pitt participated in. Hopefully the chapters (DVD) will allow me to skip through and witness only the acceptable cinema. Trash the basterds.<br/><br/>Alas, what else could be expected from Quentin Tarantino? Brad Pit and Tarantino can now put on their resumes: ""I made light of WWII, the Holocaust and the deaths of millions upon millions of innocent people.""<br/><br/>EDIT: I reread my review and worried that people might misconstrue how I feel about Brad Pitt the actor. Brad has put in some masterful performances in his time: Se7en, Legends of the Fall, Fight Club. There are others too. Brad is easily one of the better actors of our time. So much more the reason to hammer him for his part in this film. You reach the heights - be careful not to fall.<br/><br/>As for Tarantino, I loved ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction,"" the latter being one of the best of the decade (my opinion). His later stuff... not my bag."

If you have read anything about what all the different sides did before and after the war you inevitably have to ask yourself who really were the good guys? Certainly not Stalin -- the WORST mass-murderer of all time who we gave half of Europe to in our zeal for fighting for ""freedom"" against the Nazis. After the war, we starved and killed upwards of 3-6 million mostly women and children. Many people today actually think the Nazis were the least morally reprehensible faction in the war--if you consider the evidence objectively! War is hell, and this movie appears straight out of hell.

","I haven't enjoyed a Tarantino flick since Kill Bill, and IB does nothing to make me change my mind. I was mostly bored during the movie, because it seemed like Tarantino was doing nothing new here, merely recycling his older tricks. I think he ought to stop hyping himself so much, and maybe skip directing for a while, in favour or writing. That's his strength, really. As a director, he's lately been just too self-indulgent.<br/><br/>As for the movie, the title itself is misleading. The Basterds were hardly in the movie. But I'm not complaining, because they were more caricatures, than serious characters. If Tarantino had elected to completely edit away Aldo The Apache and The Bear Jew, and make the movie only about Shoshanna, I couldn't be happier. Her plot was the only part that actually seemed like a coherent story. In fact, if I will ever get 'round to watching this movie on TV, I'll skip through all the frivolousness and just watch her scenes.<br/><br/>Still, my favourite sequence in the movie also featured the only Basterd I liked, Til Schweiger's Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (who ironically, isn't even an original American Basterd). This is the clandestine basement meet with Diane Kruger's Bridget von Hammersmark, where Murphy's Law is in full effect - basically everything that can go wrong, does - followed by the awesome shootout.<br/><br/>And how can I not talk about Hans Landa, the Jew Hunter! His performance towers above everyone elses, and he rightly deserves his Cannes best actor award. His ending however, was atrocious, and a major disservice to him. The whole idea that he would even consider surrendering to the Americans seemed kind of lame. He just didn't seem like the traitorous or turn-coat types to me. Basically Tarantino built up his character, and had no idea what to do with him, so he got one of the worst endings possible.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a juvenile escapist fantasy, and not a very interesting one at that. I am, of course, in the vast minority that didn't like it, as most of my other friends seem to act as if this movie is the cure for cancer. Cure for insomnia is more like it."

It was the first films EVER that I contemplated walking out of. . .this might be due to the fact that I rarely go to the cinema on a whim but Tarantino carried so much credit in my book that I went on the day it opened without reading anything about the work.<br/><br/>It seems to me that no one really has the courage to say what they think...that this movie is something they would expect from a B or even C production! The story line is absolute garbage and all though I sat through the whole 150 minutes of the film I couldn't help but think that Mr Tarantino should stay of Cocaine and maybe watch some classics again before making a movie. Inglorious Bastards is like a WW2 comedy with a Western Twist...I hated it. There is not a single part of the movie which is historical accurate including things like uniforms, weapons etc. which by the end of the movie was the least of my concern. The acting was by in large rubbish...perhaps Brad Pitts worst performance. The only light point in the movie when it comes to acting is the performance of Christoph Waltz in his role of the SS Col.

And these are my favourite movies. It is more than ""edge of your seat stuff,"" it will have you on your knees. Once you see the truck approaching the house, the end result is inevitable. For the duration of the scene you are praying that the colonel will just leave, but he sits still simply smoking his pipe... His politeness is unnerving too. When the soldiers are called in, you feel like falling to the ground and shutting your eyes forever, it is just so horrific. When a movie does this to you, or in this case just one scene, you know your in the hands of one talented director.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is no disappointment. Tarantino's style and talent continues to impress throughout, especially in the bar scene. The suspense here builds up hugely, not unlike the first scene, until an epic climax of gunfire amazes the audience. Among the violence, the movie contains light-hearted elements. The humour is very accurate, especially with the dialogue of Brad Pitt's character, Aldo Raine. Altogether it is top class entertainment.<br/><br/>I also can not go without complimenting the acting. Brad Pitt and Michael Fassbender's job was well done, but the star of the show was Christopher Waltz. His role was brilliantly played, as his character, as I said before, was unnervingly polite and terrifying.<br/><br/>All in all, a terrific achievement by Quentin Tarantino.

Tarantino should definitely give up casting Hollywood ""buddies"". I didn't get any sense of perspective from the story - was there a point to any of it at all?! Rambling scenes followed, and the general pace of the film was slow and limp, asides from the occasional abrupt burst of violence which often simply stopped characters from developing further. I found it very hard to feel anything for the antagonist in the movie and Brad Pitt's constant over the top accent and overacting just made me want to watch his scenes with the sound muted.

About 5 minutes into the first scene I was squirming with boredom. this movie is all buildup with no payoff.<br/><br/>We wait for a good 2 minutes for a guy to come out of a dark corridor with a bat. We just stare at the tunnel while he thumps the bat against the wall. Presumably this is supposed to be suspenseful, but it just comes off as annoying. The first scene we know what the outcome is going to be, but we sit through about 5 extra minutes of pointless talking. I have no problem with a conversation if it furthers the plot, but every scene was way too long.<br/><br/>The problem seemed to be that Tarantino chose to follow the less interesting plots in the movie. This is not a Brad Pitt movie, and it certainly should have been. He was brilliant. I should add Christoph Waltz as Landa was great too. If the movie just stuck to them, and didn't bother to add the bizarre love story last minute between Shoshana and the black projectionist, or a painfully long bar game with characters useless to the plot, or waste so much time on the star of ""A Nation's Pride""; it would have been far more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Also, for no reason Samuel L Jackson narrated 10 seconds of the movie. Then we never heard from him again. Mike Myers shows up for an unnecessary scene where they should have used someone else. It should have been an old English man, instead of Myers in silly looking make up. There was no reason to use a famous face for that inconsequential part. He didn't do anything special with that part. Knowing it was him only made it seem silly.<br/><br/>To be fair, this movie had a lot of moments that were funny. It had some violence that, while disgusting, paid off in a major way. The problem was the payoff was delayed so long, I was always just wanting it to be over by the time it happened. Don't buy into the hype. It was a movie, that could have been quite good and was instead ruined."

","Don't mess with the history. The purpose of historical fiction is to use fictional human interactions and characters to illuminate a period in time or to deliver dramatic circumstances in a historical context. PLEASE DON'T show me Hitler being killed by the resistance when he died many months later (and at the last possible moment) by his own hand, and don't show me the entire German high command being wiped out in a movie theater fire when doing so would have substantially changed the entire course of history. Remember the Nuremberg Trials? The Berlin Wall? The Eastern Block? INGLORIOUS BASTERDS commits the cardinal sin of rewriting history for no apparent purpose other than to introduce us these characters that we never really care about, and this story that doesn't really tell us anything about, well... anything. And there are no ""What if..."" explorations that might give us a hint as to why Tarantino drags us into this bizarre alternate universe for two and a half hours. Sparkling dialogue, some funny moments, and a truly gifted clever performance by Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa are not nearly enough to explain why Tarantino thought this story had something to tell us that made it worth rewriting history and taking up a few hundred minutes of our lives."

","Yes, Danny a Wood, I agree wholeheartedly with you This is what passes for ""masterpiece"" these days. Humor and violence porn, torture porn. People are so insensitive that they thrive on stereotypes and caricatures. Real characters and real events, daily struggles, the quotidian are not for our modern ""Tarantino fans."" They want blood, revenge, and shock. Shock and awe. Shock and kill. Kill Bill. Kill the Nazis. Dehumanize the Germans. At least some non-Nazis did die in this film, but it was almost all Nazis who did. And all Nazis were bad. Just one hint of humanity, no two. But they were expendable, too. A few non-Nazis died like suicide bombers who were dying for a cause. The good cause. And Posse10 I also agree with you. This was stereotyping of Germans, there wasn't a single human one in the film. And the stereotyping of Native Americans was also included as Pitt was supposed to be part ""Apache."" Most Native Americans know that it was the Europeans settlers who brought scalping to America. This is Hollywood at its worst and why Tarantino is touted as brilliant and artistic is beyond me. By jumping on the bandwagon and cheering for these dismal works of his we are merely perpetuating another form of Nazism - American glorification of violence, torture and stereotyping. The Nazis get treated as they treated others, therefore there was no redeeming quality about this film. Only revenge and bloodshed. Art appeals to the higher instincts of mankind, not the base instincts."
"dbborroughs","4","21","47","23 August 2009"," Okay send up of the Euro-war film is for fans of Tarantino's dialog only
","Quentin Tarantino's painfully over long World War Two film that started as a remake of Enzo G. Castellari's Inglorious Bastards, but which changed over time to this monster of a movie.<br/><br/>The plot has a band of American soldiers, all Jewish, operating behind enemy lines killing Nazi's when the opportunity comes to work with a British officer who's job it is to kill a large portion of the high command at a film premiere in Paris.<br/><br/>The film is essentially a long winded send up, you can't take anything in this film seriously so its a send up, of the Euro- war films of the 1970's and 80's. Indeed the film that the movie takes its name from is from 1978. To be certain the film has better production values than most of the films that he is sending up but it isn't all that much better than the most mediocre of the genre.<br/><br/>What went wrong? Tarantino is what what went wrong. To be certain Tarantino knows his war films and the film very often feels like it fits very nicely in the genre, I'm currently going through a good number of Italian war films and from a feel point of view this film does get it right. His rip offs and borrows, of which there are many, mostly work (even if they frequently break the mood).<br/><br/>The problem is Tarantino's attitude is more is more. This is all well and good, except that the films he is sending up are at least an hour shorter than this behemoth. This film drones on for two and a half hours. It never seems to end. Actually it never seems to get going. Honestly the film is well over an hour in before the film even begins to start to move, and even that it does slowly. I kept wanting to hit the remote to get to the point where it gets moving.<br/><br/>What is the deal with this film. Its a war film with very little action. Most of this film are these long, painfully long, sequences where the characters just sit around and talk. The opening introduction of Christoph Waltz's Col Lada is twenty minutes long. Yea it plays out in essentially real time, but at the same time I screamed ""get on with it"" at the screen (yes I was shushed) because there really was no point. Actually there is little point to much of the dialog. This is a film that could be trimmed by at least an hour and lose nothing but inane dialog. (Your ultimate love or hate for the film will depend upon whether you like Tarantino's penchant for long rambling dialog exchanges that goes nowhere, or if not nowhere drone on way past the point of what is really required and serve no point beyond showing how well he can write).<br/><br/>Which brings me back to the idea that this is an action film. How much action is there? Very little. The shoot out in the bar, the end, the introduction of the band at the train bridge (maybe thats an action scene) and maybe one other sequence, the rest is talk. To me the film felt mostly inert. Its not a film that slowly builds only to have the tension released in an orgy of violence, rather its rambling nonsense punctuated by an occasional scalping. If you really want to be fair you'd have to say that this film is static in away no Euro-war film- other than a concentration camp exploitation film- ever was.<br/><br/>I'm curious what the tone of the film is suppose to be. After the too long but tense introduction of Lada and Shoshana, the film jumps to Brad Pitt talking to his men about what is expected of them (100 scalps). Its fall down funny. Its so over the top that you can't take anything that happens after that even remotely seriously. Forgive me it sinks the film since every time Aldo Raine comes on screen or is heard the film falls into silliness. You'll have a serious sequence and then Pitt comes on and spoils the mood.<br/><br/>Its also troubling. Its troubling because I'm not sure what I'm suppose to take away from the film. Clearly the jovial attitude is suppose to make it easier to root for the good guys, but at the same time what they do, often in a joking manner, isn't funny. I don't think the Nazi's do anything other than shoot people, the good guys scalp people, cut their throats and beat their heads in with a baseball bat while their comrades cheer and dance around. These are the good guys? I don't think Tarantino was going for the same effect that James Dickey was going for with his novel To the White Sea (the film of which had Pitt attached) since there are too many jokes. I'm sorry the implications of what the heroes are bothers me.<br/><br/>I do have to say that the performances, outside of the Basterds who are just too over the top, are for the most part very good. I was very impressed by Michael Meyers who has a solid cameo as a British general.<br/><br/>Do I like the film? Kind of, but not really. Its better than I thought, but not as good as it should have been. Its a bloated approximation of the Euro-war film. Tarantino has beefed it up and disjointed it in the way that an over-imaginative five year old who is making up his own story would do. Unfortunately for Tarantino the plots of many of the films he's sending up, I will not say paying homage, are so close to parody already that he's pushed it all in the wrong direction. He's done better, and he's done worse.<br/><br/>I can't really recommend it since its too long for what it is. Wait for DVD or cable"

","I love war movies. I love World War II movies specifically. They are a perfect venue for romance, intrigue and suspense. And the Nazis make great villains. That said, this movie was nothing but an semi-amusing parody of history that tries to exact retribution for something that can neither be undone, nor 70 years later, has any relevant or accountable culprits. The Jews have played the holocaust-card for sympathy and gain long enough, and it doesn't make them any more respectable as a political entity. Inglorious Basterds is an attempt to depict a vindictive fantasy of those who still hold a grudge around which they have formed their entire identity - a grudge that any ethnic group could hold if they were so little. For instance, just imagine when the Palestinians get a hold of the popular media. But, the truth is, it wasn't even that good of a movie, and normally, I like Quentin Tarantino. I think that if the makers really wanted to create a convincing band of Jewish marauders behind enemy lines, like the 'Inglorious Basterds,' the last thing they should have done is cast real Jews (rather, more like Til Schweiger). There were a few good performances...and the opening scene was about the most suspenseful. Other than that, it was a mess. Probably the worst acting I've ever seen Brad Pitt do."

The viewer cannot suspend disbelief. <br/><br/>I respect liberties taken with history, even with very sensitive moments in history, but to create an ending as such in the movie completely denying the events that occurred in time reduces the movie to an insulting cartoon: it mocks the intelligence of the viewer.<br/><br/>Some actors and actresses, though, gave great performances: notably Diane Kruger, who may be the most seductive and feminine woman in the world, and Christolph Waltz. Brad Pitt, on the other hand, is no Warren Oates, and was not believable at all right from the very beginning of his entrance in the movie.<br/><br/>""Desperado"" worked for me: it was in part a spoof and largely entertaining. But this did not, partly because of its subject matter: too fanciful, unreal, and thereby insulting the viewer. <br/><br/>Sadly this could have been a great film. I read that the author had put the script aside for years before completing it. Perhaps that explains the disconnected ending and the film's failure.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Hitler truly missed its mark. It was not even humorous in order to make it palatable to the viewer.

"sayblack","3","6","10","30 January 2010"," Inglourious Basterds Not So Glorious
","Guess what ladies and gentlemen? Quentin Tarantino's rendition of 'Inglorious Basterds' is not that original. It is original in its storyline. But in terms of general creativity, it is hardly original. Hmmmm surprise, surprise. This is one more movie in the seemingly endless tidal wave of remakes and sequels currently polluting theaters and home DVD players. This is not to say that the movie was bad. Its storyline is a far cry from the story in the original. But when it comes to levels of violence and general camera work, this is largely more of the same from Tarantino, therefore setting it far apart from the original. What's more, while the general storyline makes for an interesting watch, the story feels as though it is dragging nonstop from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The story of the original 'Inglorious Basterds' involved the Dirty Dozen-esquire group of rogue soldiers trying to stop the Nazis, while trying to keep themselves from getting in any trouble from their own people. This time around, though, Tarantino has made an entirely fictitious story of said soldiers taking part in a plan to assassinate some of the Nazi party's elite at a theater. Unbeknownst to said soldiers, a young French Jew has her own plan to kill the Nazi's, too. Along the way, there is plenty of violence, and foul language, killing, and a very unnecessary short sex scene.<br/><br/>The sex, violence, and language aside, one of the positives of the movie is Tarantino's ability to make some very interesting camera angles. He does things with the camera that few other directors would dare do. The angles, in their own way, help to tell the story. They set mood by themselves, and by giving a better view of the scenes (and the characters).<br/><br/>While the camera angles and shots may help to tell the story, Tarantino and company fail to tell the story in a timely fashion. The separation of the story into chapters makes for wonderful transitions. But perhaps certain things could have been left out of some scenes to help push the story along. It felt as if so much of the story was just extraneous material that could have been cut. But then again, that is much the style that Tarantino has in his work.<br/><br/>'Inglorious Basterds' may not be the most original movie in the annals of war movies. But for all of the negatives that this movie may have, it is still somewhat uncharted territory for Quentin Tarantino. He is not typically known for doing war movies. And for this, it is a movie that will likely stand out among that mass of war movies created since the dawn of the silver screen."

","My first reaction when leaving 'Inglourious Basterds' was ""They could've cut a good hour out of that film!"" And as much as I ONLY went to this movie due to Tarantino, I think he was so in love with his work, he barely edited out a second of footage. Even if the misleading advertisements were true – ""Killing Nazis!"" actually only takes up approx 1/6 of the movie, as does Pitt's character – I still wouldn't have been interested in the subject matter. I'm just not into war/period-piece movies. Again, only Tarantino's name got me to buy a ticket. In 'Basterds's defense, it was much more than just a period piece, or war movie, so I'll give it that. I'll also praise a lot of great scenes that made me laugh, snicker, jump, root and admire. Unfortunately, they were so few and very, VERY far between, I'm seriously reducing my rating. I miss the old Tarantino, as even if the movie was slow at times, it kept me interested throughout with raging dialogue, plot twists and intersecting story lines. Here we have a straight arrow plot, yes, with multiple story lines, but barely a crossover. In the beginning we get 1 of many enormously overlong scenes where a Jewish family is slaughtered in 1941 Nazi-occupied France, but one escapes. (The other notable drawn out to the max scene is a barroom conversation that I wanted to scream for it to be over – you knew where it was going, so get on with it! 10 minutes, maybe, but not 30 minutes or so.) Anyways, we get her story later, along with a weasel detective and a group of war-criminals-to-be Nazi killers (see trailer) all leading to a movie screening finale. Good ending, but be prepared for 80% subtitles and 60% fluff to get there.<br/><br/>Side Note: Despite it being a ""period piece"" movie – where's the jams? I do miss his great soundtracks. Also, never thought I would say this, as I ALWAYS go for the ""unedited"" versions of movies on DVD/Bluray. However, I certainly wouldn't mind see the NBC network edited down version.

By the time Inglorious Basterds came out, Tarantino already had major success in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, more than enough to permit him to live the rest of his life in good comfort.
Quentin Tarantino just loves cinema, and that's never been more obvious than with this film. The meticulous attention to detail and carefully - and successfully - written plot leaves the audience feeling completely satisfied. In a film that relies partially on subtitles to tell its dialogue, it's extremely effective and entertaining.
As with previous films, Tarantino doesn't waste time. This movie is to the point and every single scene adds to the plot. Coming fresh out of this movie, it's a fantastic product that I will definitely be going back to watch many times."

","Let me be upfront in saying that this is not my kind of movie. For some reason, I fail to understand the hilarity in mass murder and graphic depictions of violence. There is some flaw in my character that lacks the ability to cheer as I witness a hundred people gunned down in a burning building with no means of escape. So I admit that I am pre-disposed to well...LOATHE this movie.<br/><br/>But let us pretend that I'm a Buddy Holly glasses wearing hipster who loves this kind of movie on principle (you know--it's violence I can cheer for cuz it's like, ironic, man). Even in that case, this movie, well...blows. Here's why:<br/><br/>1. The title characters of the film (the Ingloourious Bastaaerds however weird ironic way you want to spell it) are completely superfluous to the entire movie. Indeed, it would be a much more interesting, cohesive film without them, as they only serve to detract from the power of Shosanna's story (incidentally, the only actual character in this whole cartoon of a movie).<br/><br/>2. Schizophrenia, thy name is Tarantino. Is it a spaghetti western? A post-modern comedy? An homage to name-your-impressive-pop-culture-reference-here? Or even (snort) a serious wartime drama? Who knows? Hell, I sat through all 2 and a bloody half hours and I can't even tell you what that purpose of the damn film was, let alone its genre. <br/><br/>3. And the most galling point of all appears in the abhorrent disrespect shown to a dismal time in our world's history as well as the people who experienced it. Tarantino makes an absolute farce of the Nazi regime and the terrors of World War II. The audience cheered and laughed as people were violently murdered and disfigured and their corpses violated throughout the film. It's so completely dehumanizing, it makes me think that our own real life gladiator days are close on the horizon. Indeed, some might say that in trivializing death and suffering in such a callous manner, we can't be that much better than the Nazi followers themselves.<br/><br/>So overall, I left the theater sickened and more than a little pessimistic about the state of empathy in our society. Perhaps I'm not ""cool"" or ""ironic"" enough to appreciate such a ""masterpiece"" (okay, sarcasm quotes off now), but I'm glad of it. <br/><br/>Bottom line: If you have a heart, don't see this movie."

","Like many others, I became a fan of Quentin Tarantino when I saw the iconic Pulp Fiction. Sadly, it has all been downhill since then and with Inglourious Basterds he really trawls the depths. I have no objection to Tarantino's penchant for gratuitous violence, it has served a purpose in cinema from the time Moe first poked Larry in the eye in the Three Stooges (and probably before). However in this film Tarantino seems intent upon presenting sickening violence that is not so much gratuitous as irrelevant. In Pulp Fiction the violence was cleverly and eccentrically presented - in this film it is neither. The story is not even loosely based on fact - which is just as well because if it were, the number of Americans in the dock at Nuremberg would have exceeded the number of Nazis. The characters are boorishly stereotypical and - even in a film deliberately seeking unbelievability - lack any trace of credibility. The most notable example is the portrayal of the Nazi colonel by Christoph Waltz (presumably a nom-de-plume to protect his true identity - and his career?). The character emerges as a sort of Hogan's Heroes meets La Cage aux Folles, with the colonel camping it up and smoking a ludicrously huge pipe. Sadly, this film is further evidence - if any was needed - of the demise of a once creative genius.

","This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>What is the purpose of this movie? A bunch of Americans enters Nazi-occupied France and starts slaughtering Germans. You see them scalping their enemies and beating them to death with baseball bats. While making jokes, of course.<br/><br/>Some will say that this movie is a parody of a certain genre. For a parody, it is neither witty nor funny. The contents is zero. It is exceptionally brutal and disgusting. Underneath lies a subtle political message, because it is again ""the good guys"" killing ""bad Nazis"". The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around. Could you imagine a storyline where Nazis (while making jokes) kill everybody in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not, but this movie is exactly about that, with the exception that is satisfies the weird moral expectations of a certain audience: slaughtering people is so cool when done by the right people.<br/><br/>This movie only works because of the hidden Nazi-ideology underneath. It does not regard the enemy as people. And if the latter is supposed to be an element of the fun, I am happy to say that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me.<br/><br/>Another mystery is how such violence can fascinate the American crowd while a bit of nudity will freak them out. But if a naked body is pornography, this movie with all its brutality is pure pornography at its very worst.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds is a pointless, boring and tasteless waste of time and money."

","Cardboard cutout characters, clichés, phoned in performances. I was disappointed. The plot was telegraphed in the first ten minutes and much of the dialogue improvised to save money on good writing. I expect there are some demographies that lap this stuff up but I prefer plot, imagination, good writing and good acting. On top of all that the storyline (and I am stretching it) was so incredible I could not suspend disbelief. The only interesting moment was Tarantino generating outrage in us at the Germans watching ""Nation's Pride"" yukking it up as Americans were being killed, then a few minutes later the cinema audience were cheering on as the cast of German soldiers and politicos were being killed on screen."

","This is a silly, violent, unhistorical fantasy. I guess it must make sense to someone who still hates the Nazis so much that they revel in seeing them brutalized, killed, and dismembered. Never mind that nothing in it is remotely similar on any level to anything that actually happened in World War II.<br/><br/>I am sitting here trying to imagine what motivated this creation and how it made it to production. Are there Jewish persons among us that need to see something like this? Possibly, but they can't be prevalent. Are there young people who might be duped into thinking this is historical? Why would anyone do that? Why would someone want them to believe the war ended like this instead of the arguably more dramatic way that it actually did end? Was this just a bizarre excuse to make a graphically violent film that an oddly disturbed new audience might be willing to pay money to see? <br/><br/>I never got the SAW movies either. Yet, I have heard young people praising them and eagerly comparing notes. Is this another film for that crowd? Is it just another violent blood fest masquerading as art? Don't bother answering.

The story however can be told in two minutes without leaving anything out and every dialog is among the worst I've seen. The constant self-justification was so annoying. Even mediocre movies don't need to go that low. Plus it was plain boring. If I wasn't one of the many Tarantino fans, I'd never have watched till the end.

","Inglorious Basterds is based in a 'alternate reality' wartime France. With many cameos and a long star list of A and B actors from both sides of the Atlantic. It uses the now well worn Tarantino formula of having two (usually more) main story lines converge as well as brief flashbacks to flesh out character and subplots. Whilst a lot of the reviews here would appear to be by fanboys of Mr. Tarantino the fact of the matter is that adulation, desire, wanting and hero worship will not make this film a good film and save it from critical thinking and heart-felt review...<br/><br/>Acting. Christoph Waltz delivers a strong performance as the main protagonist. Delivers his lines with aplomb in fact and he along with Melanie Laurent save this film from complete oblivion. Unfortunately, at the other end of the acting spectrum, we have Brad Pitt who would struggle to out-act a ham sandwich judging on his effort here. He over acts along with much of the cast whilst the rest look a little confused (except the above mention Waltz and Laurent). There is very little emotional/intellectual feel about most of the acting/dialogue and it really leaves the film flat. Brad Pitt, in my mind, is a curious case to play a leader or person of any type of authority. He has always comes across as a himbo or a male model who can act a little. Not a hardened army officer. People may point to some previous roles such as in Fight Club but in the most part he is a girly man's tough guy and in this film he again doesn't look like he could inspire or lead. His accent is school play level.<br/><br/>Pacing. The opening scene is good. The meeting in the basement pub is OK. Rest of the movie is tedious.<br/><br/>Dialogue. Again the beginning scene is good but other than a few moments where the film appears that it might get beyond second gear it falls way short of Tarantino's first two films, Reservor Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Acting, again, impedes or ruins most of the dialogue.<br/><br/>Believability. James Cameron once said that if you can take the ridiculous and make it believable that's movie magic. Here, Tarantino takes the ridiculous and makes it, in the most part, boring.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino has succumbed once again to self-indulgent homage, harking back to the old days of VHS b-movies that lurked within the bowels of all video stores circa early-mid 1980's. What terrible thing happened to Mr. Tarantino during those days that he can't let the past stay in the past? Or was then, the zenith of his days? Do we have to endure this seemingly endless mid-life crisis that influences his movie making palate? Not since Russ Meyer has someone generated the same style in making films and at least Mr. Meyer did it for laughs and titillation.<br/><br/>Verdict: 4 stars thanks to Mr. Waltz and Ms. Laurent.<br/><br/>See this film if you must, but I'd suggest to wait to see it on DVD or on TV."
"pfgpowell-1","2","17","39","24 May 2010"," Tarantino redefines what a turkey might be: this is very bad.
","It is slowly becoming apparent to me that Quentin Tarantino is something of a one-trick pony. And it really doesn't matter how many cineastic references you make, if you make them in a film which is simply not very good, such as Inglorious Basterds, it all becomes rather pointless. So much is mediocre to downright bad about this film that is difficult to know where to start. That there are, ironically, several very good performances in it - despite the idiotic film in which these take place - can, perhaps, be chalked up in Tarantino's credit, although I think it is more probably that he or his producer simply struck lucky when he chose his various casting agents. Inglorious Basterds strikes me as nothing more than a bad TV movie script by a not very bright though puerile teenager which somehow gets to be made on a big budget. And that is being kind. We are asked to accept that a film which starts with the brutal massacre of a Jewish family can then blandly go on to expect to be regarded as something of a light comedy. For 'light comedy' is what I assume Tarantino thought he was making. But do graphic scenes of scalping and a man having his brains beaten to mush with a baseball bat really create that many laughs? Tarantino seems to think so. The films then meanders along a rather silly plot line involving a British film critic turned serving soldier, a well-known German movie star who is - larks! - an British agent, Churchill, Hitler, Goebbels, a young Jewish woman who escaped the massacre of her family to arrive in Paris to run a cinema - and on it tediously goes. Lord how Tarantino must have chortled when he wrote the script. How clever Quentin must have thought he was. There is no thought here, no direction, no heart. It is just a mush of ideas, with the odd scene which plays well. But none of those reasonably good scenes adds up to a row of beans when it is all stitched together into a whole. Oddly enough, it is almost far too ridiculous to take this film seriously on any level, almost ridiculous even to discuss it seriously. Tarantino has a certain gift for making a certain kind of film. But take him out of that comfort zone, take him away from his one trick, and the alarming paucity of his imagination becomes all too painfully apparent. And what on earth persuaded Brad Pitt to get involved in a project as tiresome as Inglorious Basterds beats me. If you think Abbot and Costello liberate Auschwitz would have made a great comedy, this is for you. Otherwise find something better to do and save your money."

","What a huge disappointment this movie was. Tarantino's done some off-the-wall but really cool stuff, like ""Kill Bill, vols. 1 & 2"" or even the classic ""Pulp Fiction"" but this one just stunk, period. Brad Pitt has shown that he has great acting chops, particularly in stuff like ""Seven"", ""Benjamin Button"" and ""Snatch"" but in this atrocious film, he just hams it up as a twisted, 2-dimensional character who gets his thrill only from the kill (and a whole lot of torturing too). What the hell was he thinking, taking on this role?! Diane Kruger was good as the coolly mysterious Bridget and Micheal Fassbender (who was so good in ""Hunger"") does the best he can with the role he's stuck playing but seeing Mike Meyers as a general was too much because I kept picturing Austin Powers trying to play leader. Eli Roth should stick to writing and directing those shallow slasher films he specializes in because as an actor, he's just not that talented. Tarantino likes lots of gore in films so he worked some weak little story into the plot so that audiences would sit through his blood-and-guts fest. Better films about alternate history endings and World War 2 in particular are not hard to find. This one belongs on late night cable or worse. What a waste of money and time."

","There's something profoundly offensive about this. Oh, it isn't the gratuitous catalog of stereotypes. Its the fact that they are stereotypes, unmodified in any way.

The illusion of movement is just an illusion.<br/><br/>There are, however, two things I enjoyed.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is amusing, not in the context of the film, but in the context of his craft. He is turning into a worthy actor, taking chances and not relaxing. I cannot imagine anyone else with this range. Chris Cooper? Pitt is not an intelligent man, so he cannot be an intelligent actor and he cannot stand outside this business and annotate. But he can be overtly ridiculous, and that is good enough here.<br/><br/>The other thing is the way the film within is constructed. It is as blunt as everything else, but because of what it is, it is fun. The thing is set up for a film within, misplaced. The literal film within is a war film, perverted by an exhibitor. But the real film within is the film of that film's audience, who as viewers have done to them what they celebrate on screen. It is really a very elegant idea, just kicked on our face.<br/><br/>Oh, a more structural elegance works a whole lot better. This is not extended from the war genre, but the detective one. Our main character is not the leader of a group of terrorists. but a master detective in a efficient machine that gets increasingly madder as you get away from him.

"VaticanAssassinWarlock","7","14","31","16 August 2009"," Initial reaction: surprise, pleasure and disappointment.
","I just got back from watching the uk preview. It is certainly a very interesting film, and absolutely nothing like the trailer suggested. I'll avoider spoilers, but it is worth pointing out that the eponymous 'basterds' are hardly in the film, and it doesn't really follow their exploits. In fact the bulk of the film is based around a revenge story for a female jew who's family has been massacred by the nazi's.<br/><br/>Tarantino displays several styles. The much-emphasized contemporary-western style all but disappears after the first, brief chapter. His nouvelle vague influences return with full force, as do his 70s-inspired ott gimmicks, and their are traces to all his previous films here. Personally I'm not sure they all fit, and I didn't feel the film always knew where it was going.<br/><br/>The pro's. The film has two utterly excellent scenes, the first is the opening 20 minute scene of the film involving a french farmer and a nazi commander, the second involving a secret meeting between allies in a tavern basement. Both are tense, thrilling, and beautifully shot and acted. Another brief standout scene is the introduction of the Basterds as a tale retold be a survivor. Also, Mélanie Laurent gives a brilliant performance throughout, with only a bit of corny dialogue later on as she transforms into 'the bride' character, stilted dialogue and all. Secondly, Christoph Waltz is very good as the films central antagonist, and who you get the feeling Tarantino is rooting for all along.<br/><br/>The con's. Firstly, Tarantino has replaced his own inappropriate cameos with a new one, Eli Roth's poor acting stands out throughout the movie and really serves as an unnecessary distraction. Secondly, the film has no real focus, it is a collection of quite-long scenes, held together entirely by coincidence, which seem to come and go with no real connection to those before or after. Perhaps this is due to the third problem, the film seems to have a LOT missing. Only two of the Basterds get any development, and this is minimal. We don't know where any of the films character come from or what motivated them, even those who the film highlights. The film's two main plots never really come together, and the films climax is explosive, but not particularly gratifying (although others may disagree with this).<br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed Kill Bill, Tarantino seems unwilling to return to the kind of easy naturalism and character development that made his first two films so exceptional. His style is very deliberate, but for me it often seems like he's trying too hard. More akin to Jackie Brown (as I remember it at least) this film is uneven, with some incredible scenes and some great characters, but a lot of inappropriate gimicky cheese and underdeveloped ideas too.<br/><br/>I'm sure many will love this film, and given times and multiple viewings, I may do too. But initial reactions on first viewing are certainly uneven."

","I can safely say that I'm no longer a Tarantino fan. Looking back from Jackie Brown to Pulp Fiction to this, I wasn't impressed. One could call this Gratuitous Basterds because a lot of the violence was graphic and over the top, which I don't mind at all, but a lot of it was unnecessary. Movie starts out REALLY, really slow to the point where I was starting to fall asleep. Nothing but table dialogue. Like any movie, it had its moments. I think because this drags out so much is what hurt it for me. If it would've moved a bit faster, I think I would've enjoyed it. Brad Pitt's absurd voice aside, the only other character that was really enjoyable was Hugo Stiglitz. Didn't have much for screen time or dialogue but his appearances and intro were significant enough that he stood out more than most of the other Basterds and characters in the movie. I was really disappointed when they killed him off. Would love to see a movie strictly devoted to him because I like the character that much.<br/><br/>Not much for chicks here but the ones they did have were pretty tight. It's a mostly white male cast and the only black character in the whole movie seems to have lived after the ridiculous movie theater massacre climax. How fitting. Scalpings, chokings, carvings...the violence was pretty graphic when it was on display but it wasn't enough to save this flick. Hitler dying by gunfire in an exploding, flaming movie theater is probably gonna stick with the uninformed who'll think this movie is factual. I give it 5.5 out of 10. Tarantino fans and simpletons who are easy to please and don't require much in the way of plot won't be disappointed. Those who want a little more entertainment will be."

","Inglourious Basterds<br/><br/>""That's a bingo!"" A line used by the ironic winner of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Christoph Waltz, for his role as the German version of the over investigative Sherlock Holmes, Col. Hans Landa. Bingo! Is definitely what this film acquired with a perplexed yet astounding cast including the ever so talented Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine and the director/actor Eli Roth as the coined name, ""The Bear Jew"" a berserk home run hitting leader in Nazi's. Quentin Tarantino took an everlasting ten years to complete the screenplay for this fictitious outlook of Nazi Germany in World War II and released it in 2009. The enduring story is about a group of American born Jews, known as the Inglorious Basterds, who are shipped behind enemy lines to do one thing, kill Nazi's. Shot in settings such as France, Germany, and England, this Tarantinoesque film is an eye-catching, blistering, yet excessively heavy ingeniously dialogued representation of what to expect when watching a movie by Quentin. This flick by far takes a warm seat in my top ten films of all time, for the reason that the music plays a major role in many scenes and the acting on all fronts, no pun intended, is exceptionally, as Hitler would put it, Aryan.<br/><br/>Music in this film signifies the intensities of a lot of the scenes. Scenes of intensification such as the farm house scene is a great example of how music is used to augment the suspicion of what is about to happen. As Col. Landa (Waltz) figures out that Jews are hiding under the floorboards, the music begins at the start of what will build to the peak of a massacre. The way I see it, music in this film is used as a bridge to connect objects or people that have a disturbing flaw against one another. A scene that caught my attention was one that used music so perfectly as well as camera movement, is a scene when ""The Bear Jew"" is called upon to beat down on a Nazi. The scene flips back and forth slowly moving in closer to the face of the Nazi and the dark shadows that ""The Bear Jew"" is supposed to emerge out of, and while this is all happening the music is gradually increasing to give the setting a eerie feeling.<br/><br/>Music may have been a major factor for this film, but the acting surpasses that by a long run. Each actor had a certain style, Brad Pitt plays a straight to the point Tennessee cocaine snorting kind of guy, while on the other side, Christoph Waltz plays a sarcastic over- achieving Nazi detective. These different roles play a major part in the film because it gives the movie an overall amount of balance. The actors also had an exuberant amount of dialogue to rehearse, and I believe the way the dialogue was presented, adapted perfectly with Tarantino's famous style of ""Mexican Standoffs"". The overall acting is superb and going into a Tarantino film, I knew that the way he sets up his actors, will always be performances to remember.<br/><br/>Nominated eight times at the Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Inglorious Basterds is a riveting thrill ride that everyone should try. Yes there are long dialogue scenes but the direction of Tarantino is a unique style of art that can't get passed by; if at the Louvre would you pass the Mona Lisa without looking at it? Go rent Inglourious Basterds on DVD, and when you take it out of your tray, you'll be screaming, ""That's a Bingo!""<br/><br/><ul><li>Marcel Urena</li></ul><br/><br/>5/5"

","Another juvenile revenge fantasy brought to you by the master of the genre. Mr. Tarantino knows his demographic well, and he plays to it expertly here. Just as Ronald Reagan was directly responsible for the ""dumbing down"" of American political discourse, so too has QT taken on the responsibility for the dumbing down of American cinema.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt provides some unintentional laughs in the lead role of Lt. Aldo Raine. His hill-country accent is never believable. A descendant of American Indians, Raine is of course, the right man for the job. Especially the part about taking Nazi scalps. Ah, QT. You are certainly an equal opportunity offender.<br/><br/>Which brings to mind how uneasy I am about Mr. Tarantino taking on the mantle of filmmaker as fantasy avenger for the Jewish people. The holocaust and Nazi atrocities are not exactly the most apt sources for a farce such as this. I'm reminded of Roberto Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful,"" another misguided attempt at mining humor from a situation that was an abject nightmare for any and all of its unfortunate participants.<br/><br/>There are one or two set pieces that demonstrate Mr. Tarantino's skill at developing a well-realized scene. But overall, the effect is mind-numbingly sensational, and then, quickly forgettable. The movie is like a bad dream, whose bits and pieces you're unable to reconstruct into a cohesive whole. My greatest fear is that this piece of revisionist history will be remembered by its legion of youthful Tarantino enthusiasts as the way things actually went down. Thanks for nothing, QT."

"Chrysanthepop","Null","7","13","8 December 2009"," Not Very Glorious But Passable To An Extent
","So much hype but does the film deliver on its promises? Not exactly. Tarantino has managed to capture the European essence in his film. The sets, the landscapes, the costumes, the actors and the camera-work that gives a spacious feel of old Europe are well used. The film also has a polished look with some fine cinematography and background score. Most of Tarantino's films are ridden on dialogue and violence. 'Inglourious Basterds' is no exception but here he fails to create a balance unlike in his previous works ranging from 'Pulp Fiction' to 'Deathproof' where he succeeded in combining the two. Here, the dialogues are very long but most of the time they lack the meat and after some point they lose momentum. As someone who enjoys violence in movies, 'Inglourious Basterds' fails to deliver on that count too. For me the violence has to have some relevance to the story but here it appears a little out of place and safe (when compared to his other works). I didn't find the characters to be well developed either but some of the acting namely by a tortured Mélanie Laurent and a hateful Christoph Waltz was very good. Diane Kruger too manages to stand out in a brief role. Brad Pitt fails to impress. Daniel Brühl is passable. Overall, in my opinion, 'Inglourious Basterds' is a strictly average film mainly lifted by fine execution and a few notable sequences like the fire scene and the shootout in the bar."
"raimund-berger","5","7","13","5 December 2009"," Mediocre.
","We love Tarantino for his humor don't we. And how he weaves B class cinema and TV nostalgia into his films. And it does work really great, as long as it's about LA street thugs. As soon as he leaves the city though, and even more so when leaving the continent, his style unfortunately becomes rather a limitation than an asset.<br/><br/>I won't go into all the details. Because as soon as you see a bunch of SS guys approaching a house in France mixed with an italo spaghetti western style music score you'll realize it's gonna be ... stranded. The whole thing lying almost dead on the shore, hardly breathing before it all even really started.<br/><br/>So it's basically a fairy tale of the ""what if"" kind with two story lines. The basterds and Shosanna. The former is plain pitiful, which I myself wouldn't attribute to Pitt. I mean he's sure not a great actor, never has been. But I think he did OK with the material he was given, which in itself was poor. Nazi scalps, Apache style. How funny.<br/><br/>The Shosanna thread is the more elaborate and not that bad. Thanks to some pretty nice casting. The names to mention here would be Daniel Brühl and Christoph Waltz. Where the latter delivers the first remotely believable SS officer I've ever seen in an American financed movie, in my entire life. Kudos also to Tarantino here, for giving him the freedom. Also, if you want to see what a professional actor with proper stage experience can really do, Waltz is an example. Mélanie Laurent and Diane Kruger are both great too.<br/><br/>Still, the old trauma. Why can't we have top ranking Nazis portrayed realistically? Hollywood must be afraid that people could like them, especially when shown as they were in their prime time. So what we got here again is Goebbels and Hitler as clownish parodies, but listless as such. Obviously, Tarantino didn't dare to compete with Chaplin, who had the advantage of not knowing yet what Nazi Deutschland really was about. On the other hand, he didn't have the courage to go entirely realistic either. Outcome being: nothing. And boring as hell on top.<br/><br/>All this merely as a warning. To not expect too much, because this film effectively is lame. Besides the points mentioned above, the actors, I'd give it some points for nice cinematography and stuff, and amiable self referential cinema blah of the nouvelle vague kind. Where back then a large part of the films was about making films. Which might translate to: a large part of Tarantino films is about Tarantino films. OK sorry, that was a nasty thing to say.<br/><br/>Still, Tarantino did make a notable step towards showing halfway believable Nazi characters, in the shape of an SS officer and a Volksheld. Given the Anglo-American film history regarding the subject this might already be considered a major achievement. I wished he had gone whole length though. But if he had, the result likely wouldn't have sold that well. So welcome again to the American film industry."

"ruudpel","3","7","13","2 October 2009"," What was Tarantino thinking?
","I've always been a big fan of Tarantino, ever since of seeing Reservoir Dogs. Especially after seeing the Pulp Fiction masterpiece, every time a Tarantino movie comes out I turn into this little kid 'lemme see lemme see lemme seeeeeee!' So yesterday me and some friends saw the Basterds in the movie theater. At one point in the movie I was so annoyed and bored at the same time I've had to suppress the urge of getting up and walking away. What a crappy, crappy movie. My disappointment is almost indescribable. But let's get to the positive facts first; I've given this movie three stars out of ten, one star for the following actors who make this movie bearable to watch: Melanie Laurent, Diane Kruger and most of all Christoph Waltz. Both female leads in this film were excellent, especially Laurent, delivering a very emotional performance. Kruger was great as well, but I don't think anybody can deny Waltz really stole the show in this one. Hope this guy gets nominated for an Oscar because he sure does deserve one. So, why only three out of ten stars if the main performances were so great? Well first of, the lead actor, Brad Pitt, is simply horrible. The accent was incredibly fake and annoying and even though Pitt IS a capable actor, he really messed this one up. It's hard to describe what's so weird about Pitt's portrayal of Raine, but the ones who have seen this movie probably know what I mean. Secondly, the movie (more specifically, almost very single scene in the movie) is WAY to long/stretched out. The very first scene for example, as well as the scene in the pub when the three Basterds get into the gunfight with the Germans, are incredibly long and eventually boring. Sure, the acting in those scenes is generally superb, but the directing and the dialogs got on my nerves very quickly. What also really bothered me is that Tarantino took the time to introduce some of the characters, only to kill them off only a few minutes later. The British member of the Basterds is a good example of this, after watching that (too long, surprise surprise) scene with the British General, getting him killed in the bar gunfight. A lot of these 'random' things really bothered me about this movie. In the last part of the movie, B.J. Novak just stands next to Pitt as if he's mentally disabled, his eyes glazy and not saying anything. The whole conversation/interaction between Pitt and Waltz was so badly acted on Pitts part, it was simply hard to watch. The Germans letting Soshanna getting away in the first scene is, I think, very unrealistic. They even had motorcycles right there with them, why let the sole survivor escape? And that whole storyline about the German soldier who killed God how many U.S. soldiers is just (though very nicely acted by Bruhl) pathetic. And what the hell was up with that storyline about 'the Negro?' It made no sense at all. Well, I could go on, but like the movie, this text is becoming too long ;-) I do have to say two scenes were really awesome in this movie; the first scene would have been a classic if it weren't so long and stretched out. The two scenes that really make this movie are the ones that the Basterds interrogate and kill the Nazi in the ditch and the scene with the apfelstrudel. The interaction between Laurent and Waltz is simply amazing.<br/><br/>Two things left that bothered me greatly that deserve separate listings. First is that when you ask people what they thought of the movie, nine out of ten say 'it's a typical Tarantino movie.' No, it isn't. Nothing about this movie is Tarantino-like. There are no similarities between the Basterds and Reservoir Dogs/Jackie Brown/Pulp Fiction/etc at all. Some might say, what about the violence? Well, what about the violence? Sure, the scalping scene is very disturbing, but that's about it. This movie, besides that one scene, contains hardly any violence. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction had a lot more violence than this one, I think. The second thing that bothered me the most of all, is that this movie has no genre. It's not a war movie, it's not a drama, it's not a comedy, it's not a western, it's nothing. Tarantino should have picked one or two genres to stick to, but nothing suck so much as a movie that tries to be a dozen genres at the same time.<br/><br/>One can only hope this movie will be soon forgotten and that Tarantino, who I still deeply respect as a filmmaker, will get back to what he does best; make action-dramas with good camera-work, editing, acting and writing. He's lucky he got Waltz, Kruger and Laurent because they, in combination with the ditch and apfelstrudel scenes, saved this movie from going down the drain.<br/><br/>(oh and PS..Mike Myers? Quentin Quentin..what were you thinking?)"
"TheLittleSongbird","5","9","18","9 December 2010"," Well made with a brilliant Christoph Waltz but uneven and disjointed
","Now I like Quentin Tarantino's movies on the whole, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs being my favourites of his. But Inglorious Basterds, as much as I wanted to like it, is not among Tarantino's best.<br/><br/>Granted it is very well made, with the cinematography and scenery amazing. Also the music is superb and Christolph Waltz is brilliant as the SS colonel being both charming and deliciously evil. Despite these high points, in my point of view it is just too uneven. Story-wise, it is essentially a series of vignettes and of variable quality too. There are some highlights such as the opening and the resistance-bar rendezvous, but there are some dull and bloated parts too unfortunately. The script has its fair share of wit but it is also some very stilted and ropey dialogue too. The characters come across as rather caricatured and clichéd, and the other acting is so-so at best. I actually think Brad Pitt gives one of his weaker performances here I'm afraid to say. And I also don't think Tarantino's direction is innovative or authentic enough, while I didn't thinmk much of the ending.<br/><br/>Overall it has its moments but these moments weren't enough as a whole. The result is a disjointed and altogether disappointing and somewhat self-indulgent effort. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
"bob the moo","Null","9","18","9 December 2009"," What it perhaps lacks in heart and total production it more than covers with tension in well-acted and well-shot scenes (SPOILERS)
","Looking forward to my viewing of this film I must confess that I expected it to be a particularly self-indulgent mess. It is an idea that has been mentioned since Tarantino first burst onto the scene and had a lot of choices in what he did next and it is not a short film and, to be frank, Kill Bill did not really do much for me at all. Basterds starts with more though because instead of the tiresome excess that Kill Bill Volume 1 brought with it, this film has much more patience to it. The plot is a bit of a mess and others are correct when they say that in a way he is referencing propaganda films of the period but it does run longer than perhaps it can really sustain. Having so many characters is one of the problems perhaps but in another way the length is necessary because most of the scenes do run quite slowly. Those expecting a big Hollywood action movie will be disappointed but ironically enough the film's main selling point is how well so many of the individual scenes are done.<br/><br/>The dialogue sets it up because, whatever the language, it is mostly well written. Some is funny but mostly it works because it has a tension in each scene that is almost behind the dialogue – the ever present threat of violence or discovery or both. This makes you pay attention to each moment rather than being bored by the discussion taking place, because you know something is happening or something is being hidden behind the words, you're just not sure what will happen or who knows what. The cellar bar room scene is a perfect example because it does seem to have a lot of ""nothing"" happening but while this ""nothing"" is happening, the situation is feeling tenser and tenser. The same is true of the film's opening scene, the first face-to-face meeting of Shosanna and Landa and several other key scenes that have a real edge to them. Tarantino's direction is a big part of this working as well as it does on the screen. His shots are mostly very well framed and they add to the tension in a way that you notice because of how effective it is as a tool (although I suppose that could be taken as a criticism, if one is able to notice it happening). The dialogue scenes in particular are very well filmed because of the effect on the tension. The violence seems a little obvious and it is ironic that it is least effective when it is most gratuitous. Speaking of irony I would also have liked a bit more intelligence to the delivery of scenes where the viewer is clearly going to make a contrast in their head but yet the film offers nothing in the way of commentary or opinion; in particular this is telling where we are watching a Nazi propaganda film of Allies being gunned down to the crowd's delight, only to be put in the place of the in-film audience as we see Hitler and many other Nazis being gunned down and are probably having the same reaction.<br/><br/>This lack of insight is sort of the problem with the film because it does feel like it is constantly of the moment and doesn't have a lot of heart behind it. The total film feels less important than the specific scene and, while this does mean that the running time runs by with lots of strong scenes, it somehow doesn't feel quite as good when you look back on it. A quibble perhaps, when it is so engaging moment to moment, but it is still the impression I was left with. The cast are not so prone to problems though and indeed they seem to work best because of the focus on the scenes and the dialogue rather than anything else. For all the names in the film, it is Waltz who dominates the screen. His insincere facade and his playful menace makes many of his scenes occur on the edge of a knife and he is great every time he is on. Laurent herself does very good work but her material is not quite as strong as she has to carry more of the ""heart"" of the film – a ""heart"", as I said, which is not particularly strong. Pitt has a lot of fun and his sections of the film add to the dark comedy of the piece. Brühl is enjoyable in his turn as well – doing good work with Laurent. The supporting cast beyond this is mixed but mostly solid enough to do the specific jobs they are asked to do; personally though I found Roth, Myers, Novack and a few others to be distractions rather than additions to the film.<br/><br/>I went in to Inglourious Basterds unsure of what to expect from it and when I was finished I was quite pleased with what I had seen. It is a rather hollow film as a whole but it is surprisingly engaging thanks to how well the majority of the scenes are put together. What it perhaps lacks in heart and total production it more than covers with tension in well-acted and well-shot scenes with Tarantino's usual good use of music. Not a great total film perhaps but a very good demonstration of Tarantino's skills in how well it works as you watch it. Certainly an improvement on Kill Bill."

","I will keep this short.<br/><br/>Bit of a let down, Had some good moments. The first 10 minutes of the film are just gripping. Then fell flat. Some action, some script, o.k acting but I left just feeling that it should or could have been better.<br/><br/>Yes I laughed and cringed and the cinematography is done well but it wasn't enough to save this film. I almost wish he stayed with the original story instead of just taking the title and inventing a completely different story all together.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong I am a massive Tarantino fan. His work is truly amazing but this just didn't seem to have that flare he normally possesses."
"Veritas_Lux_Mea","7","9","18","23 August 2009"," Entertaining but Tarantino is stuck in revenge fantasy mode.
","The film was promoted with the phrase ""Once upon a time..."" both a tribute to one of Tarantino's heroes, Sergio Leone, and a tip off that the film presented would be a FANTASY. Tarantino has been stuck in strictly revenge fantasy mode since Kill Bill, as the two Bill films, Death Proof, and now Basterds are all nothing but revenge fantasies. He clearly let us know he was not making a film that presented us with accurate history. The Nazis in the film serve two purposes, comic relief and symbol of evil and the violent destruction of them fulfills the fantasy.<br/><br/>It is well known that Tarantino does not make films that are polite or in ""good taste"" he makes films that satisfy his childhood film fantasies. I can't imagine a person walking into a Tarantino film thinking they are going to get a history lesson or learn something. This has never been the point of a Tarantino film, he makes films to pay tribute to the pop culture and filmmakers he loves so much. He is not a complex filmmaker, he is a kid in a candy store and like that kid all he wants to do is overindulge himself. The ""fun"" in seeing one of his films is watching him do so with such glee.<br/><br/>This film is a big goofy mess, not meant to be taken seriously, the thing is you can either laugh along with Tarantino or walk away. I won't argue that there is plenty in this film, including the ending, which could obviously be seen as ""offensive to Jews"" and some of my Jewish friends have already told me they think the film is a travesty but I think the thing is you have to try to take into consideration Tarantino's intention, which was to make a film that would make the kid in him yell ""That's so cool!"" Is that sort of dumb considering Tarantino is an adult? Sure it is, but I guess watching the film is like watching kids open presents, they are thrilled and excited to be tearing off all that pretty colored paper...not very deep but it is true."

","Anyone who has read many of my previous reviews will know i have something of a gripe with Quentin Tarantino. Despite his unrivalled genius when it comes to cinematography and dialogue i always find his films to be a strudel without cream; a most unsatisfying prospect as Colonel Hans Landa will attest to. The lack in his previous work of any real tone of emotion and overload of dialogue (no matter how well written) lead me to find his creations far less immersive than the work of many other directors. However, Inglourious Basterds is a completely different batch of strudel. Never before has Tarantino's work been so transcendental, and never before has he made a film that i have found so complete.<br/><br/>If you haven't yet seen the film, you have good reason to be confused by my mention of Hans Landa. He is a little advertised character in IB, but no doubt steals the show. Christopher Waltz plays the ""Jew Hunter"" in such a convincing way, that i have felt genuine hatred for his character. His grotesquely charming creation is not only defined by his actions, but also by his ability to manipulate everyone from a lowly milk farmer to the British high command. i felt a pull in scenes involving Landa that i have never before felt during a previous Tarantino film, and it seems a perfect example of the director and actor working together and making something truly memorable. He really does steal the screen from far more well known actors.<br/><br/>Despite this, there is a real intrigue behind all characters in the movie. Pitt, making his debut in a Tarantino movie is brilliant as Lt Aldo Raine. He is as funny and smart as he is deep. Everything from his crooked smile to the unexplained scar along his neck adds to his presence on screen, and this is a blanket feeling. Each of the Basterds has their own distinctly different traits and Tarantino explores these in their actions, names and nicknames given by the German forces making a richer tapestry of characters than i am used to seeing. All cast members do a great job at creating an atmosphere as immersive as that of any film, a testament to the casting team, who somehow managed to cast effectively in 4 languages.<br/><br/>While all this is going on, the classic Tarantino cinematography and dialogue is still present, and never before have i seen a film incorporate humor alongside so many deeper issues as seamlessly. There is a witty quality to the script that leads to even long periods of dialogue with little or no camera movement to still be immersive and humorous. The blend of laughter and tension in many scenes is a rare and original concept captured perfectly.<br/><br/>Now from this review it sounds like a complex film and this couldn't be more true. In true QT style there are numerous story lines interwoven and this leads me to my only major gripe with the movie. Towards the end, it all comes together in something of a mishmash. You lose track of the differing motives of the different parties involved and you aren't aware of how much the different characters know of the others involvements. However, it is some climax. Unexpected, emotional and as always, brutal.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. At nearly 3 hours it would have been easy to make a confused mess of different plot lines buried under a mountain of dialogue pouring out of every bodily orifice, but nothing could be further from what we have here. No dialogue feels wasted and all scenes are aimed towards making the finale even more delicious. There is a simple way to describe how much i enjoyed this film. To paraphrase Lt Aldo Raine, ""I think this might just be his masterpiece""."
"kdavidbushnell","1","22","54","22 August 2009"," I waited for at least 6 months...
","I waited for along time to see this film. It sounded like a great premiss for a movie and a couple great actors who do an acceptional job but. Wow was this film an absolute disappointment. You really REALLy have to like QT amateur directing. His two best films and earliest films are good and appropriate for his directing style, Pulp Fiction and Resavoire Dogs (how ever you spell it) because the plot and story were so over the top and stylized. For a world war 2 movie, let alone a war movie his style of directing is ridiculous. IB's was the most over the top, and Wildly unrealistic war film I've ever seen. The end was incredibly stupid and unrealistic (Hollywood explosions and killing Nazis..Yea man!, no stupid as sh*t). The nazi general would have never been so stupid to make all these silly demands to a US official, let alone the whole end is just f#cking dumb that's just a tiny portion of its stupidity. <br/><br/>The music is similar to the last four Tarintino films and obviously he has some creative input on the music, and it doesn't match AT ALL, the music is so disproportionate just like every other element in this film. <br/><br/>His directing style needs to mature. Just like all film directors they have matured and corrected what needs to be for necessity of successful art. <br/><br/>I agree with someone on IMDb who stated that this movie was simply trying to entertain with violence and it sucks because there's nothing more to it besides one of the worst stories ever made up.<br/><br/>The action is QT and Hollywood cliché, and it's only there bc it's BS.<br/><br/>This was a bad excuse for a war story/plot to make Tarontinoesque violence. It sucked. <br/><br/>What kind of a movie was this, a failed attempt at a fantasy war? It's not historical fiction. It's not a drama (if it was it would need a much better plot and story), IT'S A GODMN MESS OF A FILM. EVERY OTHER FILM ON IMDb WITH TERRIBLE OVERWHELMING GENRE BLENDING GETS BAD RATINGS.... what about this movie? Worst story and genre blending in any movie ever!<br/><br/>LARGE disappointment! If you don't want to see an absurd and overrated action/war film do not see this. DID I MENTION THAT Hitler IS SHOT HUNDREDS OF TIMES? ARE YOU JOKING TARENTINO. I COULD WRITE THIS MOVIE! THE FACT THAT Hitler DIES IS JUST ABSURD, DORKY, LAME AND CHEESY. Sorry QT dorks, this movie f*cking sucked, worst story ever!!! Did I mention it's way too long."

","Quentin Terintino latest action film takes place in a Nazi occupied France. Brad Pitt stars as a American Jew- rebelling against the Nazi's. I thought this movie was alright. I actually almost disliked, the movie except for the amazing last scene in the film. (not going to give any spoilers away).<br/><br/>The beginning of the Film was fantastic the opening act was superb keeping me interested and wanting more and more of the film,then by the close to middle of the film, it all went downhill. From the appearance to actors who did not have to be in this movie to a bar fight that had no purpose the movie just got plane boring. The action scene's from the beginning of the movie disappeared and i felt like the movie was going no were. Quentin has lost his touch in my option but thats a hole different issue.<br/><br/>Although, the middle of the film bored me (almost to sleep) the end of the film was absolutely spectacular. Showed me that Quentin could still create one of the greatest acts of violence and death i have ever seen in cinema. This final act of hate, anger, revenge and a huge pool of other emotions allowed me to see the real potential that this movie had, just like it did in the beginning scene's of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, i give this film 5 stars out of 10, although it had one of the greatest action endings i have ever seen, the entire middle of the film, (which is a while because this film is around 2 hours and 30 minutes) was horrid and there was no action and nothing interesting at all. People may disagree and say Quentin is back and better but i say this movie was a interesting idea and well acted by Brad Pitt, and had an amazing final act but it just lacked the interest factor and the suspense and intrigue that Quentin's other movies such as Pulp Fiction, And Kill Bill both had."

","There are war movies, and there are war movies. Some people call ""Casablanca"" a war movie. I don't. War movies are supposed to depict actual fighting...you know, shooting and combat. I always feel especially cheated when they promote a film as a 'war' movie, and it involves little or no artillery fire. This film portrays a few minutes of horrendous bloodletting, but no actual on screen 'combat'.<br/><br/>It's the same old stuff you've seen from Tarantino. Threats, hostile situations, characters being backed into a corner, more threats, murders and mutilation. It features the usual round about dialogue, except here it goes on and on and on.<br/><br/>Some of the actors are entertaining. One guy gives the worst performance as Hitler I've ever seen. Brad Pitt acts like a clown.<br/><br/>So this isn't really a 'war' film. I thought it might be an updated version of the ""Dirty Dozen"" but it doesn't resemble that one at all.

","This film really should be called INDULGENT BASTARD. Sinking dread is a great suspense device in any film, that uneasy feeling of nervousness you get when the characters in whom you have invested some time and emotion get slightly trapped. However, in the tedious sequences in this indulgent serial killing schlock the suspense quickly evaporates and you get to just sit there until someone gets killed. And then, in this 150 minute film, Quentin kills them right before your eyes. You must pay attention because all the hypnotized media wannabees insist you wanna be 'cool' too, but for anyone watching with film with their own genuine heart, brain, and actual courage, well QT the emperor of cruelty has no clothes (again). Once, in older films when someone died it was a tragedy for the character and emotion evoked from the attentive audience. Like when Sonny was killed in The Godfather. Now-days thanks to QT, someone getting killed as cruelly and graphically as his blood-lust allows, it is actually akin what was, in a better film, the punchline of a joke or a song sequence in a musical. Now that he has teamed up with Jewish cinema hatemeister Eli Roth and decided to reboot THE WAR (something each is too young (in every way) to have experienced, they have simply created a Nazi pantomime that is an excuse to dress some out of work actors up as the Third Reich and then graphically kill and disgustingly scalp them right before your appalled eyes. And of course, the gorgeous women in this film get defiled humiliated and mercilessly killed in the most graphic close up QT's fevered misogynist hatred allows. So what's new about this episode of hatred? Well, it is well produced hatred, well photographed hatred and well decorated and designed hatred. Then in apocalyptic episode of bullet spraying hatred, it all burns up and disappears up the rectum of the history of over praised gimmick cinema. I do not care to see Eli Roth ever again, in film or in person, and I seriously wish the entire planet's inhabitants soon realize what a destructive influence he is on young minds. QT's desire to show human beings mercilessly mutilate each other is both unproductive in cinema and a one trick career that might just as easily burn out like the final few scenes in the climax of this pop comic drivel. There are laws against hate crimes and QT needs to have his career as chief hate dude consigned to the cutting room floor. The fact that people get killed in telling stories is one thing, but QT's films aren't just that, nor are they devices to tell a story, they are the whole story: the film exists to graphically show you as much hatred in the most gleeful way possible. And for that I condemn this rotten tedious stupid film."

","So, the wait for ""Basterds"" is finally over. Was it worth it?<br/><br/>Let's look at the negatives first.<br/><br/>Criticism 1: It was quite ""talkie"" for a war film.<br/><br/>Yes, this is true. but this is no ordinary war film. whilst it is (very) violent in places, as one would expect from a modern war film, the film is an exercise in characterisation and with this in mind, it is very successful. Landa, Dreyfus and Raine are brilliant lead characters whilst the supporting characters, namely Sgt. Donny Donowitz, Lt. Archie Hicox and Bridget Von Hammersmark, are wonderful characters. So while this is a very dialogue heavy film, the dialogue between the characters both forms the story and strengthens the characters.<br/><br/>Criticism 2: It was too bloody and violent.<br/><br/>OK, let us look at films like Hostel. The violence is so strong and so frequent that we as an audience are numb to it and it becomes boring by the end.<br/><br/>""Basterds"" is a war film after all so we can give it some leeway for being violent in places but it was realistic and it served a purpose.<br/><br/>Criticism 3: There was no story.<br/><br/>Like all of Tarantino's films (Jackie Brown aside) there is little story but whatever the story is, it is well executed and all plot holes are tied up by the end. When you go to see a Tarantino film, you should know what to expect by now.<br/><br/>Criticism 4: The music didn't fit.<br/><br/>I agree with this one on only one point. The David Bowie song, although it was used effectively and it suited the scene. The rest of the music was perfect for the film.<br/><br/>Criticism 5: It wasn't even remotely historically accurate.<br/><br/>Yes it was, the soldiers uniforms, set design, weapons, cinema (right down to the type of projector and films) were all accurate. it was only the story that was fiction.<br/><br/>So, was it worth the wait.

"come2whereimfrom","4","47","130","17 August 2009"," Another let down from the once great QT.
","So Quentin brings his unique directorial style to a film set in World War II and in doing so presents us with 'Allo 'Allo on crack, which I hasten to add is not a good thing. Once again told in chapters he impishly teases the audience by playing with the narrative, using quirky music and on screen graphics. Add in a couple of mates, a few stars and thank god one amazing performance and ladies and gentleman I give the 7th film by QT 'Inglourious Basterds'. Fortunately I wasn't expecting much from this film after his last three lacklustre attempts and so wasn't too disappointed when I finally saw it. The film they say is a 'return to form' for the director, who hasn't delivered since the underrated 'Jackie Brown' (in my opinion), but don't for one minute expect a return to past glories because this film has no idea what it's supposed to be. Part comedy, part drama, a distinct lack of action and overacting (in a film where he has spent so much time on getting Germans to speak French and vice versa with such attention to detail does he then get Mike Myers to play a caricatured British General?) cloud the plot which expects us to believe all sorts of preposterous aspects just because 'we are in the world of Tarantino'. It's crass, brash and at least an hour too long, but here's the crux everyone's cop out excuse is 'well that's what Tarantino does' to which my reply would be 'you are right of course but that's what he's being doing for 17 years, its wearing a little thin to see someone with obvious talent just treading water'. How many more slow motion walks with a funky bit of music do we need? How many more Samuel L Jackson voice overs? QT is like a child he just can't seem to grow up. There are however highlights (which is why I earlier referred to his obvious talent) Christopher Waltz as Col. Hans 'Jew Hunter' Landa stole the whole film for me and is one of the more comedic elements, there are still little touches of greatness in the camera work and audacious ideas, but for me its not enough. Brad 'Popeye' Pitt's performance is perhaps one of his worst and the dialogue at times goes on and on and without the ability to litter it with pop culture references just comes across as boring, there is even a scene he has stolen from one of his own earlier films. So ten years in gestation this vanity project feels like another up yours to Hollywood, on the one hand a geek trying to prove his knowledge by scattering references to early French and German cinema among the plot (the last few chapters centre around an art house cinema) and on the other a once infant terrible throwing his toys out of the pram because his last few films weren't as critically acclaimed, which is all well and good if you can back it up with the product. In the film Pitt's character cuts a swastika into the forehead of each Nazi he lets live, a permanent reminder of their crimes, on carving his last one he declares 'that may just be my masterpiece'. In fact it's just another swastika on another forehead and sadly this is just another Quentin Tarantino film in your local cinema."
"PrinceGonzo","3","18","43","24 August 2009"," Somewhat pornographic
","It's funny that Tarantino portrays German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels as an enemy in his film - because Hollywood seems to be quite a good pupil.<br/><br/>For Hollywood it's all the same, but of 100 Germans during WWII 10 were real Nazis and maybe 1 in 1.000 was a Nazi murderer (in a concentration camp, taking part in a war crime etc.). The ordinary Wehrmacht soldiers were no more Nazis than the about 10 percent in the whole German population and of course they were not murderers - they were just fighting bravely for their country (although they were not fighting for the good side, but at that time that was not so clear for most Germans - mass murder of the Jews for example was a state secret). Many American leaders and generals have expressed respect for Wehrmacht soldiers after WWII as honorable men.<br/><br/>Making a film that takes revenge of the real Nazi murderers - that's OK. By the way, there were and still are lots of Nazis in countries outside of Germany. But why making again and again and again films that make Germans and especially German soldiers subhuman beings you can just kill? Why are American brains so addicted to this primitive affect? Is it because you feel ashamed for the genocide on Native Americans and Black Americans? Does the American society leave you with so many dark emotions that you have to ab-react them in a racist way of manner - it's no excuse to hide behind a ""Jews / good Americans are taking revenge of bad Nazis"" - mask.<br/><br/>There is the scene where a highly decorated German soldier, who was captured by the ""basterds"", is tortured that he will be brutally killed if he does not betray the position of his comrades. He is very brave not to do so and then faces being murdered by the ""Bear Jew"". The whole scene is filmed as this were some funny baseball game. Is that cinema for apes? Can that really be funny? Are you sick when you enjoy watching such a scene? <br/><br/>Another scene: the cinema (within the film) is filled with some Nazi leaders like Hitler and Goebbels, but also lots of Wehrmacht soldiers, civilians, notably 3 schoolgirls. The theater is then locked, and the film tells you that it is now totally OK and great fun that all these people are now burned to death and additionally killed by machine guns. Is this the revenge for Hitler and Goebbels enjoying American soldiers being killed, by the way strongly reminiscent of American movie audiences enjoying it when Wehrmacht soldiers are killed? All in all a very weired massacre, and if you liked it, you are in my eyes either sick, evil or just very similar to the Nazi murderer you think you're taking revenge on.<br/><br/>So my résumé is... forget ""Inglorious Basterds"". See ""Deep Throat"" instead. It's the much better porn."

","""Inglourious Basterds"" is many things, but one thing it is not is a World War II drama. The setting is an alternate version of history, where Nazi-occupied France becomes the wild west for another of filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's Sergio Leone-inspired pulp action movies where various Jews can carry out their revenge fantasies on assorted members of the Third Reich.<br/><br/>A true QT film through and through, ""Basterds"" is smothered in the director's many trademarks, and calling cards are left at each of its lengthy and dynamically suspenseful scenes. From '60s-style title cards to narrative digressions to scenes set entirely around a table, fans of the filmmaker who revolutionized the writing and directing of film in the '90s will find his seventh feature film to completely satisfy their itch.<br/><br/>But does Tarantino's recklessly violent style have a place in telling a story that circumvents one of history's darkest chapters? That's a matter of personal taste. There's no doubting the filmmaker is in top form -- humorous and attention-grabbing, crafting some great characters and even better scenes -- but it's a style that's seen better applications than WWII.<br/><br/>Broken into chapters, ""Basterds"" introduces us to a couple main story lines that lead to an ultimate objective of revenge. If not for its pulp groundings, the film could be called ""Everbody Wants to Kill Hitler,"" for all intents and purposes. First there's Shoshanna, a young Jewish girl hiding in France who manages to escape when the farmer hiding her family confesses to the S.S. The scene is one of Tarantino's best, especially thanks to Christoph Waltz as the charming and delightfully intimidating Nazi Col. Hans Landa (aka ""the Jew hunter""), whose beguiling manner clashing with the serious undertones of the plot makes his performance worthy of nothing less than an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Then there are the Basterds, Jewish American soldiers under the command of Lt. Aldo Raine, a one-dimensional albeit hysterical character played just so by Brad Pitt. Raine is up for nothing but killing Nazis and making good sport of it, as is Eli Roth's character Sgt. Donowitz aka ""The Bear Jew,"" whose weapon of choice is a baseball bat. But no matter how outrageous it all sounds, there's nothing secretly fulfilling about Jews killing Nazis and that's part of the film's problem.<br/><br/>These stories come together in 1944, when Shoshanna is now running a movie theater (another predictable QT move) where the Nazi party hopes to show off its latest propaganda film, ""Nation's Pride,"" inviting the biggest names in the Nazi regime including the Fuhrer himself. This happening attracts the Basterds and even sparks vengeful thoughts for Shoshanna.<br/><br/>Of course preparing for such a plot brings need for deception, perfect fodder for these long intense scenes with inevitably violent conclusions along with of course the prowess of Waltz as Landa. Though for every brilliant set up, Tarantino brings it to climax with meaningless pulp. These violent battles and merciless killings send off vibrations that simply deaden upon hitting the air, not resonating through the rest of or after the film ends. That kind of bloody and clever outcome works great in films like ""Kill Bill"" or ""Pulp Fiction,"" where there's no realism to the circumstances of the violence, but it comes off as immature in the context of WWII and the Holocaust.<br/><br/>Perhaps I should have expected no less from the master of climactic deaths, but there's an unignorable side to ""Basterds"" and that's the emotional depth of the Holocaust and the terrible war surrounding it. When this sense of humor is effective, many people may feel guilty being entertained comically by ""Basterds,"" and at other times they might find it feels stupid and pointless. Then again, many might push the historical context aside and delight in all of the style and excellent craftsmanship.<br/><br/>So despite Tarantino's brilliance, all of which manifests itself through different scenes and character in ""Basterds,"" nothing accounts for the rift between how many viewers think about WWII as they watch a film about it (fictional or not) and how viewers watch a Tarantino film, a genre in itself that carries its own set of expectations. It can almost be best described in this way: Either wild west Ennio Morricone music set to Jews killing Germans in WWII works for you or the clash is a bit too unnatural. Either way, you respect the talents of the filmmaker. ~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"

","What is the fascination with Quentin Tarantino? He is the Larry Flynt of violence; reveling in it, smearing it all over the screen, forcing the viewer to overdose on it. His films are all about violence for its own sake; there is no greater artistic merit to this filth, no matter how many allegedly intelligent critics effusively praise it.<br/><br/>The message this movie sends is truly frightening. The ""good guys"" set out on a mission to brutalize the ""bad guys."" Our ""heroes"" do nothing laudatory at all throughout the movie, except to violently destroy ""bad guys."" They have no scruples, no principles and no morality. This is typical of those who inhabit Tarantino's warped, pornographic world. As another reviewer noted here, this film unintentionally causes the viewer (at least those viewers with any semblance of decency) to sympathize with the Nazis. That certainly can't be what Tarantino was trying to achieve.<br/><br/>""Inglorious Bastards"" is political correctness gone amuck, armed with an electric buzz saw. The cartoonish caricatures, the vapid, sophomoric revision of history, the profane ""might makes right"" credo- all of it should make any halfway intelligent and sensitive person cringe in disbelief. Brad Pitt's accent is about as ridiculous as any I've ever heard; he would have been laughed off the stage of most elementary school productions.<br/><br/>Those who think our civilization is collapsing will not be comforted by this film. Tarantino is an overrated, vile filmmaker who has perhaps produced his ""masterpiece"" here. Or at least we can hope."

","I have never been a fan of the poster child of graphic violence. The only Tarantino film I ever reached the end of was 'Four Rooms', and he only did a quarter of that. <br/><br/>Quentin, if you're reading this, your films - including this one - disgust me. <br/><br/>How can you possibly imagine that it is entertaining to watch someone, in graphic detail, being scalped? Or to watch someone poke their finger into an open wound to deliberately inflict pain? How is this entertainment? <br/><br/>I see you say (quoted here on IMDb) : ""What if a kid goes to school after seeing Kill Bill and starts slicing up other kids? You know, I'll take that chance! Violent films don't turn children into violent people. They may turn them into violent filmmakers but that's another matter altogether.""<br/><br/>Are you really so naive to believe that your films don't influence kids? Or unstable adults? I can only suppose you grew up in a perfect middle-class world where kids do their homework when they're told to, and respect their parents. Where I live, it's not like that. Kids are bored, undisciplined and violent. And that's before they get high on cheap drugs and alcohol and decide to skin the neighbours cat - like they saw in your film. I agree, violent films don't turn non-violent people into violent people, but they DO give violent people new ideas. <br/><br/>When are you going to grow up and realise that we're not all 10 years old any more? Actions have consequences. You are in a position to show kids that there are alternatives to violence. Or do you prefer that they go around sticking hypodermic needles into each other?"

","Inglorious Bastards has one of the greatest first acts of any war movie I have ever watched. With a perfect combination of acting, directing and set design, the scene is both unbearably tense yet painfully subtle. By simply changing it to black and white, the entire performance could be slipped right into Shindler's List without any additional modifications. It seemed to be a prelude to what would be perhaps the best war movie to hit theaters in this century. But I was mislead.<br/><br/>As soon as the next 'chapter' began, it became obvious that the rest of the movie would not be able to live up to it's introduction. Going back and forth between excruciatingly dull and unrealistically Hollywood, you have to start to wonder if there were two different production teams making the same movie. It only comes close to reaching the initial level in a later scene that takes place in a pub containing both Germans soldiers and undercover English agents, but even that is slightly distracted by a very brief flashback with an electric guitar overplay.<br/><br/>The actual plot of the film apparently takes place in some bizarre alternate universe where the events that occur are not even close to reality. Perhaps there is some higher artistic goal here, but it is completely lost on me. In addition, the Nazi high command is portrayed so unrealistically, that you can't even hate Hitler because he comes off more like a cartoon character than the leader of the Third Reich.<br/><br/>I do not want to say Inglorious Bastards is not worth seeing, but rather don't expect a serious World War II movie, even after watching the first act."
"davideo-2","4","6","11","5 May 2010"," Misfiring, self indulgent latest addition to the Tarantino staple
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>During the second world war, in Nazi occupied France, a young girl witnesses the execution of her family at the hands of Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), barely escaping herself. Years later, that young girl has grown into Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) a cinema owner who has big plans for revenge at a big premiere that the German army will be attending. Meanwhile, similar plans for retribution are in mind for a group of Jewish-American soldiers calling themselves 'The Basterds', lead by tough nut hill billy Aldo Reine (Brad Pitt) who plan to leave their mark on the monsters by killing them- and taking their scalps as trophies.<br/><br/>Despite being one of the most recognised and influential writer/directors of our time, Quentin Tarantino is one of the most selective men in the business, dishing out new material once every blue moon. His latest work, a loose remake of an old war film with the same name, revolves around one of the biggest themes that his films are known for- revenge. Violent, bloody revenge, to be more precise. It's lacking the fun, vibrant edge of the Kill Bill films and for all it's brutality, does display a more mature, rounded edge than most of his work. This is a blessing and a curse, though, because Inglorious Basterds is simply no fun at all. In fact, it's deadly boring. The kiss arse film magazines and aficianardos have fallen over themselves with praise as usual, trying to make everyone feel it's another absolute work of genius and that Tarantino can do no wrong, but to a wider demographic of the audience, the film will just come over as pretentious and wholly self indulgent, thinking it's so clever but really just too big for it's boots. Most of the dialogue is over the top and completely unbelievable and the film pretentiously plays in different 'chapters', like it's some deep, meaningful piece of art and not just the usual Tarantino blood fest. Performances wise, Pitt carries the lead role well, not leaving a huge mark or creating a truly memorable character, but doing the best he can and to be fair, the supporting cast, including Laurent, Waltz, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender and Diane Kruger, are all on top form too but the material weighs them down.<br/><br/>Those not screaming about the genius writing and directing will, as usual, be complaining about the violence, but despite some nasty scenes, it's hard to see it as a film that in any way really glorifies violence or stylises it, as some of Tarantino's past films arguably have. All the same, though, it's a slow, uppity mess of a film that is so far up itself it loses touch with what made it's directors films so great in the first place. **"

","Inglorious Basterds is yet another flashy exercise in pulp excess taking liberties as much with history as accents. Pitt and co play the titular basterds who operate behind enemy lines scalping Nazis (Pitt demands 100 scalps per member of his unit) culminating in a plot to wipe out the nazi hierarchy at a Parisian film premiere. Unbeknowknst to them the cinema's owner is plotting almost precisely the same thing. Eventually the 2 groups' paths collide in the film's explosive cinematic climax. Personally, i didn't enjoy it much, nor was there much chance I was going to as the thought of Tarantino directing a war film fills me with bemusement - like Leone directing a comedy. His overwrought self-satisfied style is all over this like the cream on the strudel in one restaurant scene. Every scene is planned to look and sound as cool as possible, removing any semblance of naturalism from the product in the process. The table conversations that fill the majority of the runtime never sound like a conversation people do or would actually have, rather they're pure script delivered by actors who sound only like they are delivering lines. The emotional vacuum in these scenes and others runs to the heart of what's wrong with what promised from its beginnings to have some substance to it yet with conversational emotion understated out of existence and the emotionless murders that make up the film's action there's nothing left for the viewer to latch on to. We're never supposed to empathise with anyone in the film because we're never given the chance, everyone is a basterd in this - the women perhaps moreso than the men and no one wins in the end. Nihilism? Not quite. Just a film that starts slowly, never gets out of a canter then gets lost along the way choosing to retire early rather than finish the race. Not the best couple of hours i've ever spent by any stretch."
"gabriel@arq.net","4","6","11","28 January 2010"," One among many terrible, awful films you should really, really see.
","Inglourious Basterds is just one of those really terrible, just G-dawful films that, frankly, you will probably really enjoy a heck of a lot and you should probably see just because it will actually make you feel good. If you like a terrible movie like ""Shadowboxer"" that just has to be seen, then see this one, too.<br/><br/>The acting is terrible, but the parts aren't meant for great actors. Amateurs could perform as intended.<br/><br/>The cinematography is surprising. Several scenes will seem familiar or cliché, and yet you'll notice an unconventional angle was chosen and appreciate that it was the best angle for that scene, or some unconventional pan that conveys perfectly the scene's direction and momentum. The camera and choreography were refreshing. It's a knee-jerk reaction these days that ""the unconventional camera work was overdone, false ambition"". That doesn't apply, here. Tarantino seems to use the camera to carve beautiful, curling lines through the cinema space.<br/><br/>The color scheme is based on the Nazi flag. It's cheaply and effortlessly presented, out front, that no shame was felt in being so obvious. That's a sense you get through the whole movie, a shrugging ""so what"" from the director, ""I know, how cheap, just watch this next part"". It's shameless and efficient, and the director's attitude justifies the title.<br/><br/>The movie is about the megalomania of war entertainment. How else to phrase that: ""war-based entertainment"" is superlative; ""war movies"" doesn't quite capture all of it; ""glorification of war"" is the impetus, not the form. The movie does actually present a message that ""war is anything but glorious"", but it is so quick and unapparent that it barely counts as the point of the movie. The rest of the movie is purely about glorifying war, on purpose. The movie's entire plot is about the use of the recording and recounting of war as a glorious pursuit for the sake of manipulating public consensus, or for the sake of turning a dollar, or for the sake of continuing a tradition, upbringing, or pastime. The ironies involve what you could say is a ""film-maker's guilt"": that inevitably, like all of modern technology, much of the advances in film we rely on today were made under the auspices of war propaganda, and that ultimately war propaganda is about instant gratification and megalomaniacal pursuits. The reason such propaganda and films in general are useful is because they are effective, effective because the film maker knows how to engage the audience, who are engaged because they relate so well they become immersed in the film to some extent. It becomes ""realistic"" to them as they watch it. This was not quite understood before World War Two; it is well understood, today, and perhaps was the entire expression of the ""New Wave"" in cinema. Today we have immersive, interactive environments where a person can fulfill their megalomaniacal desires and destroy hundreds of simulated human targets in a short period of time; this is called ""realistic"", ""battle simulator"", and so on, and not just by way of marketing. ""Inglourious Basterds"" symbolises the advent of the wholesale destruction of human lives as a pair of characters, one representing the half that is the real mechanism of war, and the other representing the portrayal of that for whatever purpose -- entertainment, propaganda and disinformation, training and briefing, conditioning, pre-conditioning, conditioned response sublimation, post-hypnotic immersive deprogramming, career choice, and so on.<br/><br/>All of that aside, the movie addresses the issue of racial stereotyping being bolstered by cinema. Obviously, people form stereotypes primarily based on direct experience and to a lesser extent information from others. In a state such as that, a person can be expected to have their stereotypes removed by further experience, or to have them reinforced by the same. Granted, you can use film as that form of ""information from others"" to lend suggestions of stereotypes to someone, but they may be just as easily rejected by the audience. Now, consider a film industry that is notoriously typecasting, where you only see people of certain ""racial"" heritage in certain roles. Russians, Slavs, and African descendants all complain of this occurring overmuch in Hollywood. The movie doesn't appear to address the issue of how Russians and Slavs are typecast as mobsters, vampires, bad guys, and so on, but it at least addresses the problems that African-Americans have faced historically in the film industry, in as quickly, directly, and obviously as it addresses ""war isn't glorious"". A person who is being informed by film is going to have a source of information that not only tries to present stereotypes, it tries to ensure that those stereotypes appear to be true in the world as far as film allows the world to be presented. ""Slavs are all Dracula? Thanks, Hollywood! Blacks all have to die right away or they're going to escape and tear up the Empire? Thanks, Hollywood! Russians are all American-hating mobsters? Thanks, Hollywood!"" Obviously such stereotypes are not true in the real world, but try and admonish Hollywood about it and get them to stop making that impression. Tarantino gives just that a shot.<br/><br/>Tarantino also expresses what I would say is probably a profound dislike for Nazis in general, and I would guess probably by way of the fundamentals they tried to stand for. If anything, you can say the movie is Tarantino's self-validation of his morals. ""I'm a good person -- look what my fantasies are."" Besides all of the artsy ""message"" content, or ""what this means about the director"" and so on, it's just a terrible comedy. I can't even say it's ""action"" -- there are all of two action scenes, and one is barely ""action"". The rest is just a bunch of violence. It's a bloody, gory, horrifying comedy."

Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller takes a rapid interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theater she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the ""Basterds"", a group of Jewish-American guerilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history...<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that despite my love for cinema and the number of films I watch per week, I never payed much attention to Quentin Tarantino's work. I did saw Kill Bill some time ago but I really didn't like it. Having said that, I'm well aware of Tarantino's style and formula and here he presented us with more from the same.The question that ensues is, are you a fan of Tarantino? For someone that enjoyed his previous work this film will probably be a delight; for me, I wouldn't say it was a disappointment, because knowing the kind of films Tarantino does, I was already expecting something among the lines of what I saw but I guess I still had a little bit of hope this film would be different.As I see it, Inglourious Basterds is painfully long and for the most part it feels inert with never ending dialog that isn't really necessary.The acting was completely over the top, specially Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz. Despite being known as the pretty boy in Hollywood I consider Brad Pitt to be one of the finest actors out there and he has starred in some of my favorite movies but his acting here is just all over the place.Then again, this is a Tarantino movie, so this is expected. The beautiful Diane Kruger who I usually enjoy watching didn't stood up for me either,I don't know if it was the fact that she spoke German most of the time and I'm used to see her speaking English or if I was just fed up with the movie by then but something was a little off with her.Anyway, as I mentioned before, in the end, it all comes down to a matter of taste,fans of Tarantino will most likely be pleased and non-fans will probably dislike the film.

That Hitler together with the most notorious Nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about the killing of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in Paris is unbelievably ridiculous. the Nazis laughing and hooraying each killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game stupid. It truly dwarfed the whole Nazi - Jews conflict and is a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the Nazis. Its disgusting. This is from a guy in love with his own writing. It isn't Inglorious, its disgusting. A bunch of Americans enters Nazi-occupied France and starts slaughtering Germans. You see them scalping their enemies and beating them to death with baseball bats. While making jokes, of course. It is exceptionally brutal and disgusting. Underneath lies a subtle political message, because it is again ""the good guys"" killing ""bad Nazis"". The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around. Could you imagine Nazis (while making jokes) killing everybody in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers?

I do agree that Christoph Waltz did a nice job acting in the role of Col Hans Landa, but realistically, if he gave the same performance in a less hyped movie, he would have fell through the cracks on Oscar night.<br/><br/>About 2 of the 2.5 hours of this movie consisted of pointless dialog leading to very telegraphed and predicable outcomes.

Herr Flick's character is present in at least four of the side characters. There are too many logical glitches to anyone but the most ignorant.

","This must be said first and foremost--if you HATE violent films, then don't watch this film. The film is filled with ultra-violent images that will turn your stomach--scalpings, machine gunnings, fire bombs roasting crowds of people and the like. My assumption, and I am NOT trying to be sexist, is that in general guys will like it more than women--though I know that there are man exceptions. If you look at the demographic breakdown on IMDb of votes, this doesn't reveal any difference between men and women...unless you look carefully. You'll see that men have outvoted women 10-1! It is, simply put, a ""guy film"".<br/><br/>Second, the film has almost nothing to do with the original ""The Inglorious Bastards: (1978)--other than the fact they were both about American soldiers fighting the Nazis. Both are very good and in a homage to the original, director Tarantino cast Bo Svenson (from the original film) in a role in the accompanying DVD extra ""Nation's Pride"". This new version is more like a Spaghetti Western than the earlier film--complete with music in many places of the film that would have worked great in a Sergio Leone movie.<br/><br/>Third, although Tarantino did NOT mean for this to be realistic in the least, I hope that you don't believe that this is in any way based on history. Sure, there are some similarities, but so much of it is pure fantasy. There was no such military group like the ""Basterds"" and American soldiers did not do what these guys did! Heck, they made the ""Dirty Dozen"" look like pacifists!! And, unless you are a total idiot, you'll realize that the ending did not really occur!! <br/><br/>As for the plot, I'll skip discussing that as the film came out several months ago and by now lots and lots of reviewers have already discussed this to death. Instead, I'll just say what I liked. Brad Pitt was terrific in the nominal lead. While he was NOT in the film as much as you might expect, he was hilarious and I loved his accent that was highly reminiscent of George Clooney in ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"". Also, the German Colonel was amazing--speaking four different languages and making a great villain. The action was great and the film very enjoyable--but not as action-packed as you might think based on the commercials. Lots of fun and an interesting film because of all it's inside jokes, references to other films and it seeming a lot like a movie serial version of WWII. Watch this one."

Not enough fun, in general. Must say that the entire cinema was disappointed, people left in silence, without any enthusiasm or clapping. Too much talking, which is not a brilliant as they say, simply talking. Some developments are ridiculously stupid, too much even for such a far-fetched premise: the risky, aggressive behaviour of the English spy in the bar, the fact that a common soldier in a bar speaks fluent English, the fact they manage to lock down the entire theater - with the cream of Nazi German machine in it - without anyone outside noticing it, or a shrewd Nazi officer negotiating the terms of his surrender with English command... on the phone! If Germans were so stupid the war would have been over after 6 months, not 6 years. At least if the film were more funny, witty, but it weren't.

Those film reels are burning faster than paper quick get me an expert on flammable material.<br/><br/>The German characters and Jewish characters speak German and French and therefore its subtitled for a lot of the film which is not really what I'm after when I go to watch a movie I'm after a visual audio experience, but luckily some of the scenes wouldn't of worked like that so conveniently the director switches the same people to speaking English at the drop of a hat.<br/><br/>In a nut shell it is a very long drawn out film not historically accurate with long scenes usually set in one room where at the end you know someone will get shot and you really don't care who, and by that time you have fallen asleep anyways the gunfire will wake you up briefly but then you can snooze off again for another 30 mins.<br/><br/>Some critics have said that Quentin should have been reeled in when making this movie, I personally think he should have been wheeled out."
"madness237","3","18","44","2 September 2009"," Disappointing Film Fails To Gel
","By far the worst film Tarantino has made to day, this rambling mess of a movie fails on several levels, and ultimately leaves one unsatisfied.<br/><br/>First of all there is the matter of the misleading title and advertising campaign. This is not a movie about the Inglorious Basterds and their war against the Nazis. The Basterds are, at best, secondary characters in this film. Of the eight Basterds, only two have speaking lines, and six of them are never seen after the first thirty minutes of the film. They don't die, the movie just forgets they exist.<br/><br/>In fact, we see little evidence that the Basterds are even an effective fighting force, and we mostly have to rely on other characters assurances that they are scary. There are very few battle scenes, and those that do exist are extremely short. With the exception of a brief prison breakout -- seen entirely in a 30 second flashback! -- we never actually see the Basterds operate as a combat unit. If you go to see this film expecting the Dirty Dozen Tarantino Style -- which the ad campaign seems to promise -- you will be sorely, sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>Worse though was the complete and utter lack of character development for any of the Basterds. The only member who gets a back-story is ignominiously shot later, leaving one to wonder why Tarantino even bothered to name him (as he doesn't name the majority of the Basterds). We're simply never given any reason to care about the characters the movie is NAMED AFTER. It's almost surreal.<br/><br/>The most developed characters in the film are a French Jewish woman whose family is killed by a SS officer, that same SS officer, and a German soldier turned film star. The movie focused almost entirely on these three characters -- most of whom never even meet the Basterds! Its as if the movie's subplot took over the film, and it leaves you wondering if the movie about the Basterds promised by the trailers was left on the cutting room floor. Several other characters are given lengthy introduction scenes, then quickly discarded.<br/><br/>Other flaws include the soundtrack, which is full of modern songs, including a David Bowie track that calls far too much attention to itself and was a major distraction, as well as a ridiculous and somewhat surreal Mike Myers cameo.<br/><br/>Many scenes seem to wander aimlessly and by the time the film came to an end I was yawning and ready to go. All if all, this film completely failed to deliver on its promises -- even the blood, gore and mayhem were relatively tame. While there are definitely some funny lines and a few really excellent scenes, and the subplot involving the Jewish girl is interesting, the movie fails to gel into anything coherent, and the resulting mess feels half-baked. This one definitely should have spent more time in development."

","I never really write on this site, maybe once or twice before. I however feel obliged to after seeing this. I wont be long and I wont give anything away. I will just tell you this is simply his greatest movie. It is epic in every sense of the word. The plot is huge and beautifully woven together. Every actor from the smallest to the largest puts in a brilliant performance. Main credit must go to Christopher Waltz though, who delivers the single most chilling performance in cinema since well since I can not remember. As always the music used is wonderful and adds so much to what ever scene it has been used in. I could go on and on, but I wont as I really do not know how to sum how good this is. Just go watch it and decide for yourself. My opinion though is that it is just truly mind blowing."
"Flex_Mentallo","9","12","27","2 September 2009"," His Best since Pulp Fiction? (Yes)
","First off this is easily Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction. I'm not going to say that it rivals Pulp Fiction yet, but I might in about a week after this movie finishes swimming through my brain. The choice to have all the characters speak the languages they actually would be speaking adds a weird sense of realism and also works into the plot, in a way that makes a lot of since. Subtleties of accent and mannerism mean a lot. Also, great performances from the entire cast, especially Christoph Waltz, who won Best Actor at Cannes. In the first scene I missed some of the subtitles because I couldn't take my eyes off him. That good.<br/><br/>Speaking of the first scene, it was excellent, and sets up the motivations of a major character down the road. This and the bar scene are the two standouts in the movie; a slow, inevitable build, followed by a burst of violence. A-game material for all involved. <br/><br/>I'd also like to address the criticisms this film received for ""turning the Jews into Nazis"". That's simply not true. You see one major Jew character's family mercilessly slaughtered by Nazis early on, and you can imagine similar backgrounds for many of the Basterds, given their willingness to do violence to Nazis. The climax can be twisted to enforce the above statement, but I refuse to believe it. It's irresponsible for those critics to dismiss Tarantino as glorifying violence, but what he's actually doing is much trickier; he forces the viewer to deal with their own morality, and where they draw the line between justice and vengeance. The climax, in particular, teeters on the edge of satisfying and nightmarish, leaning more towards the second as the screams of the Nazis and laughs of the movie screen grow louder. It raises questions, and is aware of this. Tarantino is too masterful a filmmaker to be ignorant of his movie's message. <br/><br/>Yes, I said master filmmaker. And, I loved the way he worked film into the climax. I loved the way he worked film in this movie, period."
"lostinaction","10","12","27","20 August 2009"," Pulp Fiction goes France in WW 2
","I'm still impressed by this film directed by Quentin Tarantino. The last movie by him which impressed me that much was Pulp Fiction. All the ingredients I loved in Pulp Fiction I found again in Inglorious Basterds. I was totally impressed how Mr. Tarantino handled it to direct a movie with three languages. One of the reasons might be that he made right choices for the cast. Germans/Austrians are speaking German, Americans/British are speaking English and French are speaking French. Only one person in this movie can speak all three (four) languages fluently: the SS Officer Hans Landa. Hans Landa is portrayed by the Austrian actor Christoph Waltz. He must be some kind of a linguistic genius. To be precisely they are speaking a little Italian too. It's worth to watch the movie only to listen to the Italian from Brad Pitt. Unfortunately I don't speak any French but it was wonderful to listen to the other languages I know well. Next to Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt the beautiful French Actress Mèlanie Laurent convinced me.<br/><br/>This movie contains a lot of dialogues, humor, bloody violence and perfect acting. It reminded me a lot on Pulp Fiction. The most important thing I was positively surprised as I was about 15 years ago during watching Pulp Fiction. I'm a big fan of Spaghetti Westerns and it was fun hearing familiar sounds in the background. But I wished Tarantino would have used lesser known Music because some of them we already have heard in his former works. Inglorious Basterds includes everything what you need for a pleasant evening: well written dialogues and a lot of killed Nazis."

"hillside1231","10","13","30","30 August 2009"," Exhilarating
","I really don't know where to begin. First, i guess I will start with the critics of this movie. If you don't like this movie, you fit into one of two categories. 1. Someone who doesn't like Tarantino movies at all. 2. Someone who loves Tarantino a little bit too much and has a unconscious disbelief that Tarantino can deviate at all from his normal style and still make a wonderful, original movie.<br/><br/>Both groups are equally ridiculous to me.<br/><br/>This movie was absolutely PHENOMENAL. Any statements to the contrary are void of any REAL intellectual conviction, being, however, derived from one's arrogant intellectualism in their views of ""proper"" cinematic execution. This film was not an industrial norm. Nor an Indie film norm. It was exquisitely original.<br/><br/>The antagonist SS officer Hans, played by Christoph Waltz, was the most INSANELY well acted and portrayed villain I have seen in a movie or read in a book, over the last decade. The intensity of the scenes of dialogue between him and EVERY other character, which others have carelessly referred to as ""drawn out"" and ""pointless"", is perhaps some of the most thrilling bits of dialogue to come from Tarantino since Resovoir Dogs. This effect was extremely apparent in the initial scene of the movie where he is questioning a man who is hiding jews, as they lay motionless beneath the very floor they are conversing on top of. Absolutely paralyzing intensity, that was nearly able to be tasted, ingested, and digested in between each sentence. If the Academy fails to acknowledge Waltz's genius in his portrayal of this sadistic SS officer, it will be an absolute travesty and a complete dereliction of their duty to nominate the BEST performances for Oscar awards.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's performance could be viewed from different perspectives. The amateur-actor-like way he delivers his southern accent starts off unbelievable and irritating, but by the middle of the film becomes the most endearing attribute of his character, Leuitenant Aldo Raine. I wont give away the scene, but the part where he attempts to speak Italian is as equally inspired a vocal performance as his southern, though for different reasons.<br/><br/>The Basterds role in the film was executed perfectly. If you have too many scenes of scalping and mayhem, it would dilute the film into more of a Robert Rodriguez/Tarantino effort. But these characters were FANTASTICALLY simplistic and an utter joy to watch.<br/><br/>The parallel story of the victim in the massacre that begins the film is equally as gripping as the basterds. Considering the way the previews portray the film, I would say, a GENIUS blending of characters and genres is what ultimately takes place. The preview lures you in with action sequences. But you will leave feeling delightfully deceived. Not to say that violence and action is under represented in the film. The violence that does occur is utterly satisfying and quite a good blend of action, horror-core, and fantasy.<br/><br/>I will leave you with a simple statement. Go see it. Open minded. As if the trailer says that Quentin has invented a new genre. Compare it to nothing. And you will most definitely leave as wonderfully exhilarated as I was."
"southsidepopper","5","9","19","15 September 2009"," Waaaaaaaaay too much dialog
","Although the violence in this was brutal and graphic, I think this movie lacked action. 90% of this movie was them talking about the things they were going to do or already did. I enjoyed the story of the girl getting revenge on the Nazi's that killed her family much more than I enjoyed the ""Inglorious Basterds"". I liked how all the stories ended up coming together in the end. And speaking of the ending, that redeemed the movie completely. What the girl ended up doing in the movie theater was one of the most kick ass scenes I've seen in quite some time. But the ending doesn't completely make up for the utter lack of action and extremely slow pace of the movie. About halfway through I was about to walk out, but found that my buddy was asleep, so I decided to let him rest and finish watching the movie. If you plan on going to see it, prepare yourself for Quentin Tarentino's slowest, and most boring movie he's ever done."

Yeah, I get it - Tarrantino is trying to build tension - but he draws out the scenes too long and there isn't a payoff at the end of the boring, subtitled scenes.<br/><br/>The long boring scenes worked in Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill (for the most part) because it was characters (mobsters & assassins) who did terrible things to terrible people. But the idea of watching and hearing Nazi's being social and comical is off-putting and creepy. It just doesn't work - and this was evident from the half-filled theater."

I think Tarrentino is over rated.<br/><br/>Not a whole lot happens for it being a 2 and a half hour movie and then killing Hitler? really? I am sure Valkarye would have been a better movie if Tom Cruise had succeeded in killing Hitler but you cant just rewrite History like that. It did have some funny bits however, Brad Pit plays his part very well and the scene were they interrogate the Nazis with the bear Jew is very entertaining. However this is the only scene of torturing Nazis and one of only two involving the basterds themselves. From the trailer i assumed it would be a lot bloodier and a lot more killings. The long drawn out scenes did not build tension, they bored you until finally something happened which wasn't exactly great. People are sayin people who don't like this movie don't understand his genius etc, bollix, its not a hard movie to understand and people are saying its because its too violent. Its not even that violet, i recently seen Antichrist which is one of the most violent films ever made but it was still a great movie. Inglorious Basterds was just a bad movie, not because im too dumb to appreicate it, not because it was too bloody violent, just because i sat through 2 and a half hours of mi life that im not getting back just to go ""meh"". Even the ending was great, no real story, lets just kill some people. <br/><br/>I would say that any one who hasn't already judged this movie before even cin it ( Tarratino lick ass,) will not enjoy the movie.

Hes obviously in love with his own writing, but it just comes across as pretentious nonsense.Most scenes he just runs away with lots of this pointless dialogue.And its so corny and badly written, your quickly bored. The editing seemed to have been skipped in this film as large chunks are completely pointless.And with all the overly long scenes and drawn out dialogue, the film appears muddled.Even Brad Pitt seems embarrassed in some scenes, with the waste of his talents.Some of the actors do very well with what they're given.Christoph Waltz puts in a good performance, just a shame its all Quentins masturbating material. If you were wanting to watch the Inglorious Basterds, rampage through Germany.Killing dismembering any and all Nazi's, as the trailer hints, you will be disappointed.The Basterds aren't in the film much at all, 80% of the film is just conversation. In the end this movie was bad, very bad.And i think some of the actors should feel a bit of embarrassment for being involved.Christoph Waltz can hold his head high, but Pitt has got a major black mark to work off.Tarantino is way too in love with his work to make a good film anymore.And when he lacks he just copies from others, (just like Reservior Dogs which was unbelievably similar to a famous Asian film).He seems obsessed with becoming a legend or major name in cinema, like those who's techniques and styles he copies.He calls it homage i call it just plagiarism.While once he was original at least, now hes a self obsessed mad man."
"alisoncolegrooveq","2","16","39","26 August 2009"," A disappointed fan...
","Many reviews you will read here claim that this is a return to form for Tarantino...<br/><br/>I went into this film absolutely open minded and ready to be entertained, the first 'Chapter' is certainly promising with it's taut tension and fantastic climax...<br/><br/>sadly its a wobbly roller-coaster all downhill from there...despite some excellent performances (though i hardly think Brad Pitt in 'boofhead / Burn After Reading mode qualifies as one of them), but the tension builds and dissipates unevenly, even the standout scenes such as the cellar and cinema climax. Part of the problem is there's just SO MUCH going on, a subtext on both films and violence,knowing references to other war, spaghetti western, European art and exploitation films that Basterds is a twitchy and uneven mess despite some wonderful moments.<br/><br/>The plot is two converging but extremely predictable lines, and in a sense that is one of the problems, often we know whats going to happen and don't care much when we get there...this is a marked contrast to the snappy editing and craft on display in his earlier films.<br/><br/>The titular Basterds themselves (please dummies who question the intentional spelling need to watch closer!) are not much more than a weak half baked exploitation ensemble/distraction/ device from the main action with our heroine whose own plot seems to career to a predictable campy end...we hardly 'know her' enough to feel much in amidst the heavy handed 'cleverness' of the final cinema scenes...<br/><br/>Personally i did not find the film very violent compared to most, and that's more to do with the uneven suspense I think...it will be interesting to see how time treats this film. Perhaps I'll grow to love it, though i hardly feel compelled to see it again.<br/><br/>My gut feeling is critics are praising it more for the heavy handed cinematic subtext and Kubrick-esquire attempts at humor - however lame. It's never completely boring during it's 2 hour plus duration, nor is it very compelling or involving... It's also possible younger cinema fans feel like they're discovering Tarantino for themselves...hopefully they'll do a little more exploring to discover that this is a much weaker effort than his previous work.<br/><br/>Go in with extremely low expectations..or just go next door to District 9 for a real hoot.."

"CultGuy1","1","7","14","28 December 2009"," Hideous and offensive
","As a fan of the work of Tarantino, it pains me to say that I found this film hideous and offensive. Not to mention historically inaccurate. The director stereotypes his characters in what one imagines he thought was a comic way. Tarantino is WAY off-mark here. Not only does his anti-semitism permiates each frame, so does his hatred of the German speaking nations. I found this film terribly offensive and the satire that Tarantino was obviously aiming for turned out to be nothing but racial gutter humor. Perhaps its time Tarantino found his own bunker and shot himself. This kind of film-making should NOT be tolerated! Tarantino contributed much to fringe cinema. Perhaps its time for him to move on. He seems to have become THE MAN FROM Hollywood. The character he played in FOUR ROOMS! Anyone who enjoys this film should apply for membership to the neo-Nazi's. Shame on you QUENTIN!"
"Cinemadharma","6","7","14","23 August 2009"," An incohesive film made by an inconsistent basterd.
","In the 1st 10 minutes of the films, Tarantino used about 10 different fonts for various on screen titles. Might not seem like a big deal to most folks, but it is an early example of the films' sloppy inconsistency. QT has always liked to mix genres, most successfully in the Kill Bill films, and I'm fine with that. But here, his A.D.D.-enabled multi-style style is at its most random and really doesn't work for what this film could've been. (I considered offering a list of all the inconsistencies, but my reviews are generally too long anyway.) What I had hoped for, and what the trailer seemed to promise, was a Dirty Dozen homage, where a team of badass characters are assembled with the mission of killing Nazis. Generally, in that type of group mission film (Dirty Dozen, Oceans 11, The Seven Samurai or even QT's own Reservoir Dogs), you'd get to know a bit about each of the members of the team, building some kind of relationship between the various characters and the audience. But QT doesn't take the time to do that. We never really get to know any of the people in the film. Instead, he spends a few slow 20 minute sections in ways that don't enhance our relationships with the characters, the story or the film overall.<br/><br/>So what's good? 1. The film does offer some fantastically funny and quirky performances. Brad Pitt is hilarious, and the film's main villain SS Col. Landa, played by Christoph Waltz, is as funny as he is batshit crazy evil. Pretty much all of the supporting cast, with the exception perhaps of 1 or 2 of the 'Basterds', are also noteworthy. 2. No one knows how to use music in films better than Q. 3. A bunch of Jews kick a whole bunch of Nazi butt in some particularly gratifying (and gruesomely violent) ways.<br/><br/>Final say? Disappointing, but worth seeing. Not for the kids or for people who don't like seeing Nazis die."
"MOscarbradley","10","11","25","23 August 2009"," At last, a real return to form
","First and foremost, Quentin Tarnatino's greatest love affair has been with the cinema itself and if he finds masterpieces in trash and the exploitation genre that the rest of us are oblivious to, it's hardly a crime. Indeed his passion for lost and forgotten genre pictures has rescued many a career and put the odd new face on the international map. Referencing other movies is, of course, nothing new and almost every auteur has at least one 'homage' in him. However, for Tarantino, 'homage' has virtually become his livelihood. And, of course, like all homages sometimes they work and sometimes they don't.<br/><br/>Film-buffs love them and often spend most of the movie picking out the references and this can sometimes spoil the fun; the fun of simply watching the movie and enjoying the plot. There is a great deal to enjoy in ""Inglourious Basterds"". This is Tarantino's homage to the war picture but it's just as much a pastiche of the Spaghetti Western, (the score, from opening bars of 'The Green Leaves of Summer' from Wayne's ""The Alamo"", is mostly made up of bits and pieces from other films and all sounding faintly 'Djangoesque'). Primarily, of course, it's a homage to the cinema itself, both the notion of 'film' and the place where films are shown.<br/><br/>The Basterds, (the title is taken from the English title of the little seen Italian movie ""Quel Maledetto Treno Blindato""), are a kind of Dirty Dozen presided over by Brad Pitt's gung-ho 'Apache' descendant, dropped into Nazi occupied France with the sole purpose of killing (and scalping) Nazis, but while Pitt is ostensibly the film's star the Basterds are only one strand of a diffuse plot, (the film is told in chapters), that introduces a number of other characters, all of whom become involved in a plot to kill the entire Nazi High Command, including Der Fuhrer himself. And since this is a fantasy, a cartoon of extreme violence, (thankfully only amounting to a very short period of screen time), it bears no relation to accuracy or history. Tarantino gathers his protagonists in and around a small Parisian cinema run by Melanie Laurents' Jewish survivor of an earlier massacre of the rest of her family, and it's here that the Basterds, on the one hand, and she and her partner, on the other, plan the events that will bring about an early end to the War. And like any movie set in and around a cinema, movie references predominate. It's fun if you get them but it's just as much fun if you don't.<br/><br/>Long admired for the 'cleverness' of his dialouge, Tarantino's movie is a very talkative picture indeed. From the opening chapter, which is mostly a dialogue between Col. Landa, the SS 'Jew Hunter' and the French farmer who is sheltering the Jews he is hunting, this is a film that is sustained by long conversations and some really first-class acting. Language itself plays a major part in proceedings and Tarantino has a field-day with his use of English, German, French (and Italian!) and the accents with which they are spoken. Indeed outcomes hang on language and what is said and what is meant. Sure, there is action and some very bloody violence, (not to mention some very dubious morality), but this is far from being a brainless, exploitative action picture. But did anyone expect it to be? I doubt it.<br/><br/>In a large cast there are some terrific performances. Pitt hams it up but with a knowing wink at the camera. Newcomer Christoph Waltz is a splendid Landa - it's a star-making performance that has already won him the Best Actor award at Cannes and could well win him a Supporting Actor Oscar next year. Michael Fassbender, (Bobby Sands in ""Hunger""), is perfection itself as a stiff-upper-lip British officer who used to be a film critic while Daniel Bruhl continues his upward climb as one of Europe's finest young actors as Fredrick Zoller, sniper extraordinaire, and whose exploits form the basis of the film that is being premiered for Hitler's benefit, with Bruhl playing 'himself' as Germany's answer to Audie Murphy, and Melanie Laurents is superb as the vengeful Shosanna. Here is another French actress about to make her international breakthrough.<br/><br/>It's a brave or a foolhardy or simply a vain director who will end a movie so chock full of film references with the line that 'this may just be my masterpiece'. If it isn't quite, it still marks a major return to form for a film-maker whose place in Pantheon is already assured. It's also the best film I've seen this year."
"BigGuy","5","11","25","21 August 2009"," Inglorious is Right
","It would be unfair to say this movie didn't have its moments, but overall I found Inglorious Basterds to be sub-par. The first half of the movie was fun, clever dialog, interesting story, great characters. The second half of the movie just fell apart.<br/><br/>Overall, it is clear that Tarantino is a fan of movies, since this film is an homage to a number of them. Once upon a time in the West features prominently. There are also a number of Wilhelm screams. The problem is: splicing together a bunch of good/great movies doesn't make a good movie in return.<br/><br/>Overall the acting of the main players was quite enjoyable. Brad Pitt, Diane Kruger, Daniel Bruhl, and Christoph Waltz deserve mention. Although towards the end when the film overall went to pieces the over the top acting got a bit ridiculous.<br/><br/>For someone trying to decide whether to see this movie, I would offer the following. The movie is two and a half hours, so be prepared for that. There are a number of rather gruesome scenes (maybe not quite Reservoir dogs intense, but the right ballpark). It is definitely a Quentin Tarantino movie."

","Inglourious Basterds has a good title. It has good characters. It's awesome in terms of cinematography, and in terms of directing. But the script is fricking awful, as is the plot development. When you compare the dialogue to that of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, you find yourself wondering what went so wrong in the last 15 years or so for Tarantino. There's no stand-out monologues, or moments of outrageous humour. Even Brad Pitt struggles to look anything other than average. In fact, the only character who has any decent dialogue whatsoever is Colonel Landa, the 'Jew Hunter'. Back to the plot development, which is equally sh*te. The premise of a Nazi-killing crack squad of Jewish-Americans sounds good, but in truth doesn't really ever seem to materialise, aside from a single scene. I found myself really not giving a f**k about the characters, what happened to them, or even if they succeeded in killing Hitler. And when you don't care about whether or not Hitler dies, you know you've got a bit of a sh*te film on your hands."

","This movie started well with an intriguing first scene involving some very competent acting, cinematography & scene setting. I thought QT had turned a corner in his film making & development, moving into a more mature phase of his film-making.<br/><br/>Alas no. The film went downhill with the introduction of the Inglorious Basterds... (what is with the graphical text name tags? They're not edgy or cool; in this film they were just kinda redundant). I'm not sure if these guys were meant to be the heroes, I'm neither American nor European & i just ended up hoping they would get killed off as they lent no sympathy to their (historically inaccurate) cause. They seemed psychotic & barbaric with zero redeeming qualities via zero character development. Take them out of the movie and I don't think it would have changed the outcome very much at all.<br/><br/>My fingered hovered over the fast-forward button a few times; the dialog was long & overly drawn out, some scenes were totally unnecessary, it seemed QT was masturbating behind the camera trying to prove how mature & edgy he could be. And then his blood filled scene climaxes... gross dude. Get a tissue & a room. I don't care about your tug sessions, keep it to yourself next time.<br/><br/>The editing was bad, Brad Pitt was awful (i could not understand what he was saying a few times - why you no subtitle Mr Pitt as well?) The plot dysfunctional, the cinematography was.. OK and some of the other cast acting was actually good. But not good enough to hold this history 'basterdisation' together.<br/><br/>Awful."

","Being a devoted Tarantino fan, for me this movie was a disappointment. Inglourious Basterds has its flashes of genius, as you'd expect from a Tarantino movie, but they're lost in a muddle of half-baked ideas and characters, and in the end it's probably his weakest movie so far, lacking in the one thing that even Death Proof had - energy and pace. The film does have some mentionable qualities, that are enough to make it watchable and even quite enjoyable - as you would expect from Tarantino, it's fantastically professional in every aspect, especially cinematography and sound. Some of the characters have tons of potential, and the actors are usually spot on (another honorable mention to Christoph Waltz), but there are so many characters that not one of them is developed enough to be satisfying. Tarantino fails to juggle a large number of plots and sub-plots the way he did in Jackie Brown in Pulp Fiction, and they never intertwine in any meaningful way. And worst of all, it's not even that controversial or offensive - Tarantino took a lot of liberties with history, and he certainly created violence that's more realistic and more explicit than ever before, but it's really just violence for the sake of itself. I realize I'm in a minority here, but I don't recommend this movie. I'm not saying don't watch it - there's a lot here to enjoy. But in the end, it's just not that good."

","Evidently it is now politically correct to make a movie about the slaughter of wartime Germans because they are/were Nazis! Of course the director is Quentin Tarrentino, who reinvented the old blood and guts movies by making them more graphic, and in the process has gotten many fans who can't get enough of the genre. And the other draw for the movie was Brad Pitt, whose career has been reduced to making movies like this and Ocean's 11-25 sequels. Anyway this movie is supposed to be a comedy as well, but I thought it was basically disgusting and only about as funny as laughing at scenes from Schindler's List. People laugh at this stuff? Slaughter some Nazis in increasingly more horrible ways as they try to make it seem comical-that's the movie in a nutshell. Brad Pitt and everyone else associated with this piece of garbage should be ashamed."
"Karlamon","2","5","9","23 July 2011"," This on the Top 250? Seriously?
","Inglourious Basterds is boring, nonsensical, stupid, and overlong. I can't get my head around on why this is on IMDb's Top 250. Personally, I don't think it deserves this amount of praise. Heres why.<br/><br/>The main problem with Inglourious Basterds is that it can't decide whether to be a gritty war film or a table conversation caught on tape. For 70% of the film, all we are given is boring and overlong foreign language conversations that do nothing more than act as stretching filler for the 153 minute run time. Worse, it does almost nothing to develop the nonexistent plot line and the uninteresting and emotionless characters (apart from Colonel Hans Landa played by the great Christoph Waltz). Boring!<br/><br/>It is a strange fact that the title characters (the Basterds) get such little screen time. But even if they had more time, you still wouldn't care about them the slightest. For matters, they aren't very interesting characters. Who are they? Where did they originate? Why were they selected to assonant Nazi's in the first place? None of this is explained. And as hard as Brad Pitt and the others try, their talent is wasted on their roles being overshadowed by the unnecessary conversation scenes plaguing this film.<br/><br/>Near the end of this bore, we get to the action scene (finally!), but its just played out ridiculously. Spoilers: Hitler and his Nazi officers get locked inside a burning theater during a screening. Shouldn't there be guards available to stop the intruder from doing this? I only spotted a few on duty who didn't do anything. During the explosions, two of the Basterds sacrifice their lives to well continue shooting Hitler's corpse I guess? Not sure why. Then we cut to a conclusion that doesn't resolve anything.<br/><br/>So whats so good about this film? From my point of view, nothing apart from Waltz. There's no plot or character development, the story is poorly told and the pacing is slow and boring. We all know Quentin Tarantino as a respected film director, but this mess he made doesn't come close to the charm of other WWII films like The Dirty Dozen, Saving Private Ryan, Defiance or Valiant.<br/><br/>This basterd of a film is just plain bad. But seriously. A movie this poor in the Top 250? Thats completely beyond me. ""D"""

It has been nominated, how I don't know, for a drama award, and yet it was more like a comedy (a bad one) than anything else.<br/><br/>It was a totally unbelievable, lets get all the main Nazi leaders in a cinema and have two guards for the whole place, and leave a black man to wander around freely locking up doors and starting fires.<br/><br/>It made the Jewish into evil thugs and suicide bombers, and was a right wing anti-semitic piece.<br/><br/>This proves one thing to me, Tarantino could put anything, absolute anything on the screen and some people will give it a high score.<br/><br/>This is easily one of the worst movies of 2009."
"bainslie","5","5","9","5 January 2010"," Why that ending?
","Inglourious Basterds is a movie that will leave thinking viewers utterly shattered. Its opening scene of the Nazi Jew Hunter and the French farmer is absolutely brilliant. It brings out the evil of the Nazi regime and the agony of the farmer who must choose between life for his family or life for innocent Jewish neighbours. It certainly puts a new spin on why some people in WW2 would have collaborated. After this amazing section the movie jumps crazily between scenes of cruelty, intense suspense, sadness and farce. I knew it was fiction but at least I could see a link between true history and the events of this movie. That was until the ending in the Paris movie theatre. I hated the ending so much as I know what happened in reality to those evil monsters who ruled Germany in World War Two. They got what they deserved. In this movie they get it years in advance. I actually expected a scene after the ending which would set this movie straight with historical reality but it was not to be. A shame as Tarantino is obviously a clever writer and director. Did he run out of steam? Result – would recommend it up to the last scene. Thus I would give it only 5 out of 10 (5 out of 5 up till the theatre events and 0 out of 5 for the ridiculous ending)."

","So you know what it's about. Here's a review you can read in about the same time it takes to play a game of who's who.<br/><br/>Firstly there are some wonderfully iconic scenes, such as the 'basement stand-off', and one highly effective performance in Waltz's Nazi detective, Hans Landa, which give Inglorius a rewatchability.<br/><br/>Praise must also be encouraged for the direction of languages, which lend the movie priceless creditability, along with a great deal of its appeal.<br/><br/>Sadly, as has been mentioned elsewhere at length, Mike Myers' cameo is without purpose and merely distracting, as is Brad Pitt's redneck accent.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest flaw of the movie, though, is Tarintino's continued obsession with segmenting movies unnecessarily, along with adding titles, and back stories related by voice-overs. These disrupt, not just the flow of the movie (any movie), but also the 'feel' of it. For example, all the cat and mouse tension and emotional intensity of the intro, is undone at the moment when Quinten reaches for the titles board.<br/><br/>The ending was a little flat for me also, and somehow unsatisfying. This typifies the mood of the film, which wavers uncertainly between being a serious war movie and a knowing pantomime.<br/><br/>You finished that game yet?"
"tubby1","7","5","9","28 December 2009"," Inglouriously uncomfortable
","This is not a film that you can pleasantly enjoy, you can appreciate the technical expertise of the film but Inglourious Basterds is a juvenile and ill-judged plot.<br/><br/>Firstly the film has a good beginning, well shot with the tension built up well and a fine introduction to Colonel Hans Landa played brilliantly by Christoph Waltz. However, after this start begins a mish-mash of genre styles which are confusing. What was with the western music? It did not at all fit with the film, and the way Inglourious is divided into chapters was odd and certainly unnecessary. <br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is spattered with impressive camera shots and there is no denying Tarantino's strength with dialogue. However, scenes are too lengthy and drag on. Some of these scenes are too brazen or bloodthirsty and many of the peripheral characters are largely dolloped in a comic-caricature style. Brad Pitt for this deliverance does not fit the build for Lieutenant Alan Raine, and falls short of offering a character of any vividness. However its comic exuberance does bring momentum when the film is heavily burdened and stagnated with discourse. <br/><br/>I understand that the film was meant to have a comic-like feel, as I have implied so far but it is thwarted by its infantile development, which at times was distasteful and uncomfortable. The lengthy scenes are all embellished for the finale, and this was the worst misjudgment. The final scenes are over done, and over-cooked it is an ugly and uncomfortable end.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is technically good but the story is black and distasteful, the comedy edge is not well-judged and for all its bravado it cannot hide its fundamental flaw, being its inability to provide satisfaction from its setup to its ill-conclusion."
"wrbills","5","5","9","28 December 2009"," A tale of two films
","Here's my two pence worth. <br/><br/>In my opinion Inglorious is worth a 5/10 and is really lucky to get that. It's unlucky that its director is so weak and jaded to the extent that he will let the studio etc put its sticky fingers all over his film, one that essentially has the hallmark of genius stamped into its silver bottom. My point stems from the notion that the film is divided into two not 8 chapters (maybe 7). The good chapter and the rubbish chapter. The good bit was the initial scene in the French farmhouse and the next scene was the preliminary to the gun fight in the French basement tavern. The bad part is the vomit spewing forth from the gaping wound that is Brad Pitt's character and everything, I mean everything, that the Pitt features in (I still rate him highly as an actor though due to his previous work).<br/><br/>Tarantino was onto something with his art house style dialogue driven scenes which I thought were taken straight out of an intelligent play. He dazzled me with a sharp witty script that simply, irresistibly, drew me into the 1940's and his revisionist plot. Then the guns came and he blew it all away. Not with the panache that we have seen in the complex Jackie Brown's or Pulp Fiction's of this world but with the blunt axe of something crap like Righteous Kill. I am thoroughly amazed that he let himself get carried away by the silly plot and the unnecessarily gory scenes (I like blood and guts but in its right place - Starship Troopers etc). <br/><br/>The revisionist plot of Hitler's death was fun in the same way as Berlusconi getting a sharp miniature in his face is acceptable. He kind of deserves what he gets by why oh why do it in such a dull and horrid fashion. The rest of the film is similar, unnecessary scenes tagged onto an unnecessary plot. The gross mistake was to let Brad Pitt's character survive, no doubt his star power kept him alive but I found this the greatest travesty. I kept waiting for some clever death but this was ignored in favour of a diabolical ending in which the sneaky Nazi (Who Shines throughout this film) is outplayed like a small child by Pitt whose character was the Moron in Chief - Europe. He makes General Melchett from Blackadder look positively enlightened. <br/><br/>Anyway, the point of this diatribe is that this is a bad film when taken over three hours or so. Cut out the rubbish and you are left with a polished diamond with scenes so immersive they have to be seen to be believed."
"hnt_dnl","5","5","9","15 December 2009"," Nice try, Quentin, but absolutely no cigar!
","Immediately, a lot of moviegoers claim INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (2009) to be Tarantino's best work. I beg to differ.Now that the 00s is coming to a close, he has made 4 films this decade: KILL BILL VOL1 (2003), KILL BILL VOL2 (2004), DEATH PROOF, and this film. DP is self-indulgence defined and a true turd of a film and somehow, just based on Tarantino's fame (or infamy) has a 7+ rating here on IMDb! That alone is reason enough to suspect IB's 8+ rating so far. <br/><br/>I believe that KB1 is a contender for best film of the decade because it is the ONE Tarantino film that cuts to the chase and perfectly fuses elements of the genre it pays homage to, while modernizing it WITHOUT seeming self-important. It came together as a flawless film, but due to it's minimal dialogue, extremely high body count, and lack of ""plot"", it won't be considered to be his best of 00s or even his best film (but it should be because it is!). KB2 is really just more of the same talky drivel that you've seen before in most Tarantino films, but loads better than DP, not really saying much as, again, DP is crap! So, in the 00s, Tarantino can claim one certified masterpiece (KB1), a so-so sequel (KB2), a crapfest (DP), and now this film IB.<br/><br/>Loaded with dialogue (English, German, French), while a lot of it interesting, what's the point? Many times I felt Tarantino's string-pulling behind the actors. The characters don't seem authentic simply due to the overemphasis on dialogue. The film has a couple of tense, solidly acted scenes early on, but again, even they come off as very predictable. The film really goes downhill after the first couple of chapters degenerating into a weak climax and confusing ending.<br/><br/>Tarantino, more often than not, suckers audiences with pretentious, self-congratulatory nonsense. PF is an example of his best use of dialogue. DP his worst. IB falls somewhere in between and I put it closer to DP simply b/c I think the dialogue in this movie is almost as tedious to listen to as DP, with the addition that in IB, everything feels staged. Tarantino literally stalls the plot so much with his chapter divisions, unnecessary narrations, and untimely use of violence and humor that the film ends up being a frustrating exercise in patience.<br/><br/>The most obvious best part of IB is the character of Colonel Hans Landa (played brilliantly by Christoph Waltz, who won Best Supporting Actor of 2009). This is a prime example of a truly great performance that is the standout in a mediocre film. But no other major character is even in the atmosphere of Waltz, although Melanie Laurent (the female lead Shosanna, a French-Jewish escapee of Landa's opening scene massacre of her family) is exceptional early in the film doing a great job of non-verbally acting, but after the Landa restaurant scene, Tarantino really lets her character down as he sporadically shows her anymore and gives her very little to work with emotionally, and this is not good as hers is perhaps the most key character of the film. Next to Waltz, the best performance is by Diane Kruger (as German double-agent Bridget von Hammersmark), who leaves a real impression as she effortlessly relays her character's duplicitous nature. Nominal star Brad Pitt (as Lt. Raine, head of the Nazi-killing Allied unit) is pretty good and fairly humorous, but you never get any sense of who he is as Tarantino has Pitt play him a bit too comical and cartoonish. But really most of the characters (except Landa) are hampered with inane dialogue. Landa comes out the winner simply b/c he's the only one that seems ""real"".<br/><br/>Also, was the purpose of this film for the viewer to hate the Nazi characters? Because if it was, he failed miserably! If anything, he managed to most of German officers and Nazis (even Hitler himself!) sympathetic characters. Now THAT is blasphemy!<br/><br/>Tarantino noticeably uses music in some form from all his previous films in IB and this is a big no-no for me! I don't want to be reminded of PF, JACKIE BROWN, and KB when I watch INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS! I want the film to have it's own identity. Borrowing from other, much older films and creating uniqueness out of that is one thing, but borrowing from your own films within the last 10 years is just plain egotistical! Most of the music is strangely weak and misplaced.<br/><br/>Most of the characters don't feel individualistic, just like Tarantino-quoting pupils. There is one very noticeable casting gimmick that just plain doesn't work and really underscores the uneasy comedy-drama mix in the film. But the one word that describes this film...PREDICTABLE! Pretty much at the start of every big scene, the viewer knows what's coming just based on the way Tarantino sets things up. There was nothing predictable about PF or the KB films, or even the insipid DP. But in IB, you can see the finish line from a mile away. <br/><br/>In reality, IB is just a bunch of sound and fury, signifying absolutely nothing. And in that regard, it's not a good film, no matter how good the editing, art and costume design are. Deep down, there's nothing there. Just more of Tarantino's splicing and patchwork disguised as a film."

","This movie makes it obvious that Quentin Tarantino has a very narrow vision when it comes to creating movies. His interests are American low-lifes, violence and film-making. He is very aware that people hailed his movies for the clever dialogs, so of course he adds those as well. Picture this, now we take all of the ingredients above and turn it into a German WWII movie. Whereas the genre-bending style of Kill Bill was quite successful, in this case it is a complete failure. Most of the dialogues are just clever to be clever and have the overhand in the entire movie. Quentin already went overboard with dialogs in Death Proof, boring the viewer to death and partly saving the movie with the great final 15 minutes. I won't explain how much the movie fails in creating a realistic picture of WWII, as that was obviously not the purpose of the movie. The theme hardly adds anything to the story, except for the fact that killing nazi's is a tagline that Quentin has probably been wanting to use for a while. Overall the movie does have its moments in which it is entertaining, but overall it is more boring than entertaining. Of course the movie gets high ratings because it was made by Tarantino. As a big fan of his previous work I wonder how so many people lose their ability to see that this movie just isn't up to par with classics like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. Please Tarantino, stick to the US of A with the theme of your next movies and use the clever dialogs/situations when they are appropriate."

Having not seen so much as a preview, prior to viewing it, my only knowledge on-hand was that it was QT's new flick, it had a good rating on IMDb, and that the gist of the story revolved around a ""secret"" US outfit sent in to terrorize/kill/maim Nazis, in order to spread fear among the German ranks.<br/><br/>After watching it, I left with the same impression as I went in with: It is QT's new film about a group of Nazi killers during WW2. I was thoroughly entertained, and that is pretty much that =] Was it groundbreaking cinema? No, lol, not in the least. Was it a Tarantino flick? 100% <br/><br/>After browsing the scores of positive reviews on this, I think that no matter who you are (and this is mostly directed at those who disliked the film), you have to admit one thing: Tarantino has his finger on the pulse of Generation Y. And that, in itself, is gold.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/><ul><li>Christoph Walz's performance is excellent </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The myriad of spoken languages/subtitles in the film is wonderful, refreshing, and a joy to listen to </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The set &amp; costume design is fantastic (if you care about stuff like that) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It's entertaining, with some great moments of suspense! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Mike Myers is tolerable (wow!) </li></ul><br/><br/>Cons: <br/><br/><ul><li>Brad Pitt is a good actor in many films. In my opinion though, he was terribly miscast here. A younger Clint Eastwood type, without a fake accent would've much better suited the role...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The American ""machismo"" in the film may have not been overbearing per say, but its presence was just enough to make me roll my eyes a few times. Essentially, any time the Basterds were on screen...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Basterds were, for the most part, idiots. I don't think this is a con exactly, depending on how you look at it. I think it's just saddening that they are, in fact, our the ""heroes"". A bunch of violence-crazed, hillbilly yanks. Yay. Go team. And we wonder why other countries don't take us seriously? </li></ul><br/><br/>On a final note, I'll just say that any cons, including others that I didn't bother to list, can be easily dismissed with one fact: It's a Tarantino film. I definitely recommend checking it out and deciding for yourself. If not for originality alone - I have to give it a thumbs up =]"

For people who wish to find some depth or at the very least an accurate depiction of the nazi regime and its constituent functionaries, they will be completely disappointed.<br/><br/>In the end the only rudimentary principle that this movie follows is: Dumbing down Hitler and his associates and swapping the cruelness of the Nazis with the Jews.

","This comment is a very generous 6 stars out of 10. This is not Quentin Tarantino's best. I realize when viewing a film you should willfully suspend your disbelief but that is not the problem here. I am more than willing to watch far fetched historically inaccurate movies. Inglourious Basterds was simply a horrible idea. This movie lacked any and all good qualities a movie should have.<br/><br/>Plot Development. There were some entertaining scenes that were preceded and followed by very long and quite boring scenes.<br/><br/>Dialogue. The subtitles are exhausting and take away from enjoying the essence of the acting, plot development, and cinematography throughout basically the entire 153 minutes.<br/><br/>Character Development. There were hardly any sufficiently developed characters. Brad Pitt had some comical dialogue but was hardly a likable character. Like all of the other characters(except Col. Hans Landa) his lacked any sort of complexity whatsoever. Christoph Waltz (Col Hans Landa) puts on a flawless performance and is probably the best and most well developed character. Waltz brings a delightful talent to the screen, which was unfortunately surrounded by sub-par and adolescent writing/direction.<br/><br/>I'm usually able to stomach distasteful gore in a movie if it can be supported by a worthwhile story but Inglorious Basterds was not one of these experiences. The film was not really even titled accurately. Certainly there were ""inglourious basterds"" but they didn't even contribute enough to have a whole movie titled after them.<br/><br/>In summary, this was 153 minutes of Tarantino's sick and twisted day dream. I am a big fan of his but this one just lacked the talent and creativity we all know he has. I think people who enjoyed this were probably just too excited to really watch and evaluate it carefully just because it was a Tarantino film.

It's also the best sequence in the movie.<br/><br/>But on the other side of the coin, there are the parts of the story involving the Basterds themselves. Some of the scenes involving them are very comical, and that includes Brad Pitt's performance. I'm not sure why he performs the part as he does, but Christoph Waltz, as Landa blows him off screen through-out, and is easily the best performance here. There is good support too, from Diane Kruger as a double agent, and a wonderful performance from Melanie Laurent as Shosanna. And this brings up another fault with the movie.<br/><br/>The story involving Shosanna is the best part of the story, yet it never ties in with the story involving the Basterds, even though the movie climaxes in the same location, a cinema. Tarantino should either have made 2 separate movies, about each story, or made one of them. The Shosanna part is serious and very well done, which as I mentioned puts it at odds with the Basterds side, which at times does get a bit over the top.<br/><br/>Tarantino as his is want, uses pieces of music or songs either from other movies, and some of this doesn't work either Instead it gives credence to the idea he is simply making movies that are homages to the past, instead of something original, which we know he can make.<br/><br/>This is a pity. As stated, there are moments here which show how good he can be. And he deserves credit for, in a big-budget movie, allowing Germans to speak in German, the French to speak French, instead of all the actors speaking in English with a funny accent.<br/><br/>To be fair, this is a much better movie than Death Proof, but now someone must take him to one side, and have a strong talk with him. If he keeps making these homages to films, then he is going to squander his talent. If he wants to do that, instead of coming up with a movie as good as Jackie Brown again, then so be it. <br/><br/>The choice is his."

","I am a Tarantino fan and a WWII / Nazi movie fan, so I really thought I would like this movie. I WANTED to like this movie. You can imagine my disappointment when this film almost bored me into a coma. Contrary to the opinions of some other viewers, there was nothing groundbreaking, innovative, or shocking about this film. I would have preferred if it was at least offensive instead of a 2 1/2 hour flat-line. There were no characters in it, only 2 dimensional cookie cutter stereotypes. The plot was predictable, the dialog trite. I just stopped caring about what was happening to the characters after the first 20 minutes. And yes, I will grant that the opening scene and Christoph Waltz are exceptions to this general assessment. I truly believe that the deliberately misspelled title was a secret tipoff that you were about to see a stupid, sloppy movie. Unless you need to test your seizure threshold, save your eyes the pain of taking in this empty shell of a movie."
"Galina_movie_fan","5","8","17","23 September 2009"," Once upon a time in Tarantino's envisioned Nazi occupied France...
","Inglorious Basterds, the latest film written/directed by Quentin Tarantino, the surrealistic phantasmagoria set during the World War II was a big disappointment for me. I found it irritating, boring, and full of Tarantino who did not make a movie about WWII but about his love for movies, this time for spaghetti westerns and his interest in the German movies of the Third Reich period. All his movies are about himself and often it works. I absolutely love Pulp Fiction and believe it is his glorious achievement. I like a lot Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and both volumes of Kill Bill. I said more than once that Tarantino does not make profound statements or ask eternal questions, but what he does do is entertain, and he does it marvelously - with style, class, irony, wit, and talent. Deathproof was the first alarming signal that more than anything Tarantino loves to talk and talk he does to the point that the viewer gets bored and frustrated even while watching supposedly fast and violent movie. It only got worse in Inglorious Basterds. Something is terribly missing in QT's vision of the important and tragic period of European and World history. Oh, his movie looks splendid, art direction is the best ever in any QT's films. The soundtrack is killer as always, and I'll make sure to have it. The first Chapter of the film is perfection. Pure and simple, the masterwork of setting, writing and acting. If anything, the opening introduces Christoph Waltz and Denis Menochet in the star making performances. But you know what? I am really surprised that Waltz's work has been proclaimed something of revelation by the critics while Malcolm McDowell who played the same type with relish in The Passage (1979) had been but crucified by the critics. Back to Basterds, it all goes rapidly downhill after the opening scene. It seems to me that Tarantino was under the spell of his own self- importance. He could not force himself to make some or should I say many scenes shorter. Some scenes only exist because Tarantino had to make the participants speak out his witty remarks and be the part of the snappy dialogs, his trade mark, even if and when the scenes did not make any sense and just went on and on. I think that in his last movie, Tarantino lost the sense of rhythm, and the film stuck more than once. I won't say that Inglorious Basterds is a total failure but it is so pointless, self-adoring, and often empty that sadly the brilliance can't always shine through inglorious and pompous stupidity, emptiness, and juvenile arrogance. <br/><br/>I don't think the movie problem was total lack of historical accuracy. It is not the first time, the film makers or the writers take liberty with history to create their own interpretation and vision of the epoch and the events that influenced it. One of my favorite writers since my young days, French Alexander Dumas, famous for the highly successful historical-adventure novels, had said about his works, ""Sometimes I have to lift up the skirts of history to make Her good sons."" The father of The Three Musketeers (1844) and The Count of Monte Cristo could be justly proud of his creations. As the result, Tarantino's violation of history has produced just that - inglorious basterds.<br/><br/>My rating is 5/10 - for art direction, soundtrack, Chapter one, and introduction of Christoph Waltz, Mélanie Laurent, and Denis Menochet. Another point goes for using different languages throughout the film."
"nmlal68","7","8","17","1 September 2009"," A half masterpiece
","It was so wonderful to escape from all that MTV like trash movies populated with Barbies and Kens and enter a world where good cinema even if crazy is the absolute key word.<br/><br/>With the first scene I was put in heaven, with superb dialogs that lasted for minutes and a fabulous camera that managed to captured all the surrounding mysteries and its tinny details as I have seldom seen before. Right there I thought I was in the presence of a second Pulp Fiction. Well, not quite.<br/><br/>The movie is a show in originality, specially when Tarantino pulls out his unmatched ability for the long and ultra intense scenes like at the basement bar, another almost unparalleled brilliant moment with dialogs to die for. The way he plays with the German clichés is absolutely incredible. Unfortunately, neither Diane Kruger nor Til Schweiger were a match for the general amazing acting, which reached the climax every time Christoph Waltz entered the scene. Brad Pit's performance was in my opinion far below his capabilities too. He just seemed to be passing by. A big plus was the constant language change between English, German and French, which functioned extremely well.<br/><br/>My biggest negative note is the breaking of the movie in too many chapters, which stole some unity. By doing this, Tarantino highlighted the idea that the movie was not thought as a whole, but rather as many different sketches produced in his head over the years and then glued together as a single movie. I also had the impression that now and then, the editing got sloppy.<br/><br/>Anyway, a film full of wit and incredible moments. True cinema at its very best with excusable flaws. A solid achievement by Tarantino."
"cyanim","7","9","20","30 August 2009"," Tarantino is back!
","Tarantino's new film Inglorious Basterds is to me a return to form for the man who gave us the instant classic Pulp Fiction. QT is at his best when he creates situations that build the tension between his characters. He is unfortunately at his worst when he chooses style over substance. A classic example of the Tarantino style over substance is in Kill Bill Volume 1 where there are so many ""references"" to other earlier Japanese films. Tarantino is also at his best in the writing of his dialogue, which, quite frankly, is in most cases, second to none. <br/><br/>Luckily for casual and rabid fans alike, Basterds showcases QT's strengths more often than his weaknesses. Two scenes are particularly strong, even to the point of being flawless: the opening scene involving Mr. LaPadite and Hans Landa aka ""The Jew Hunter,"" and the ""Mexican Standoff"" scene involving Michael Fassbender, Bridget von Hammersmark, Hugo Stiglitz, and the uniformed Gestapo officer Dieter Hellstrom. The first scene serves as an introduction to the main antagonist of the film, Hans Landa, as well as a flashback to introduce Shosannah Dreyfus, a French Jew hiding in her neighbors basement in the French countryside, and one of our main protagonists. The tension that Tarantino builds in the scene is exquisite and truly hearkens back to the best work he's ever done in Pulp Fiction. The second scene is perhaps even better regarding the buildup of tension. The dialogue is so realistic that you feel you are not in a theatre watching a Tarantino film, rather you are in that room witnessing a bloody battle about to unfold. These two scenes are absolutely masterful and proves that there is no one better in the business when it comes to writing an engrossing scene. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is standard Tarantino fare: very stylistic, graphic violence, snappy dialogue, and lots of references to other films. Tarantino certainly doesn't mind wearing his influences on his sleeve and this is one of the films weaknesses. At some points it feels over-indulgent with all the stylization and referencing of other films. It gets to the point where you feel that Tarantino is perfectly content to never come up with his own style reasoning that using other films styles IS actually HIS style. That worked well in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but by now the novelty and freshness has worn off. It is a pity QT can't be as inventive with his mis-en-scene as he can be with his dialogue. The other so- called ""weakness"" isn't really a weakness. Most of the scenes seem to go on longer than expected. But, I don't see this so much as weakness as much as a throwback to the slower pace of 70's and earlier films. This film reminds us how much the pacing of films has changed ever since MTV style editing has come about. <br/><br/>Overall, Basterds is Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown. It is not however a ""brilliant, or ground-breaking"" film like many on this website may claim. It is simply a very solid and in some scenes flawless movie. Fans will not see anything here that they haven't seen before either in other QT films or in other films in various genres (Spaghetti Westers being the most obvious influence here). However, what audiences will see is a smartly written, engrossing and intense, black comedy about Nazi-occupied France. This film redeems QT in my eyes from the derivative and formulaic Kill Bill and grindhouse films. And, the acting is consistently superb from the entire cast in this film, especially from Christoph Walz and Melanie Laurent. Go see this film if you want Tarantino at his vintage best!"
"imxo","7","9","20","21 August 2009"," One too many turns of the screw; and surprisingly pro-German.
","By far the most enjoyable thing about ""Inglourious Basterds"" (sic, sic) are the performances by the cast of outstanding European actors. These Europeans really know their stuff. In fact, this film's real stars are the Europeans, especially Christoph Waltz from Austria and Melanie Laurent from France. Their performances are wonderful. As for top-billed Brad Pitt, he has only a supporting role as Tarantino's 21st Century stand-in for Lee Marvin. Pitt may be the star on the marquis, but he's far from being the star of this film.<br/><br/>Some reviewers here seem to think the movie is anti-German. I can't imagine how they can possibly think that. Perhaps the bravest man in the whole film is a captured German soldier who courageously chooses death before dishonor. Sure, there are the usual Teutonic sadists and pigs, but on the level of plain soldiers, both sides seem to be more or less equal in executing their inglorious duties. In fact, in their manner of carrying out their parts in total war, the Americans and British in this film don't seem much of a step up from their German enemies. Indeed, these irregulars of the OSS and SOE employ many of the same methods used by their Nazi opponents: torture, threats of retaliation against families, etc. Is it possible for a particular group of sadists to claim the high moral ground? <br/><br/>Despite the excellent acting, and superb photography and costuming, this film eventually disappoints. The last 1/4 of the film descends into the realm of pure nonsense, fantasy and ludicrous, contrived situations: a country bumpkin milkmaid becomes a cinema owner; dozens of the Reich's highest ranking officials and officers gather in a hostile city with barely a guard in sight. That's so ludicrous that anyone from the Secret Service watching this film would have tears of laughter rolling down his or her cheeks. Just like a person who always gives a screw one too many turns and breaks something, director Tarantino just doesn't know how to leave well enough alone or quit when he is ahead. Like a child, he insists on demonstrating how much he knows (or thinks he knows) about movies and their history, and so he winds up damaging his own movie. <br/><br/>With his in-jokes and his sly aural and visual references to other films and their makers Tarantino wants to impress us, but he really only manages to foul his own work. I know who Aldo Ray was; I've seen him and the late, great Lee Marvin. Is Tarantino trying to impress me with the fact that he knows them, too? <br/><br/>The very talented Tarantino should spend less time being referential and reverential, and more time mastering his movie-making skills."
"cinemaofdreams","6","9","20","21 August 2009"," Inglorious Disappointment
","Of all the films slated for release this year, this is the one I was waiting for. Tarantino is unique in that he can borrow from so many genres and directorial styles, has an incredible ear for scoring his films, and of course can write dialog like almost no other. Much of this is true with Inglourious Basterds, and yet it just doesn't fit together like it has in past efforts. The magic is not there. The film has, what I feel, are three incredible scenes including the brilliant and nerve wracking opening sequence. One scene, in a restaurant, is as if Tarantino channels a very restrained Bunuel. The other, though a bit long, in a basement bar works for the most part and introduces an important character and some crucial plot development. It builds slowly to something important so its length is forgivable. None of these scenes, I hesitate to add, involve Brad Pitt. Mr. Pitt is a fine actor, but he is just a bit too much this side of parody here. Many of the other scenes are little more than filler. I can appreciate Tarantino's humour very much. I laughed hysterically through much of Kill Bill Vol. 1. It was riveting, compelling, and fun. Inglorious Basterds tries to be these things but somehow misses the mark. 6/10."
"n1h1l1s7","3","22","60","2 September 2009"," Overrated
","Whatever Tarantino does, it will get tens from certain people. Nothing bad about that, some people are fans, and fans tend to see only the good points of a movie and completely disregard the bad ones. So when the movie ends and you subconsciously have written out all the bad stuff, you say that that bad stuff is actually good... and there is 10 stars. Too bad that some people, who are not fans, tend to act like sheep and think: ""if this movie has 8.7, this movie must be great; and if I say it is stupid, that means I'm stupid, cause I can't understand it""... And give the movie 8-9 stars.<br/><br/>This movie had just several high points: Cristoph Walts, first scene, bar scene. (First scene being complete The Good, The Bad and The Ugly ripoff, the bar scene ending in typical Guy Ritchie fashion...) They are under an hour combined. The rest of the movie is patchwork, bad mix between action, western, drama and parody. Brad Pitt is just a poster boy, a lot like his role in Babel. He makes maybe his worst role, too. Eli Roth is plain horrible, but he gets as much screen time as Pitt. That guy is just worthless actor and should quit it. The really awful thing about the movie is the Jewish propaganda. By the books, toо. Hitler, Goebbels and the Nazis are complete retards and idiots, all the jew guys- cool and idealistic. The only moron among the jews is Pitt, but guess what- he ain't jew, he is redneck. In some aspects, Tarantino is harsher than Allo, Allo- but unlike the cult series, where absolutely everybody is ridiculed, in this movie only the Nazis take the beating... Yeah, I knew that the movie was about jews, scalping Germans, but what I saw was beyond my imagination."

"Michael_Elliott","Null","21","57","21 August 2009"," Tarantino's Dirty Dozen Nazi-style
","Inglourious Basterds (2009) <br/><br/>** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Once upon a time in Nazi occupied France, a group known as the Basterds are sent on a mission to scalp as many Nazis as they can. All this leads up to a movie premier were several members of the Third Reich will be attending, Hitler there as well. Tarantino has been a favorite of mine since seeing his first feature over a decade ago but this film here is a real mess of a movie. For starters, it's clear the writer was having trouble trying to come up with dialogue to fit the 1941-44 settings. This film doesn't sound like a Tarantino movie and it doesn't feature characters you'd expect to see in a Tarantino movie. While there are several great scenes, overall this movie runs way too long and the writer/director forgets to add any characters. The one character that does come out is the ""Jew Hunter"" masterfully played by Christoph Waltz. Brad Pitt's ""Apache"" leader is another decent character who doesn't get enough screen time and outside that wonderful accent, isn't given much to do. What's so sad is that both of these characters don't get that much screen time when instead we have other ""chapters"" dealing with a surviving Jew running a movie house where this big German premiere is going to be held. We see her fighting off advances from a German soldier and we also get the story of a German actress willing to help the Basterds. Some people complained that the dialogue in DEATH PROOF was too weak but I enjoyed the film. I'd say the weak dialogue is here. The movie has a major problem in finding that Tarantino zing and often times we're left with scenes that just appear to come off as the writer trying, and failing, to recapture that magic. Just take a look at the scene outside the theater when the German soldier is trying to carry on a discussion about Chaplin and various other German directors. It falls flat. Much of the movie falls flat and that includes the changing of history at the end of the movie. I don't have a problem with them changing history but when you have the Basterds, a lean, mean killing machine and Hitler, don't you want to see Hitler tortured? The way Hitler is played makes for a comic book but if you're going to change history then he deserved much worse than what's given here. Again, Pitt and Waltz were terrific but only one of their characters was really well written. The surrounding Basterds are men we never really get to know with the exception of ""The Bear Jew"" played by HOSTEL director Eli Roth (in a not very good performance). Why remake the 1978 film, itself a remake of THE DIRTY DOZEN, and not let us get to know the men? The majority of the running time is given to the German and French characters, which would have been fine but most of what we're seeing and hearing has been done better in other movies and that includes the work of Tarantino. Even sadder is that there are some great moments here and there. This includes a pretty good opening sequence where a farmer is investigated for hiding Jews. The rat story is quite creepy and leads to an amazing camera shot. Another great scene happens when we first see the Basterds at work. Being a major fan of the director's I'll certainly give the movie a second chance but I don't see my opinion changing. A real disappointed from start to finish but what's so sad is the lack of great characters. One and half doesn't carry a 153-minute movie."
"william-525","1","12","29","7 September 2009"," Sick
","This is a movie worth skipping. Just as those who denigrate all Jews rather than some onerous subset, and defenders of the faith who proclaim authors who only criticize the policies or behavior of Zionists to be anti-Semitic, this movie has no good Germans. All are characterized as Nazis (National Socialist Party members) in a graphic blood wet dream of scalping, brutal executions and branding for those wishing they were there to avenge the brutality of the German government. Sadly, the movie makes it appear that Jews can be equivalent to Nazis, which does nothing to ease the fear that the apartheid established by Israel is equivalent to the Jewish ghettos established by the German government in Poland as one step in the process of extermination. Inglorious Bastards gives Joseph Goebbels, the NAZI propaganda minister some competition, particularly the close-up of Germans enjoying the killing of American soldiers by a German sniper. The movie has no redeeming value."

","Slight spoilers.<br/><br/>From the trailers, this looked like a fun, nazi killin' romp. This is dead wrong.<br/><br/>Tarantino here has proved himself as the most literate, smart and clever film maker since Kubrick and the french nouvelle vague. Outside of those two institutions I have never seen a film which has known it's audience so well as to be able to make fun of them, even going as far as to compare them to Hitler. It's not a film about Brad Pitt scalpin' Nazis.<br/><br/>It's a film about us, watching nazi's getting scalped.<br/><br/>This became apparently in the fact that whenever Eli Roth or any other killed a nazi in the movie, people laughed, wooped or clapped. This was okay.<br/><br/>Yet when Hitler woops, laughs and claps at a nazi killing allies, whilst watching a nazi produced movie, he is evil.<br/><br/>In the past the man has been accused of being transparent and using violence as a method to make his films appeal more. However in this he has dissected his method, reasons and audience's reaction perfectly. Less Tarantino and more Peckinpah in his approach, we see what really results from violence.<br/><br/>A very tense, entertaining and funny film from QT. His best, Best I've seen this year and the smartest since A Clockwork Orange. Absolutely staggering.<br/><br/>It was only upon leaving the cinema that I realised, it wasn't just Brad Pitt who was the inglourious basterd.

The film could have been infinitely more interesting had it just focused on Brad Pitt's squad of vengeful Jewish soldiers shooting and clubbing their way through Europe taking out prominent SS ne'er-do-well's, but sadly we have to endure a ridiculous and tedious story of Hitler and the Nazi top brass attending a screening of a pro-Nazi film in downtown Paris, enabling the Basterds and a few uninteresting partisans to devise a plot to eliminate them in one fell swoop. It's aesthetically pleasing no doubt, but sadly falls victim to Quentin's ""trademark"", that is to fill huge parts of the movie with meandering dialogue that adds little to the experience. The film could easily have been trimmed down to around 90 minutes without all the yadder yadder and would have improved vastly for it.

Hans Landa and the dairy farmer is one of the best scenes in cinema to date, and even though the next scene is Lt. Aldo Raine giving a speech to his soldiers, it helps to establish a small connection between Hans and Aldo, being that both of them claim to have come down from the mountains to aid in the war efforts.<br/><br/>Reading a few negative reviews, most if not all of them bringing up all the table talks full of subtext in this film, but a few of them praised Pulp Fiction, which when you think about it, is also a collection of conversations full of subtext. Don't get me wrong, I love Pulp Fiction, but doesn't it seem a little hypocritical to praise one thing but criticise the other, when at least in my opinion, the quality of the subtext in Inglorious is just the tiniest bit worse than Pulp Fiction, but not worth knocking it all the way down to 1 star."

","My second favorite Tarantino flick,my fave being Kill Bill,I'm crazy for Samurai flicks,so it will probably always remain my favorite,but I can see why anyone would think Inglorious is his best film,it's certainly his best written. I see lots of people here complaining about historical inaccuracy and extreme violence,and they are correct,but this is clearly a fantasy,and if I was a member of the Jewish faith I could certainly see myself indulging in such a dark wish fulfillment tale,after millions of my faith have been gassed and roasted in ovens by Nazis. And as far as that subject goes,Nazis are like robots,you can chop em up,shoot them,do anything,because the real ones are no longer human,but empty shells,ripe for destruction. So no,I don't feel bad,just as I don't feel bad seeing pedophiles or serial killers getting done in,same thing to me. As to the ending,the killing of Hitler and the rest of his staff,I felt this film was attempting to be the last word on WW2 flicks,where else could you go but into surreal violent fantasy?, I'm sure it was meant to be cathartic,it certainly felt that way to me,and my family was not hunted down and tortured for no reason at all. I loved all the characters,Waltz does indeed steal the movie,but I loved Pitt too,amazing score,and to hear Cat People again on the big screen was a giant delight,icing on the cake,just brilliant. Well done Tarantino,keep em coming!"
"leadelage","9","4","7","12 May 2014"," Inglourious Basterds
","The watchwords: Killing Nazis<br/><br/>That's a Bingo! This year 2009 we can all yell the same words used by Colonel Hans Landa to talk about Inglourious Basterds, the new blockbuster of Quentin Tarantino. The movie maker applies his genius to sign this umpteenth time World War II film; obviously unusual. Inglourious Basterds is one of the rare movies that will keep you on the edge of your seat the first scene. This film contains numerous things that success! Firstly, unconventional. Tarantino chose to use uchrony, things frowned in the cinema's world, even more when it deals with WWII. Secondly, unethically. That rules the film: the different languages. Most of the time, movie makers let their characters speak Shakespeare's language in all the ways, never mind their nationalities. But it's here that this film draws its strength. The film begins with 10 minutes of French between a French farmer and a SS colonel who discovers that a Jewish family is hiding under their feet. And all along the film the languages ""intermix"". The aim of the film: to stop the IIIe Reich. Many ways are employed. The most effective one is the ""Basterds"" one which was also renowned for its committed approach to the game.<br/><br/>Jew American soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine, Brad Pitt who IS his character. With his thickest definite southern accent on earth and his large scarf on his neck which makes us think almost of a lynching. This commando plenty of spitefulness is composed of Pitt's acolytes: the actor Eli Roth plays Sergeant Donny Donowitz nicknamed ""The Bear Jew"" by the Nazis , some of them thought he's a golem, his favorite game consist in finishing one by one all the Nazis he meets with a baseball bat, very patriotic. Til Schweiger is Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz a German guy who rebelled against Hitler and excels in his brutal and sadistic ways of murdering Nazis. Violence scenes that Tarantino rules well, many cinema references, hilarious dialogues that pulse the film. For the German camp there is Colonel Hans Lander, who embodies the character of a detective who IS the real revelation of the film. His ""Au revoir, Shosanna"" proves that he's not the type to stop. The actor Christoph Waltz handles languages to achieve his goal. Suavity and virtuosity at all points and a disturbing courtesy to the point where it's puzzling. It arrived at its peak during the scene where a glass of milk drank on the opening scene in a seemingly innocuous way becomes terrorizing as hell to a young Jew survivor behind the Nazi who wants to make her realize he has unmasked her. Thanks to his performance Waltz won rave reviews from the critics and enjoyed great success with the public, remarkably in the Cannes Film Festival. Now, flash on women. The two main female characters are remarkable. Mélanie Laurent is just wonderful in her own film where she announces she is going to kill all the Nazis, her laugh resounding in our heads. Diana Kruger unveils her native language and is Bridget Von Hammersmark a German actress working as a spy in favor of Great Britain. Thereupon the British used strategies and are more diplomatic than the Americans. In the scene with Churchill smoking a huge cigar, Michael Fassbender Lt. Archie Hicox is informed of the Operation Kino, orchestrate by Von Hammersmark where the objective is simple. As ""we have all our rotten eggs in the one basket"" BLOW UP THE BASKET. The scene, no doubt in my mind, which would be the most imposing and thrilling, is undoubtedly the tavern's scene. This scene whole in German contains enough blood pressure to pickle and needles Hitler himself. Between the betrayal of himself with the third English of Hicox and the vicious voice of German accent. ""Say Auf Wiedershen to your Nazi balls"" will remain in yearbooks<br/><br/>10 years to Tarantino to create this pearl of cinema and for us 153 minutes to enjoy it. Tarantino giggles about the fact that ""Cinema wins against III Reich"" in his film. Rewrites History, a film can afford it. But as Pitt says ""A Basterd's work is never done"" and in this way Tarantino suggested he would write a series. The final scene, a low angle shot of Pitt and Roth, with these finals words ""I think it's my masterpiece"". Tarantino should probably speaks behind this quotation."
"KenricAshe","3","4","7","30 December 2009"," Sorry to ""spoil"" your fun, IF you had fun with this hatemongering film
","Inglourious Basterds shows us that Americans and Israelis can be just as savage as those who once oppressed them. Like the son of an abusive father, the boy later becomes the abuser of his own children, and on and on and on. At some point, SOMEONE has to break that chain. Of course the movie had many moments of humor, genius, and beauty, but unfortunately the ""comic"" ending shows us that this film is not an attempt to make us aware of what we have become, blinded by the lust for revenge. It is not meant to be educational. It was not designed to make us look inside our own hearts. It is simply entertainment, which would be fine if not for the fact that it glorifies never-ending hatred and violence. I am DONE with Quentin Tarantino."
"girlocelot","4","4","7","28 December 2009"," silly movie
","Hard to take this one at all seriously. Quentin was def attempting something, but he didn't carry anything off cohesively. It's a mishmash.<br/><br/>Tongue-sticking out refs to cowboy movies, good bit actors but dopey big ones, great cinematography and mostly good editing but some BIG goofs, plodding plot. Never has Hitler looked so simply wrong, or been played so buffoonishly to no effect. Churchill was unrecognizable. Brad is a hoot & that's not good. His accent is distracting, poorly done and laughable, and he looks like he's got marbles tucked into his cheeks.<br/><br/>The highlight, if you can call it that, is Nazi villain Landa, played very well, if over the top. IB is a lot like baseball: lots of standing around covered up with overdone dialog followed by a lot of action that's over very fast. Enjoyable silliness for the most part, it's definitely entertaining, but you will need a few beers to smooth over the long boring bits, and at about 2 1/2 hours, there are quite a few. If you smoke a lot of dope & are into sci-fi, this could be just the ticket to fritter away an evening."

","I can't get the point of all those critics as if the movie was super. It was not. It couldn't be! Whatever you do with that script, it's bad. I love watching Tarantino movies because i believe he has a very dark sense of humor which continuously teases you and challenges your intelligence. But this time he really messed up I believe. This movie is a very very weak movie compared to his previous movies. I think the script is too weak for a WWII movie. Think about all the movies you watched on the WWII (Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful, etc.). They are all masterpieces and maybe the strongest movies of the directors. Don't get me as I compare ""basterds"" with these movies. This movie could be Tarantino's masterpiece, if he worked a little more seriously on it. I had great expectations before the movie. He would surprise and shock me with all the intelligent quotes and scenes. But his characters were so dumb that it just turned out to be a movie to insult Nazis and maybe all of us. The only two things that I liked about the movie was the card game in the basement and Hitler getting crazy as these ""heroes"" continued their operations."
"wrtlbrmftt","3","16","42","25 August 2009"," The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - this is Tarantino's Ugliest Movie
","I am not sure, what kind of movie this product wants to be: if it is a thriller, it is not exciting enough. If it is an action movie, the action don't meets the standard. If it is a secret agent movie, then it is not ... secret and well-planned enough. If it is one of these old Italo wild West movies, then it was made fifty years after the hey-days of Italo westerns.<br/><br/>But maybe the comparison with one of these old Italo westerns from the era of the 1950's to the 1960's is still the best. The best way to describe this movie is to call it an Italo western which plays in the 1940's, and which has music which sounds similar to the music of the great (and still living!) Italian composer Ennio Morricone. I am not saying, that this movie is a good movie, so don't understand me. I consider this movie as a series of copies from cinematic effects of those old movies, an attempt to reach the standards of those old movies, but an attempt in vain. It looks to me much more like a collage of old effects, brought together like a pattern without deeper sense.<br/><br/>What I like is the fact, that bad German Nazis get really beaten up in this movie. But still, this movie don't uses many historical facts but just mixes wishes and fantasies of the film makers with some very brutal scenes of man slaughter (even if these are Nazis). This movie tries to be a ""hard"" movie, but as in so many other disciplines, here it fails as well. It could be the first or second attempt of a movie by a young, not fully experienced newcomer in the movie making industry, and the screen play or script writing could have been done by a student, too. An example: at one point in the movie, the secretly-acting Americans know they will mix with many Germans. They decide to play being Italians. However, there is no proper preparation, no language training, no reason why men in such an undercover mission would ever decide to play being of another nationality without having taken proper preparation. And of course, they encounter a German who speaks Italian, and they fail totally in speaking Italian. Would that have happened during a real mission? I doubt. That movie makes the Americans acting like children without any proper sense of preparation. Unlogical, is the word coming into one's mind. Highly unlogical. Trentin Tarantino is the famous-sounding name of the movie maker, but I think, an immature early teeny in his puberty made the film in reality.<br/><br/>If you have a boring evening, you will be happy to have this movie to watch. If your cinema next door has more than one movie to play, then check out what other movies it offers tonight. I watched this movie while being abroad, and think I could have spend my money for the local cuisine there.<br/><br/>The story can be told in brief words: during the nazi occupation of France, some really really bad brutal American soldiers all of Jewish believe somehow manage to live in France without being hunted properly, and they spend their days in killing Nazis in strange ways. Also, there is a young and beautiful - no, not a princess - women whose family was killed by the Nazis and now she wants to kill them, too. Of course the brutal American soldiers meet that very beautiful women, and now they do their thing together.<br/><br/>This movie, which is almost certainly not a high-budget movie, is not deep-going, but remains very shallow, sketchy and caricaturing the true history of the real events those days in the France of the Hitler days. The only good point I could give to this weird movie is the fact, that Nazis get some beating. I just wished that movie would have been on a much higher level. Then I would like it. Oh, one thing more: don't let young children watch this movie, please. Some murder scenes are really strange. You don't want them to have strange fantasies after this movie...<br/><br/>* the words Hitler and Nazis were been intentionally spelled in lower case."

","It is schlock over substance in this WWII re-write from Tarantino. A film destined to be remembered solely for Christoph Waltz's chilling performance, this is a flabby outing from Tarantino that could have been so much better with some discipline in the editing room.<br/><br/>The story hardly matters, being merely the backdrop for the standard fare of bitter banter exploding into violence that we have come to expect from Tarantino. Amusing at first sight, these sequences do not stand up to repeat viewing, as most people's return to Pulp Fiction will testify. In IB, the sequence in the basement pub, where the Gestapo agent is introduced to rack up the tension, extends interminably. The Bear Jew is given a big build up to no real effect - by now, we know how this particular episode is going to end, diluting the visceral effect. Waltz is dazzling, sinister and absurd, and manages to eclipse an inspired performance from Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine. There is a truly laugh-out-loud moment when Raine gives us a display of his linguistic dexterity with regard to Italian. Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus is plodding at best. At only one time did I experience a cinematic moment - when the film projects on to a wall of smoke.<br/><br/>At times this feels like Valkyrie, The Comedy. For Tarantino, success has led to bigger budgets, and a corresponding lack of people prepared to honestly critique the film in the making, which is why the hunger and discipline are clearly absent from this film. The film is neither dull nor memorable, and that just isn't good enough from a filmmaker who has set the bar so high for himself."

","Warning! This review contains spoilers related to specific scenes and their outcome. If you do not wish to know key plot and scenes details, STOP READING NOW.<br/><br/>This is a hard thing to say because I really love QT. He has produced some brilliant work and some not so great stuff but I like where he is headed and generally give him more praise than my peer group.<br/><br/>With that said, there is a magic line that everyone has that just can't be crossed. Over the years I have watched QT kill people off in unimaginable ways and accepted it as his ""art"". I'll even admit to a bit of cheering on because of the graphic nature shown on how to dispose of a few deserving characters. (SPOILER ALERT) But even with that rich history of accepted death and mayhem, the basement scene in Nadine went too far for me and I ultimately left while Hammersmark was being questioned by Lt. Aldo.<br/><br/>I can't exactly put my finger on it but QT disrespected the audience and especially me. I have a rule for movies, any movie that says you can make up whatever rules you want but you then have to stick by them. To get out of a bad plot line, you can't suddenly invent super powers that weren't there previously or change the rules of engagement to make it to the next scene.<br/><br/>Wilhelm (the Nazi with the sub-machine gun) followed the rules. He was made to be a character that the audience related to and liked. He complied with Lt. Aldo's request and as we learned in a previous scene with Aldo, lives are spared when rules are followed. Allowing Hammersmark to suddenly pull out a gun and shoot him multiple times to death defiled those rules and just made it clean for the next scene (no one else for Aldo to question and confirm what happened). Stupidity also reined as it was difficult to imagine that a movie actress with no military training and who was mortally wounded in a hail of gun fire had the presence of mind to grab a pistol off the ground and perfect hit Wilhelm with every single shot. QT completely screwed up that scene and raised the middle finger to his audience because he wrote himself into a corner and didn't know how to get out. Shame on him for thinking more of himself than the audience.<br/><br/>Finally, the whole basement scene was bad from the start. Knowing that it was a dangerous, stupid place and Hammersmark had no military or spy training, the characters remain there and interact with the German soldiers and SS officer was just something that made no sense. The enlisted men drinking on a night out to celebrate a birth would not have been armed and in their heavily drunken state, wouldn't been able to shoot anyone given there were three guns trained on the SS officer and two of these guys were assassins.<br/><br/>Bad job QT, you let us down and I am out $9.00 because you felt you could go cheap and think we were stupid enough to do what you wanted. I could care less if your next movie sweeps the Oscars and wins in every category; I will not watch it on principle alone just to not feed your money machine until to apologize to your audience."

"bkoganbing","8","9","21","8 September 2009"," World War II In an Alternate Universe
","I take exception to the comment that one reviewer made saying that a film like Inglourious Basterds had not been made before. Not only was one made, but it was made during World War II. When Hitler, Dead Or Alive was shown I'm sure the same rousing cheers went up from the audience who really wanted World War II to end that way.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino must have seen Hitler, Dead Or Alive and decided to do a big budget version of that B film propaganda flick from the Forties. In that one Ward Bond, Paul Fix,and Warren Hymer play three German speaking gangsters who take a contract out on Adolph Hitler from some public spirited citizen. They enlist in the army, but as soon as they can they desert grab a plane with a pilot and land in Germany and set about to perform their task. <br/><br/>What Tarantino has given us is Hitler, Dead Or Alive with official sanction. Brad Pitt heads a group of GIs, the rest of them are Jewish so they'll have proper motivation for this job, Pitt's a good old boy from Tennessee. The purpose of their mission is to just kill Nazis, the higher up, the better. And they soon get a reputation that's come to the attention of the Fuehrer himself.<br/><br/>This film is a throwback to those propaganda films that came out as morale boosters during World War II. Pitt and the rest of the cast look like they're having a great old time with this. Best performance is Christoph Waltz who plays an SS colonel who specialized in tracking down Jews who've escaped Hitler's final solution. He might just get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>As for the end, just relax and imagine this is World War II in an alternate Universe."
"Grant_Price","4","9","21","4 September 2009"," Better than Death Proof. But then so is every other film.
","The problem with Inglourious Basterds is that it's rubbish. Two and a half hours of rubbish. All the ingredients are there for it to be a minor classic on the scale of, say, In Bruges, but these ingredients never add up to the correct amounts. Sure, there is humour, but it's usually incredibly obvious (yeah you, Brad Pitt.) Yes, there is violence, but much of it is reduced to gore shots so prevalent in all horror films at the moment they have no shock value. Then there's the myriad of characters who typically populate Tarantino films but who, in Inglourious Basterds, are never explored beyond a name and an accent. Finally there are the numerous homages that Tarantino shoehorns into every scene because he wants everybody to know what his influences are. However, when a homage consists of imitating Sergio Leone's extreme close up shot technique and replacing Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach with some German guy and Eli goddamn Roth, the effect is somewhat underwhelming. I mean, when you see the director of Hostel I and II emerge from a pitch black tunnel with a baseball bat in hand, ready to smash some guy's head in with it, you're not exactly thinking, ""Wow, this certainly evokes the same kind of tension the original did. And the same Morricone score is being used! I may start clapping at the screen when the film ends.""<br/><br/>Some elements do work. The chapter sequences, ripped bodily from the 120 Days of Sodom, are a nice touch. The decision to film half the scenes auf Deutsch was quite brave and far more interesting to watch than Germans speaking in English together with German accents. Tarantino's film-within-a-film, Nation's Pride, was clever as it showed what could have happened to Inglourious Basterds if he'd written it as a typical war film. The audience of Nation's Pride are entirely desensitised to the excessive violence on screen because it is occurring constantly; by contrast, when Inglourious Basterds finally erupts into a maelstrom of shooting, explosions and death, the audience greets it with repugnance. Clever, I think. Finally, the element that works the most, and furthermore almost single-handedly succeeds in overcoming the film's general disposition to be as mediocre as possible, is Christopher Waltz. Not only does he speak fluent German, English, French and Italian, but he also has a gargantuan chin. And he gave a rather puissant performance as a not very nice human being.<br/><br/>What I found most infuriating about Inglourious Basterds was the amount of acting talent Tarantino had to use but chose not to instead. Daniel Brühl, for instance, is relegated to the role of 'plot device.' The only character development he is given is the definitely not contrived ""I seem nice, but when I don't get what I want I become a whiny bitch."" Til Schweiger faces slightly different difficulties. What's the point in giving him a back-story if the back-story is going to be his only story? ""Check out what this guy did! Now's he dead! Next!"" Brad Pitt is also wasted. Who asked him to speak like that? Why is he in about six scenes? Not even six cool scenes, just six dull ones (cept wen hez speekin Italian amirite?!). Michael Fassbender is the other one who is criminally underused. Instead of having a revenge story about a Jew girl that nobody cares about, it would have been infinitely more beneficial to follow the exploits of Lieutenant Overtly British. On a related note, why did Tarantino feel as though he had to include Mike Myers showing off his one-note acting abilities and why have him attempting an English accent in the presence of Fassbender, whose own accent could be the archetype for all future English person impressions? Myers just looks and sounds retarded. No different than usual then. Zing.<br/><br/>To conclude this pointless essay, Inglourious Basterds has everything that could make a film great, but is assembled in such a way as to appear only half thought-out. As Colonel Landa says, ""Wait for the cream."" We're waiting. Where is it?"
"Red_Flag","6","9","21","25 August 2009"," The ultimate cinema basted is back but is it cinema bliss or a total miss?
","It's been a long time coming, sure some might argue that Kill Bill isn't a total mess, but for a lot of people Quentin Tarentino hasn't made a good film since Jackie Brown. Does Inglourious Basterds mark his triumphant return as king or does it just dig his grave deeper? The story takes place in Nazi occupied France and a young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa. Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller quickly takes an interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theatre she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the ""Basterds"", a group of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history.<br/><br/>Let's face it, the first trailer for this was terrible. It looked and sounded like kill Bill the World War II version, and true to formula it is. Oddly enough however that works to the films advantage rather than as a handicap. In Kill Bill the endless homage and references were almost unbearable. Any fan of The Shaw Brothers or Lady Snowblood could see from the second that film started who and what he was ripping off, which wouldn't have been a problem if it had been done well. reservoir Dogs, fantastic movie, total rip off of the movie ""City on Fire"". Why is it so highly touted as one of the best movies of all time? It's because Tarentino knew how to improve on the formula. With Kill Bill he did nothing but homage. Granted Inglorious Basterds isn't a fantastic movie, it's enjoyable, funny and wonderfully acted but in ten years time nobody will be referring to it as a classic. It has a lot going for it, the story is always engaging and takes several highly amusing twists that you don't see coming.<br/><br/>So why doesn't it entirely work? For many of the same reasons Kill Bill didn't work. Tarentino is really smart about knowing what just the right about of good is. He never overdoes it and when it's good it's fantastic. That said the film features some scenes of just monotony, mostly when Eli Roth rears his head but in a movie this well polished the moments of low grade stuff sticks out a mile. Pitt is passable as Lt. Aldo Raine but it's his co star Christoph Waltz WHO BRINGS THE GOOD. He is smart, edgy and most important absolutely hysterical. What it lacks is the texture of felt life; to put it another way, you don't believe a word of it. To fans of ""pure"" cinema this might not matter, because the film creates a world unto itself; it is about technique and spatial understanding, not realism. (The same defence used to be deployed by fans of Brian De Palma). But lacking that human dimension, the QT effect will always come up short. He's a great film encyclopaedist, which is somewhat different from a great film-maker.<br/><br/>QT's bullet-speed banter is back (although without the modern pop references, obviously), firing out a hail of comedy moments, with rat-a-tat regularity. The opening act feels like a spaghetti western, as we're introduced to the film's star man, Nazi officer and ace 'Jew hunter' Landa (Christoph Waltz's scene-stealing moments are brimming with malice and ominous humour), before picking up pace as a war flick with the unleashing of the Basterds, a brutal Dirty Dozen who carve swastikas onto the faces of their foes. The director's signature flourishes – close-ups of female feet, biting barroom banter and the Mexican stand-off – all get a fresh and funny update. The soundtrack's decent, too.<br/><br/>Verdict: Tarentino's back but not quite on top form. This is undoubtedly the best film he has made this decade but something feels out of place whether it be the underuse of the bastards or the stilted first act this is no Pulp Fiction. It is, however, a good film full of, as I like to put it ""F*ck Yeahs"". it will have you hooting and hollering until the final credits roll. The picture contains all the things his fans like about Tarantino -- the wit, the audacity but at the very same time it leaves in everything we don't favour him for. Hopefully next time he can iron out the wrinkles. 3/5."

","I've been excited about this film since I first heard about it and loved what I had heard about the plot. So, now, Basterds is finally here and I love it. While it's not what I expected, I think that's a good thing. This is not the Kill Bill of WWII films that some might think it is. In fact, the Basterds aren't even in the movie for a good chunk of the time. However, there is so much juicy dialogue and tension in so many scenes, that you can't help but be fascinated by what's going on.<br/><br/>I won't waste space by repeating the initial plot, but suffice to say, there is so much happening and so many characters that it constantly stays interesting. Everyone here, even Roth, are entertaining. I will say this is a Nazi revenge fantasy come true, as anyone who hates the Nazi's (and who doesn't) will most likely laugh at the inhumanity that is returned to them. Yes, it is also a funny movie, particularly Brad Pitt, who is wonderful, funny, and thoroughly entertaining as Aldo 'Apache' Reins (spelling?).<br/><br/>But don't go in expecting a huge action adventure. The film has less action and more dialogue and drama. Some scenes drag on, but they are filled with suspense. And Tarantino is very successful in these scenes by bringing out the worst dread and SS officer could possibly bring out. There are even some big surprises in store, but I won't spoil that here. Suffice to say, anyone who ever wanted to see a Nazi get their head bashed in by a baseball bat should go see this film."

","Inglourious Basterds delivers the expected - another Tarantino film that is bad, but way too restrained to be bad enough to be good. I acknowledge the usual attempts Tarantino makes at clever genre mixing, witty dialogue, and dramatic characterization. And once again these pretensions are as painful as blows to the viewer's head with a baseball bat. It's time to admit that skillful story telling is beyond Tarantino's talents. That leaves us with his trademark sophomoric fascination with violence. Why does he once again hold back from the full blown B movie extravaganza he was meant to make for us? Taking a very bad movie to comically bloody heights is a talent Rob Zombie has, and Quentin at heart seems to aspire to this, but he never quite reaches it. If only Zombie had mentored Tarantino on this one - Basterds could have been great - but, in the end the wrong Michael Myers was cast into the film."

","The first 45 minutes of this film actually had me fooled into thinking it was going to be a great movie. The multilingual dialog, acting, and story all seemed superb. Then came to the brutal scene of the killing of the German Officer with a baseball bat and I realized I had been duped. It's not like I went to this film expecting an all out serious movie, but this one stayed true to Hollywood's long line of anti-German American's the greatest 'war' films. Like we've come to expect, the Germans were portrayed as dirty monsters, idiots and murderers. I believe World War 2 was a disaster of epic proportions and am in no way advocating the crimes and horrors that some Germans were involved with, but I find it extremely sad what our sense of history has come to. How people can sit there, eating their junk food, laughing, cheering, as someone gets scalped, have their head beat in with a bat, a swastika carved in their flesh, is beyond me and I find it extremely disturbing. It's really amazing what passes for a good movie these days, and the fact that this movie is so highly acclaimed is a testimony to that and may just be evidence of a specific decline in humanity."

","The lacking story line did not have the characteristic, imaginary ""coolness"" of his other films. Alas, this was the worst of his films and a disappointment from such a great/unique filmmaker.<br/><br/>The movie was divided into a series of 5 chapters. Each chapter consisted of long drawn out dialogue, containing some suspense and concluding in a rather disappointingly predictable manner thus lacking the customarily ironic dialogue that make conversations about cheeseburgers fascinating and also lacking the delightfully shocking surprises and uniquely interesting imagination. These five chapters connected in such a disjointed manner it seemed as though he were making 5 random clips that vaguely associated with each other (similar to a movie he had a hand in – four rooms).<br/><br/>Other Tarantino films employ completely original conceptualized fusions of genres like Kill Bill's fusion of kung fu with the spaghetti western aura and sexy female assassins. What a unique fun concept! This concept although somewhat unique, (the killing Nazi fantasy), had a slight tasteless sensation maybe since it turns this whole event into a thrill rather than something that should remain solemn.<br/><br/>For such a long movie, I've never seen such a complete lack of character development. Even with the seemingly pure raw entertaining Kill Bills which contained characters with interesting histories and vulnerabilities, the Inglorious Bastard's characters went below one dimensional, to half a dimension, almost robotic like and all of them were so insignificant and the movie was 2.5 hours long! <br/><br/>Despite all the bad, it is a Tarantino film and since it is so, it is a refreshing divergence from the prototypical. Tarantino's trademark perverse tongue and cheek violence was rampant throughout even if it mostly lacked the violence art of Kill Bill 1. Tarantino's trademark personal dialogue was there despite getting boring at times.<br/><br/>Tarantino as great as a film maker he is clearly has his boundaries. You can sense his contemporary soul clashing with historical matter thereby limiting his scope and imagination or making things seem way too out of place. Historical stuff no matter how ""pulpy"" it gets might be outside his boundaries."

","""Inglourious Basterds"" is Quentin Tarantino. At his best? Perhaps.<br/><br/>It has in-your-face violence with left-field characters. I expected that, and I got that. I don't like Tarantino because of the extreme violence and the absurdity of situations that his characters get themselves into. I am usually confident with my decisions to avoid his movies. But here, I became increasingly restless, with it being a comedy, starring Brad Pitt, and all of its award nominations, including Best Screenplay? What? <br/><br/>It's one of those films that deserves its accolades, but it still doesn't mean it's good. I certainly didn't like it, but I watched the full two and a half hours. It's like a World War II epic, and told very slowly. But every time I had enough with a scene, Tarantino knew to switch up the narrative, so I kept watching. The story narratives changed often enough to keep me watching but not too often to get confusing. I will admit, that's good writing.<br/><br/>I got frustrated with the characters because I didn't know them well enough, but that is classic Tarantino. Violence, although necessary at times, was used way too heavily - again, that's classic Tarantino. There was just no sign of comedy, maybe a few non-sense lines for humour, but come on, this is World War II. I'm not one for being offended, but I don't find war particularly funny.<br/><br/>""Inglourious Basterds"" is Quentin Tarantino mastering what he is good at. For those that like him, this is a quality film experience, but for others like me, just because you can sit through two and a half hours of torture, doesn't mean it's good."

The scenes with Brad Pitt and his hick Tennessee accent are excruciating, once again he hams it up over the top. He cannot do comedy. The basement pub chapter on the other hand is a fascinating bit of movie making and scripting, top notch Tarantino, but that was what - 20 minutes out of the whole? Landa is a great character, superbly portrayed.

Waltz is very good as a Nazi and a small cameo from a almost unrecognisable Meyers is surprisingly good, if only the makeup didn't give him away. Fassbender too is very good in quite a small role.<br/><br/>There is a nihilistic pleasure to be had from killing Nazis but the pacing in this film is off. First chapter starts well, then by the third it feels like filler then the rest just feels like a period take on the recent Ocean's Eleven films. This film is very dialogue heavy, and while this is historical fiction, some dialogue feels very anachronistic. The whole things feels overlong, self-indulgent and even quite petulant(e.g. the notes that pop up on screen with a big arrow pointing to someone of importance).<br/><br/>The cinematography is quite pretty in places, but I never really feel as if it's the Forties.<br/><br/>The score would be perfect for a western or a seventies exploitation film but here feels unfitting and too bombastic. It takes me out of the period the film is supposed to be set.<br/><br/>Overall: a very frustrating experience for me as the premise has so much promise but the result is too busy boasting the usual Tarantino touches that it misses something vital: heart.

It did turn my stomach a bit.<br/><br/>I'll just highlight one particular bit of uber-stupidity. Four anti-Nazis, including a Brit spy and a glamorous German film-star meet in a bar which turns out to be full of off-duty soldiers playing a parlour game; professional spies would abort the meeting, but lets leave that aside.<br/><br/>Then a Gestopo officer appears and makes them play the parlour game: He's super perceptive enough to unmask the Brit spy because of his accent and a gesture He's so super unperceptive that he doesn't recognise German army enemy No 1 Hugo Stiglitz (""everyone knows Hugo Stiglitz"" earlier in film)at the table.<br/><br/>He's so stupid that he then pulls a gun (outnumbered 3-1) and the scene turns into a pointless bloodbath. He doesn't make and excuse and leave to find backup, or quietly get the other Germans to arrest the potential spies, which any even remotely normal person would have done.<br/><br/>The film is like that the whole way through. Nothing makes sense. the only fascinating character is SS Colonel Landa; and he inexplicably changes sides at the end.<br/><br/>Some of the other commentators have said what an insult this is to anyone who resisted in WW2. That I agree with but this film seems to be aimed at sub-morons.

There were some moments that really moved me, like when von Hammersmark was on the doctor's table, she was like a cornered panther, and Landa was a delightful character, but far too often, I could feel Tarantino's hot breath on my neck yammering away about what a genius he is. Oh boy look, I blowed up the cinema. The rare times there was anything like a suspension of disbelief were the indulgent bits of gore, like the finger in the wound, or the carving of the swastikas in the forehead, which i can still feel. If I want that kind of cheapshot, I'll watch ER or something. If you are looking at a character and thinking about them as an interesting casting choice, then the director has failed. Hitler was many things, but he was not a chewed-up piece of gristle, and casting that actor in the role is just obnoxious. I rarely like seeing big name actors in movies, and seeing Brad Pitt means I'm watching Brad Pitt, not the soldier he's playing (ok, he was great in that Guy Ritchie movie as the Irish fighter, but that's an exception); i wish the Hollywood beancounters would stop wrecking movies with that crap.

","(No spoilers.) Lawrence Bender (Tarantino's Producer since Reservoir Dogs) in an interview about Inglorious Basterds said that it had the layers of Pulp Fiction but with more maturity, because, in fairness, Quentin's had 15 years to grow, learn and develop, although his last two outings of Death Proof and Kill Bill showed little sign of the writer/Director maturing, merely stamping his mark on genres that weren't in the spotlight, and in some ways, recreating them.<br/><br/>So, did Inglorious Basterds live up to this claim of the new and matured Quentin Tarantino? Well, yes and no. Tarantino's staple dialogue, when not pushing a story, is often crude. That, for once, is not the case with Inglorious Basterds, so perhaps that can be taken as a sign of maturity. The dialogue is excellent, as expected, but at times without the poetic rhythm that his first three pictures had in abundance. The only drawback of this is that on rare occasions you'll find that you've zoned out for a moment, but, with a Tarantino film, you can be pretty damn sure that you'll be seeing it a few times anyway and you'll be able to catch up on missed dialogue. It is dialogue heavy, which today's audience seem to shy away from, but for me personally, I love to see a film driven by its script rather than its special effects.<br/><br/>The story is layered in true Tarantino fashion. I do feel that the Basterds themselves could have been developed more, since there are many and we get to know so few, however this isn't a small film like Reservoir Dogs, revolving around a group of Basterds as the trailer makes out, and there are plenty of wonderful characters to compensate for it.<br/><br/>Also, as we've come to expect, the film is violent, which I didn't think would bother me, but it's the only thing that left a slightly bitter taste in my mouth. I'm pretty desensitised to violence on screen and have been for many years, but I expected the violence of Inglourious Basterds to be understandable under the topic of War. I also expected a few points to emphasise the cruelty and senseless of war, but I found that in many ways this was a glorification of war and Quentin has used it as a playing field for his imagination without considering the consequences. As Uncle Ben taught us in Spiderman, ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and when I was going into Inglourious Basterds, I felt that the uneducated audience who love Tarantino might leave this film having learnt a few things. Sadly, I don't feel that is the case, and for me that is its only downfall. It's becoming more and more obvious that Quentin Tarantino makes the films that Quentin Tarantino wants to see, and while that is precisely why they're so good, I do find that if he was a little less self indulgent he could make something just as hip, funky, violent and entertaining, but with more depth.<br/><br/>However, as a crafted piece of work, in script, style and care, it fires on all cylinders. I do not believe that a Tarantino film will ever not live up to the standards we've come to expect and I honestly feel that he is the most reliable director in the world today, but I can't help feeling that while people are calling this a more mature piece of work, the reality is that his first two ventures on the big screen were in fact more mature and with less glorified violence than what he is making now.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, he is one of the few Director's who I feel is really worthy of the title 'Artist', and if somebody is an Artist then they should be free to make what they want. Tarantino is fortunate enough to be able to make what he wants without being hampered by producers, and I suppose in the end, I wouldn't want it any other way.<br/><br/>So check it out when you can and see what you think.<br/><br/>Peace."

","Inglorious Basterds convinced me that Quentin Tarantino lost it. That's not to say that he is now a bad director, but his films ever since Pulp Fiction have been all style and little substance. Pulp Fiction was a wicked masterpiece and one of the greatest films of the 1990s, but what am I to make of Inglorious Basterds? This film disappointed me even more than Kill Bill. Kill Bill was, for the most part, shallow, bloody and uninspired. Still, it was entertaining and the performances were memorable. Inglorious Basterds is just like Kill Bill except there aren't any fights and only one memorable performance. I'm not saying that it's a bad film; it's actually quite good technically. Tarantino's direction is solid, but not great. The actors deliver, especially Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt. The cinematography is good, and the film seems inspired in places. For the most part, however, I kept thinking what this is really about?<br/><br/>The film has a historic setting (Nazi-occupied France in 1944), but it's not meant to be taken seriously. The film has style (however pointless), but Nazis like Adolf Hitler were included. The pro-German and fascist/conservative minded reviewers have already expressed their opinions here. However, I don't care for Nazi Germany at all. In this film an SS Colonel somehow comes off as the most likable character. He's a clever intellectual who speaks a few languages. Except that this is a man whose job is to find and execute as many Jews and other undesirables as possible. This is a clear case of misrepresentation I think. Violence that's hard to watch is also included. An American Lieutenant and his team of Jewish men kill Nazis in brutal ways. These killings are shown in all their detailed glory. So it seems that it's not the Germans who are the ruthless and exceptional murderers but an American team. There are other things in the film that didn't take place for real. I don't think Tarantino meant to take sides, but all this film has is several conversation scenes and several murder scenes. In parts it's entertaining but there's nothing to take away from it. In the end it feels shallow and pointless. I don't recommend Inglorious Basterds, but by popular vote this film made it into the IMDb Top 250. For my money I'd rather see films that are meant to be historically accurate and thoughtful like Schindler's List (1993) and Come And See (1985)."

The scalping scenes with Brad Pitt & his Basterds will leave you in splits or freak you out. I loved the way this movie was told. Tarantino is one of the best storytellers ever.<br/><br/>Christopher Waltz, god this man made me hate him & love him at the same time & he won an Oscar for that. I am very happy that he won, he portrayed the most insane character so well. Humour is very much a key part as with all Tarantino films. The violence is sudden & lyrical. This film is a piece of art. Shoshanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) who manages to escape from under Landa's nose & plays a key part at the end was wonderful. There are so many parts to this movie that I can't indulge here. Diane Kruger also gives a solid performance. For a Holocaust movie, Hitler is very much sidelined.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful film, inspite of its questionable politics & its textured characters, the poetry of the dialogue & its exquisite images.

","This movie is shocking in every way, and it should be, because what else should you expect from a director whose trademark is blood-filled-violent-killing-scenes and who is making a movie based on the 2nd World War? Perhaps we could say that Tarantino glorifies violence, but I think that's just the way he expresses his ideas and points of view. Somebody will write a poem, somebody will draw a painting, but Tarantino will shoot an aggressive and brutal movie. It is just a way of expression. So why is this movie so special (or not)? Well, it actually IS an antiwar movie. Too bad the plot is set in WWII time, so basically most people will agree that killing Nazis is good because they don't deserve to live because they are the worst enemies this world has ever seen because human kind has never done anything like that and will never do something like that again and if somebody deserves to be scalped, it's the Nazis, and so on and so on It is quite simple to understand this and accept it as a final fact - if you're a five-year-old kid that is. It's interesting how Tarantino managed to portray that in the movie itself (the cinema scene). So basically we (the human race) kill because somebody else killed us first, we take an eye because somebody took ours eye first, and eventually all that is given to us we take and destroy among ourselves, while somebody is laughing and having fun (and people in my theater did laugh few times on the scalp scenes, actually). It's a sad truth, but not to everybody. The film has great acting though, especially by Christoph Walz."

The pace of the film would be considered slow as compared to other movies but good things come in slow packages (That's small but you get the jist).<br/><br/>The pace really builds upon the tension and the suspence in each scene and each chapter. The chapters are masterfully drafted to tell a masterpiece storyline. Each chapter on standalone is real good.<br/><br/>The details like the accent and the oh so sweet french that the ""Jew Hunter"" of this film speaks is like music to the ears. Smaller details like the way he intimidates his opposers is something that shines.<br/><br/>Would recommend for a rewatch.<br/><br/>Would even recommend you to find a film lunatic friend like you and binge watch all the Tarantino movies."

","In Nazi-occupied France during World War II, a plan to assassinate Nazi leaders by a group of Jewish U.S. soldiers coincides with a theatre owner's vengeful plans for the same.
Directors: Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth (uncredited). What a great flick.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino returns with the story of the Basterds, a group of Jewish soldiers performing guerilla warfare and terror tactics behind enemy lines to strike fear into the hearts of German soldiers during World War II. Inglourious Basterds is a very difficult film to pigeonhole. It's part Jewish revenge fantasy, part gung ho war film, part knowing parody of patriotic flag wavers and 100% Tarantino. Tarantino has found his new muse in Melanie Laurent. She was fabulous . The performance of Christoph Waltz, playing the Nazi Gestapo figure Col. Hans Landa, is the highlight of the film. His ability to convey courtliness and sympathy and then go to commit the cruelest of horrors is simply superb.
Inglourious Basterds is naughty, apocalyptic fun -- Tarantino's version of a war movie, with history rewritten to avenge the guilty in ways that satisfy his pop-art cinema. Like a bat to the head, it's not too subtle, but you can't help but watch."
"Leofwine_draca","10","3","5","5 August 2016"," Tarantino's best? I think so
","No joke – I believe this film to be Tarantino's best yet. The movie has its naysayers, but I see this as the epitome of movie-making: a literate, intelligent film, beautifully shot from an excellent and original script. You might be forgiven for thinking that little more needs to be said about the Second World War, but you'd be wrong, as this outing shows: it's as fresh as a field full of daffodils in the springtime. I knew I was in for some fun with the opening sequence, in which spaghetti western style music riffs on an old classical piece and builds up the tension as Nazi officer arrives to question a remote French farmer.<br/><br/>From then on in, we're involved in a film which uses long scenes of dialogue and character interaction as a way to build the utmost suspense. Suspense plays a big part in this film's effectiveness, and nowhere else is it better than in the basement bar sequence around halfway through: this 20-minute segment is one of my favourite scenes in a film, where great direction, scripting, and acting all combine to make a masterful moment. The cast is excellent: Brad Pitt and Eli Roth headline the titular squad of soldiers, on hand to lend some much needed humour (usually of the pitch-black variety) to the film, while Diane Kruger shows how much she's matured as an actress by playing a double agent. Michael Fassbender reminds us why he's a rising star with his turn as British officer Archie Hickox, and even a cameoing Mike Myers doesn't ruin things. Only Tarantino would cast the long-forgotten Rod Taylor as Churchill, but it's a move that pays off.<br/><br/>In the end, though, it's the unknown European actors who really make this work. Christoph Waltz deserves his Oscar as the impeccably mannered Nazi officer, an utterly horrifying creation; Melanie Laurent delights by providing the movie's emotional core. And the little turns, from Til Schweiger's psychotically vengeful German soldier to August Diehl's slimy SS officer, are also perfectly judged. Throw in some snippets of outrageous violence to break the tension, add in a bravura climax that, for once, doesn't let the viewer down, and you have a film that's quickly become a new favourite of mine."
"petra_ste","8","3","5","30 August 2014"," That's a bingo
","Quentin Tarantino is known for his abundant use of violence and profanities, but his subversiveness runs a lot deeper than that. Consider Inglourious Basterds, his first war movie, a choral story with intertwining plot lines set in Nazi-occupied France during WWII.<br/><br/>It's amazing how Tarantino treats conversations like set-pieces: with his great ear for vivid dialogues he crafts magnificently tense scenes of verbal sparring, the best involving British officer Fassbender and his men, all disguised as Nazis, trapped in an increasingly dangerous discussion with a clingy Gestapo Major. See how Basterds plays with different languages - many conversations take place in (subtitled) German and French, with cunning manipulator Landa (Christoph Waltz, stealing the movie with his affably villainous performance), a skilled polyglot, ably switching between them.<br/><br/>In fact, the only battle scenes in Basterds occur in the propaganda movie-within-the-movie Nation's Pride, a stream of gruesome killings witnessed by an enthusiastic movie theater full of Nazis - Tarantino takes a jab at the audience' expectations, much like Joss Whedon would do a few years later in the horror genre with The Cabin in the Woods.<br/><br/>Tarantino also draws a clear parallel between brutalities committed for the sake of the good cause and those perpetrated by villains. Consider how the audience shares the point of view of fallen Germans savagely branded by the Basterds, or how the appearance of the ""Bear Jew"" is akin to that of a serial killer in a slasher movie, emerging from a dark cave preceded by the ominous thuds of his baseball bat. This is the spiritual successor of Robert Aldrich's queasily brilliant The Dirty Dozen.<br/><br/>Performances are fine, with the already mentioned Waltz, Pitt in one of his canny turns proving he is a much better character actor than conventional romantic lead, plus Fassbender, Kruger and Mélanie Laurent in a star-making turn as the movie's real protagonist. <br/><br/>7,5/10"
"Jonathv15","10","3","5","22 August 2014"," Quentin Made it again !
","The first time iv'e watched this movie was on History Channel. I didn't last 20 minutes before felling asleep. The long conversations was too much for me. A few month after that, I saw the rating of Inglourious Basterd on IMDb and I was surprised so I decided to give it an other try. I sat on my couch and watched it. And in fact, it is one of the best movie I've ever seen. There is a lot of conversation and not a lot of action, but you want to ear everything they are saying because those conversation are really interesting and funny. The screenplay is amazing. The performance of Brad Pitt with his redneck accent is stunning. Christoph Waltz play a spectacular role as the villain Nazi. If you want to see something Really Funny and Different you should watch this! Oh and as someone who take the WWII Really Really seriously, I am not offended by this movie. Those who are, don't understand the difference between a Historical event and a movie so don't listen to them."
"jturnbull-398-395794","8","3","5","7 July 2012"," Major surprise
","I am normally the first to slam revisionist history and did not go to see this on cinema release.<br/><br/>It came onto television recently and having nothing better to do, and there being not much else on, gave it a whirl. Well blow me down,I really enjoyed it, and had to go away and think why I did so, when the plot is overall quite preposterous. And I think that is the key to the movie, it is sheer over the top nonsense so that it actually transcends revisionist history and becomes a piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>There is some stuff in there though that isn't much known that is real history. Both Goebbels and Hitler were huge movie fans and indeed Goebbels produced a version of Titanic that is quite extraordinary in its propaganda but is regarded as the first effort to seriously make a movie about the tragedy (Google Nazi Titanic). It can be bought and I have a copy but it can now be downloaded from You Tube. Goebbels production makes his one just as ridiculous as I.B. which adds to the irony.<br/><br/>I found it hard not to watch this movie without a grin on my face because it is very well acted (actually overacted) and so clichéd (deliberately) that it does not really take itself seriously, and you can see that. Brad Pitt is having a ball. But it was the performance of Cristoph Waltz that really blew me away. How good was he? The perfect blend of Nazi evil with a touch of vaudeville thrown in.<br/><br/>Recommended. <br/><br/>This movie is completely over the top which is why it works. It does not want to try and rewrite history like the goddam awful Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Killer which takes itself all to seriously."
"michaelcampbel90","5","3","5","23 May 2012"," Laboured and massively disappointing
","Having waited years for this release as Tarantino had spent 10 years writing the script I was moist with excitement over this movie. A big fan of all of his other films, with exception to the much maligned Four Doors, there is a massive gulf in the quality of the writing between Basterds and the great auteur's other pieces. Despite the breathtaking opening exchange between the dairy farmer and the multi-linguistic Waltz's terrific Hans Landa the rest is a jumbled, badly cast mess. The main object of my derision is Eli Roth's Bear Jew, played with all the subtlety of a steroid abusing frat boy, although Brad Pitt's lazy, hammy turn as Aldo Raine and the inexcusable Mike Myers can not go without remark. The violence also is over the top and hard to stomach, missing the timing and black humor that made Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bills so watchable. The plot is flimsy with the parallel story lines of the Basterds and Shosanna being crudely sewn together at the end rather than the seamless blend we expect. Having said that there is a lot to like about it. Michael Fassbender, Christophe Waltz and Melanie Laurent are great to watch and the whole thing is beautifully photographed and scored. At the end you just get the feeling that Tarantino should not have been given total reign over the film and that had it been stripped down and tightened we could have been looking at a masterpiece. Unfortunately, its B-movie material and watching it feels like taking a mental bowel movement."
"Steve Crook","2","3","5","5 March 2012"," Tarantino tries his hand at a comedy
","I was watching this last night and waiting for a plot, and I was waiting, and waiting. Then I realised that it was meant to be a comedy. Or I hope it was, that's the only excuse I can think of why someone like Tarantino might have made a film like this.<br/><br/>It doesn't really have a plot, instead it has a series of pastiches and comic characters that can't be taken seriously.<br/><br/>As is usual with any Tarantino film there are loads of references to other films throughout this one. That's how I stopped myself nodding off to sleep, by trying to spot as many as I could.<br/><br/>From the comic cameos of people playing Hitler and Churchill, to the comic version of the Dirty Dozen where everything they try goes wrong. Or was that because they were part of the OSS, the precursor to the CIA? To the ridiculous Mexican stand-off in the cellar bar and thence on to the even more ridiculous denouement."
"eyesour","5","3","5","13 September 2011"," Cut and Paste again. Patchwork.
","Many suspenseful moments, but that's about it. Maybe I've seen too many films, but I kept being reminded of others seen earlier. Several scenes were reminiscent of True Romance: Waltz struck me as very like Walken in that great and original movie. The interrogation scene was fresh as new paint in TR, but here in IB it was starting to feel stale, and it was repeated more than once. IB even has Brad Pitt in a rather minor role; and what about the shootout where everybody starts firing and almost everyone gets killed? The premise was reminiscent of The Dirty Dozen, another fictional story of German officers and women being locked in a large space and then burnt alive. This no doubt makes a number of those who remember the holocaust feel good, but others may just think it reduces those who enjoy it to the same level as the original Nazis.<br/><br/>Like others have said in earlier reviews, this kind of fake history can be amusing while it lasts, up to a point, but in retrospect it's disturbing. Think of Where Eagles Dare, where hundreds of Germans get blown up, have their throats cut, shot down by the dozens. Great stuff. But do kids get to believe this dung is actually true? Scalping? Baseball bat battering? American performance in WWII Europe was in fact pretty second-rate. Ask the participants from any other nation. 70% of the US didn't want to know anything about it from the beginning, and America only came in after the Japanese attacked and Hitler, being barmy, declared war himself, forcing US participation.<br/><br/>The story of IB is a mess and a muddle: did QT just say to himself, what shall I do now? Anything goes, more or less, provided the scene works on its own. These scenes don't have to join up too well. What about the two suicidal machine-gunners shooting down the cinema audience at the end? They didn't seem at all surprised the place was going up in flames and all the doors were locked. With the girl being killed in the projection room there was even an echo of Morituri. And what happened to her black friend? All a bit of a shambles, I fear.<br/><br/>I gave this film five stars too many. Can't believe the overall rating of 8.3."
"cksz","4","3","5","15 January 2010"," Not as good as I expected
","I was never big fan of war movies in general and of WWII movies in particular, but, when I heard that Mr Tarantino made the movie of this genre I was intrigued. More so when I saw him in an interview where he said that he basically threw away all bondages of historical accuracy and allowed his artistic creativity to soar free from the tyranny of past events. That sounded promising. He did such a great job with ""Pulp Fiction"" with funny, lively and surprising plot, colorful characters and with touch of bizarre that just made it so entertaining and memorable. I expected nothing less from the movie made by the same artistic genius. I watched the movie, and I did enjoy somewhat...some things there. I did NOT like the plot. Not a single bit. I found it plain, boring, shallow, predictable, and just plain silly. Characters were somewhat better, I found pitting one sadistic psychopath against another sadistic psychopath amusing, but I saw at least one movie and (a few episodes of) one TV series with that sort of thing. It seemed that what I was left enjoying were those little details, clever clues, and witty and nuanced verbal exchanges peppered all over the movie. I was like a bird that enjoyed pecking juicy grubs out of rotten log. However, in this case, the juiciest morsels were reserved for very special birds, the ones with very, very sophisticated beak. Unfortunately, I am not the one of those special birds. I got some tidbits and just looked at the other ones, hopelessly out of my reach. Well, so be it. I will let those lucky ones to praise the feast, I was left more hungry than full."
"with_the_flames_i_die126","3","22","67","22 August 2009"," Tarantino is possibly the most overrated filmmaker in all of Hollywood
","Obviously, I am not a Tarantino fan. I think his movies, with the exception of Pulp Fiction, are far too dialog-heavy, gore infested, and have too much of an 80's B-movie feel. Inglourious Basterds is no exception.<br/><br/>The movie is divided into chapters, five I believe, to give the movie a feel I can't quite put my finger on and one that Tarantino apparently finds interesting. The first of which is a fifteen to twenty minute dialog scene introducing the audience to 'The Jew Hunter' (name self explanatory). He interrogates a man who is hiding Jews in his home at that very moment. The scene ends in gunfire. Now, I'm not going to give anything away, but for the twenty minutes preceding the thirty seconds of something interesting, I found myself fidgeting in my chair, and constantly restraining to look at my cell phone to determine how long the scene actually was. So personally, I didn't think the thirty seconds of the action sequence was worth the twenty minutes of boredom that preceded it.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie follows the same format. Overly long dialog, making the movie dull, and then a short scene to wake everyone back up only to see a scalp being sawed off with an army knife. Brad Pitt is just about the most interesting piece of this entire film, and for having the lead roll, he was in maybe a third of it. And every scene he wasn't in, I found myself wishing he would either make an appearance, or it would quickly end so the movie would progress and I could see more of the most interesting part of the movie.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the title of the film, 'Inglourious Basterds'. The Basterds themselves are in maybe a quarter of the movie, mainly in Chapter 2, titled 'Inglourious Basterds'. The Jew Hunter, a cinema owner, and Hitler and his Reich make up the other parts of the movie. In other words, 'Inglourious Basterds' is by no means an appropriate title for the movie. 'Tarantino's Take on WWII' would probably fit better. The 'Inglourious Basterds' are merely a subplot in the movie, which does not have a main plot to begin with. It is pretty much a collection of three or four subplots put together and all tying up at the end. Personally, I thought it was rather distracting.<br/><br/>So I will again express my dislike for Tarantino and his style of making movies. Personally I think he is a great B-movie director, which is why I find it odd that he continues to make and be supported making A-list films. I will say, however, that everyone has their style, and everyone has their opinions. This was mine. And if you're a Tarantino fan, you will most likely love this movie. If you're just an average movie-goer looking for a different take on World War II, chances are you might be disappointed. And that's all I got.<br/><br/>3 out of 10."
"MovieZoo","3","18","53","21 August 2009"," Inglorious indeed
","I have never gone to a Tarentino movie expecting great things. Matter of fact, the only Tarentino directed movie I enjoyed was Reservoir Dogs. That movie was solid all the way through. Except for a few scenes, everything was connected. Basterds, is the first one that I had hopes for. So much for hopes and dreams.<br/><br/>I didn't get enough of Pitt. He had the best ""interesting"" character that anyone could stay attached to. Christoph Waltz's Colonel Landa was definitely interesting and scary at first but soon lost my interest when he became inconsistent and clownish - not something you want from the lead baddie who, at first, appeared devious, evil, and unpredictable. Everyone else had their 15 seconds of fame and then wiped themselves off my memory.<br/><br/>The movie had too much talk(is there such a thing as gratuitous boring talk?). A true Tarentino obsession. I got bored during most of the conversations. It seemed intentional. Was that to distract from the occasional blood-lust? Yeah, it was bloody, and I got the dark humor in it, but it was clumsy. The best scene was near the end which occurred at a theater and affected the audience in a dark and disturbing way.<br/><br/>The best the movie had to offer was some great imagery and choreography but nothing that should earn anyone any awards. What killed that was the lack of emotional attachment. Really, when I think about it, this movie came across more as a study of Coen brother movie-making and failing to achieve anywhere near that level. Is Tarentino trying to imitate them? There is no way to talk anyone out of seeing this movie so I won't try. However, it is doubtful I will ever consider seeing another Tarentino film.<br/><br/>3/10"
"zombiemonster26","Null","10","26","21 August 2009"," A Must See
","Quentin does it once again. This film tops all of Tarantino's classics such as 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Kill Bill'. This film also tops many of the classic WWII film of the last sixty years. Reasons why? It takes you on a ride through four years in Nazi Occupied France, this of course is an alternative timeline. And in an alternative timeline - anything goes. No rules, no factual evidence; much like 'Watchmen'. <br/><br/>The Tarantino-esq style fits for this film. Much of his other movies are like modern westerns. But in this movie, it fits and believe me... it works. Brad Pitt brings a stellar, bold, bad ass execution of what is a remarkable and mysterious Lt. Aldo Raine. A man of few words - and often humorous one liners. Christoph Waltz is a villain like no other. He's one of those few that we just hate to love. Much like the Grim Reaper if he ever attempted standup comedy. The rest of the cast pull of their rolls superbly well. <br/><br/>I say, if you like action, history, war, revenge, redemption, intrigue, and just straight up nazi scalping, then go see that what is by far Quentin Tarantino's bloody out of this world masterpiece of a World War II movie"
"mattyegg-1","10","12","33","16 August 2009"," Tarantino's Masterpiece?
","In my opinion this is (so far) what I consider to be Tarantino's masterpiece. Why? It has everything in it that defines what Tarantino's films are all about. A lot of heated dialogue between a mostly male cast with scene's escalating slowly but surely to deliver a spectacular pay off. Most people would not be able to sit through 2 and a half hours of this and there are some very humorous moments throughout the film, whether it be dialogue or at times the almost comical violence. The Tarantino fans will know when to laugh and not feel guilty about it. It also features quite the opposite, dark sadistic violence. However my one gripe is that (as Jonathan Ross pointed out) the soundtrack consists of scores from other films and consequently if you've heard the music before it can become distractive. The acting from each and every one of the cast members is fantastic and each actor fits the role perfectly and Pitt continues to impress as he shows how diverse he really is. I don't need to go into detail about how utterly brilliant the dialogue is. My words could not justify it, however i will say that only about 30-40% of it is in English so to read the subtitles and see the characters could at times be hard to see the brilliant performances. Although it's long length i never once stopped and wondered how far through we were as from the very start you are gripped and compelled to see how the story plays out. It also moves at a very fast pace for a long film as it was supposed to be a mini series so although there are lengthy conversations they make sure they keep the story moving and it doesn't drift into anything meaningless. I do intend to see it again and as I've only seen it once it takes a lot to digest all at once and multiple views may be required to really study this in depth. By the time you've finished the film you'll see why i AND Tarantino will be calling this his masterpiece. Tarantino films are what the cinema is for so be sure to see it on the big screen as all the way through the imagery is superb, particularly the last chapter is some of the best I've ever seen."

"baenad","5","16","48","8 September 2009"," The Three Stooges Meet Hitler
","Well, well. Quentin Tarantino's long awaited war movie is finally here sort of. It is unmistakably Tarantino, but were it not for this fact, ""Basterds"" would be pretty hard to classify. Tarantino hits us with glimpses of his former ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Reservoir Dogs"" brilliance in a chilling, suspenseful opening rendering of an all-too-real Holocaust. The opening is just a taste of what's to come; or is it? After almost lulling you into thinking you will be watching a serious, sound-minded period piece, the film pulls a complete about-face upon the introduction of its protagonists: a rag-tag band of Jewish-American-cowboy soldiers bent on revenge, brutality, and all-around mayhem, and so recklessly farcical that the film loses all sense of historical scope. These are complimented by equally farcical caricatures of Hitler, Goebbels, and the other leading members of the Nazi high command. Of course, complete anachronism and the destruction of all historical continuity is exactly Tarantino's intention, but comical re-tellings of dark events in human history are nothing new; one need only consult Mel Brooks or Charlie Chaplin to verify this. (Actually, Tarantino's Hitler can be called little else than a poor Chaplin impersonation.) In all inglorious truth, ""Inglorious Basterds"" does not succeed as a war movie, a dark comedy, a western, or a satire. It is nothing more than a gratuitously violent version of slapstick farce. <br/><br/>Aside from the technical cinematographic aspects of the film, which are excellent per the standard we've come to expect from the Cannes-winning director, there is very little that is aesthetically pleasing in this movie, that is, unless one considers an extreme close-up of a man carving a swastika into another man's forehead with a knife pleasing to the eye. It is all too fitting that this movie should co-star Eli Roth, director of such ""masterpieces"" as ""Hostel,"" ""Hostel part II,"" and the fake trailer for ""Thanksgiving."" <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong,violence is necessary in a movie when it advances the plot, gives insight into a character or setting, adds realism, irony, or, in select cases, humor. What made ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" brilliant was the perpetual tension between comical, and at times farcical elements, and the vivid, gritty, ironic realism which Tarantino captures so well. There is no such tension in ""Basterds."" The violence, used in previous films as a means to create this realistic tension, only adds to the ludicrous slapstick of ""Basterds."" The alternate version of history Tarantino presents is as preposterous as it is superfluous. In itself, mocking or changing history is harmless, and even amusing, but Tarantino does more than mock history- he destroys it. He deals with a subject matter that requires, if not a sense of seriousness, then at least some measure of intelligence or irony, but he creates something so far-fetched, so over the top, that it simply becomes impossible to take even the slightest bit seriously. The proverbial pie in the face is replaced by a rubber-like Hitler mannequin's face being annihilated by an MP-40 at point-blank, which is neither particularly realistic, aesthetically pleasing, or for that matter, funny. Tarantino fails in every way that Aldrich (""The Dirty Dozen"") succeeds as a realist, and in every way that Chaplin (""The Great Dictator"") succeeds as a satirist."

","Typical Tarantino. A passable film which everybody hails as a masterpiece. But it isn't. The multi-narrative storyline starts out boring but turns out OK, and the ending is tense, with Tarantino borrowing from the cult kitsch B-movie to good effect. On the other hand, I wish Hollywood would stop dealing with the Nazis and the Holocaust. Enough is enough is enough! We know it happened, quadrillions other genocides happened throughout history too, without Hollywood making a billion films about them - akin to the effect of a brainwash. The stylized violence I also find unattractive. It's highly unrealistic and tends to make it look appealing, when in reality violence is the exact opposite."

","Inglorious Basterds definitely became one of my all time favourite movies! Why? Well as Tarantino said he wants the audience to feel the emotions and he makes the movie in a way that it's basically planned when you should feel a specific emotion. That's what makes a great movie. I had all the spectrum of emotions while watching this film. I laughed, I cried, I was scared, nervous, I had anticipation....I never thought that I would like a WW2 movie and especially not one about Nazis. But now I can't actually believe and It's weird to say but Hans Landa has become one of my favourite character from a movie... I mean how great is Christoph Waltz??? Without Christoph Waltz I wouldn't have enjoyed the movie as much. He played the best antagonist I've ever seen. And then of course there's so much more that made this movie a masterpiece: The music was just mesmerizing, Brad Pitt played a fabulous role (loved his accent), the cinematography was beautiful and the long scenes built such an amazing tention. Another point that made it so special was that it wasn't only in english. I just loved the fact that it was in german, french, english and Italian (bawn gewrnow ;-)). It made me realise a lot about languages especially for me because I speak exactly those languages. So the first tim I watched it, it was funny because I didn't even realise that they changed language!
I just wanna thank Mr. Quentin Tarantino for always reminding me why I love watching movies and for always making such great masterpieces! That's pure Art. If this movie was a Canvas I would put it in the Louvre! So Merci, Dankeschön, Thank You and Grawzi:-)"

","This is a bad movie. Tarantino is undoubtedly one of the filmmakers I least appreciate, though he acknowledges his legacy for film art. Unfortunately, this film is uninteresting, boring, highly stereotyped and has an environment that never harmonizes with the time and space portrayed, looking like a caricature more than a serious and credible film. The guilt of this is the incorrigible taste of Tarantino, who likes to transform a regular film into a collage of elements imported from a thousand and one genres of cinema. Sometimes the collage turns out to be funny, but in this case it was stupid like a Frankenstein monster. Credibility was never part of the script, absolutely miserable and illogical. The characters are caricatures and never show themselves capable of reaching the audience, with their forced dialogues and theatrical postures. It features a strong cast, where you can see Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Eli Roth or Diane Kruger, but they are not to blame for the crap. They did what Tarantino wanted, the way he pointed them out. The film still has good costumes but most of the scenarios do not come as a surprise either. There are some well-done scenes, but most of them are due to a huge performance by Waltz, undoubtedly the actor in the best shape in this film and the biggest positive aspect to point out. Despite being a minor actor, he shone more than the main ones, stealing the scene from Roth and Pitt (this must be his worst film work), deserving the loud applause of the audience."

","I adore Quentin Tarantino, he's a filmmaker like no other, the way is he able to create almost entirely dialogue driven films that have no down time or boredom is what makes him one of the best directors of all time and Inglorious Basterds is my favourite film of his and one of my favourites of all time. The plot of this movie is simple: 8 Jewish soldiers set out to kill every Nazi in sight. It's simple and it's impossible not to get behind the deaths of some of histories evil human beings. But there's just one Problem, Christoph Waltz is the way of them killing he entire Mazi command and Waltz gives an absolutely Incredible performance which ranks up in the greatest performances of all time. Theirs not a single scene where he's not intriguing or down right terrifying. Brad Pitt also gives one of his greatest performances here not only is he really funny and an entertaining character buts he also really unpredictable and really cruel which just make him an overall better character. This movie contain some of the best building tension ever put to screen for example the scene in the bar that just has you on the edge of your seat and still manages to leave you startled when everyone starts shooting and again it's all through dialogue. This is not a war movie it's a Tarantino movie it's not trying to be a historical movie it's trying to be a tension filled Masterpiece and the proof of this comes from the films ending. Not only is the movie within the movie incredibly well executed but the events surrounding the final assassination of Hitler and the high command all comes together perfectly it's feels earned and I really admired Tarantinos choice to change history. It's give the film as a whole a more satisfying conclusion. <br/><br/>If your looking for a war movie this is not for you but if your looking for a movie with incredible performances and tension filled sequences then this is for you and is in my opinion Tarantinos greatest achievement. <br/><br/>A+/-100%"

","After seeing the rating on IMDb and being a fan of kill bill decided to watch it.<br/><br/>What can I say, this movie is very very very long, 3 hours felt like 6, there is just so much filler and talking about nonsensical crap which adds nothing to the core plot. The plot, which takes a whopping hour to be revealed, is to destroy a cinema whilst Nazi leaders are watching a pro Nazi war movie premier.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a farmer safe-harbouring Jews being interrogated by the 'jew hunter' played by Christopher waltz, his performance and 'coolness' outdoes this scene, sadly this comes to an abrupt halt and your left being dragged though a hour and half of nonsense until the next good scene which takes place in a tavern, however if you given up on the film by this point, your sat watching 5 people taking for 40 minutes... 40! and all of it boils down to 1 sentence of dialogue contributes to the story! <br/><br/>Cut to the final scene, which I admit brad pit is pretty funny at his terrible job at faking Italian, it is in no means worth waiting 2+ hours for. But you cant help but notice the annoying surreality of the situation, if Hitler is there, why are there only 2 guards?<br/><br/>At this point I couldn't of cared less and just wanted the whole experience to end. Its too long, and spread too thin, to leave the audience bored stiff-less. 2/10"

","I've always had a love and hate relationship with Quentin Tarantino. Some of his work i've adored, others no so much and this falls into the latter category. I guess it helps that I had really no interest in the whole storyline, while I also thought a lot of the performances were way too over the top. The brutality is up to part with a lot of Quentin's work, the set pieces are impressive but in the end it just ended up boring me. Eli Roth is great in his twisted role, I especially loved his Ted Williams impersonation from The Red Sox when he hit someone with a bat, but Brad Pitt didn't deserve his critical acclaim if you ask me.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Some will undoubtedly love this, others will hate it, I definitely hated it. Tarantino lovers should see it immediately, casual viewers may want to look for something else, it's all to personal taste.<br/><br/>3/10"
"mistabobdobolina","7","4","8","10 January 2010"," So, apparently you either love this film or hate it.
","I'm in neither camp, though I lean toward liking it.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about it: Reviewers complaining that Tarantino has fallen in love with himself are to some extent correct. Excerpting Morricone's spaghetti western soundtracks for Kill Bill really worked; here it feels gratuitous and tacked-on. There are other elements (like the constant film-geek-friendly jokes on characters' names, cf. ""Hugo Stiglitz"") that create the impression that Tarantino feels the need to do this stuff now simply because it's come to be expected. And the inclusion of David Bowie in the film score is, from a director known for his uncanny talent with matching music to the visuals, a rare and aggravating misstep.<br/><br/>What was just middle of the road: (EDIT: I originally said here that the Nazis were expiring as a class of film villain. How quaint *that* sentiment looks in 2017. Turns out they're more relevant than ever, sadly.) If it was that easy to kill Hitler, one of the myriad assassination attempts from real history would probably have worked. Additionally and most problematically, it's not plausible for the Basterds to have had the track record they achieved behind German lines without any of them being able to speak German -- indeed, this whole premise clashes with a key factor that a major scene in the movie turns on. So, those are all flaws, albeit not film-sinking flaws.<br/><br/>What was great: Every single person who logged in here to complain about the ""pointless"" and ""overlong"" dialogue scenes has renounced, for all time, any right at all to criticize Tarantino's ""taste"" or timing or sense of the craft. What he knows and what you don't -- and the main reason this movie is garnering the positive reviews it is -- is how powerful a tool TENSION is. Basterds is replete with scenes that build and release tension absolutely masterfully; the opening interrogation scene is the best example, but far from the only one. Tarantino's extraordinary gift for dialogue and tension is what saves the movie from its admitted flaws. All that's required in order to appreciate this gift is an attention span.<br/><br/>He's also helped by some tremendous performances. Melanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz -- in a pair of superb performances -- have already gotten lots of well-earned attention. There's also great work from Fassbender and Diehl, and others besides. And yes, Brad Pitt -- the dozens of comments maligning him notwithstanding -- does an excellent job of establishing Aldo Raines as a shrewd and formidable character, for all that his Tennessee accent isn't authentic. <br/><br/>Overall and with its flaws taken into account, it's a fun and entertaining film, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."

And talk.<br/><br/>There were a few brief moments of something actually happening on the screen. Mostly in the form of gunfire. After a few seconds, however, they returned to the talking.<br/><br/>This movie is boring beyond belief. If it hadn't been Quentin Tarantino's creation, it wouldn't be anywhere near the top 250.

","Before I write anything else, let me establish some things.<br/><br/>I wasn't offended by the violence in this film.<br/><br/>I wasn't offended by it's portrayal of Germans/Jews/Tennesseans.<br/><br/>I wasn't disappointed by the campy, occasionally over-the-top performances.<br/><br/>I wasn't disappointed by the action movie size plot holes.<br/><br/>I wasn't upset with the alternate reality turn of events.<br/><br/>I enjoy Tarantino films, but not enough to own all of them...<br/><br/>... and this is one of them. <br/><br/>It wasn't a bad movie really. It was just kind of boring. While there was some action and humor, mostly there was just dialog. And while I enjoy dialog heavy films as much as any three line action flick, I like to feel there's actually a point to all the talking. Where Tarantino once put a lot of character into quirky conversations or tense exchanges, here he just seems to be filling up space. Some of that character occasionally pops up in Basterds, just not often enough to keep me interested. Any tension that was built up early in a scene would slowly fade away as the conversation just marched on. <br/><br/>There's no real fault with the cast here. All the actors do a fine job with what they're given, it's just that they were given way to much or, oddly, not enough. For every character that has nearly endless lines of dialog, there's another who, despite seeming to be someone of significance, wanders though a scene and (usually) dies. Even more bizarre were the characters who were introduced, talked endlessly, and then died. They weren't around long enough or didn't say anything that made us really care for them and, despite being ably acted, mostly seemed to exist just to extend the length of movie.<br/><br/>The best thing I could equate this film to would be sitting in a restaurant, eavesdropping on the table behind you for two and a half hours. Half the people at this table are utterly uninteresting and the other half are obnoxious assholes. Every now and again there's some conflict and occasionally something funny gets said, but mostly they just prattle on while you're waiting for dessert. <br/><br/>As a side note, for a bunch of guys who built up a reputation as Nazi-killing boogiemen (during a period the films mostly skips over), they seem incredibly inept or unlucky when we catch up to them. Any tension I felt was from wondering how they would manage to screw up what was coming next. I would have been more interested in a movie about the Basterds and who they were than what Tarantino decided to show us."

Whoever funded this visual mush should be rightly indignant, not only at the waste of money but that everyone will forever know they are a Muppet with a sign on their back saying ""my money is up my butt, take all you can grab with one fist""<br/><br/>Great actors, great acting, good directing and production cant save this pointless script.

","I was prepared to write something really mean this time. It was supposed to be about Tarantino wanting us to giggle once again together with the sadist inside us. Giggle about the lynch justice, the reptile morality and the sometimes rather stomach turning violence.<br/><br/>But once again I was seduced. Not at least by the dialogues, which go on not only for 5 minutes, but for 10 or nearly 15 minutes. And I promise, even the most shallow action addict will sit quiet, not wanting to miss a word. That's focus, that's great movie-making.<br/><br/>But the story is certainly the worst ever by Tarantino, although told in a much clever way. When he leaves the retaliation morals of a 14-year-old, he will not just perform great movie-making. He will also make good films."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","6","14","28 August 2009"," I sure would like to take Tarantino's history class
","Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino's new motion picture, he's established very much as a great director and writer in Hollywood. He has a ton of fans and everyone here on IMDb that I know of complain constantly how Pulp Fiction was robbed of best picture, still a puzzler to me, but I'd say that I'm a fan too over all. I own most of his work and think that he's a very talented man. He hasn't really come out with anything new for a few years excluding Grindhouse, Kill Bill Vol. 2 was his last film that he directed. I was actually kind of disappointed with that film, now I loved Death Proof, but I know that was not his baby. With Inglourious Basterds I think we were all going through the same thing as that Quentin is back to doing what he does best, writing great material as directing it with a unique style and giving the audience so much entertainment. Does he do that with Inglourious Basterds; yes. The film has it's flaws, it's not his great masterpiece or opus since Kill Bill Vol. 1 or even Pulp Fiction, but this film is hella entertaining and Tarantino picks a terrific cast of actors to bring this crazy ""effed"" up version of what Quentin thinks should have happened during WWII.<br/><br/>Set in an alternate history of WWII in which the entire top leadership of Nazi Germany, namely Hitler, Göring, Goebbels and Bormann attend a film premiere in Paris celebrating the exploits of a German sniper who had managed to kill 300 American soldiers in Italy over four days and single handedly hold the town he was occupying. Tracking the separate attempts to kill Hitler by two disparate forces, one being the ""Basterds"", a motley crew of Jewish American soldiers out for revenge against the Nazis. The Basterds have a modus operandi whereby each man must cut off the scalps of dead Nazi soldiers, with orders to get 100 scalps each. The Basterds allow one German soldier to survive each incident so as to spread the news of the terror of their attacks. However, the Basterds carve a swastika into the forehead of that German so that they cannot hide or forget that they were a Nazi. The other force concerns Shosanna, the only survivor of a Jewish family killed by a Nazi colonel nicknamed ""The Jew Hunter"". Shosanna then plots her own revenge on the Nazis. The Basterds and Shosanna remain unaware of each other thought they both have set their sights on revenging all Jews and destroying the Nazi party.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is one of the better films I've seen in 2009, the writing, direction and acting(in particular a knock out of the ball park performance by Christoph Waltz) made Inglourious Basterds into a very good movie. I only have 2 complaints, pretty minor but I feel like as much as I admire Quentin's style of movie making it seems like he's still trying hard to impress with his Making a Movie 101. He's got great style, he needs to explore a little more and push the edge. Also I love Quentin's dialogue, we know this man can write, he's probably the best writer in Hollywood and the very first scene cements how brilliant his writing is. But the movie is very long, 153 minutes, I just felt like a couple of scenes dragged on a little too much, I know this is his style but for this type of a film I think he could have done different. But he entertains where it counts and this ending was just the most insane ending I've seen in a film for a while. He made an interesting choice in casting Eli Roth, who is the director of Hostel and Cabin Fever, he just looked so hyped to be in this movie, but over all Roth pulls his weight. Pitt who you think would be in 95% of the movie is actually not as big of a role as I expected but he barely holds up a candle to Waltz's performance, but the two played off each other and were great. Diane Krueger also delivers in a great performance with Mélanie Laurent as a strong female who has a very menacing act to follow. I would recommend Inglourious Basterds for a matinée show, like I said, it's not Tarantino's masterpiece, but it's a great way to get back into the big screen with a splash.<br/><br/>8/10"

All of this in a supposedly amusing to watch fashion.<br/><br/>There had to be a very evil SS colonel who could just execute those 8 and their lieutenant, save Hitler, Goebbels, Goering and many others and become a national hero.

And just a few minutes before his betrayal... he strangles a woman to death - for no real reason at that point, other than remind the audience how bad he can be.
He is also shown placing dynamite under Goebbels chair. That, *before* he knew he would get a deal with the Americans. What a gambler!<br/><br/>There had to be a black dude who sets the movie theater on fire - sort of a reference to the final scene of the Dirty Dozen. 
However, this black dude is also Jewish (were there many black Jews in France, in 1944?) as Shoshanna claims in her laughing, psychotic speech ""I have a message for Germany, you are all going to die. I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who is going to do it"".<br/><br/>And of course there is no doubt or remorse of any kind for the hundreds of men and women massacred in the theater. After all, they were just Germans, right?<br/><br/>One last word for that guy Ryan from The Office, his acting and his onscreen presence are so terrible that it's impossible he doesn't have someone very powerful driving his casting.<br/><br/>A total piece of crap of a movie, produced by that disgusting pig Harvey Weinstein.

Quentin Tarantino's attempt to right the wrongs of the past brings to life one of his finest films- a dark, comic fantasy.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds unfolds in five chapters and features one of the best opening scenes.The fifteen minutes segment introduces us to the ambitious, ironic and fantastical Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), Nazi Sherlock Holmes, interrogating a farmer for the whereabouts of the Jewish Dreyfus family. Waltz's impeccable performance blends charm with villainy and earned him the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.<br/><br/>The second chapter introduces the Basterds, led by the cool and comical Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), infamous for their barbearic (pun intended) ways of warfare. The British send in one of their own, Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender), a film critic war hero, with a plan spiced up by the gorgeous German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger).<br/><br/>Coinciding with their plan is that of the vengeful Shosanna Dreyfus' (Mélanie Laurent). Her story is the film's heart and helps connect the dots. Laurent plays the role our traumatised heroine elegantly. She is symbolic of what a persecuted people feel under tyrannical foreign rule which sometimes manifests itself as the constant annoying presence of Pfc. Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl), the poster boy for Nazi propaganda.<br/><br/>Not for the fainthearted, Tarantino stylises violence to the point of cathartic sadism doused with comic relief. Some scenes get so nerve-wracking that even four languages are not enough to describe them and rely on emotions. The movie culminates with a cataclysmic ending at Shoshanna's cinema. The outright unpredictability makes it engrossing from beginning to end despite its long runtime, leaving us wondering how the tables turned (pun intended)."

The division in chapters and the fact that the different stories get combined in only one at the end was a very smart idea and it did fitted the movie very well.

","The thing I find funny about the bad reviews of this film is how you claim it's unbelievable. Really, Hitler wouldn't go into a movie theater without security? Your a f'ing genius. Tell me more about a war and a time you know nothing about. Really, it's unbelievable that a black man is in France in the 40's? You obviously have never been to France or know anything about French history. It's a movie people, not a documentary. Waltz is amazing in a great movie as long as you don't take yourself so seriously."

","This movie is great. From the first scene, I was hooked, and from there, the film took off. Although this is a far less actio-heavy film than some other tarantino movies, I was never once bored by the dialouge, and I love the use of multiple languages and foreign actors. The interwoven stories of Shosanna (Melanie Laurent doesn't get enough credit for her) and the basterds are great. Much like other tarantino movies, there is no true main character, and almost every actor with a prominent speaking role is great. The ending is so perfectly fitting that it gives me chills every time. Even with the exciting and somewhat humorous scenes with Landa and Aldo negotiating, the climax scene in the theater is unaffected by the tone change, and absolutely brilliant. I haven't seen many people comment on the scene, so I assume most see it as your average wild tarantino climax scene, but it is so much more. The crowd panicking after Shoshanna's face cuts to the screen, and the way the revenge-seeking basterds rain bullets onto the crowd is insane. It cannot be put into words- the way Shosanna laughs, while engulfed in flames, is almost satanic. And the true final scene, with Landa and Aldo, is also great. I get chills everytime i hear brad pitt say, ""This just might be my master piece"" in his ridiculous southern accent. <br/><br/>Overall, an all-around great film. One of my all-time favorites. Watch it with an open mind."
"ramoncontreras","10","2","3","19 June 2015"," A Masterpiece!
","The film Inglourious Basterds takes place in Nazi-occupied France during WWII. A Jewish girl named Shosanna Dreyfus played by (Melanie Laurent) witnesses the massacre of her family at the hands of Nazi Officer Hans Landa played by (Christoph Waltz). Shosanna barely escapes with her life and later is the owner of a theater. She meets a young Nazi Private named Frederick Zoller played by (Daniel Bruhl), he becomes infatuated with her and later he convinces Nazi Propagandist Joseph Goebbels played by (Sylvester Groth) to have the premier of his film ""Nations Pride"" played at Shosanna's theater. <br/><br/>This event will be attended by all of the Nazi high command including Adolf Hitler himself played by (Martin Wuttke). This catches the attention of the ""Basterds"" who are a secret unit whose sole purpose is to kill Nazi's. They are led by Lt. Aldo Raine played by (Brad Pitt), he and his unit meet with British Lt. Archie Hicox played by (Michael Fassbender) and German Actress Bridget Von Hammersmark played by (Diane Kruger) who have a plot to kill all the Nazi's attending the premier. In one fateful evening the plans of both Shosanna and the Basterds will come together to provide a thrilling alternate ending to WWII. I feel that the theme of this film is unbridled revenge.<br/><br/>Another film that has a similar theme to Inglourious Basterds would be the Kill Bill films. In both films you have a strong female who is bent on revenge at any cost. Tarantino used sound and dramatic acting to reinforce the theme. Throughout the film his use of music and sound was excellent. For example, he incorporated music of the 1940's along with music from today. This really added to the ambiance of the theme. Then he used sustained intense dialogue to enrich the theme of the film. For example, the scene's involving Shosanna and Fredrick, you can feel her disgust for the Nazi's as a whole by the intense dramatic acting that she portrayed. You also get this feeling from the Basterds because most are Jewish-Americans who want to see the Nazi's get their just deserts."
"joehemmings68","7","2","3","13 April 2015"," Some flashes of Tarantino gold, also Nazis
","This film has one of the strongest starts I've ever seen. Waltz interrogating a farmer is an absolute triumph of tension building. Tarantino lingers here for far longer than other film makers would, and it's that that pushes the scene to another level. Subsequently any scene throughout the film where Waltz features earns a measure of this same tension. Sadly everything else here doesn't quite stand up. The scene in the basement did something similar and was also enjoyable, with a strong performance from Fassbender. Aside from that, pretty much everything else is frankly ridiculous, yet I didn't find this film funny especially. The dialogue just doesn't hit home in that way very often. The Basterds particularly were both basic and uninteresting, though perhaps that was intended, who knows... I also felt the tension drained from the film towards the end, which is really the opposite of what you want. The more ridiculous and violent the film is, the less compelling it is, but Tarantino wants to get all his tropes in there rather than go with the more serious and exciting film that this truly is at times."
"AnimalMother1","9","2","3","13 September 2014"," Golden Acting from Waltz!
","I've always been a big fan of Tarantino films, and this was certainly a good addition to his line-up of entertaining films, even though it wasn't his best.<br/><br/>The overall plot, in my opinion, wasn't the strongest. It didn't feel like it was well drawn up and instead felt quite disorganised, in particular, I didn't feel as if the Basterds fitted in well with the rest of the plot. Their role in the movie felt rather forced, and the scenes with the Basterds were, in my opinion, the weakest scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>Yet, while the plot wasn't really rich, the film made up for it with its tense, memorable scenes and memorable performances. As expected with Tarantino, he builds up the tension with lengthy scenes and long periods of dialogue. Oh, and of course the comedic over-the-top violence that Tarantino is renowned for does occur in this movie don't worry, but at no point was it out of place.<br/><br/>But really, what made the film was the acting from Christoph Waltz. Before this film, Waltz was a relatively unknown actor hailing from Vienna, yet afterwards, he was transformed into a mainstream actor who all of the film directors are chasing after, and after watching Inglourious Basterds, you can see why. Waltz played the part of SS Colonel Landa to perfection. Honestly the character is one of the best villains ever in cinema history in my opinion. It was just the sheer competence, elegance and ruthlessness the man possessed made him absolutely compelling. Tarantino himself had fears that the role simply could not be played, yet Waltz completely smashed his fear, with style.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the acting, I have to give good mention to Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger, and overall the general acting performances were solid, although, I am critical of Brad Pitt. I felt, especially as one of the main characters, he didn't really create any connection with the viewer, and the role was relatively pedestrian and simple, so this shouldn't be a film that Pitt is renowned for.<br/><br/>Overall though, whilst the film wasn't Tarantino's best, it's certainly a film that was very entertaining and kept my interest the whole way through, so it's certainly worth watching, especially to witness the incredible acting from Waltz. I'd give the movie 8.3/10, which is what it currently is rated at."
"Love_old_films_and_new","2","2","3","6 September 2014"," Read the reviews, but don't waste time watching this movie.
","This movie is truly awful. Quentin Tarantino's prime motivation seems to be to show as much violence as he can, while pretending that his goal is to advance the craft of film making. I like WWII movies and know that war is by definition violent. However, what is interesting to me are the people, their personal histories, characteristics, thoughts, actions, and reactions to their experiences. Quentin Tarentino seems fixated on hostility. This may be what attracts many Americans to movies, but not me.<br/><br/>By contrast, the review by I_Hate_Almost_Everything gives a great summary of this movie, with its amusing chapter by chapter listing of the role of tables in the movie. Read that review and don't waste any more time on this movie."
"SnoopyStyle","8","2","3","30 May 2014"," Quentin Tarantino's style and Christoph Waltz's menace
","In 1941 Nazi-occupied France, ""The Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) finds the Dreyfus family hidden by their neighbors. Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) escapes after her family is massacred. Meanwhile Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) has gathered 8 Jewish American soldiers to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. Their brutal scalping campaign instills fear among the Germans. Donowitz (Eli Roth) is even given a nickname ""The Bear Jew"" for brutally beating Nazis with a baseball bat. Then in June 1944, Shosanna has a new name and a theater. She catches the eye of German war hero Fredrick Zoller who wants a big premiere in her theater that will attract the biggest of Nazi leaders. It even attracts the Jew Hunter as well as the Inglourious Basterds.<br/><br/>Christoph Waltz is great as the cold menacing well-mannered Nazi. He is completely engrossing in every one of his scenes. Every word he speaks is dripping with menace. His scenes are quiet and some of the most compelling parts of the movie. Then Quentin Tarantino has injected his brutal violence into this Jewish revenge fantasy. It is nothing less than audacious and uniquely original."
"thewillt08","4","2","3","15 April 2013"," Not What I Expected
","It is really known that when you see a movie by Quentin Tarantino, you are in for a movie experience like any other. The man who brought us Kill Bill, Django Unchained, and Pulp Fiction brings Inglorious Bastards. I expected really slick dialogue and a lot of action. I tried to enjoy this movie, I really did, but with the English subtitles taking me out of the story, the conversations and characters I don't really care about, and the little action, Tarantino swung and missed with this movie. Inglorious was his worst movie since Kill Bill 2. Brad Pitt stars, I guess he stars since he is in the movie so little, as a leader of the Inglorious Bastards. The Bastards hunt down and kill Nazis. When Pitt is on screen he is entertaining and he did a good job acting, but I wanted to see him more. It takes a long time to introduce his character and we don't see him all that much. Instead, the movie focuses on many characters and it is almost confusing to remember who is who. There was also the Jewish girl who escapes, the members of the inglorious bastards, a few key Nazis including Hitler, the random lady who I don't even know the name of, and then there is the Nazi General played by Christoph Waltz. Waltz is the only reason I didn't hate the movie. He saved the movie for me. He won an Oscar for best actor in a supporting role and for most of the movie I was trying to figure out why. He shows up a lot in the beginning speaking back and forth from English, French, and German, but his conversations are just boring. Pulp Fiction had conversations about milkshakes and it was way more interesting than any conversation in Inglorious Bastards. By the end his characters actions and a really intense scene between Waltz and Pitt really sucked me in and did save the movie for me. I was waiting for something to happen and there were flashes of brilliance in the movie but overall it was disappointing. The strongest point to a Tarantino movie is the dialogue along with some intense action scenes. This movie had very few of both. The very first scene of a movie is very important. Star Wars had Darth Vader's introduction. Lord of the Rings had the seven minute prologue. Pulp Fiction had the incredible conversation in the diner. This movie had nothing. I was uninterested from the very beginning. It is Waltz and a French farmer talking about nonsense and after almost ten minutes of pointless talk it gets interesting. The Frenchman was hiding Jews under the floorboards and the last minute or two of the opening scene had such a little impact because of the boring conversation. It didn't work for me. A lot of people didn't like that most of the movie wasn't in English and that it was subtitled. Now, I love subtitles. Even when a movie is 100%in English I put on subtitles. It is just a habit so subtitles didn't bother me. However, the subtitles took me out of the experience and I'm not too sure why. It made it difficult for me to connect or care with any of the characters. I got a few characters confused and a lot of them were just unimportant. There was a long scene in a bar and again, it had a good ending to the scene but the events leading up to it dragged on and on. This movie isn't suppose to be historically accurate, but this makes zero sense. The basic idea of the movie is to get a large group of Nazi leaders in a movie theatre to present a German war movie, and kill them all. It is the act of a Jew to get revenge on the Nazis with the help of Brad Pitt and the bastards. First off, Nazi leaders would never put all of their leaders in the same room, or at least they would premier in Germany and not France. Trying to sell this idea is completely crazy and you know this would never ever be possible. The ending scenes were amusing and fun to watch, as unrealistic as they were I still laughed. The final scene of the movie was terrible because I was asking myself ""That's it? What happens next? That was dumb."" The story wasn't finished. I feel like it was laziness by Tarantino which was unexpected. Was this movie a disaster? No, when there were action scenes they were really awesome. A huge Jew beats the skull in of a German officer and how do you not enjoy the sight of a Nazi getting demolished by a Jew? Pitt had a lot of smart dialogue and I loved his accent. The confrontation between him and Waltz was great, but it could have been so much better. This entire movie can really be summed up in a word, disappointment. Overall, Inglorious Bastards was not Tarantino's best, but it was not his worst either. I remember seeing trailers for this movie and I thought it looked stupid and I was uninterested. I then learned who Tarantino was and saw his movie and I needed to see this movie. I saw this movie because of its director but I didn't feel like I was watching one of his movies. I didn't know what I was watching but out of respect for the director I finished the movie and salvaged what I could. I did my best to enjoy this movie but it gets the WillyT A for Effort."
"honorhorror","10","8","21","27 August 2009"," It's not for everyone, but it's QT in his finest hour.
","This might be, by any means, my favorite QT movie so far. Maybe that's because I have also made quite some progress by myself, but I still like to give Inglorious Basterds two thumbs up.<br/><br/>It's QT in his purest form, and in his finest hour. Before the movie's release, medias had quite some good time chatting about Brad Pitt's involvement and the controversy the movie aroused up. All these are good signs for those investors, since Inglorious Basterds have triumphed in the box office already. However, Brad Pitt is not the point of the movie. His performance is manageable but not top-notch, yet he's still funny in almost every scene. On the other hand, the supporting cast are the real stars. Christoph Waltz as the sophisticated, sadistic schemer Col. Hans Landa is not to be missed. Unlike a lot of Nazis portrait, he's a mixture between a stereotypical Nazi and a smart farce. Actually, that can also be the summary of the entire film. The one who faced him off was Melane Laurent, whose performance was very impressive in terms of dimensions and details. In some shots, she looked extremely like Tobey Maguire(no kidding). And, I have to mention Diane Kruger, who have never been so brilliant in front of the camera. QT really has some talents to squeeze the potential out of those actors and actress.......<br/><br/>The movie did not try to break through in terms of cinematographic or the camera movements, which means they are good as usual like all the other QT movies. Still, some scenes are ingenious. The final scene was mostly technically-persuasive. In some way, this is also the most stationary movie QT made, since the 90% the conversation was in foreign language and there were not so many casual sequences like in Death Proof or Reservoir Dogs.<br/><br/>Concerning Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds can be considered as its sequel, but more expensive, a lot bloodier and even more over-the-top. Like RD, IB is not for everyone. It's not a good movie to take your kids to. It's also definitely not the best family movie if you consider to take you 80-year-old grandma to. But it's so over-the-top on the dramatic side and comedy side as well. If you don't totally hate it, the efforts put into the screenplay will show you how to turn the greatest war fought in human history into a satire. The lies and tricks set in the beginning of the movie as well as in every chapter's beginning will automatically catch you. Later it naturally catches you off-guard. You may care for all the characters in the movie and even sob for their fates, but you just can't help laughing out at the idiotic status of every climax. The whole thing reached a new peak in the final chapter of the movie, which told some truths about the humanity.....If I expose any bit of the story, it will not make such a surprise for you. Let's describe it this way, you saw the first 3 minutes and assumed it would be very serious, but later you found the underlying mockeries in it. The intentional jokes are obvious to catch and are all funny. But when you walk out of the cinema and recalled the way Hitler acted, and think about the whole idea again, you will laugh your butts off.<br/><br/>Liked it very much, one of the most satisfying movies of the year. I bet 3 Oscars on it. 10/10. QT is becoming more an more careful and bold at the same time. Bravo!"

I'm anti glorifying violence, but for some reason T seems to get away with it, for me . . . perhaps b/c of the comic book quality of his films. <br/><br/>The whole idea of wiping out the German high command, including Hitler, was inventive.

","I felt the film could have been so much better. We have some great actors and an interesting premise, but the movie just doesn't hang together. The plot is too far-fetched and the violence too gratuitous; also, the actors depicting the major Nazis were poorly cast (especially Hitler). Brad Pitt was good in his role, but the one redeeming feature was the acting of Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa, who was so astoundingly realistic as a Jew-hunter Nazi that he made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck. Rarely have I seen a performance so perfectly attuned to the character portrayed."
"sol-","Null","1","1","3 June 2017"," What shall the history books read?
","As Christoph Waltz's Nazi colonel states at one point, ""what shall the history books read?"" is an important theme of this Quentin Tarantino movie that subverts history to present an alternative look at how World War II might have shaped up with a few unwise choices from the Nazis. The plot has Hitler, Goebbels and other high ranking officials attending a propaganda film premiere together - something that gives two factions the same idea to blow up the Nazis. As per Tarantino norm, 'Inglourious Basterds' benefits from snappy dialogue and memorable characters, but this is very much an ensemble piece and sadly not all the characters are fascinating. Waltz is excellent with his cunning interrogations and Mélanie Laurent has some excellent moments as Jewish woman living under a pseudonym and operating the theatre where the propaganda film will be shown. None of the other characters are particularly remarkable though (same goes for the performances), especially Brad Pitt and the over-the-top Italian accent that he inflects at one point. Pitt does get some of the film's best lines though, including in the final memorable scene. Add in some superb spinning shots from Robert Richardson and this is a pretty good- looking film too, but whether it has much to offer beyond its novelty of twisting historical fact, as sometimes happens in the history books, is debatable."

And most importantly there was a satisfying ending.<br/><br/>Forget about the history. Watch it like a movie. Other than that you can't connect with it. Remember connection is very important.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is a complete film from artistic point of view. It is not a serious film.

The casting and Christopher Waltz performance. Waltz Oscar is a well deserved one. Truthfully this is the best performance in villains role I've seen since Heath Ledger's Joker. The casting is phenomenal. The ""Basterds"" are perfect.<br/><br/>A downside of the film is that we are acquainted with Tarantino's style.

The reason I love it so much is for it's simple element of fun. A prime factor of film is escapism, and this picture is not lacking of it. A bizarre idea executed brilliantly. The performance by Christoph Waltz is incredible, and well deserving of an Academy Award. I was also satisfied by the rest of the cast's performances, with Melanie Laurent I can single-out as well. It is fair to say that the film does have quite a distinctive taste, due to the high level of violence, setting and running time, however the right audience see it for what it is: nothing short of a masterpiece."

If you want to find historical errors and features to dislike about it, there are many, but if you allow yourself to become immersed in the amazing tension building scenes and truly spectacular depth of every character, you will love it.<br/><br/>At first, I though that Brad Pitt would annoy me the entire film, but he turned into a splendid comical counterpoint to the incredibly human, intelligent, and sadistic Nazis, and the driven, committed, wounded Jewish girl, all of which are played with impressive skill. The performance of everyone is incredible, with suburb interaction and exquisitely tense spoken scenes. Tarantino is a master of bringing out the best possible performance in the best possible way, and weaving it into an intense delivery.<br/><br/>I was absolutely amazed at the dignity and honor they managed to give a minor character, a German sergeant who faces his coming death with stoic calm in a tense, drawn out scene. When the ""bear Jew"" approaches, he asks, you get this for killing Jews? and the sergeant responds ""bravery"". It was breathtaking, I had the feeling, here is a man worth knowing, how did he win this medal? what is his life story? And then, in the most brutal and brilliant fashion of a QT movie, he is violently killed in a way that robs him of that dignity, and shows the cruel lack of understanding replaced by the rage of the Bear Jew, who as we all know, has his ax to grind as well. Every scene contains this type of power.<br/><br/>I was so involved in the movie that I failed to finish my 9 dollar small popcorn, and I love popcorn.<br/><br/>Complaints- These are minor, but one would be that QT certainly suspends the difference between Wehrmacht and SS units. I see the necessity of this action for the movie, and in the alternate reality that he creates, who knows the history he has created? My second complaint is Mike Meyers. I did not think he found his character in this movie, his scene is awkward in that he seems to be smiling too much, and remaining too serious. He also fails to pull of the commanding presence of an older general, and sounds too young and awkward holding the paperwork. What I was looking for was 'Presence', which he lacked. In my opinion, he just did not work in that role, especially with the unbelievable Winston Churchill look alike and scene stealing arrogant British captain in the same scene.<br/><br/>I hate to say it, but I saw a bit of Dr. Evil, and Austin Powers in his performance. He was weak, but the scene is short, and gets to the point, and in any other movie would be successful. Here the rest of the movie is too powerful.<br/><br/>It was great, I intend to see it again."
"Coventry","10","7","18","30 August 2009"," The Glorious return of true cinematic excitement!
","Perhaps it's partly because I've always been a hugely over-enthusiast and biased Quentin Tarantino fan-boy (I even thought ""Death Proof"" was brilliant), but I can't fathom how anyone could possibly dislike ""Inglorious Bastards"". Tarantino's film is a genuine ode to cinema, and not at all a pretentious and personal hobby-project like some people claim, with a marvelously absurd plot & structure and a deeply fascinating cast of characters. ""Inglorious Bastards"" is the type of motion picture that causes spontaneous adrenalin-rushes inside your body and automatically makes your blood pump faster with its brilliant sequences that are alternatively suspenseful, comical and unbelievably violent. From the teaser trailers and previews we've been seeing months from beforehand, it looked as if this would become a simplistic and insignificant (but nevertheless entertaining) WWII-action flick, but the eventual finished product is a massively surprising epic with style and content that very well could be the most genius movie of the year. Right from the opening chapter, ingeniously titled ""Once upon a time in Nazi- occupied France"", it's crystal clear that Tarantino's amazing talent for writing dialogs hasn't vanished yet (in spite of what QT-haters claim) and that he even improved his skills regarding the building up of tension and atmosphere. Together with his talented eye for acting talent and exact casting (the relatively unknown Austrian actor Christoph Waltz depicts the ultimate Nazi villain in the history of War movies); the intro grows out to an intense and mesmerizing 15 minutes long verbal cat-and-mouse game ending in sheer terror. The next chapters are definitely more light-headed and marvelously over-the-top with the introduction of the titular bastards, the film-within-film plot about a German private who single-handedly slaughtered half an army and Joseph Goebbels turning his adventures into a propaganda movie, the hilarious preparations for a well-planned assassination attack and the return of an orphaned Jewish girl with her mind set on vengeance. The bastards are unquestionably the main attraction of the movie. They're a battalion composed of Jewish soldiers and one lunatic German deserter. Under the command of the pleasantly deranged Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt in an amusing role), they prowl around the occupied French countryside and sadistically kill & scalp Nazi officers wherever they can. This concept is vintage Tarantino, with borrowed ideas from great War movie classics, psychopathic character drawings (for example the Bear Jew with his baseball bat), hilariously witty dialogs and anecdotes and extreme uncompromising violence. <br/><br/>""Inglorious Bastards"" is a non-stop series of brilliant sequences and unforgettable little trivia details. I could easily list fantastic moments throughout five whole pages, like the use of David Bowie's song ""Cat People"" and the Strudel scene inside a French restaurant, but the principal message is to just go and watch this film! Only Tarantino could take a serious topic and setting like WWII and turn it into a darkly comical fantasy with absurd twists and a downright demented climax in which practically the entire Third Reich becomes exterminated in one massive shootout. Like always, Tarantino playfully messes around with the fixed values of cinema. Usually WWII movies stick close to the facts and alter the characters' names, but here the names of all Nazi commanders are maintained but the events are completely fictional. Still, and I truly hope that all the negative minded Tarantino critics will finally realize this as well, our director respects and pays attention to little important details like languages and cultural differences. The Germans speak German, the French speak French and the Americans mock the Europeans regarding all the typical clichés. Everything about ""Inglorious Bastards"" is brilliant and this will undoubtedly become another Tarantino movie that I plan to watch and re- watch numerous of times."

He was very polite and articulate, yet undeniably frightening. Fantastic performance by Mr. Waltz. He should be a least nominated for the Academy award.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was somewhat an insignificant part. He played it well, and he was actually quite hilarious. I just would've liked to see him play a bigger part in the actual slaughter of the Nazi soldiers.<br/><br/>Overall, an incredibly entertaining film.

"Danusha_Goska","6","6","15","28 August 2009"," Tarantino Can't Top Real World War Two with His Fantasy Version
","""Inglourious Basterds"" wants to be World War Two on steroids. It wants to be bigger, stranger, bloodier, meaner, funnier, more stylish than WW II ever was. Here's the problem: World War Two WAS on steroids. It WAS bigger, stranger, bloodier, meaner, funnier, and more stylish than anything a sheltered film geek like Quentin Tarantino could dream up.<br/><br/>Tarantino didn't have to invent a group of Jews who fight Nazis; there were such Jews, including the Warsaw Ghetto fighters, who staged the first urban uprising in occupied Europe, The Bielski Partisans, who fought in the forest, and the Treblinka and Sobibor Uprisings in death camps. Nothing Tarantino could invent could be stranger than the life of Oswald Rufeisen, a Jew who survived by posing as an SS man; his memoir, ""In the Lion's Den,"" is far freakier and gasp-inducing than anything in Tarantino's film. No filmmaker will ever make a more over-the-top or diabolically stylish production than Leni Riefenstahl's 1935 documentary of the Nuremburg Nazi Party Congress, ""Triumph of the Will."" Tarantino has a reputation for stylish violence; the violent scenes in ""Inglourious Basterds"" are not as violent nor as innovative in their use of violence as those in ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""The Passion of the Christ."" Tarantino also has a reputation for witty, stylish dialogue. Again, the real World War Two produced plenty of unforgettable lines: ""Peace in our time,"" ""Who remembers the Armenians?"" ""I shall return,"" ""Nuts."" Tarantino's most daring ambition is to provide a more ignominious end for Hitler than Hitler's real demise. Sorry, can't be done. Hitler died a betrayed, solitary loser, knowing full well that everything he had strived for was lost. A far better movie, ""Downfall,"" depicts Hitler's nightmarish real life descent into Hell; Magda and Joseph Goebbels' historically accurate deaths in ""Downfall,"" preceded by their murder of their own children, are as creepy as it gets. Tarantino can't top history.<br/><br/>""Inglourious Basterds"" consists, for the most part, of a series of relatively disconnected dialogue scenes; the sensationally violent scenes are few and far between. Dialogue goes on and on and on. Yes, there are some gems, and some tension is created, but the simple fact is that Tarantino needs an editor. I never thought I'd be so bored in a lurid, violent movie about Jews wrecking revenge on Nazis. There are three different scenes of Nazis and resistance members who are hiding something sitting around tables, consuming food and drinks, and hoping that the Nazis don't discover their secrets. The first time Tarantino does this it is very powerful. The third time it just drags, and you think, ""Come on. Don't you have anything else to say?"" Suspension of disbelief and conventional narrative structure work magic on the brain, inviting identification. Tarantino does everything he can to push his viewers away from involvement in this film and to remind viewers that he, Quentin Tarantino, quirky film genius, is the real star.<br/><br/>The Basterds of the title are minor characters; the plot hops from place to place, character to character. When top Nazis appear on screen, a hand scrawled note appears on the film, with an arrow and the Nazi's name. Some scenes, like the opening involving a Nazi interrogation of a French peasant, are played as if real, and other scenes are obviously played with lots of winking and nudging at the audience. Musical styles shift throughout the movie. ""This is really a salute to Spaghetti Westerns!"" some of the music shrieks. Experimentation is welcome, but all this ""Hey, don't forget, Quentin Tarantino is behind the camera; I'm famous for quirky films"" winking and nudging broke my involvement with the film and made it a real slog for me. I didn't care about what I was looking at, and I got bored.<br/><br/>""Inglourious Basterds""' opening scene is flawless. Nazis arrive at an isolated French farmhouse. A girl is hanging sheets on a line. Given Tarantino's penchant for saluting past films, I immediately thought of Andrzej Wajda's ""Ashes and Diamonds,"" and was ready to see a character bleed to death all over those clean sheets. Not so. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), a Nazi ""Jew Hunter,"" is there to interrogate the farmer (Denis Menochet). Menochet is brilliant in this scene, a study in stoic, peasant masculinity. Waltz waltzes into movie history. His fastidious, precious, melodramatic performance as a perfectly evil Nazi enters cinematic history. His life will never be the same.<br/><br/>The rapturous embrace of ""Inglourious Basterds"" by critics and film fans is kind of depressing. It's sad to think that there are young people who will think that this is what World War Two either was like or should have been like, and it's sad to think that they are so divorced from history that they don't get how wrong both assumptions are. Years from now scholars will study kids who think that no Jews fought back till Tarantino invented them."
"mikenine453","5","6","15","26 August 2009"," Great moments but fairly all over the place
","I really loved characters and moments in this film but felt those gems were hidden in a very sloppy/messy structure and a fairly insensitive film. I know this is what QT was going for but it seems pretty strange to me to trivialize something as serious as this subject matter for a sort of silly entertainment value. I also had a problem with the fact that the Basterds were really featured very sparingly in the film. Its sort of false advertisement of sorts to sell this movie as revolving around these characters and then really spend the majority of the film elsewhere. It felt like Brad Pitt was only in the movie for 45 minutes (out of 2 and a half hours). This structure made it hard to connect with any of the characters as they were so spread out throughout the movie. Also, really great scenes began to drag on and on throughout the film. It felt very self-indulgent. And I really felt the ending was in poor taste."
"Jonny_Numb","7","6","15","23 August 2009"," Long, Gory, and Not Quite Glourious
","Taking its basic inspiration from a subpar '70s actioner (same title, but spelled correctly) by Enzo Castellari, Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" is the story of a group of Jewish-American soldiers scalping Nazis at the end of World War II...or maybe it's about the plot to kill the officers of the Nazi high command at the world premiere of a propaganda flick at a small French art theatre...or maybe it's about sitting around in a pub, trying to guess what cultural icon is written on that card pasted to your forehead.<br/><br/>To say ""Basterds"" takes the 'scenic route' to its inevitable conclusion would be a vast understatement. There is almost too much nuance, subtlety, and craftsmanship to absorb in one sitting, but in its own novel-like way (like the ""Kill Bill"" films, this is also divided into chapters), it all comes together, somehow.<br/><br/>An avid disciple of trash cinema with an undeniable knack for recycling said trash into creations of originality and cinematic slickness, Tarantino's love--first and foremost--is his characters...and their ability to jaw away on subjects ranging from crucial to superficial. Critics hailed this approach most notably in ""Pulp Fiction,"" Tarantino's 1994 breakthrough. But by the time ""Death Proof"" rolled into theaters as part of the ""Grindhouse"" double bill in 2007, many seemed burned out by what had, at that point, become formulaic (scenes of winding conversation juxtaposed against moments of shocking violence). Those disappointed by ""Death Proof"" are not likely to be won over by the ambitious–yet garrulous–""Basterds."" <br/><br/>Neither will those who have viewed the ""Basterds"" trailer (a shrewdly assembled string of highlights from the film's scattered--yet potent --action scenes) expecting a slam-bang fiesta of Nazi scalpings and bodies riddled with machine-gun fire. As exciting as it would be to see Tarantino truly cut loose with a scuzzy, exploitative homage to his forefathers, I think that duty will be forever be supplanted by frequent collaborator Robert Rodriguez (""Planet Terror""; ""Sin City""). Still, Tarantino has pulled off quite a feat with ""Basterds"": he has made an art film that will play on nearly every screen in America, has the misspelled taboo of its title to draw in the curious, and makes sure most of the film's dialog is spoken in an array of languages (French, German, broken Italian)–that's right, this is a film that, for the most part, is READ. The opening-day crowd I saw this with expressed audible displeasure at the near-constant barrage of subtitled dialog. ""C'mon, when do we get to see more scalpings?"" it seemed to cantankerously demand.<br/><br/>As a period piece, ""Basterds"" is aesthetically interesting in that it straddles the line between the tropes associated with low-budget independent film-making and infuses them with a distinctly mainstream slickness (by comparison, this fictionalized take on the fall of the Third Reich and the end of WWII boasts a better plot and more excitement than last year's fact-based ""Valkyrie""). The result is an oft-confounding collection of seemingly disparate events and characters (including frequent flashbacks that, puzzlingly, lack any sort of context), but I can't deny the sheer genius of certain passages, and the way the climax doesn't shy away from upending the proceedings in an unabashed orgy of blood and madness.<br/><br/>Above all else, the film is a showcase for Tarantino's distinctly well (some would say over)-drawn characters. Frequently, he will bring the story to an unexpected halt to give a newly-introduced face a monologue that shades in every nook and nuance, often before said character is unceremoniously blown away minutes later. While the result is an arrhythmic pace in a film that could have easily benefited from some dialog clipping, it also portends a depth that goes largely unseen in our attention-deficit era of film-making. And while Brad Pitt earns top billing as Lt. Aldo ""The Apache"" Raine (and is perfectly serviceable in the role), the film contains standout performances from Melanie Laurent (as the Jewish survivor of a Nazi raid, who runs the aforementioned French art theatre and conveys a detached, ice-cold beauty) and especially Christoph Waltz as Third Reich Colonel Hans Landa, whose ingratiating smile and laugh portends a darkness that's nothing short of horrifying (don't be surprised if he snags a Best Supporting Actor nod at next year's Oscars)."
"Quinoa1984","10","11","33","21 August 2009"," a spectacular achievement of ""movie"" cinema
","Inglourious Basterds won't please everyone. It's not a full-blown crowd-pleaser like other (dumber) blockbusters from this past summer. It's a war film, but in the same way that Pulp Fiction was a crime film. Some will be thrown off by things that people tend to take for granted with Quentin Tarantino films: it's ""talky"", with pages and pages of dialog performed sometimes like a stage play, and the violence, when it happens at a moments notice, is graphic and harsh and not with much hope for the character killed or injured or, in this case, scalped. It might not even be a film some will claim is the greatest film ever of a generation like with PF. But, for me, it is about as pure a piece of cinematic bliss I could ask for this year. And, dare I suggest, it's as audacious and genre re-defining as anything Tarantino's done, or may do again.<br/><br/>Tarantino makes up his own rules to break them down and see what makes them tick. Godard was like that, but in this case we don't see a filmmaker lose control of his own rules as Godard ultimately did in his career. Instead its a sprawling epic that throws a few really big damn monkey wrenches into Americans vs. Germans vs. French in world war two. It tells concurrent stories that come together in the BIG climactic chapter (and make no mistake, these are BIG, long chapters unlike Kill Bill) about a Jewish girl, Shoshanna (Mélanie Laurent) who runs away just in time before the Nazis kill her family who are in hiding on a French farm, and years later becomes an owner of a movie theater in Paris and is picked out by a popular 'star' Nazi soldier (Daniel Bruhl) to screen a film starring himself in a recreation of his slaughtering 300 people from a roof-top.<br/><br/>The other is, naturally, the Basterds. It's actually with these story lines that Tarantino makes up his first rule to break: why not have a movie called Inglourious Basterds and *not* have them in every frame of the movie? Indeed, by my estimation, the Basterds are in about 55 to 60% of the full running time of the movie. But their scenes are the larger-than-life sort where we see Brad Pitt in an outstanding-cartoonish portrayal of a mass murderer/scalper who, in the real world, is a true-blue war criminal. Him and his men, which include ""the Bear"" (Eli Roth in a surprisingly good turn) and Hugo Stigliz, tear-ass around Europe taking down any Nazis in site (the ""killin' Nazi business"" as Ray says very clearly), and its hear we see an exaggeration of the take-no-prisoners philosophy of men in combat. Prisoners? Too much to bring along. Better to sic the Bear on em.<br/><br/>And all the while Tarantino provides us with an absolutely menacing presence with Hans Landa, a German colonel who appears in the opening scenes in a manner akin to Angel Eyes in the Good, the Bad and the Ugly (this is surely intentional, of course), only his evil is the smiling, chilling kind that reminds one of a William S. Buroughs line: the face of evil is the face of total need. Landa needs information, constantly, and asks so questioningly and with such cunning that we feel a sense of uncommon dread when he appears on screen, even when its just to eat a pastry with the (incognito) Shosanna. And leading in this role, almost threatening to tower over all of the other great or at least just revelatory performances, is that of Christoph Waltz. Take your eyes off this guy, I dare you. He's about as hypnotic and alluring and subtle as they come, and can floor you like Samuel L. Jackson reciting a Bible quote.<br/><br/>But oh, yeah, this film is ""talky"", make that clear again I should. Some scenes go on with a kind of cruel precision that one finds often in Tarantino's work, where you wonder if it might be going *too* long but, in reality, you'll probably be too caught up in the acting, or the suspense that builds (i.e. the basement-bar scene is a classic example) to such a thick point you'll get goosebumps. But at the same time that Tarantino makes a muchly European movie, with small nods to German and French cinema and a surprisingly mature control of the characters and mis-en-scene, he also makes a gaudy spectacle with his Hitler (at first) coming up like Moe Howard of the Three Stooges in You Natzi Spy, or even just Pitt's voice and mannerisms. It's something special to see a filmmaker embrace conventions and then set them with a box of grenades in another. If you see the climax you'll see what that means even more (and that, perhaps, reaches a pornographic exploitation of Nazi carnage).<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds left me intrigued, startled, laughing, cringing, jaw-agape and eyes-widened, and left me hungry for more. Some will leave disappointed and some will complain. There not without their rights in this case. It's also one of a handful of examples in 2009 cinema of true f***-the-world ""art"" you'll come across. I, for one, can't wait to go into it again, even with that final line screaming (delightfully) of its director's hubris."

","It was with the most excited, expectant anticipation that I sat down to Inglourious Basterds, only to slowly discover that I was being conned. It was a slow realization, but eventually I was convinced. I've loved pretty much everything that Tarantino has done, he's not afraid of unconventional storytelling and usually gives us a good ride. But here, I'm not even sure what I saw. Any Tarantino fan knows there will be long dialog scenes, Mr.T loves his talky parts, but give us a break. Scene after overlong scene of people just sitting around talking, creating faux suspense with sudden and ridiculous payoffs. I can definitely say it's the most un-action packed war movie I've ever seen. I kept expecting something to happen, and when a little bit did, it just moved on to another torturous dialog marathon. With all the talking, there is very little obvious humor and when there is a laugh it's not much of a relief. Tarantino (again) divides the film into chapters, which are boldly stated like we're finally going to get going, but no, we just keep meandering along with the yackety yack. Others here have stated that the film is childish but I'll also add that it looks amateur, if there was a lot of money in it, I couldn't tell. Even the finale which I assume is supposed to be epic and disaster-like feels rushed, confused and tightly filmed. I have no objections to the ""alternate reality"" plot, but at least make that alternate reality interesting, instead it comes off lame and badly thought through. I have no objections to the violence, but there was precious little of it for a war pic. The shocks often come like a punchline to a joke instead of justified. We get suggestions that The Basterds are supposed to be like The Dirty Dozen, but none of them (with the exception of Brad Pitt) even have a handful of lines, frustrating for such a dialog heavy piece. Eli Roth's role is borderline cameo and I kept wanting to get to know ""the gang"" just a little bit, but it never happens. Mike Myers appearance is distracting and unnecessary. There are no heroes, no villains, just a bunch of people being mean to one another, sadistic on both sides of the conflict, which ultimately does a disservice to what millions of poor souls must have really experienced. I HATE to get preachy about something that's supposed to be fun, but I can't help but see it that way. Thank God we didn't get a concentration camp scene. The main idea here seems to be the notion that it would be cool to see Jews exact their revenge upon Nazis. This may be a great idea when sitting around after too many drinks, but it does not a movie make. There were many moments that I got so bored listening to people run their mouths that I just zoned out, again, not something I would associate with Tarantino. I left the theater disappointed and angry. To say that this was not my idea of a Terantino film is a huge understatement.<br/><br/>I would compare the experience to a kid who's all excited at Christmas for a pair of skates and instead gets a photo of skates...no, a drawing of skates, and the whole family just laughs and laughs."

It is like a combination of the TV show Hogan's Heroes and a bloody WWII flick.

Making the Nazis into such buffoons, as they were in Hogan's Heroes, makes them seem more cuddly than horrible. I would argue that this is a fantasy. It was not meant to be taken seriously.

","I am Jewish and I LOVED this film. I wasn't prepared to love it as I had heard about the violence which I often cannot endure but I did love the film. Why? I was born in 1948 after the greatest catastrophe, the Holocaust, was perpetrated on the Jewish people – my people. Thankfully, I never experienced it but year after year I absorbed the horror of it in film and by the word of mouth from parents and friends who knew about it or experienced themselves the evil that had befallen our people. I have viewed hundreds of hours of film footage of it, documentaries on it, bought and read books and anthologies about it, viewed TV drama devoting hours to it, viewed and participated in lengthy discussions and yet through all of that one burning question remains and it is not necessarily the word why. We can find thousands of rationales for the Holocaust but the question of what can we do about it remains illusive. As a naive child I said to my parents but we won the war as if that were the happy ending of it. The answer always was an unsatisfying yes we won the war but  .<br/><br/>The trials at Nuremberg, the trial of Eichmann, the imprisonment and execution of some of the Nazi hierarchy to be sure was some satisfaction but not the kind of satisfaction I desired for such unpardonable and unspeakable crimes. I had to face reality. There was no revenge huge enough and there was certainly nothing that could bring back the cerebrally unfathomable six million. What does six million mean? It is an utterly incomprehensible number made even worse because it is a number that COULD have included me. Only an accident of location and time of birth made me a learner about and not a victim of those events at that horrible time. Still, there is no revenge which is able to give purpose to the purposeless. That is a hard reality for a Jew who was born in America to swallow. Are not the good guys supposed to win? Do not the bad guys get sent to hell? The answer is a discouraging no the good guys do not always prevail and no, the bad guys probably do not end up in hell. Truly there is no good ending for this incredible story.<br/><br/>This film, though, albeit in fiction form, satisfied the desire for revenge for those dastardly deeds perpetrated within a historical minute slightly more than 65 years ago. The end of the film was the Dante's inferno for the Nazi curse. It was glorious to watch as hell by Jewish hands was visited upon the entire Nazi hierarchy including Hitler himself in the confines of a beautiful theater as if the entire war was played out right then and there on film and I rejoiced. I felt like I took a bath in flames that cleansed the world and me of one of man's most horrific crimes. It was as if God himself burned the screen, blew up the theater where Nazi big wigs sat and screamed to them this is Jewish revenge; this is Jewish punishment for what you have done. I loved it and wished it were true.<br/><br/>Alas, it is not true though as it is a work of fiction. So afterward I am bounced back to reality yet again and know there is nothing I can or will be able to ever do about it. I can as a Jew never exact my pound of flesh but I did, for over two hours, feel as if I had. More, much more can be said about this film. I highly recommend it IF one understands the necessary violence of it."

"curtis-8","6","5","12","14 September 2009"," Interesting, but not the ""New Dirty Dozen"" action film its advertising purports
","""Inglourious Basterds"" is an interesting film, but not really a satisfying one. It has the ideas and framework of a cracking 1960's style WWII action spectacle, along the lines of ""The Dirty Dozen"" or ""Where Eagles Dare,"" (Or even Italy's ""Inglorious Bastards"" from which the new film gains its name). But the long sequences that make up IG are really more like outtakes from a Hollywood film. It's as though Tarantinio is presenting the conversations that happened in the big budget 1960s WWII action epic when the camera wasn't on. In that way, it is actually much more like his first commercial feature ""Reservoir Dogs""--long dialog sequences punctuated by violent outbursts; all surface style, no deep characterization; incredibly entertaining dialog, but way too much of it, etc.<br/><br/>I had very high hopes after the first sequence, a very skillful lift of the prolonged yet tense opening sequence from Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" But I was soon to find out that the film was just going to be one such sequence after another, each less effective than the last simply due to the repetition. There were no real themes developed, the Basterds (except for Pitt's cartoony ""Psychotic Andy Taylor"") were basically faceless and uninteresting, and the whole thing was unfocused and unbalanced. But even so, the dialog scenes were entertaining while they were taking place—it's just that they served absolutely no other purpose than momentary amusement. It would have been really cool if Tarrantino had collaborated with someone who could have integrated the best of his conversational sparring sequences into an actual story."
"gentendo","7","5","12","12 September 2009"," Jewish Fantasy Fulfilled?
","The long anticipated, ultra-violent spaghetti western riddled with WWII iconography is Tarantino's homage to the alleged Jewish fantasy: sadistically bludgeoning the Arian, Nazi race. We follow two savage forces—the Basterds and Shosanna—each who make separate attempts to destroy Hitler and his band of carnal cronies, thereby ending the war.<br/><br/>Made with reminiscent traces of The Great Escape & The Dirty Dozen, not to mention the peppered cruelty of Hostel or any other torturous Eli Roth picture, Inglourious Basterds is a marvelously skewed alternative to how WWII should have ended, rather than how it actually did end. When it was over, I sat in the theater feeling sterile. Fruit could not be produced.<br/><br/>In typical Tarantino form, the film was broken into five headlined chapters, was terribly verbose yet possessed witty dialogue on occasion, masked its bloody and grotesque content in beautiful aesthetics, flowered a pastiche of anachronistic musical melodies, and brought forth extremely rich & compelling character developments—all of which were mesmerizing. Christoph Waltz, in particular, gave a truly haunting performance, the best Nazi portrayal I've ever seen and one in whom I hope wins multiple awards. Brad Pitt was just goofy, nothing special, but Waltz was downright sinister—a manipulatively charismatic Nazi general who toyed with every character's (including the audience's) emotions. Every time he was present on screen, I felt fully secure in the holy moment, or rather the devilish moment.<br/><br/>Similar to the sword picture homage he gave in the Kill Bill series, I.B. reflects Tarantino's obscure reverence towards WWII and the cinema-going experience in general. The film in many instances reveals Tarantino's love of celluloid, as suggested through the multiple Noir, French New Wave, Neo-Realistic and Spaghetti Western nuances. The man has a pervasive education in film history and it greatly heightens the quality of his work—that much I give him. However, as much as the film was provocative and cutting-edge devilry, there was something deeply disturbing about it.<br/><br/>The audience, as I'm sure Tarantino intended, was laughing hysterically at all of the blood-spattered carnage displayed implacably before them: whether it was the scalping of Nazi's, the irrevocable and torturous image of Eli Roth bashing a Nazi's head to pieces, or the slitting of throats or machine-gun riddled faces. It was just sick, twisted. Even Tarantino seemed to get the last laugh via his femme fatale laughing head as she watched the theater hall filled with Nazis burn ironically proxy for the Jews. ""Payback is a bitch,"" he seemed to subtextually scream.<br/><br/>Though I never laughed once, I was just as guilty as they were, for I well knew what I had paid to see. And when you pick up a snake asking it not to bite, you are denying the law of causation; you desire the identities of particular entities to disobey their innate natures and conform instead to your anarchic, destructive wishes. Well, in that sense, the film was a good social experiment. It taught a valuable principle of what it feels like to lose hope and faith in humanity, and as deputy, indulge in the ""super-cool,"" pretty packaged pockets of sadism. I was hoping, though, that one of the characters would be redeemed, rather than have to sit through 2 ½ hours of the ""eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"" philosophy."

","If you have not seen this movie yet, stop reading this review and go. In a nutshell this is Tarantino's version WWII and it is a dandy. Tarantino's exceptional writing skills on display are further enhanced with exceptional acting thanks to Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz. In particular, Waltz' performance of the multilingual-Gestapo-juggernaut is dominating. This film is filled with satire, suspense, and drama which is likely to garner awards. I could easily call this film this years Dark Knight. Whats interesting about this film is that although WWII films have become tiresome, Tarantino has put together an avant-garde war film which is rare and should not be overlooked."
"a_Berliner","10","7","19","5 September 2009"," A Masterpiece
","Tarantino's latest film about a group of Jewish avenger in WWII France is the best film I have seen in years. The different interwoven stories which the film tells in different chapters and the development of the characters are not remarkable - but the sheer brilliance of the acting, the pictures, the directing, the dialogs, the cinematic references and the original ideas make this movie a masterpiece. Besides it offers countless layers of understanding and interpretation (some controversial) - while being thoroughly entertaining.<br/><br/>When I am reading some reviews and comments here and elsewhere I see that the movie has one big problem with the audience: Unless you understand at least two of the three languages spoken in it (German, English and French in order of significance for the movie) you will have difficulties to appreciate and savor the brilliance of many dialogs and partly even of the acting. Being German I can tell you that the German spoken in the film is perfect and authentic ""Nazi-German"" in diction and delivery by the superb cast. BTW, I always thought that the problem of not having many good German movies was the lack of good German speaking actors. Tarantino proves that I was wrong.<br/><br/>Christian Waltz's Oscar-worthy performance as ""Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa is as good as Forest Whitaker in ""The Last King of Scotland"" and as frightening. Landa's character as well as the acting of it outshines the other characters a little bit, still, the rest of the cast is superb: Denis Menochet as cool French dairy farmer in the opening scene, the beautiful Melanie Laurent as close lipped Jewish-French movie theater proprietress who is not succumbing to the youthful charm of Daniel Brühl as German war hero. Noteworthy also August Diehl whose performance is as convincing as Waltz's as evil SS officer. The only exception is Diane Kruger as German movie diva whose acting and especially German articulation are a little bit amateurish although her German-accented English is very convincing.<br/><br/>This leaves us with the eponymous heroes: Whereas the rest of the characters seems to be more or less drawn from ""real life"" the Inglorious Basterds are depicted (not literally) as Comic figures. And the cast delivers: Brad Pit as determined hillbilly Lt., Eli Roth as the angry ""Jew bear"", Till Schweiger as gloomy killer and the rest are overacting with relish - but this brings a humorous touch to the movie and an important detachment from the horrible reality of WWII.<br/><br/>I should add that this is by no means a historic movie or even a war movie. For all perfection in the use of language, costumes and scenery: The history is only the background for the artist not his aim."
"thejimhale","10","7","19","23 August 2009"," Great Movie
","A very memorable movie, both funny and a great revenge flick. I'm a big Tarantino fan and was happy to see he's still putting out great stuff. For those that say it was too long, I feel the opposite. Didn't want it to end. The acting was first rate all around. In particular Melanie Laurent's role. The emotions she portrayed as the victim and then the avenger were incredible. Christopher Waltz as the Nazi SS colonel was superb. Best role I ever saw Brad Pitt in hands down. For those of German descent I could see how it could offend, but you need to keep some perspective. Look what kind of stereotypes blacks and native Americans have had to put up with and they didn't even do any of the disgusting things the Nazis did. Some very funny moments all through the film. At the end, at the theater I attended in Provo, Utah, the audience burst out into applause. The movie does have some gory scenes in it, so be forewarned. Oh, Til Schwieger (german soldier that joined the bastards)was incredible. Particularly in the bar scene."

The violence and gore in this movie were way too over-the-top, and I still don't understand why so many people apparently like this movie.

"Ferdinand_99","10","4","9","5 November 2012"," Tarantino's best
","Inglourious Basterds is set in Nazi-occupied France and is about a group of American soldiers called the Basterds working behind enemy lines, killing and scalping as many Nazis as possible. Their leader is lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), a man who for example likes to carve swastikas to the heads of Nazis (he usually lets one go to tell the story of the Basterds). In 1944 the allied forces plan ""Operation Kino"", an operation where most of the Nazi high command is killed during the presentation of a new movie. The Basterds are ordered to execute this important operation. The theater where the presentation is being held is owned by Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) a French Jew whose family had been killed by SS colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) and is planning to burn the cinema down during the same presentation to kill the Nazi high command. But then something shocking happens: Hitler decides to attend the presentation.<br/><br/>The reason why this movie that is so good is the script. It's a very original story that feels like it couldn't have been written by anyone else than Quentin Tarantino. The dialog is sharp, the characters are interesting (except a couple of characters could have been developed a bit more) and the way that Tarantino keeps what is happening unrealistic in a way that it still doesn't feel like a joke is great . Especially the character of Hans Landa is extremely well written.<br/><br/>The second great thing about this movie is the acting. Christoph Waltz clearly gives the best performance as the charming but scary Hans Landa. I also think it's the best performance by a supporting actor that year. But the rest of the cast is really good as well, especially Mélanie Laurent, Daniel Brühl and Diane Kruger. But those performances are a bit less showy than the performance that Waltz gives.<br/><br/>The film is also well directed by Tarantino with some great directorial choices that make the film more than just a movie with a good script. The look of the film is also very good: the cinematography is very good and the production and costume design are just like what they're supposed to be.<br/><br/>As a whole Inglourious Basterds is a great entertaining film with an excellent script, great acting and directing, good cinematography and design. The final line of the movie feels like Tarantino is saying that this is his masterpiece. Whether it is that depends on the viewer. I personally think that this is Tarantino's best but this is coming from someone who has yet to see Reservoir dogs, Pulp fiction, Kill Bill vol. 1 and Death proof (although I don't think the last one is going to be that good). But I do think that Inglourious Basterds is one of the best movies of 2009."
"Trombonehead","1","4","9","1 June 2012"," Tarentino's WORST Movie Ever
","I didn't go see Inglorious Basterds when it first came out. Although I'm a fan of other Tarentino movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs,and Kill Bill----and think Jackie Brown was totally brilliant ---- the promotion and the trailer to Quentin's first war movie just didn't grab me. Now that I've finally gotten around to seeing it---- it's definitely two thumbs down. This is not only Tarentino's worst movie ever, it is also one of the all-time worst movies. It doesn't take you long to see that the plot is just a hash-job remake of ""The DIrty Dozen"" and ""Where Eagles Dare"" and some other famous war flicks. It's the old ""Select-team-penetrates-Nazi-headquarters-in- disguise-and-wipes-the-enemy-out"" cliché. There's really nothing really new here at all except the level of violence. Even the foreign dialogue with subtitles has been done many times before. All that happens is that Tarentino basically just throws the cast into a big stage set like a puppet-master, and regurgitates his own standard clichés. It has the usual amount of extremely gratuitous violence thrown into your face at regular intervals. It has the usual number of bizarre, sadistic, disturbed, twisted, and otherwise bent or unconventional characters. It has shocking twists in the plot when you least expect it. But that's all you get. Tarentino fails to to give us something unique, like he can do when he's really on. The basic problem is the script, which is the weakest he has ever written. The plot is just plain silly and pointless, and could have been so much stronger and interesting. There are long tedious scenes with reams of dialogue that just take up time and go nowhere, unlike his earlier productions, where dialogue is original, razor-sharp, riveting, totally unpredictable, and powerful. There are no performances that reach the level of Samuel Jackson, John Travolta, Pam Grier, Uma Thurmann, Robert DeNiro etc. in past productions. Brad Pitt is basically just hamming it up, and is ultimately disappointing. The same goes for the rest of the cast. That's because Tarentino's usual gift for characterization is only partially evident. This movie could have been so much better. It's disjointed, self-indulgent, and ultimately boring. I never thought Tarentino could make such a total loser. I hope he gets back on track with his next one."
"brian-669","1","4","9","6 March 2012"," How bad can it get?
","This film wastes Tarantino's massive talents on a cruel, vicious distortion of the truth which puts the Allies on a par with the Nazis. Christopher Waltz was competent in his part, but Brad Pitt was well miscast and below par. A few good cinematic moments, such as the opening sequence in the farmer's cottage, were spoilt by over indulgent direction throughout. I could just about have stood the unhistorical plot if it had some purpose, but it came out in the end as nothing more than an anti-Nazi wet dream. Someone please tell Tarantino that cruelty needs to be justified by something more than evoking a sadistic response in the audience."
"aadpilot","10","4","9","31 December 2011"," Best film of 2009
","I hate violence. Over the years, I've avoided Tarantino's other films for purely that reason. Yet I watched this one for an artist's interpretation of history, a personal passion of mine. I was floored. Everything about this film is perfect. I knew of his particular use of music, his snappy dialog, and general film-making style. I was not prepared for how this film would affect me. I'll break it down in the following way:<br/><br/>VISUALS- While much of the film involves simply conversations between little groups, it still looks beautiful. The lighting in the first scene is especially stunning. Being a period piece, the colors are somewhat muted, the costumes autumn hues, with bursts of brilliant crimson at the right moments.<br/><br/>SCRIPT- I knew prior to viewing this that words were the director's strength. Excuse the pun, but I didn't know how that would translate into other languages. With a film half in English, and the rest in German, French, and Italian, it remains funny, witty, poignant, and crackling throughout. Actors shift seamlessly between dialects, for both humorous effect and key thematic moments. I could write volumes on the script alone. It's that incredible.<br/><br/>ACTING- Everyone's brilliant of course. The cast is huge, the nationalities varied and every actor makes scenes their own. Thanks to the brilliant lines, they all get to shine. The two standouts are Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent. While Melanie's Shosanna is restrained and her arch towards vengeance both powerful and quiet, Christoph's Hans Landa seeps onto the screen, attacks and probes at the viewer, and infects them. I laughed with and at him, hated him, was fascinated by and loathed him. He's just that good.<br/><br/>MUSIC- A soundtrack makes a film for me, and this did not disappoint. German standards from the 40s mixed with Bowie and vintage Ennio Morricone, perfectly accentuating a line or scene. It's playing in my house or in my ear at least once a week.<br/><br/>THEMES- We manipulate, we love, we hate, laugh, misinterpret, destroy. Evil begets further evil, and hatred breeds further hatred. Moments of pure beauty or jubilation are contrasted with sudden and extreme violence, one balancing the other, each necessary for the other's existence. All these are universal truths, and film the universal language. Tarantino addresses all these, and more- is violence the answer, if it is justified; how do you define a hero; and who ultimately writes history. War is merely a backdrop to tell a story, probably told before, of heroes and heroines, villains and tyrants, victory and defeat. In the same vein, film is merely a backdrop to tell a story, hopefully NOT told before. Inglourious Basterds is film making at its grandest, where the players, the words, and the visuals move in perfect harmony. I've seen it a dozen times over, and with each viewing I catch a new snippet of dialog, a sly look, a sneaky sight gag. Could not all history be re-worked in such a magnificent style? But I digress. Where were we?"
"polyesterfastfilm","10","4","9","29 September 2011"," You put beef in the stew!? You know I'm vegetarian!
","Roughly translated, Inglourious Basterds means an old, shameful unpleasantry, like a vegetarian who is tricked into once again swallowing a piece of beef. Tarantino plays devil's advocate, the person playing the practical joke, who puts the beef in the stew, thinking that if we are conscious of what we intake we will be aware of the tomfoolery. If not then our blindness will lead us to the immorality we strive against, in this case, that meat is murder.<br/><br/>He is telling the audience to not be a pushover, to stand up for what you believe in, and to not be scorned by ignorance. The last line, ""This just might be my masterpiece,"" is a mathematically crafted answer, his ""Therefore, QED"" statement that tries to answer sets of matrices. It takes a well trained eye to calculate the numbers as they grow exponentially throughout. This is no test problem, more so a bonus question. It reads, ""Solve the differential equation,"" and the answer demystifies a single stereotype that math teachers can only hope to demolish in students brains, ""That math has no application in the real world."""

","Quentin Tarantino is truly one of a kind. His well-known earmarks are always fun to watch. I think it's phenomenal how he can make films which are so full of personality and quality - brilliant performances, epic quotes, satisfaction. Inglorious Basterds had been waited for some time and I gotta tell you, it absolutely delivered. I thought it might be good, a real shooter. What I didn't think was that it would make a list to my elite films. It was a surprise at times, but when I think now, it isn't. Why? Because it's Tarantino's. You just know you get great stuff.<br/><br/>Obviously, it is Christoph Waltz in the role of Col. Hans Landa, to whom all the applauds are going to. His performance is second to none. But I wouldn't underrate Brad Pitt's role as Lt. Aldo Raine. Terrific actor, extremely versatile.<br/><br/>Believe me, Quentin Tarantino gives a new look to the WWII. It may like you, it may not.

This silly, childish comic-book movie would have sunk without trace if it were not for the publicity generated by having Tarantino as director, and to a lesser extent Pitt as a main character. But it's not pointless. As cynically pointed out Ricky Gervais, any Hollywood film to do with Jews and World War II will earn an Oscar. <br/><br/>First of all, a Hollywood film about the war will reinforce American belief they won it. Alone. Secondly, and this is more recent but vital: that World War II was all about the Jews. Now we have another film whereby the Jews won the war. The film's plot is about cinemas and the importance of Jews and Hollywood is unhidden - so pay attention to what's being said: Jews of America control the media (not just Hollywood) and the media is how you receive the world's reality. The most telling scene is when a German officer has his head bashed in by a baseball bat. The Jew (""Jew-Bear"") proves he is quintessentially American with his self-congratulatory mock-heroics afterward, baseball representing this. Hollywood wins America. ""America"" has been reinvented by Jews. They won the war, the anti-semitic Nazis lost. Saxons lost. Anglo-Saxons lost."

","Have you ever been feeling mixed emotions such as squeamishness and interest, love and hate while watching the film? If not, you must contemplate a masterpiece by Quentin Tarantino ""Inglourious Basterds"".
The main action happens in Nazi-occupied France, where the American, British and Jewish spies try to kill as many German soldiers and officers as they can and, of course, not to forget to murder a key figure of the II World War - Hitler. The story is far-fetched but I think that filmakers have this opportunity of changing an outcome of War.
""My honor - loyalty"" - a motto of this fast-moving and breathtaking film. Characters want to protect pride of their nations. Despite the terrible scenes, viewers look forward to see a sequel of plot each moment. Many actors were recieved rave reviewes: Brad Pitt, Melanie Laurent, Christoph Waltz,Til Schweiger, Daniel Bruhl and etc. They were given the highest ratings, espessially Christoph Waltz who's got Bafta and Oscar for his supporting role.
There are not so many special effects but despite this in 2009 film grossed 322 mil$ and was added to the list of the best movies.
The portrayal is so plausible and that's why you hate negative heroes and love positive. If you ready to change your attitude to War, you're welcome. I think it's worth watching.

That's certainly bad enough, and distressingly common nowadays.<br/><br/>But outright rip-offs of other films based -- apparently -- on the assumption that the young film-going audience is unaware of anything created before their time is unacceptable.<br/><br/>Especially when the critics and audiences go into orgasmic ecstasies regarding the ""fresh"" and ""original"" -- not to mention ""revolutionary"" and ""profound"" -- supposed merits of the film in question.<br/><br/>It's all a sad commentary on how ignorant and easily conned even today's supposed intellectuals are. They are, in fact, ignorant victims of the self-esteem industry and should bow their heads in shame.<br/><br/>It is distasteful as well to see yet another movie that exploits the Holocaust. I would have hoped that ""Schindler's List"" would be the last gasp of that ""genre."" Now, if one forgets all the above, there are some good things in this movie. But ""good things"" in the sense of a comedy of manners or stereotypes. The raging Hitler is well-done, as is the ruthless SS officer. Of course, we know (I note with sarcasm) that the greatest Hollywood-style Nazi villains are always charming, suave and debonair; not to mention multi-lingual (in French, German, English and Italian) and able to handle themselves in posh restaurants...<br/><br/>If Tarantino wanted to make a black comedy based on exaggerated stereotypes, he might have succeeded. It is the lack of originality in every respect, however, that kills this film and makes its greatest advocates out to be fools."
"Magenta_Bob","9","3","6","20 March 2012"," This just might be Tarantino's masterpiece
","""I think this just might be my masterpiece"", Brad Pitt says near the end of Inglourious Basterds. The line might be a bit blunt, but it is quite clear that this is what Quentin Tarantino aimed for with his one-of-a-kind revisionist World War II spaghetti western of sorts.<br/><br/>One element that runs through all of the chapters is the incredible tension that Tarantino squeezes out of his drawn out scenes. Many of them are based on fear of revelation or information asymmetry. Take, for instance, the brilliant opening scene where a dairy farmer is interrogated by Hans Landa about whether or not he is hiding Jews at the farm. After a while, the camera slowly descends to the basement where a family is hiding – a terrific example of trading the element of surprise for the element of suspense. Another one is where the woman (Shosanna Dreyfus) who managed to survive from that scene is meeting Landa again. A third example is the marvellous basement scene in which a group of British and American officers disguised as Germans are forced to play a tense card game with a real German officer. This is also one of the (rather few) scenes were all that tension is released in a violent climax.<br/><br/>The film has a great cast overall, but most of the praise has rightly been given to Christoph Waltz as the cunning and almost menacingly polite colonel Hans Landa. I guess it can be equally attributed to Tarantino's writing; in almost every scene Landa seems to have an advantage over his opponent. One such hilarious instance is when he meets Brad Pitt et al. who are disguised as Italians, and it turns out that he speaks perfect Italian; another is when he offers Shosanna an ominous glass of milk.<br/><br/>All in all, Inglourious Basterds is a wonderful condensation (actually, maybe not so much a condensation as an expansion) of the things we have come to associate with Tarantino. The film is full of great music, long, dialogue-heavy takes and is filled to the brim with movie references (Pabst is namedropped quite a few times). I am not sure if it actually is his masterpiece, but it is entertaining enough for me to want to see it over and over again."
"LennyOO","5","3","6","24 January 2011"," Great acting, terribly misleading trailer
","There are reasons why you should avoid watching trailers. This movie is one of them. Before I saw the movie itself, I had seen the trailer at least a dozen times because it seemed that the producer's goal was to ensure everyone to know of the film. And just like practically everyone around me, I was really looking forward to the film. Great, thought I! A band of American mercenaries, off to kill one hundred Nazi's each! That was practically the whole trailer... What did we get to see? Well, not much. There were no battles, no gore, just some short conversations that did not have any significance for the plot in any way. The scenes did not make any sense at all. I do not think that the way Tarantino deliberately misspelled the title of the film changes anything about its stupidity.<br/><br/>Of course, there is also the bright side of life. For one, I really liked the way Christoph Waltz depicted the Nazi officer. Also, Brad Pitt's outrageous accent never ceases to entertain me. The mustache that rests on top of his mischievous crack out of which a lot of bullsh*t comes, has a finishing touch. <br/><br/>This movie is, in my opinion, heavily overrated. The Second World War combined with a lot of unrealistic and irrelevant characters and the alternative ending just does not work. I think people are too psyched about the way the war was won so easily in the movie, or because Brad Pitt had a giant mustache and a great accent, because the movie was not special at all."
"DKosty123","6","3","6","27 December 2010"," Fantasy Turned Into Un-Even Movie
","I am not a big fan of Brad Pitt. This film did not help me change that opinion. There are good sequences & performances here, but as a whole, this film is not something great. In fact, it put me to sleep except I'd jerk awake whenever there were shooting sequences.<br/><br/>The film is based on a fiction work of a unit of Jews organized to get even with the Nazi's by killing them, & then locating Hitler & his henchman & killing them too. While this dream works for some folks, to me the real story of attempts on Hitler are much more interesting. In fact, there is a better story that could be made into a movie.<br/><br/>That true story is the Eastern Front Story of the Russians wiping out Nazi's at a faster rate than even these folks do in this movie. For some reason, now that this history is available, nobody has tried a movie depiction of it yet. Of course this story could make a real epic film. A recreation of some of the tank battles that happened on the Eastern front would make good cinema because the largest tank battles in World War 2 happened on that front.<br/><br/>This movie while it has some decent parts, does not make it as a whole. The parts make it rate a 6 on my book. If you take the best parts out, then it falls to a 3."
"singwaileung-1","7","3","6","7 February 2010"," Fun but flawed
","Inglorious Basterds is a flawed but fun film. Christopher Waltz was an absolute blast! What an exceptional performance! Every time he spoke, it just felt harrowing, even his obnoxious laugh just made you feel so uncomfortable. This was more his show that any of the other casts for sure.<br/><br/>Overall, IB was very much Kill Bill-esquire, playing on the spaghetti western and used chapters to go through each proportion of the movie. The opening sequence was strong on dialogue but it was enough to keep me on the edge of my seat and that was down to Waltz, but also credit to the house owner, whose presence made the scene even more effective because of his size.<br/><br/>Whilst the film was entertaining, I felt there were some major flaws here. If this movie came out last year with Slumdog Millionaire, it wouldn't get a sniff at the Oscars, because these films usually don't.<br/><br/>One of the biggest flaws is Brad Pitt. He was atrocious. He tried way too hard with his fake accent and just made it feel like every word that came out of his mouth was forced. I'm not American let alone a redneck, but I know his accent didn't sound natural. His acting was like watching a shy school kid who was made to stand in the middle of a class to do a role play using a French accent. It just didn't work. Tom hanks would've done a better job looking back on his previous films Forest Gump and the Green Mile. But why didn't Tarantino think of Clint Eastwood and take him out of retirement? He may be 70+, but he would've been fantastic. I'm sure working for Eastwood would be Tarantino's ultimate dream! The Basterds in my view took a back seat, with the Jewish girl's revenge plot being of much greater significance. The Basterds seemed incompetent and their whole team besides Pitt and one of the others were destroyed. And if this was a major event just for the Nazi's and Germans, why were guests supposedly from Italy easily let in, especially with dynamites strapped around their legs? Wouldn't anyone have body checked them? And with the Basterds being so renowned, surely the Nazi's would have had intel on their looks. And are the Nazi's really stupid enough to not have guards around the auditorium? How easy was it for Marcel to lock up the doors and the Basterds kill those guarding the Fuhrer? Waltz character was so domineering throughout but his credibility was ruined by his stupidity of trusting the Basterds in giving him what he wanted, which was a war hero warrant and a life in paradise. It didn't make sense for someone who just went and mercilessly strangled Diane Kruger's character to become a guy who thought he could negotiate a deal for him to go scot-free.<br/><br/>The film itself doesn't really deserve an Oscar, but it hasn't been a very fruitful year for movies besides Avatar. Waltz however definitely deserves a best actor award and I sure hope we will see more of him in films to come. Overall, Inglorious Basterds was entertaining, but everything that happened seemed too convenient."

","I'm a huge Tarantino fan. I bought this film, sight unseen, for my iPhone so I could have it with me all the time. Wow, what a fool I am. I'm writing this review to undo a bit of my idiocy and hopefully prevent others from wasting their time and money too.<br/><br/>This is yet another film that will make you say, ""They showed all the good parts in the preview!"". The Nazis are ALWAYS near-omniscient...almost as if the Germans characters themselves had read the script! The good guys were the most careless sorts imaginable. This made all the dialog completely predictable. We get it, the Nazi has seen through their subterfuge AGAIN...do we have to slog through another twenty minute scene at a table for which the outcome is already clear in the first 30 seconds? That's not suspense, that is just annoying.<br/><br/>This film isn't the least bit dark, gory, or thought-provoking. All the action was in the preview.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have said this film rewrites history. Usually when someone says something like that they mean the film implied something unsubstantiated like Queen Victoria liked to dress like a man or that the Great Wall of China was built to keep Christianity out of China. This film goes so far beyond that level of absurdity that you will be completely appalled. Further, no explanation for it is offered. Making it a dream sequence might have earned the film another star or two.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading this review. You have been warned!"
"g-white723","6","3","6","7 September 2009"," Not as bad as expected
","This was a really well made film, but the story was just pure nonsense and probably disrespectful to some soldiers who died for their country during WW II. I am not happy to see brutal treatment of defenceless soldiers passed off as entertainment.<br/><br/>A band of trained Jewish American killers go on the rampage near the end of the war, brutally torturing prisoners of war. Some of the scenes were disgusting. Their objective is to take out Hitler and his acolytes, and so end the war.<br/><br/>It is a long film beautifully shot in northern France. Some of the performances are superb, and to be fair not all the Nazis are cardboard cutout baddies. Daniel Bruhl plays a German war hero who has romantic desires on a Jewish woman played by Melanie Laurent, who is also being hunted down by an SS officer played by Christopher Waltz. This drama brought little bit of sanity amidst the mindless violence, and those three actors were outstanding in this film.<br/><br/>Just as I was enjoying the film, the ending descended into B movie madness. On the whole it was an enjoyable film, but obviously (as is always the case with Tarantino) there is far too much graphic violence. I did expect a much worse film after seeing some reviews, but I think Tarantino managed to pull off a quite a controversial film in the end."

","There is no way this movie is a 8.7 out of 10. No way. Once again Tarantino's nerd fans must be giving it 10's for no other reason than that they are Tarantino nerds. I just saw this movie and it is not terrible, it is about a passable 4 or 5 out of 10. I'll give it a 2 to help balance out one of the Tarantino nerd votes of 10, I don't see why they love him and his movies so much??? Anyway obviously this movie is more for guys, there is lots of brutal violence and death and dark humour. A couple of good performances, one very good performance by the lead actor who is not Brad Pitt, forget his name but he is great. The story isn't bad but if it's like Tarantino's other movies much of it is ""borrowed"". The story is interesting but not very deep and the ending was pretty stupid. Again I don't see why so many guys love Tarantino, maybe because he's just an average everyday guy like them?"
"davphv","3","9","27","30 August 2009"," Wait for the DVD
","The bad far outweighs the good in this film. The scenery and costumes are spectacular. The suspense is good, but it is drawn out way too long, then always followed by a very short and violent ending to the scene. <br/><br/>There are plot holes big enough to drive a Panzer through. A French dairy farmer speaks fluent English? The Germans would debut a Nazi propaganda film in Paris after D-Day? All the top Nazi brass would come to see it? Like most movies involving guns, multiple shots in the middle of town attract no attention from the policing units. There are armed Germans everywhere in France, yet the aftermath of every shoot-em-up scene shows only the good guys standing around talking (again for too long). Granted, this is a fantasy, but nothing in the script about reprisals? <br/><br/>This is the second recent film that depicts Jews fighting back (Defiance). Is that the new genre now? Every year we get at least one WWII movie about the plight of the Jews. WWII was 65 years ago! Occasionally, there is a film about other genocide situations (Kosovo, Cambodia, Rwanda), but those folks don't run Hollywood."

","Today would have been my father's 88th birthday. As it is, I'm glad he didn't live long enough to see this movie. It's difficult to decide which part of it worst. Gluttony comes to mind, but maybe that's because I'm still trying to erase the loving close-ups Tarantino gives us of a couple characters enjoying their strudel.<br/><br/>From the very opening credits, I was suspect. Can credits be artful and boring at the same time? I say, ""Yes!"" But that was quickly swept away by the opening scene at a French farm house where an SS officer (Christoph Waltz as ""Col. Hans Landa"") is searching for hidden Jewish people. After treating us to about ten minutes of subtitled French, the two characters switch to rather flawless, unaccented English. The ""action"" is boorish. The dialog laborious. And this scene establishes the pace and tone for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Scene after scene (""Chapters"" as the movie puts it) labor on and on with nothing happening. The characters are NOT expanded upon beyond their original shallow depth. I think I've seen more nuanced characters in a Bugs Bunny cartoon.<br/><br/>Each ""chapter"" reminds me of a weekday soap opera. You can leave it for several years, return in the middle, and pick right back up where you left off.<br/><br/>The film's ending is farce mixed with a dash of tragedy.<br/><br/>I loved ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""Pulp Fiction"" & ""Natural Born Killers,"" but around ""Jackie Brown,"" it felt as if everyone became afraid of the great artist Tarantino. ""Kill Bill"" was clearly excessive. ""Death Proof"" and ""Grindhouse"" were uncalled for. If simple gore is art, then please, Mr. Tarantino, make a decent horror movie. Otherwise, just stop. Buy an editor and listen to them. I believe you're too much of a fan of cinema to realize you're boring us to death.<br/><br/>As for my dad, he was a veteran of the D-Day invasion at Normandy. His landing was the one you saw the opening of ""Saving Private Ryan."" He was in Stephon Ambrose's book. He loved ""Hogan's Heros"" (the TV show), so I know he had a good sense of humor about lighthearted treatments of WWII. Still, I'm glad he didn't have to suffer through this horrible movie.<br/><br/>I left the theater during the café scene. Stepped outside to smoke a cigarette because I was so bored. I came back in time to still be bored again before the ""fireworks"" started. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.<br/><br/>Cut this movie down to the hour and half it probably should have been and you might have a decent movie. As it stands, it rates on par with ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" only less compelling."
"m-spam1234","4","7","20","29 August 2009"," Interesting patchwork, with some great scenes, questionable parts and disappointing elements
","In this movie, Christopher Waltz is truly fantastic. Especially in the opening scene with Mr. Menochet. As a french speaker, I thought the french scenes were horrible except for the one with Denis Menochet. Mr. Menochet emotion evolves perfectly to Mr. Waltz probing in the little 20 minutes he appears on screen.<br/><br/>Mélanie Laurent and Jacky Ido remind me of the low quality french-acting displayed in many french movies, with boring dialogs and poor french. Brad Pitt is disappointing, and Eli Roth just plain cruel.<br/><br/>I appreciated the character build up of Daniel Brühl. He becomes a likable person all along the movie, seeming heroic and valiant. Mr. Tarantino then breaks up this likability by making him behave in an ungentlemanly manner to Miss Laurent. Then in 30 seconds, he becomes likable again in an almost romantic way.<br/><br/>All in all, the first chapter and the basement chapter are worth watching. The rest is distracting without standing up to Mr. Tarentino's earlier work. Expect a lot of crude violence.<br/><br/>Does being German in WWII (here German = Nazi) suffice to deserve any treatment and cruel acts? such as the brave soldier that gets his head beaten to a pulp by a parody Jew soldier? No scene displays Nazi cruelty and Germans just seem classy, well-educated and smart people. Plenty of them display the non-human behavior of the (Jew) basterds in a very graphical way, they are in my opinion the bad guys of the movie. Moreover, the cast of the basterds is almost comical, using cliché Jews that could be found in German WWII propaganda. It serves in supporting my suspicion that Mr. Tarantino constructed this paradox on purpose.<br/><br/>Mr. Tarantino, some of your dialogs were great, some scenes shot up to perfection and characters truly interesting (explains the 4). However, was your objective to see if the general public was brain-washed enough to appreciate a movie just on the ground that the beaten-up bad guys are Nazis and the good guys Jews. Testing whether you could display any amount of extreme and unacceptable behavior and have it welcomed by laughter? were you trying to see how far you could go using the Nazi-justification? If that wasn't your goal, this movie is truly disappointing."
"gumsh-1","10","7","20","21 August 2009"," Brilliant Actors, unconventional, absolutely convincing
","I just watched the movie and found it worthy to post my first IMDb comment after using the IMDb for years. One point motivating me is the fact that i am a German and i'm sure a lot of people might find it interesting to hear from a German point of view that this film is hilarious. Please excuse my untrained school English.<br/><br/>First of all i want to name the hilarious acting of Christoph Waltz. I'm afraid not to have seen the original Version of the Film yet so i can only imagine the dialogs being mixed in English french and German. What i have seen for now was really inspiring. The Dialogues which take a lot of room in the plot are special special and special. Each Plot has a Main Dialogue or Monologue (Pit when Introducing the Basterds) which is originally written and full of turnarounds. Waltz gives a wonderful Van Cleeve like Bad who is brutal intelligent and cold but in a way admirable. Tension is created through every word he speaks cause one never really knows how intelligent tarentino lets him be. Pitt does a great job playing the cool American nazi killer. Melanie Laurant is beautiful in every situation she's in and her acting ins absolutely convincing i won't forget her FACE for a wile. Schweiger (i don't really like him) does what he has to and is both amusing and absolutely cool. And especially to mention doing a great performance in one of the long Dialogues is August Diehl. He creates Tension out of nothing and is releasing it through laughs only to create it again. For me the best ""side acting"". Kruger is as i feared before the only bad part of the acting, but maybe that's because she is so German in trying to be an American playing a German. The synchronization she does for the German version is bad, really bad. But i could bear it since the rest of the acting was so good. Tarentino did the best job since pulp by giving the actors room to unfold.<br/><br/>As i mentioned Dialogues in the Film are given most of the 150min of the Movie but no dialog is destroying the tension. It's like Turn and River card all along like Leone does in a fistful. They are simply captivating you i didn't want them to stop.<br/><br/>I thought the film would only be a brutal American interpretation of Nazi-Germany and how to best give them what they deserve which is the main aspect of the Trailer. Tarentino is doing this in a way, but for me not too much and concentrates more one originality than on brutality. He played with my sympathy all the time by giving all the Germans in the movie some sympathetic aspects and making fun out of cultural mix-ups.<br/><br/>The western elements are there, and he is not trying to hide that he wants some Leone in his movie. The main characters are good bad and ugly. These attributes can be distributed in many ways just find out for yourself. The nazi's in the movie often show Wallach like behavior.<br/><br/>The Germans in the movie seem authentic to me which is another plus. Casting German actors was an important decision for the authenticity of the movie. Ohterwise i guess a lot have Germans would not buy it and simply call it typical American interpretation of German cultural aspects.<br/><br/>To come to an end Dialogues as creative as only tarentino can create, tension which is worthy to call it Leone like , a bad guy who can compete with Van Cleef, Actors who are set in scene in this special tarentino way. Best Fim since Dark Knight."
"Chris Knipp","9","7","20","6 August 2009"," A wealth of almost-themes and lush production values, amazing cast, a must-see
","Tarantino's World War II feature Inglourious Basterds shows the director's best and worst features, but in a wholly new setting. Here is his propensity for sectioned films (there are five ""chapters"") with disparate plots with neat but wildly implausible interconnections. His love of elaborate extended set pieces where the dialogue takes over, sometimes at excruciating length. He casts playfully and ingeniously and provides his actors irresistible opportunities to strut their stuff. He's a master of old-fashioned camera-work, with bold and traditional uses of big close-ups. He tries out some pretty fancy production pieces, notably gun battles and a classic old movie theater rigged up for a Nazi gala, and these are never less than colorful and delightful eye candy. The new twist is the swing to Europe -- German-occupied France -- with tons of subtitled French and German dialogue, and even translating back and forth between them. A big question is this: can we really stomach a partly comic, partly grandiose, partly grind-house version of the war European filmmakers and at least all older Europeans still take deadly seriously? Can World War II be the basis for a movie about movies so fanciful that it seeks to resolve the war in that old Paris cinema with a host of Nazi bigwigs all on hand for a propaganda film? Besides the Dirty Dozen team of American Jews headed up by Brad Pitt's southern redneck and charged, as viewers of the movie trailer will well remember, to bring back ""Nazi scalps"" (a hundred each, in fact) -- something a little in the vein of Samuel Fuller's 1980 saga Big Red One, once planned in this long-contemplated project as a 16-episode TV series -- there's a not-so-secondary dual theme of concealment and identity. The movie begins at a French dairy farm with a visit from the most impressive and despicable character, Col. Hans Landa (played with relish and equal linguistic skill in French, English and German by Austrian Christoph Waltz Waltz), who's nickname is ""the Jew Hunter."" The farmer is hiding Jews, and Landa finds them -- but it all happens in dialogue, followed by a violent rain of bullets. One of the hidden family escapes alive, Shoshanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), who reappears improbably several years later as the proprietor of a Paris cinema, having taken on a French Christian name.<br/><br/>This sequence is excruciating enough, but less so than one in which an English OSS officer's posing as a Nazi officer, Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender), is gradually smoked out in a cellar bar. At that point the excruciating becomes hard to separate from the tedious. And then three's the German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diana Kruger), undercover for the Allies, who's caught out later like a doomed Cinderella, by a shoe that fits. Meanwhile there are several Germans who pose as Nazis while their real aim is to kill Nazis, and there is young German war hero Fredrick Zoller ( Daniel Brühl), fluent in French, and in love with Shoshanna as well as with movies -- and he becomes a movie star, beginning by playing himself in a propaganda film . The ingenuity and parallelisms are so fascinating one wishes identity were made more resonant as a theme.<br/><br/>Another theme or Tarantino fetish much on display here is for deal-making. The dairy farmer is bargained with. Lt. Aldo Raine (Pitt -- the name a homage to veteran war movie actor Aldo Ray) is ready to bargain with Nazis, letting them keep their lives and their scalps if they'll give up German military information. Col. Hans Lada makes the biggest deal of all -- his life for, well, the Third Reich, basically.<br/><br/>A big element is the celebration of movies, not only by the climax in a movie house, but in the constant references to old ones, to the point that Inglourious Basterds, the title itself a deliberate corruption of the name of a schlock Italian WWII film, becomes more than anything about old war movies. At times the whole effort gets mired in material that is too familiar -- the nasty Nazis, the drinking scenes, the face offs, the suspenseful plots -- material that has been done better and with more gravitas elsewhere. Quentin Tarantino's movies have never been about ""reality."" They're ingenious fantasies, built up out of cinema, delighting in the magic of what can happen on the screen.<br/><br/>But World War II was always movies, too, and propaganda. The ""Basterds"" -- the team of Jews out to give individual Nazis horrible deaths -- are a propaganda weapon. And so is the movie ""Nation's Pride,"" made starring Zoller, depicting how he singlehandedly killed 300 men, And Tarantino gives us something it's surprising he's not done before, a movie-within-a-movie. Zoller calls himself ""the German Sgt. York."" Tarantino does not resist the temptation (how could he?) to put his versions of Goebbels (a very juicy Sylvester Groth) as well as Hitler, and even, off in the corner of a scene, Churchill, on the screen.<br/><br/>Also present is the quintessential Tarantino theme: revenge. The ""basterds"" are having revenge for the annihilation of Jews. Zoller's insistence that the premiere be transferred to Shoshanna's cinema gives her the opportunity to wreak vengeance on a whole auditorium full of Nazis for the brutal killing of her family.<br/><br/>Things get very complicated when three plots by the British, the ""Basterds,"" and Shoshanna (with her black French boyfriend Marcel (Jacky Ido) all converge on the premiere of ""Nation's Pride"" at Shoshann's theater, with some confusion of the continuity in this event.<br/><br/>Whether or not you buy the whole thing, the production is lush, the acting is rich, and there's a fascinating interweaving of almost-themes. Waltz carries the day, but Pitt, with his down-home shtick, though it's not as funny or as vivid as stuff in Full Metal Jacket, is still quite entertaining, and he too gets his chance to put on a (comically clumsy) fake identity. Troubling, drawn-out--and not to be missed."

","Quentin Tarantino has always been throwing out movies which are quite different from the regular ones. But looking at ""IB""(I can never spell it), I'd say this is one of his worst movies. I am definitely surprised by the reviews and ratings this movies has received. I am actually from India. People here are average viewers and not critics. When I was at the theater people were actually moving around and shouting at the long and boring conversations in the movie. What I expected was some action or at least some fun in the likes of Kill Bills or Pulp Fiction. There were two long and boring conversations in the movie which weren't of any importance to the storyline. Not only did they bring dullness but they even added some extra boredom into the movie. And there's more of French and German where people actually spent their time looking at the subtitles rather than the movie itself. But the ending was very good I never expected things to turn in an amazing way. For the normal viewers I would suggest u to ignore it (Atleast the Indian viewers)."
"faraaj-1","8","5","13","30 August 2009"," A welcome return to form after 15 years
","I still remember the rush I got when seeing Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction for the first time. I ended up seeing both multiple times and took something new away from each viewing. The media hype around Tarantino, which I believed at the time, was that he could do no wrong. It really seemed in '94 that he was not only the greatest director in the world, but would change cinema forever. Unfortunately his produce since Pulp Fiction was neither prolific nor impressive. The primary weakness with Tarantino's three works post Pulp Fiction and pre Inglourious Basterds was his constantly parroting or paying tribute to other works he had admired instead of going out and doing his own thing, creating something original. An excess of verbosity slowed the pace as well. Viewing the trailer and reading initial reviews of Inglourious Basterds led me to believe it suffered the same shortcomings. To be honest, the trailer for Inglourious does not sell the film I saw. And Tarantino's frequent arrogance and more recent track record have opened him up to a lot of criticism - much of it unjustified in the case of this film.<br/><br/>Anyone who has read any review of Inglourious would know that the villain is a sinister Col. Hans Landa and that the opening sequence is one for the ages. He is a unique movie villain like Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men or Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs. He doesn't speak, he interrogates and interviews in a eerily calm manner. It requires nerves of steel to maintain your composure with him around! His audacity in the last 20 minutes is breathtaking. The opening sequence was worthy of Sergio Leone, whose Once Upon a Time in the West and Lee Van Cleef in The Good The Bad and The Ugly no doubt influenced Tarantino's handling of the entire sequence.<br/><br/>I actually liked the criticized bar sequence even more than the opening. Long yes, but it slowly builds up to a brilliantly directed climax. The twists and turns, the playful banter which turns into something deadly are among the memorable sequences of cinema history. Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus has given a performance that is almost on par with Christopher Waltz's Col. Landa. If his performance is Oscar worthy (not that that should be the yardstick!), his interview of her and her reaction when he exits is also equally worthy. I should mention here that the name star of the film, Brad Pitt, is really only one part of a great ensemble cast. His performance is superb and not the caricature that the trailer implies. A sequence where his hick officer is forced to act 'Spanish' is just brilliant comedy. He has the accent of a southerner down pat. I only wish he'd been given more time. I hope the director's cut adds something to his role.<br/><br/>In closing, I'll add that Tarantino's knowledge of cinema was never in doubt. His camera-work and understanding of the mechanics of film-making were always good, but he has exceeded himself in this film. There is something classical about the photography (beautiful long takes) and cinematography, which almost no director can emulate. As a former fan and later critic of Tarantino, I'm blown away by Inglourious and despite his cheek, I do think he may just have made his masterpiece!"
"derekisdman","8","5","13","28 August 2009"," Tarantino is back in form...
","Tarantino's films always have a certain anachronistic quality to them: they take place during a particular time period, yet none of the characters seem to portray the qualities or mannerisms of people during that period and, thus, seem strangely out of place. However, this method has proved to be successful in the past due to Tarantino's uncanny ability to completely ignore the conventionality of the real world and, instead, bring life to a new and exciting alternative world where characters speak poetically, improbability becomes the new likelihood, and Mexican standoffs are commonplace. With his latest endeavor, ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Tarantino's distinctive ability shines through once again with perhaps his most ambitious film to date.<br/><br/>""Inglourious Basterds"" is a World War II movie like none you've ever seen. Most of the time, you'll completely forget the fact that you're even watching a War movie, as, deep down, this isn't really a War movie at all; rather, what we're given is an eclectic mixture of genres (action, comedy, drama) blended with Tarantino's typical fan-boyish references to the nostalgic films and sub-genres of his past. Both the spaghetti western and the grind house film movements demonstrate their presence throughout the film and help to develop the quirky and eccentric characters we've become accustomed to seeing in Tarantino's previous films. Lt. Aldo Raine, played by Brad Pitt, is one such character. Raine is the all-American southerner who just happens to also be Jewish. This unique dichotomy of traits necessitates a hatred of Germans (and, more specifically, Nazis) and thus motivates Raine to lead an exclusive group of Nazi haters called the ""Inglourious Basterds"" whose sole business is ""killin' Nazis."" Oddly enough, I found that the most captivating scenes didn't include Pitt or any of the other primary members of the ""Basterds"" at all; instead, the majority of the film's memorable sequences feature Col. Hans Landa, played by Christopher Waltz, a ""Jew hunting"" Nazi detective whose ability to methodologically turn seemingly casual discourses into rigorous interrogations is truly remarkable. In essentially every scene Waltz is in, you have a strange feeling that at any moment something bad is going to happen, which manifests a constant feeling of anxiety, creating an almost omnipresent edge-of-your-seat type of experience throughout most of the film.<br/><br/>""Inglourious Basterds,"" unfortunately, is not without its faults. While the film starts off and ends with spectacularly well-directed and suspenseful scenes, the slightly overly long running time, featuring a few unnecessary extended scenes (mostly in the second chapter), tends to disrupt the otherwise smooth flow and thus makes the pace seem marginally inconsistent at times. As mentioned before, the film features several astonishing sequences (and some of Tarantino's best), some of the more notable ones include: the opening chapter, the rendezvous bar scene, and the ending Theater scene. However, the weakest points in the film are the scenes interconnecting these aforementioned sequences, which at times feel like they're there for the single purpose of moving the characters from one place to another, or solely for Tarantino to indulge in his signature masturbatory character obsessions.<br/><br/>""Basterds"" is not for everyone. It is violent, unrelenting, and its completely inaccurate portrayal and glamorization of events may put off or offend some viewers unfamiliar with Tarantino's style. That being said, most viewers should have a lot of fun watching the film. It is smart, daring, and contains mostly all of the previous elements that Tarantino so admirably captured in his previous films. It features strong performances (including perhaps the best performance in any Tarantino film to date by Christopher Waltz), sharp writing, and unparalleled suspense. Though not perfect, it is one of the better films to come out this year.<br/><br/>4/5 Stars."

","""You probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-takin' business; we in the killin' Nazi business. And cousin, business is a-boomin'."" Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) <br/><br/>Raine pretty much summarizes the story of Inglourious Basterds as Quentin Tarantino concocted it: A WWII assassin crew headed by Raine (Pitt's southern accent is overcooked but impressively true to the Tarantino style). As a matter of fact, I like to think of this anti-Nazi/ SS film as showcasing the director's own SS: style and swagger.<br/><br/>Working the famous Dirty Dozen assassin idea with his usual homage attitude, Tarantino adds his cinema obsession as a deadly motif occupying much of the movie. This is the director as we know him--wisecracking (see the opening quote), allusive, irreverent, outrageous (he does play with the outcome of the war), not with the originality of Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill, but with the inventiveness of Mel Brooks' Springtime for Hitler sequence in The Producers.<br/><br/>But fewer laughs, although I enjoy pulpy ones like this from Raine: ""If you ever wanna eat a Sauerkraut sandwich again take your Wiener Schnitzel lickin' finger and point out on this map what I wanna know."".<br/><br/>Tarantino (like any maturing auteur, it becomes his film rather than its title) breaks his own mold by telling a linear story about the assassins and their final solution; we don't even witness the ascendancy of the Basterds, just their beginning in 1941 and their maturation in 1944. Additionally, more than one scene, for instance the opening Nazi visitation to a French farm and a bistro party, are much longer than other scenes I remember from his canon.<br/><br/>Yet, they pass quickly enough, so adept is the director at building tension with climax certain in the near future. Perhaps this lingering is evidence of his willingness to let narrative take over rather than quirkiness or film reference (he was, after all, a notoriously knowledgeable video store clerk).<br/><br/>Although other Tarantino films will long be remembered after this successful WWII satire is short-listed, few will be as close to mainstream thriller while staying far outside the restrictive conventions. It is one of the best movies this summer, standing next to Katherine Bigelow's Hurt Locker by saying something important about war and entertaining at the same time.<br/><br/>Their ""business is a-boomin'."""

","Firstly, I'd like to say that I am a massive Tarantino fan and prior to seeing this film I found myself felling rather worried that this might just be another Death Proof. However, this was far from it. Where as Death Proof was slow, talky and downright dull this was everything that Tarantino usually delivers and more. Filled to bursting with tension, action and engaging characters, I enjoyed this film so much it's hard to describe. Everyone in the cinema was laughing so hard including myself.<br/><br/>I'd openly recommend this film to any fan of cinema in general and I'd go as far to say that so far this has been the film of the year for 2009."

","I will keep this short. I'm a fan of all Tarantino movies and screenplays. We even share our favorite movie - Assault on Precinct 13 (ok, my second favorite after Where Eagles Dare). This movie truly misses the mark. It is entertaining in a sense. It is clearly carefully written, acted and edited. So the problem? Many of the scenes are just too long with little payoff. No, not the opening scene as this is key to the movie. I'm talking about almost every other scene. For example, there is a scene where we are waiting for the Eli Roth character to enter the movie for the first time. He is walking down a long dark underpass of which we just see the exit. It literally takes him 90 seconds to 2 minutes (didn't time it - felt like an hour) to exit. All the time hitting his baseball bat against the tunnel wall. It was soooo long and sooooo uncomfortable, I was getting upset. Boy, this better be a HUGE payoff! No, just Eli Roth after doing some weightlifting. Yawn. Stare at the wall for 2 minutes. Is that fun? If yes then you will enjoy this movie. If not, wait for it to hit cable."

","It's my first review on IMDB. This movie is the most overrated movie I have ever seen to this day.

I know this movie is fictional but I think this movie is a insult to WWII veterans for both sides."
"antonov-2","10","4","10","31 March 2012"," One of my personal favourites
","The first thing I thought when the credits to this movie rolled was: Only Quentin Tarrantino can come up with a movie like this and get away with it! For me it turned out to be one of the most exhilarating movie experiences in recent years.<br/><br/>I mean seriously: If someone told you that there is a movie about WWII in which Hitler is shot in a french movie theatre by a bunch of Jewish-American resistance fighters, you would think it can only be some low budget farce. The mere fact that you can take this movie seriously is a big achievement in itself.<br/><br/>What I admire most about the movie is the carefulness with which it was made. An American filmmaker who actually bothers to pick Germany's finest in his cast (Daniel Bruehl, August Diehl, Til Schweiger and so on) is almost unheard of. And Christoph Waltz - What a revelation that guy is. I honestly did not now him before I saw the movie even though I am German and being Austrian he had starred in countless German/Austrian movies before. His performance of SS Col. Hans Landa is one of the finest I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I do not want to get into details about the plot here, enough has been written about it already. One other thing about the movie that struck me is how well the German dubbed version is made (although I do not know to which extent Q was involved here). Of course the original version is still superior, but compared to the ragged dubbing of most other non-German movies (I just cannot stand this any more, going to the cinema in Germany can be a very frustrating experience), the job done here was quite decent. Of course it had a lot to do with the fact that all English lines of German actors were done in German by those same actors. In the first scene of the movie it took me a while to even realize that the scene was dubbed.<br/><br/>So see this movie and see it now! You will not regret it."

","A group of hardened Nazi killers stalk their prey in Nazi-occupied France as a Jewish cinema owner plots to take down top-ranking SS officers during the official premiere of a high-profile German propaganda film entitled,Inglourious Basterds.It is a war film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and it features Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent. It tells the fictional story of two plots to assassinate the Nazi Germany political leadership, one planned by a young French Jewish cinema proprietor, and the other by a team of Jewish Allied soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine.<br/><br/>As far as Lt. Aldo Raine is concerned, the only good Nazi is a dead Nazi. Raine's mission is to strike fear into the heart of Adolf Hitler by brutally murdering as many goose-steppers as possible, or die trying. In order to accomplish that goal, Lt. Raine recruits a ruthless team of cold-blooded killers known as ""The Basterds"" which includes baseball- bat-wielding Bostonian Sgt. Donnie Donowitz and steely psychopath Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz, among others. When the Basterds' secret rendezvous with turncoat German actress Bridget von Hammersmark goes awry, they learn that the Nazis will be staging the French premiere of ""The Nation's Pride,"" a rousing propaganda film based on the exploits of German hero Fredrick Zoller, at a modest theater owned by Jewish cinephile Shoshanna Dreyfus, posing as a Gentile after the brutal murder of her family by the ruthless Col. Hans Landa. As the Basterds hatch an explosive plan to take out as many Nazis as possible at the premiere, they remain completely oblivious to the fact that Shoshanna, too, longs to bring the Third Reich to its knees, and that she's willing to sacrifice her beloved theater in the process.<br/><br/>This is a classic Tarantino genre-blending thrill ride of a great movie.It is violent, unrestrained, and thoroughly entertaining.This was a World War II revamped Tarantino style movie that succeeds as the ultimate fantasy revenge story as a Kill Hitler which stands as one the best works in the career of its influential filmmaker.It shows how they Shows how most of us turn to film for both fantasy escape and an avenue to make the abstract past tangible, enough to even possibly, and powerfully, replace actual history.Attribute that to the cast brilliant and excellent performance and Tarantino's direction. The only negative thing about it is the film was overlong and draggy in some scenes. But despite some of the scenes dragging on too long, Inglourious Basterds is still a lot of fun, altering history for the better as the Nazis feel the force of redemption."

","The first thing I did after watching Inglorious Basterds was laugh out loud!!!Not for the entertainment,but for the intelligence infused in the entertainment.This in fact became the second best movie I watched after PULP FICTION.There was this time when movies ,which had ""world war 2"" as their theme,were hard hitting or really serious as in ""Schindler's List"",""Saving Private Ryan"" or the ""The Pianist"".No doubt these movies were masterpieces to say the least,but none of them had the story of how the rebellious Jews took or could have taken their revenge on the Nazis.Maybe that's why I liked the movie even more.And all these films had a sorrowful tone of those times.But this was the first movie which was a fresh fiction with a sardonic tone of those times.The sardonic tone was implied to the Nazis,not the Jews!This is first movie in which the Jews ill treated the Nazis in the most entertaining way!!Never will you find a sad or a morose scene ,but only a lot of violence in this movie.But then again which of the movies I have listed does not have violence?In fact you can digest this movie compared to the other.<br/><br/>The whole movie is set in the Nazi occupied France.The story is how a group of Nazi hating Americans called ""The Basterds"" plot to kill Hitler with the help of a French actress(Diane Kruger).The group is headed by Col.Aldo Raine played by Brad Pitt in a surprisingly brilliant performance.As much as I know he is known more for his looks than acting. But this movie proves that he has both the qualities.The movie is directed by Quentin Tarantino with the usual Tarantino taste of direction-chapter wise adaptation of the story,lengthy but brilliant dialogues,unpredictable but gripping screenplay and sudden violence!.The action in this movie is not over-the-top as in Kill bill series.Frankly speaking,this the most straight forward and a simple movie scripted by Tarantino unlike his previous non linear films -""pulp fiction"" and ""reservoir dogs"".<br/><br/>Brad Pitt wonderfully fits in to the role of a ruff N tuff Jewish American with his Accent whose only aim in life is KILLIN Nazis.But the most brilliant performance is by the Austrian German actor Christof Waltz as col.Hans Landa ,chief security officer of Hitler.His acting as a paradoxical character showing a steadfast attitude with a masked cruelty,simply bowls you over(He won the Oscar too!!Thank god my prediction of this award did not go wrong at least this one time.)!The others have done a commendable job<br/><br/>So to summarize -please watch this movie ,not to learn something new about world war and Hitler as it is a fiction set at that time, but for the unusual take of those times and the perfect blend of hilariousness and violence"

","The hyperbole being bandied about regarding this film is certainly Tarantino-esqe. It is an amusing film, well crafted and fun to watch, but there is nothing incredibly artistic about it. It has little of the writing brilliance that Pulp Fiction has and doesn't convey brutality the way Reservoir Dogs does. <br/><br/>It has a little bit of everything, though, and is certainly a fine film. The dialog is snappy, the comic timing is decent, and Christoph Waltz does a good job of being over the top without being over the top about it. The acting, in general, is top shelf. Production, in general, is solid. It is a good movie.<br/><br/>But it is NOT remotely as good as many here would have it. There is little sense that the movie was written to convey anything much beyond a comical telling of a slightly Stooges-esqe, though rather bloodthirsty, war tale. If you like Tarantino, go see it by all means, but don't expect anything earth-shatteringly good - certainly not top 70 films of all time good.<br/><br/>(and why does this &^^%@#% system insist on changing -esque to -esquire?!?)"

","I really wanted to like this. Mark Kermode and a few other reviewers has said the sub plots were worthy of awards. But it was so horrible to watch. The non-Geneva Convention US/Jewish Death Squad. The eponymous 'heroes' of the piece. Where on earth did he dream those up ? Unhistorical, illegal and surely more at home in Viet Nam or Nicaragua in the 1970s. What really saddened me is that many youngsters ignorant of history will think these people were real and not made up. I started rooting for the poor Nazis as these alleged 'heroes' were so vile. I couldn't understand the glorification of the heroes in the film as 'kill them all and let God sort them out' type murderers. All German's were not Nazis. Many were simply enlisted men. Real stories from World War Two reveal this. This was simple racist hatred. Were there really Jewish Death Squads in WW2 ? Or did Tarantino just wish that there were ? I gave up before the Hitler assassination attempt. The fantasy sequence in the cinema was too stupid to bear. The guy portraying Hitler was ridiculous too. The worst version since Mel Brookes the Producers. By making him a buffoon it diminishes him. Why do it ? The worst excesses though remain the unnecessary gory violence. The Mohawk style scalping surely unknown outside the Goumier in the French Colonial Army, and the clubbing to death of prisoners, surely copied from Nazi tactics from the Holocaust, sat uneasily with US troops as the perpetrators. It seems Tarantino's blood lust knows no end and he will never grow up past the age of 18."
"comco-1","5","4","10","19 February 2010"," gory war fantasy based on World War II story
","Once again, script writers found it necessary to invent a war fantasy based on World War II. During those six years, there were many dramatic episodes, and the need to invent a fantasy was, by itself, fantastic. The primary character (played by Brad Pitt) was never credible, and Pitt's attempts at a southern accent were never convincing. The film consisted of a series of gory episodes followed by long and intricate dialog, which often left the viewer confused by all the meandering. The bar scene in which the English agent is exposed was far too involved, and was so detailed that the viewer wondered if the point was to teach reading subtitles. The long finale made no sense, as the events portrayed in the film never occurred, which is why I describe the picture as a war fantasy. The female stars were beautifully filmed, and worth watching."

","I completely understand why some people would hate this film. I had no expectations for this film, except that it was helmed by QT and all that entails. I was pleasantly surprised, enough to order the Blu-ray immediately after watching it.<br/><br/>To the naysayers... was it needlessly gory? Of course! Jesus, did you expect something else from QT? Were the characters over the top? Again, would you expect anything else from QT? This isn't Ingmar Bergman we're talking about, it's Quentin Tarantino. If you think Sergio Leone's characters weren't also overdone and almost comical, watch his films again. Tarantino just takes it one step further. Please don't tell me that you expect characters to fall in love and get married after one day as they did in most spaghetti westerns. You accept that nonsense because it's a product of the day and the genre.<br/><br/>I loved the language play in this film. Thank god QT didn't pander to stupid audiences who don't like to read movies. The nuances of language are new for Tarantino and a welcomed addition. It definitely added depth to the scenes.<br/><br/>The acting was also at least on par with other QT films, if not better. Waltz was amazing, sheer genius. The Nazi characters were given a respect that I didn't expect in this film. They weren't bumbling idiots, nor were they completely evil automatons. They were humanized. To those who fault this treatment, you are doing history a disservice. You don't need to be a monster to do evil things. Humans are capable of such atrocities en masse and we have seen this time and time again.<br/><br/>If there is a fault with the acting, it would be the Basterds themselves. There's not enough back story to justify their actions. Their treatment is too comical. Give me more back story if you want me to believe they can completely suspend all human decency. Don't rely on history, because at that point most of the Nazi atrocities were just rumor and speculation. Perhaps the Basterds were comical to lessen the impact of their atrocities. To those who fault Brad Pitt specifically, I think he was exactly who QT wanted him to be. Was Eli Wallach any worse as Tuco? John Wayne's acting was laughably bad and yet people adore Ford's spaghetti westerns.<br/><br/>Unlike some, I was held in complete suspense by this film. Why? Because I had no idea what to expect. I didn't know if QT was going to take it completely over the top or not. I kept waiting for some reason why the plot would fail. I should have seen Hitler's demise coming, however. After all, this is QT. Someone else said it best. This film never would have been released if not for Tarantino. That's the reason why it succeeds. It IS a Tarantino film.<br/><br/>I also watched District 9 the same weekend I saw this. I found myself saying how stupid all those characters were and how unrealistic were their actions. That's the difference. In District 9, you present me with a situation that is supposed to be real and yet you give me people who act ridiculously out of character for their situation. In Inglourious Basterds, you suspend everything because it is complete fantasy. Everything goes out the window with Tarantino. If you can't suspend that, you won't enjoy this film. If you can, you will be rewarded with a fantastic romp through cinematic silliness.<br/><br/>Is this Citizen Kane? Hardly! Was it completely entertaining and outstanding for it's purpose, absolutely! If you are not a QT fan, stay away. You won't like it."
"DoNotTrustImdb","4","4","10","22 November 2009"," Load of rubbish
","The first 20 minutes where the best part of this overrated flop! I thought finally Tarantino had done it again after a lot of so so films, but what started well went of the boil real fast. This film is described as a drama! Sure it started like it, but lost that serious feel, and became a very none serious, very inaccurate historical Hollywood farce!<br/><br/>Specially when Mike Meyers character came up, what did they think that he could act an British officer, with lots of make up and that oh so over done fake accent (yeah baby). Brad Pitt stars in this flop to give it some weight, but is only part of the side cast, the German/Nazi's are betrayed as an circus act, with a story line that could have delivered a very solid film, but it just went no where, 2 1/2 hours of over done boring dialog that is more of a comedy then a drama. But then again Hollywood has only ever done a few good World War 2 films, and this is not one of them.<br/><br/>The score of 4 is only held up by the fact that it started well (first 20 minutes) and that all characters spoke their language as per nationality. Whats next for Tarantino? A Xmas movie? Or wait he will do a sci-fi film! As far as I am concerned he is still part of the Hollywood party due to a hit a long long time ago and I just could not take this as a serious film."

","So there were a few things about this movie that didn't make a whole pile of sense to me; > There were chapters.....Why?.... > Modern Music during.....Hardly scene setting? > Brad Pitt & Mike Myers were not in serious roles and sometimes I got the feeling they were about to start laughing. > Samuel L. Jackson narrated for 4 - 5 minutes. > The mutilation was far over the top to the point of unbearable. > Sheer fiction > Basterds isn't a word.<br/><br/>I sincerely get the feeling that Quentin couldn't stretch himself out of his usual format with this movie.<br/><br/>Scenes were sometimes long winded and a little pointless. Most roles in this movie were cameo's and there wasn't really a lead actor.<br/><br/>Like I said, I still don't get what this movie is trying to say but it reminded me an awful lot of Dr. Strangelove."

","It appears, Pulp Fiction was the last great movie by QT. All his following products shows his obsession with prolonged oh-I'm-so-postmodernist, so deadly dull dialogue. If interested in obscure WWII disguise matter, better watch Shield & Sword, quite bad Soviet series is a way dynamic than this one."
"vincentagra","10","5","14","23 September 2009"," Forget it's Tarantino, forget it's Pitt, just watch and learn
","I can only imagine like me, there are a load of people who both can't wait for, and dread the release of a new Tarantino movie in equal measure. This is because despite being one of the most followed and admired film makers out there (Not to say copied) he has that sort of vulnerability about him that I feel like I want to protect, because despite creating a legendary flick in Pulp Fiction, it seems like some people revel in seeing the mighty fall.<br/><br/>Granted it will be a mean feat to emulate the dizzy heights of PF, I doubt it'll happen, so what you've got to try and do is take each movie on its own merit and enjoy it for what it is. Now if you can forget who made it and watch it as a piece of war-fiction and it's actually really good. Second thing to put aside is the thought that this is a Brad Pitt film. It's not. Crafty advertising will draw QT & BP fans in by the bucket load but really this is like having an elaborate, wordy novel acted out to you on screen. Saying that, get your reading glasses on because most of it is subtitled and apart from the quality of the way it's made, the real stars are the relative unknowns Mélanie Laurent & Christoph Waltz – the latter in particular, is amazing.<br/><br/>So many films these days are churned out in a way so that they appeal to the masses, which I spose is fair game, most people do in fact fall in the category of 'the masses' so we enjoy them, but this makes the movies feel like business rather than art which you got to question which is more important. I suppose making money, and it is the 'movie business' after all, but occasionally you get a film which was clearly made to be a film that the maker wanted to see and this is one of them. So I guess what I'm getting at is not everyone is going to like this, but there will be some that love it.<br/><br/>So again you've got a chapter styled story here and again, it's told in a way where it has a few bunches of stories going on independent of each other which ultimately culminate and mash together in the climax. Tarantinos' style I guess, but done so well that every little chapter feels like an epic in itself and I recon you could quite easily just watch one of them on their own without finishing the film, like catching an episode of your fave show - they're that good. The dialogue is snappy, but not too hip (It is the 40's after all) and to get this sort of snap from four different languages takes something special. It's fair to say that every angle of war has probably been shown on film so why not twist it up a bit? And that's what happens – don't go in expecting a accurate history lesson because it's not that, so what? I can't see why people are getting annoyed with that? So what if it doesn't tell history as it was – even films like Braveheart had people up in arms because William Wallace didn't sport long hair and blue face paint, so just go with it.<br/><br/>So there was a bunch of Nazi hunters that did exist and what they did was horrific and this follows them for the short part, the other parts of the film though are the gems, the movie within the movie is a cool touch, directed by Eli Roth who isn't half bad actually. The standoffs, both verbal and physical are brill and the ending, although no spectacular twist, is really satisfying and gutting in equal measure. I literally cannot wait for the interviews and ramblings on the disc, it will no doubt be a treat!<br/><br/>OK so he doesn't follow the rules, and he sure as hell doesn't in this film, but you've got to give it to him he has had a stab at most things right? Gangster, Kung Fu, Hammer Horror, and now War, I mean what's next I wonder? A Rom-Com? Now that would be interesting..."

Right down to Christoph Walz as the nastiest Captain Hook ever and the ticking alarm clock. Clever!! But then I realised I how stupid I was being, what the hell! Still, fun for all the family, as long as your family are Nazi-haters. Maybe better to leave the more impressionable kids at home, though. Wouldn't want them trying to copy the actions of the Apache and his homicidal crew .<br/><br/>Smart, not too intrusive echoes of his previous work and lots of irony there if your looking for it, Operation Kino is drenched in it, and not the sad kind, but the laugh out loud kind. Is this Tarantino filling in the application form for the job of Obama's Propaganda Minister. I certainly hope so.<br/><br/>I'd give it 10 but for the soundtrack. I'm actually trying to be very objective here, even if it doesn't, sound like it. Because it worked for me, big time, but there's one point that I think might jar a bit.

Amazing acting all around, but Eli Roth as the Bear Jew Donny Donowitz and Michael Fassbender as Lt Archie Hicox, not to mention the female leads Diane Kruger (Bridget von Hammersmark) and Mélanie Laurent (Shoshanna Dreyfus) are exceptionally brilliant. As for Christoph Waltz as Nazi Col. Hans Landa -- he is incredible. If Lanz doesn't win a Oscar, the Academy won't ever have been more unfair... That man can express more with his eyes than most actors can with a ten minute soliloquy.<br/><br/>Anyhow, dark but perfect humor, intellect, brutal but necessary action and gorgeous cinematography.

","I read some very disappointed reviews but do not agree with them. Its a very very good Tarantino (at parts very Tarantino-untypical: The most brutal scene is at the beginning, but no blood is shown, even no screaming) - and its a fine movie in context of the WWII-theme. <br/><br/>The Apache (Pitt) has a funny accent which has make me watch the movie in ""english"", not in my mother-language ""german"" because I knew about the not optimal synchronization. In German, the Apache has a loss of character because of this. <br/><br/>However, there are many details to speak about - there were some scenes when I did thought ""normally this and that will happen now - how boring"" but it did not happen the way I assumed (i.e. in the tavern as ""von Hammersmark"" killed the father of the newborn as he capitulates). No time for sentimentality, just realistically. <br/><br/>What I also do not understand is that some people here try to speak about the movie as if it were a historically movie - its not, it plays, aside the very beginning of the movie, in a parallel universe. And that gives the movie the chance to give me at the end what I expected: catharsis. And again - ""ingloriuos basterds"" does not show, I am afraid so, what really happened in France in WWII. At last, considering Christoph Waltz: give him a price. Excellent playing!"

","This is why we go to the movies. This film is a once-in-ten-year phenomenon. Nothing that happens in this movie can be anticipated and, as a result, is non-stop entertainment. Many of the actors are European born (Germany, France, Spain) and their ability to move easily between languages is extraordinary. Brad Pitt's character's clumsy attempt to speak Italian shows how language ignorant Americans are. History is completely rewritten in a most entertaining and satisfying way. The violence is extreme (typical Tarantino) and not for everyone, but it is about violent people in a violent time. This movie deserves awards all around. Picture, actors, director."

","This is not to say that he won't be able to top it. I have a renewed faith in his abilities in writing and film-making. The sky's the limit. Yesterday, before I went to see this movie, somebody at IMDb criticized it for being ""jingoistic"". Jingoism is a political term. Inglourious Basterds is a SPIRITUAL film, about a SPIRITUAL WAR, and political correctness be DAMNED. What happened in this film was PURE POETIC JUSTICE, and it is a danger to try and dilute that by giving Nazis some sort of courtesy they DO NOT DESERVE, nor would they give us. I encourage ALL JEWS (and all those of Jewish sentiment) to see this movie, and have the time of their lives, like I did. I am going back again because it's THAT GOOD, and the ending wouldn't be the same on a smaller screen. Tarantino, you had me fooled, You Glorious Bastard!!! Warrior Poet"
"ovisas","10","5","14","3 September 2009"," Making the unfunny funny
",""" It is a safe bet that the master of post-modern cinematic irony intended nothing so simplistic as this. But what, then, did he intend? Technically, this film is at least as good as any that Mr Tarantino has made, and richer than any of them in incongruous humour, cinematic insider references and graphic violence. A hit squad of American Jewish soldiers and a French Jewess living in Paris converge in a pair of outlandish plots to kill the Nazi high command. The camera stays firmly in focus during scenes of extraordinarily explicit bloodletting. Yet this reviewer found it impossible not to enjoy them.<br/><br/>This is partly because the film is, at one level, just a good old revenge fantasy, an echo of the superhero comic-book genre. But it is also because Mr Tarantino, although he kills off goodies as well as baddies, works hard to efface sympathy for all of them. Only once do truly innocent people die, and they do so off-camera. For the rest, his characters are either psychotics, such as the charming and chilling SS colonel (played by the superb Christoph Waltz, pictured) and the engaging but equally crazy American officer (Brad Pitt); or cartoon cut-outs such as a suave British agent and a Jewish baseball slugger; or good folk, such as the Jewess and the German who loves her, who are twisted by war into maniacs.<br/><br/>Mr Tarantino may be trying to prove that he, the acknowledged king of detoxified death porn, can make murder fun even in one of the unfunniest chapters in human history. This is a hollow achievement if it depends on keeping the audience entertained but disengaged. Indeed, the nub of many of the negative reviews is that, faced with the Holocaust, Mr Tarantino avoids tricky moral issues.<br/><br/>But perhaps that is to misunderstand this film. Maybe it is not a movie about the Holocaust but a sophisticated piece of self-mockery. The blood-drenched climactic scene, which takes place in a cinema showing another gory war movie, rather supports that view. If it is right ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a glorious success—just not one worth taking seriously. "" Aug 27th 2009 From The Economist print edition"

","Before I start this review I must say this movie was amazing, so amazing it should be number 1 on the top movies list on this site. QT's best film ,a must see, I loved it, now there are some things I must warn though. If you are going into the theaters expecting all blood and gore then think again. The film has great action scenes but it isn't all gore and it isn't as violent as you may think. On that note if you don't like reading subtitles, if it bores you don't see it. The movie is in French mostly and has English subtitles. Well those are the warnings about this film, although me not knowing about either of those and not liking to read subtitles (I feel it distracts your attention from what the people in the film are doing and makes you take your time reading the dialogue instead)still loved this film. I wouldn't say it's my favorite but it is up there on my list. It has no faults that I noticed and a brilliant story. It really catches you in and has a great ending. Not having come out on DVD yet, I'd still have to say this is a must see in theaters movie. You need to see it on the huge screen with the loud volume it brings out the movie and really catches you in it. Now many of you reading this may have noticed I said it deserves to be number 1 but said it wasn't my favorite, that's because unlike many of the films I enjoy, it seems to please many different groups of people. I even saw old ladies at the movies watching this. Without a doubt I would say go to the theaters and see this film. If you are a QT fan, action fan, drama fan, Brad Pitt fan, war movie fan, or just PLAIN OLD MOVIE LOVER or even just AN AVERAGE MOVIE WATCHER or even if you HATE MOVIES you MUST SEE THIS FILM!!!! run out to the theaters with a friend or even by yourself and watch this, and pay attention to it too, it is amazing. 10 out of 10 best movie that has come out in the past few years and one of the best movies that has come out PERIOD"

"MrPink08","10","5","14","28 August 2009"," An Inglourious Pick for the Best Film of the Year!
","This summer, everyone I know waited for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Me? I waited in great anticipation for the new film from my favorite director Quentin Tarantino, a World War II revenge epic entitled Inglourious Basterds. And, I will admit, it did not disappoint.<br/><br/>While Tarantino is known for his over the top violence, it's not the blood and gore that makes his films so good. It's the long sessions of dialog. While this may turn some film goers off (like my friends who preferred the aforementioned Transformers), to me it's what makes his films roll. If you pay attention, the dialog is very funny and entertaining. Plus, the action is more exciting and unexpected when QT sticks it in the middle of the conversation.<br/><br/>In his previous films, Tarantino used mainstream Hollywood stars for his films. However, with the exception of Brad Pitt and a cameo by a nearly unrecognizable Mike Myers (fans of The Office will recognize BJ Novak aka Ryan), you probably won't recognize nearly three quarters of the actors in the film. All of the foreign actors in the film are terrific, and they give a sense of realism to the film. Melanie Laurent, a French actress, is Shosanna, a young Jewish girl who plans to burn down her cinema with Nazi leaders inside. Among the Basterds are Til Schweiger, a sadistic German who kills Nazis in creative ways, and Michael Fassbender as a British war leader. As for Pitt, he portrays the leader of the Basterds, a hillbilly named Aldo Raine. Raine is an awesome character, and a role only Pitt could play. He leads his all Jewish team into France where they do ""one thang and one thang only-(kill) Nazis"". Myers's cameo is small, but you can't believe how unrecognizable he is. Hopefully, Myers gets his career back on track after duds like The Love Guru and The Cat in the Hat (easily one of the worst films ever). Eli Roth, best known as the director of Hostel, is on hand to portray Donnie, a Bostonian Jew who beats Nazis with a baseball bat. Roth is not only a good director, but a good actor as well. He previously cameoed in Tarantino's Death Proof, and hopefully more roles are on his way. But Christoph Waltz steals the show as the crazy Nazi general Hans Landa. Waltz speaks every language in the movie, and portrays Landa perfectly. You really can't like Waltz since he portrays a Nazi, but hopefully some better roles are headed his way. Some film goers will recognize Diane Krueger, who portrays German actress Bridget von Hammerstark, a spy working for the Allies. Krueger is best known for portraying Nicolas Cage's love interest in National Treasure. There, she seemed pure American. In this film, she speaks her native German perfectly, showing her versatility.<br/><br/>So, as the summer ends, I have to say I came in with a bad attitude about the summer of 09 (movie-wise anyway). However, with films like Basterds, The Hangover, and District 9, I think film goers will remember 09's movies for long to come."

","For those familiar with the work of Quentin Tarantino, you will recall that he admires the use of chapters for dividing a film's narrative into more easily-digestible parts. He employs the technique once again with ""Inglourious Basterds"", and titles the first of these chapters in a most appropriate way: ""Once Upon a Time in Nazi Occupied France..."" Some might look at this just as a catchy slogan, used for stylistic purposes exclusively. But, Tarantino means it quite literally; this is not World War II as history books would describe it, but rather a fairy tale of the war that ends with a drastically-different and far more appropriate conclusion. I shall put it this way: for those of you who believe in karma, this is how you probably believe World War II should have ended. But, really, this movie is not even about World War II...it is about, as Brad Pitt's character so elegantly states, the ""killin' Nazi business.""

"Benedict_Cumberbatch","Null","5","14","21 August 2009"," A wonderfully insane pulp fantasy; Tarantino's best since ""Pulp Fiction""
","""Inglourious Basterds"". ""Inglourious Basterds"". How I love this title. I first saw the previews for Tarantino's new film at the beginning of this year, and it seemed to me a non-serious version of Bryan Singer's ""Valkyrie"" (which I haven't seen). Not being exactly a Tarantino fanboy (I love ""Pulp Fiction"" like everybody else and know he will never do anything as good again, but moderately enjoy his other films mostly for their specific qualities than for the overall results, which don't always engage me), I was very excited for this - and not only wasn't disappointed, it exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>First of all, to enjoy ""Inglourious Basterds"", you have to put aside any deeply moral or analytical issues about World War II - and definitely dis consider, just for the moment, Adorno's theories about the banality of evil after Auschwitz. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is by no means a seriously intellectual, let alone humanistic, piece of work; but a brilliant, unapologetically entertaining mix of pulp, fantasy and propaganda. In Nazi-occupied France, a group of Jewish-American soldiers, led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt, whose superstar persona and charm fits the part like a glove), kills and scalps Nazis throughout the Third Reich. Their paths will cross with a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent, who had a supporting role opposite Gaspard Ulliel in the criminally underrated ""Le Dernier Jour"" and shows her full range here), whose family was massacred a few years earlier and now owns a movie theater in Paris. Shosanna has some revenge plans of her own, after Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz, Best Actor at Cannes for this performance) and a young war ""hero"", Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl, of ""Goodbye, Lenin!"") decide that Joseph Goebbels's (Sylvester Groth) new propaganda film, ""Nation's Pride"", which stars Zoller as himself, shall premiere at her venue - with the Führer himself (Martin Wuttke) among the attendees.<br/><br/>Highly original, extremely violent (it's Tarantino, after all), and visually intriguing, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is more than just 153 minutes of bloodbath. Filled with all of Tarantino's trademarks (even his notorious foot fetish is back, with Diane Kruger as the victim this time), great soundtrack (more discreet than usual, appropriately with more instrumental pieces than pop songs) and unique dialogue (""Let's burn down the cinema on Nazi night"" and Pitt's deliver of ""Arrivederci"" are two of my faves), this is easily his most satisfying and ambitious work since ""Pulp Fiction"". Favourite scene: a momentarily shy Zoller introduces himself to Shosanna, as she stands on top of a ladder changing the titles on the marquee of her cinema. ""In France, we respect the directors. Even the Germans"", says she. A witty, almost tender moment that epitomizes what Tarantino really is: an overgrown film buff with lots of talent, who sometimes knows how to get the best out of his lovely self-indulgence, and presents us, geeky film buffs ourselves, with wonderful treats like ""Inglourious Basterds"". 10/10."

"The_Void","10","6","18","1 September 2009"," Tarantino does World War II with Glourious results!
","I have to admit that I've not always been the biggest fan of everything that Quentin Tarantino has released; but I have always admired the man both for making exactly the films he wants, and for trying his hand at different genres. World War II was not the obvious place to go, and it becomes even less obvious when you take out any ties to actual history and replace it with a black comic surreal style that is fleshed out with absurd characters and intense violence; but Tarantino has done just that, and for me has masterminded the best film of his career! Tarantino himself calls this a 'men on a mission' film, but really it's much more than that and the film would better be described as a World War II themed ensemble. The bulk of the film takes place in 1944 and the stage is set in Nazi-occupied France. A group of Jewish-American soldiers nicknamed 'The Basterds' have been dropped into enemy territory in order to hunt down and kill as many Nazi's as possible - a task they carry out with relish. Meanwhile, it has emerged that the Nazi's are holding a film premiere in a small theatre in France owned by a Nazi hating French-Jewish girl. Naturally, the Basterds soon take an interest in the event - since every major Nazi will be in attendance - but their plans to spoil the Third Reich's evening coincides with those of the theatre owner...who has a revenge of her own in mind.<br/><br/>Like most of Tarantino's films, this one is executed in chapters - there are five of them and they all follow in chronological order. Each chapter has a distinct style and purpose and in fact each one could almost be a film within itself. Tarantino sets the benchmark immediately with the first scene - an intense sequence that sees ruthless SS Officer Hans Landa turn up at the house of a French farmer whom he suspects of hiding Jews. This scene is unbelievably intense; Tarantino expertly builds the pressure throughout the scene until it finally reaches boiling point in spectacular fashion. That's basically the crux of the film; each sequence featured is completely gripping and intense, and this makes the two and a half hour running time fly by. The film is peppered with Tarantino's trademark sharp dialogue, (which is featured in English, French, German and Italian!) and it is unbelievably good - almost every line uttered is infinitely quotable, and each of the conversations between the many characters is interesting in its own right. Every scene appears to have been meticulously planned to the finest detail – and there honestly isn't one moment in the entire film that isn't extremely well done. I'm also amazed at how funny the film is – several sequences in this film wouldn't be out of place in a comedy, and yet they blend seamlessly with the intensity and violence on show elsewhere.<br/><br/>Throughout his career, Tarantino has excelled at casting the right people for the right roles; and Inglourious Basterds is another success on that front. Brad Pitt is the biggest star name in the cast, his Lieutenant Aldo Raine is a gloriously over the top stereotype and Pitt pins down the role fabulously. However, it is in fact Austrian actor Christophe Waltz who comes out of the film with the most praise; his subtly psychotic portrayal of SS Officer Hans Landa is absolutely brilliant and will surely go down as one of cinema's great villains. The mesmeric French actress Mélanie Laurent also stands out (both for her beauty and acting), and there's also memorable roles for Michael Fassbender, Til Schweiger (his awesomely cool character doesn't feature enough!), Diane Kruger and Hostel director Eli Roth, who gives a surprisingly effective performance as a baseball bat wielding lunatic nicknamed ""The Bear Jew"". All of the central characters are very well written and Tarantino excels at getting the point of all of them across, even though the screen time is generously shared between them all.<br/><br/>Rumour has it that Inglourious Basterds was ten years in the making, and I can say that the wait was worth it! I really am struggling to comprehend just how amazingly brilliant this film is. Tarantino has made a movie the likes of which has never been seen before, and if a better movie than this one is released in my lifetime, I will be surprised."
"biduncan67","1","3","7","27 November 2019"," Disgraceful glorification of torture
","The same people who condemned ""Zero Dark Thirty"" for a disgusting torture scene lauded ""Inglourious Basterds"" for even worse torture sequences. Bludgeoning and disfiguring of German prisoners is a blatant war crime, never performed by commandos. Writer-director Tarantino makes it seem commendable.<br/><br/>The film is also historically inaccurate on nearly every level. It shows Hitler relishing a violent sniper movie, in a public theater. Hitler enjoyed musicals, opera, and Mickey Mouse cartoons, not war pictures. He visited occupied France once, in 1940, and never again. The man had a bunker mentality early on.<br/><br/>Goebbels also would not have attended a contemporary propaganda shoot-em-up picture. He preferred over-produced costume dramas, such as ""Kolberg"". Even he thought ""The Eternal Jew"" pseudo-documentary was in bad taste. Goebbels was a suave, sprightly intellectual, thus making him far more sinister in real life than in this shallow film.<br/><br/>We all laud Christoph Waltz's performance, but he was a cultured villain from another movie, like ""The Train"", ""How I Won the War"", ""Three Came Home"", or ""Bridge on the River Kwai."" He should have been in a more accurate, believable drama.<br/><br/>Offensive inaccuracy aside, this tedious film gives you no one to root for."

","Tarantino does it again helming a virtuous war / retribution film. There are so many unforgettable scenes. Hans Landa's interragation of the French farmer, Perrier La Padite is unparalleled. Lt. Aldo Raine's recruitment speach to the basterds is hilarious and brutal. Shosanna's vengeance film premiere is poetic. Lt. Archie Hicox's confrontation with the Nazis in a bar is intense. Its impossible to pick a favorite. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, score and acting. All the actors involved deliver realistic and superlative performances. In particular Waltz, Laurent, Fassbender and Pitt are commanding. The plot revolves around Lt. Aldo Raines whose mission is to seek retribution against the Nazis by putting together a squad of eight Jewish soldiers known as the ""Basterds"". The Basterds join forces with an undercover agent to take down the Third Reich. Their plan is set to take place in a theatre owned by Shosanna who is seeking to avenge the Nazi's slaughtering of her family. The plot is clever, funny, vengeful, gritty, intense, violent, poetic, unforgettable and has one of the most cathartic endings on film. The last dialogue in the film is delivered by Sgt. Donny Donowitz when he says to Lt. Raines, ""I think this might just be your masterpiece"". This viewer believes Tarantino was being symbolic and referring to the film as his masterpiece to date. The film is certainly a memorable and sublime work of art."

This is one of his best films he has made. <br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds starring Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent. The film tells the fictional alternate history story of two plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's political leadership, one planned by Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent), a young French Jewish cinema proprietor, and the other by a team of Jewish-American soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Pitt). Christoph Waltz co-stars as Hans Landa, an SS colonel tracking down Raine's group who has a connection to Shosanna's past. The film's title was inspired by Italian director Enzo G.

Although the entire cast is amazing, Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz are superb. Pitt's southern accent is actually pretty good (I'm a southerner, and very critical of fake southern accents), and Waltz's multilingual abilities were very impressive. Seeing their characters finally face one another towards the end was fulfilling and perfect.

"danpclarke","10","3","7","20 April 2011"," This may be my best work yet
","I have seen no less than eight people walk out of this film. They ranged from an elderly couple, tottering out as the first scalp is sliced off, to a group of young people who slinked out muttering something about ""fucking French"". This is certainly not your average summer blockbuster. It's talky, wincingly violent, and a little complicated, all of which are qualities which could drive restless audience members to vacate their paid-for seat. They're also the qualities which make Inglourious Basterds two and three quarter hours of unmitigated cinematic joy. Quentin Tarantino has produced a hilarious, magnificently accomplished masterpiece, tossing around and tearing apart conventions like a playful monkey to craft the funniest, most frightening and thought-provoking film of the year.<br/><br/>The basic idea is a war film with Spaghetti Western elements. Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) is tasked with leading a group of Jewish-American soldiers, the eponymous Basterds, into Nazi-occupied France to, as he so wonderfully puts it, inflict ""murder, torture, intimation, and terror"" on the men who did the same to the European countries they occupy. Meanwhile, the utterly terrifying Col. Hans Landa (Christopher Waltz) hunts Jews with charming, monstrous precision, whilst Shoshanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), a girl he let escape for his own amusement, plots to incinerate the Nazi high command. Every single performance from this stunning international ensemble cast is a pleasure to watch. All their accents and mannerisms are played up for some truly hysterical moments of comedy – the British characters are especially amusing, along with Pitt's tight-lipped ""Bonjourno"" – without ever becoming overly ridiculous.<br/><br/>As well as the ever-flowing comedic moments, Basterds offers some heart- stoppingly tense moments of suspense constructed around the unpredictability of the smooth-talking, subtly aggressive and intense Nazi officers. The film is similarly visually stunning. Brief spurts of action are a treat for the eyes, and all are managed without a hint of CGI, which led to two of the stars nearly becoming cremated during a particularly ambitious scene. The wry, winking iconography Tarantino scatters throughout also deserves special mention. Look out for the looming black poodle sternly criticizing Goebbels' (Sylvester Groth) guffawing racism, Landa's emasculating Swiss style horn-pipe, and Major Dieter Hellstrom's (August Diehl) fantastic cowboy boot shaped pint glass, coming to wreck havoc on the Apache Basterds.<br/><br/>For a film so colourfully ostentatious, Basterds is a film imbued with great amounts of depth and subtlety. Essentially, this is a film about the audience. We see Hitler laugh hysterically at the Americans being slaughtered in the film-within-a-film Nation's Pride, and our natural instinct is repulsion – but it quickly dawns upon us that laughing at nasty, painful death is exactly how we've spent the last two hours. Having the twentieth century's ultimate figure of evil indulging in the same edgy delights as our good selves might send a ripple of unease over an audience which laughed heartily at the Bear Jew (a surprisingly accomplished Eli Roth) clobber a Nazi soldier to death whilst yelling baseball conventions. Just like Roth's own Hostel, we find ourselves forced to question why we find the violence so entertaining.<br/><br/>The phrase 'kosher porn' has been tossed around by some reviewers to describe the visceral, vengeful joy the film provides. These certainly aren't the Jewish characters you tend to see in more conventional war films. Their gleeful, effervescently comic brutality makes the Nazis the victims, inverting preconceptions of the place of Jewish figures in war films by making them figures of absolute power rather than desperate resisters. It's actually their Nazi victims that seem to elicit glimmers of sympathy rather than our heroes. We're given very little background on the Basterds themselves, whilst their scalped, carved and shot targets talk of defending their people, hugging their mothers and seeing their children grow up.<br/><br/>I could write about this film for so much longer. There is so much to praise, so much to talk about. It is Tarantino's unrivalled magnum opus, a film which defies all expectations and the potential to change war films forever. Please, ignore the ignorant negative and lukewarm reviews floating around. If you enjoy cinema, go and see this film."

","4 out of 10 because of a little part in the second chapter of the movie and for the entire 5th chapter and the end.<br/><br/>I fell asleep attempting to watch this movie. The first chapter is weird with this French shepherd and this Nazi guy everlastingly talking at a table with this weird friendly/scared manner.<br/><br/>The second chapter it was actually interesting, at least there was some action when Brad Pitt interviews this Nazi prisoner and his Nazi fellows.<br/><br/>The third chapter.. Boring.. A lot of talking, too much.. All German and french and you have to follow all these subtitles unless you know both languages already. Talking and talking and talking and i don't have a lot of patience, i like to see action or, at least, an interesting storyline, period. That's just me. Even though my wife said that i needed to follow the movie entirely to fully understand what's going on.. Well, i'm kinda ""happy"" with the few things that i've catched.<br/><br/>Some action in the beginning, a nice nap and i woke up just in time for the chapter 5, the final one where i believe the most of the action of the movie is contained.<br/><br/>Despite the crazy plot, totally unhistorical war movie, i wouldn't go too far saying that it was an insult to History, too much blood and guts or stuff like that. I understand that's still a movie and the director can play with it, some can like it and some not.<br/><br/>I'm just disappointed for the huge amount of talking, no sounds around and the camera pointing still at 2 people sitting at a table.. That's the perfect sleeping pill for me. Typical of the Tarantino style, i know, but at least a movie like Pulp Fiction was cool all the way from beginning to the end, this one not at all.<br/><br/>To close this vent/review 1) If you don't mind the talking, staring at the bottom of the screen reading subtitles while you're listening to french and German (mostly) i think it deserves to get a look at least once.<br/><br/>2) If you like to see a fair amount of action and/or an INTERESTING and catchy storyline with a cool meaning to it.. You may want to chose another title for the night, otherwise: Sweet Dreams."
"blamb147","6","3","7","17 January 2010"," aesthetic nihilism
","Watching Tarantino's latests makes even the average non-critic movie-consumer realize that there can be a huge disjuncture between the aesthetics of a movie and its thematics. Tarantino obviously has talent for the former, but not the latter, at least not in a clear way (this isn't necessarily a bad thing though). Of course, as everyone will say, the dialogue is good, the acting great, and the cinematography beautiful. And perhaps this will make it a great movie for some who also find its motifs of righteous revenge and bodily destruction satisfying. The best scenes in the movie are the scenes of building suspense, like the encounter in the tavern basement. I can't help but like Brad Pitt's character too, but maybe that's because I'm from rural Virginia.<br/><br/>What bothers me about the movie is precisely its imbalance, the masterful cinema that has left behind any sort of moral message. Tarantino's ethics are very perverse: he turns Jews into Nazis, which seems to be the implication of the movie (just think of the last scene with the Bear Jew spraying bullets on Germans trapped in a locked room). Tarantino is hanging everything on the question of whether 'righteousness' justifies violence (in a similar way to Boondock Saints and a million other movies appealing to masculine code of redemptive violence). I will even hold out the possibility that Tarantino is aware of the moral-messages he is communicating, a very real possibility if the trivia facts on IMDb are true, such as how Tarantino makes several cameos: as the first German to have his scalp removed, as the hands strangling Hammerstock to death.<br/><br/>How could one watch this movie, and not ask about its ethics? Even if Tarantino is consciously manipulating moral-messages, that does not necessarily rescue this movie from nihilism. Its the same nihilism in pulp fiction too: kill or be killed. Or, kill the ones who have killed your kin. Except now its writ large on the mythology of WWII so sacred to the 21st century mind."
"jefsof-2","5","3","7","16 January 2010"," The Good, the Bad, the Ugly, and the Tarantino
","I had hoped this film would be a rip-roaring Tarantino ride but it was major creative misfire. It is really two films, the film up to the shootout in the basement bar and film that comes after.<br/><br/>The Good: A more painterly film than Quentin has ever done before - with some, frankly, beautiful shots. For part of the film a standout performance by the German (Swiss?) fellow Christoph Waltz until the film went off the rails. Riveting tension in the first long scene at the farmhouse.<br/><br/>The Bad: Once Brad Pitt sticks his finger into the lady's bullet-wound in her leg this version of the plunge-the-syringe-in-her-heart-scene just unraveled any logic the story possessed. The real human horror of an occupier hunting for human beings hiding from cruelty set up at the beginning of the film (the terrified family hiding under the floorboards as an evil Nazi stands on top of them in pursuit) is utterly betrayed and nullified as the film descends into farce. Pitt is terrific, like a Jimmy Stewart, when he plays a version of himself ... his, er, characters don't come across so well. It seemed like he was having himself a good time on-set making a Tarantino film but he loped through this thinly-written caricature of a part.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Ah, where to begin ... let's start with a complete breakdown in security at a theatre where the elite of the Nazi leadership would be viewing a propaganda film. There would have been soldiers for blocks around and in every room and at every doorway in the theatre where the assassination was to take place. Ridiculous. Was not there a blatant racist reference in the set-up (Col. Landa at the lunch meeting) that the black projectionist was to not even be on the property the night of the premiere? Yet, he's there in the projection room, running around, and behind the screen. Ridiculous and poorly written. The scalping looked fake each and every time. Pitt's accent. Eli Roth's acting. The too contemporary feel of some shots and scenes. The lighting in the theatre lobby - it felt like let's-blow-this-up-at-the-finale James Bond set. The musical choices - usually a Tarantino strong point but he blew it here. The TONE of the film changed radically in the aftermath of the basement shootout: suddenly the well-crafted revenge set-up (the little girl would face off with the evil German Col. Landa again) morphs into the stupid - now the whole previous scene of a minor cultural slip (""three"" in fingers) and accents is negated and trashed as the kooky kids are gonna act EYE-talian! Dumb. It was an entirely different movie from this point on. The cast on the lady's leg looked stupid, the acting dropped a couple of notches (except for Waltz - but he was allowed to roam freely into camp). As an audience we were promised something human and meaningful in the powerful first scene yet Tarantino either lacked the courage of this conviction or never intended to complete this film without plenty of snark and smugness because the emotional bond we established with that family who dies mercilessly and the daughter who gets away is trivialized as the film goes on to the point of nothingness. When the annoying war-hero-turned-actor Nazi soldier and the lady-in-red have their doomed lovers shootout to the death you just don't care anymore - we're now in it for the twists and turns on the roller-coaster not for any meaning to a story. And the UGLIEST of all: we are set up for showdown with the girl-who-got-away and the Nazi hunter only to have it come to nothing. This was no revenge fantasy, it was a trifle that dabbled in war movie clichés and let some actors riff. We were cheated of the powerful scene where Shosanna faces her tormentor directly and to the last.<br/><br/>The Tarantino: I felt at times like I was watching a riff on Sin City or that he was channeling The Producers (original film) in some shots and scenes. It is his most uneven film. Tarantino is hard to fathom on this one."

","I think that this film could have been really great if it was simply made as a collection of unrelated sketches, because some of the situations and dialogue are just amazingly awkward and yet extremely fun.<br/><br/>The thing is, that this is not enough for a feature film, because this piece is missing a story or believable relationships between the characters. Even the most absurd films need to have some sort of connection with the viewer other than some great lines and situations, and I think that Tarantino has realised that he can go by just throwing out wise-ass characters who never want to make any sense or difference, in the end resorting to a bloodbath as the only way to truly sort things out. <br/><br/>This film has some of the tensest scenes I have ever seen and some of the most hilarious, especially with Christoph Waltz, who deserves an Oscar for his role. Tarantino though should really think his next film through, as he is almost becoming predictable and sometimes rather boring, which was not always the case. With his older work like Pulp fiction he was on a good path to truly balancing out his randomness with some sense, but after that he just quit and has gotten worse ever since.<br/><br/>I find this truly disappointing, because if he would try to remember the background of his work and why his stories and characters turn out the way they do and incorporate that into his new work, he would be a timeless filmmaker and not just your local wise-joker turned director."

The Basterds, are haunting, but at the same time, very funny, at times even hilarious. The dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other Tarantino films. The entertainment and hilarity is led by Brad Pitt. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. I couldn't wait to see him on screen again. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. Also making great impressions were Mélanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were tremendous. The film was filled with noteworthy performances.<br/><br/>The story itself, has so many historical inaccuracies to even count, but so what? It isn't meant to be a documentary.

Tarantino's softer approach to his classic schema ? T's movies like Kill, 4rooms etc. were enjoyable because presented the gags without any ""seriousity"". Following my logic, I'd put 4rooms on number one in top 250... but it's not the case, T's movies are OK, but that's about all. Want a good movie to follow the subject ? See Amen. ;) That one really deserves a great score."

"Sirus_the_Virus","10","5","15","19 September 2009"," The best film of the year so far... The most fun I had at the movies this Summer.
","Quentin Tarentino's newest film, Inglorious basterds, is my favorite film of 2009 so far. It's fun, funny, inventive, and awesome. There are so many fantastic performance. Actually, the best performance of the summer is made by someone in this film. Inglorious Basterds, if you're expecting a big shoot'em up bad ass film you might not get it. I did, but I was overjoyed by all of it.<br/><br/>The best performance of the Summer goes to Christoph Waltz as Hans Landa. Christoph Waltz is menacing and funny. His performance is so intimidating. If I ran into him,, I would scream. He is menacing as hell and truly is a bastard. <br/><br/>Inglorious basterds also has a few other fantastic performances. One by Melanie Laurent, who survived in the beginning. she is also in on the plan that the basterds have. Inglorious basterds is a film in which you should expect the unexpected. Everyone probably thinks that Brad Pitt has a large role. Well you know what... he doesn't get the biggest role. I think that the supporting cast get more of a role than he does. I wanted to see more of Diane Krueger as the french actress. Brad Pitt does a fine performance also. I shouldn't have left him out because he is great in this film. His accent is like Forrest Gump's. Pitt plays Aldo Raine, the leader of Basterds. He is very funny, he even tries to be an Italian. He sounds ridiculous. <br/><br/>The film has a ton of guest appearances. Like B.J. Novak from The Office, even Mike Myers is in it and he looks ridiculous and gives a great performance. He is only in it for five minutes. Within five minutes of his appearance, he already doing a better job in this than in that crap Love Guru and The Cat and the hat combined. I try hard to forget about those films.I hope you do too.<br/><br/>The film isn't just about the Basterds. It's about many other people and there is a ton of dialogue. There are a ton of subplots. One including Melanie Laurent, who plays a girl who escaped from the Nazis. She owns a theater. I am not going to spoil the master plan, but I will say one thing. My jaw dropped. <br/><br/>To end my review, this film deserves Oscars. It definitely deserves best picture and there is one performance who deserves the Oscar. Christoph Waltz was fantastic. He was the scene stealer and the coolest, the most evil. No wonder, because his nick name was The Jew Hunter. Oscar picker people, be sure to put Christoph Waltz on the top of the list. <br/><br/>I forgot to mention that awful director Eli Roth. He plays Donny Donnowitz or something like that. His films are crap. But his acting is actually good. Inglorious basterds is the best film of the year, no doubt."

","A group of Jewish American soldiers. A girl who has fled her home after the brutal massacre of her family. And a group of Nazis occupying France, who will premiere their Nazi propaganda movie at a small theater. How do all these topics fit all together? They are the pieces that form the puzzle that is ""Inglourious Basterds"".<br/><br/>Brad Pitt plays Lt. Aldo Raine, a Jewish-American solider leading a group of other Jewish-American soldiers, named ""The Inglourious Basterds"", into France. Their job is to do one thing- exact their revenge against the Nazis for their horrible crimes against humanity. They plan to brutally scalp the Nazis and kill them. As Raine says, ""We're killin' Nazis, and business is bloomin'"". They have also targeted a movie theater, where the premiere of the aforementioned Nazi propaganda movie is to take place.<br/><br/>Shosanna Dreyfus is a French Jewish girl who has fled her home after the Nazis have massacred her family. She flees to a movie theater that her aunt gave to her long after she died. One night, she meets a charming young man outside the theater, and the next day she sees him again. She is annoyed by him, but is invited by the man to lunch. Turns out he is a Nazi soldier, and that he has brought her to his Nazi family. Hans Linda, the Nazi leader who massacred her family, tells Shosanna and the Nazi family that her theater is the perfect place to premiere the movie. After it is confirmed that the premiere at her cinema is officially ""Nazi Night"", Shosanna and her partner projectionist have only one plan- to burn the theater to the ground.<br/><br/>Coming in at 154 minutes, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a film that does not overstay its welcome. Every minute of its length is epic, and the whole time, you're glued to your theater seat, wanting to know what happens next. The way Quentin Tarantino structures the plot, he sticks to his usual ""Chapters"" formula, and presents the two stories in a way in which in the last 45 minutes, they come together like pieces of a puzzle. This is enough to keep any moviegoer satisfied! As for performances, every single performance in this is amazing. Pitt does a brilliant job at portraying the cold and brutal personality of Aldo Raine. Also in the film is Diane Kruger, who plays Bridget, a woman the Basterds meet along the way. She has proved herself to be quite the actress over time, and with her being German, she is definitely an easy target for the role. But the REAL star of the show is Christoph Waltz, playing Hans Linda. He steals the show in every aspect here, and he's the type you wouldn't imagine playing a cold and ruthless Nazi.<br/><br/>If you're a big fan of Tarantino, you can also expect his usual trademarks: Red Apple Cigarettes, The woman's feet shot, the usage of music from other movies (the music of Ennio Morricone is a huge character here), and the homage to other films. All of these are shown in the film. The film pays homage to European WWII movies, and does it brilliantly. Also, his dialogue, which is something he's been known for, is the best dialogue in any of his films.<br/><br/>Think of ""Inglourious Basterds"" as ""Pulp Fiction"" set in Nazi-Occupied in France. In short,"" Inglourious Basterds"" is a phenomenal piece of film-making and proved to be an excellent day at the cinema."
"frankverschelling","10","5","15","12 September 2009"," In one word: amazing
","This movie was totally amazing. Everyone should watch this, except for the people who can't handle blood. It's another masterpiece from Quintin Tarantino who really knows how to make movies. It is cruel and hilarious at the same time. If you want a real happened story about World War II then don't go to this movie. It is all fiction. Tarantino has repeatedly stressed that ""Basterds"" is a, ""Spaghetti Western but with World War II iconography."" The influence on Tarantino's vision by Western director Sam Peckinpah can be felt in the film's agonizing tension, punctuated by sudden violence. Tarantino has embraced Peckinpah's cinematic revisionism. His ""Basterds,"" arguably the cowboys of the film, scalp their victims, a behavior typical of the American Indians portrayed in many Westerns."

After IB i worship QT, please never make dull commercial movies, please keep showing your love for all kinds of genres, because IB was in my opinion:perfection.

It's the first movie i have seen more then once in the cinema in a long time, last time were American beauty and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.<br/><br/>*spoilers*<br/><br/>Hans Landa deserves an Oscar but will never get it, the dull Oscar committee will never give him what he deserves. The first scene, the strudel scene, the Cinderella shoe scene, The bingo scene, even the pipe he smokes, he is a classic villain, humorous and so very dark, you cant really love him but secretly you do because he plays the part so fantastic, my number one for loving this movie actor wise.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt, spot on, i never laughed so much for Brad Pitt but every scene in this movie was perfection. bonjeurno arrivurdurcie this just might be my masterpiece i cant stop smiling.<br/><br/>The German king kong major shouldn't be overlooked, what a terrible man, i loved his arrogance, and so cool that he wouldn't walk away but chose to die, what a horrible man.<br/><br/>Shosanna/Zoller Amazing! Romeo and Juliet QT style, how masterly filmed, especially the death scene and the scene where she looks out of the window.<br/><br/>I will see this movie many times more and i am so very grateful that there is still one absolute master of directors still out there: Quentin Tarantino is the best writer/director working today. Please continue to make many more movies with all your love and passion for movies music actors dialog and most importantly: dark humor<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds for me personally easily is the best film of 2009.

","Somewhere in France, my father directed Canadian canon fire at a Nazi canon battery that was killing Allied soldiers. The Nazis spotted my father and fired a canon at him, blowing him and his radio man out of the 2nd floor of a farm house. My dad, although injured, crawled back into the farm house and continued directing the fire of his gun crew by radio until they took out that Nazi group and their guns.<br/><br/>I wish that dad could see Inglourious Basterds. In fact, I think that everyone of age should see this movie, because in World War II, mankind was scarred by the evil of the Nazis. Although I was born a year after the war, I discovered that I still have emotions about the events that almost killed my father, and I wasn't even there. Imagine the emotional scars of someone who lived through it. <br/><br/>Today, thanks to Quentin Tarantino, I feel happier - some repressed emotions have surfaced and dissipated. I hope that many others see this movie and feel better as a result. <br/><br/>I have enjoyed many movies over the years, but for me, Inglourious Basterds has raised the bar. No other movie has affected me this much.

Until I saw this.<br/><br/>Every theatre and film school, college, university and academy should have a semester long course studying ""Inglorious Basterds."" I do not know how Tarantino wrote this script, and how he directed it, but it is a perfectly assembled puzzle.<br/><br/>The script is so well written and rewarding to the actors, who are all brilliant (except for Diane Kruger, who is just ordinarily). Even side characters who have a line or two, because of their acting, make stunningly memorable performances.<br/><br/>I have never watched 2 hours of dialogue and 30 min of unequally dispersed action, and enjoyed it so much. The camera and the tensions, and the actors' freedom in building the amazing characters they build is nothing short of phenomenal.<br/><br/>Watch the movie. It may not fit your taste, you may find it boring or cheap, but you will respect it, for it is something that has already undoubtedly turned into a benchmark, overshadowing all Tarantino's work by far."
"Captain_Crunch","10","5","15","1 September 2009"," One Word, ""Classic""
","This movie has reinstated my faith in movie pictures. Quentin has delivered an instant classic of this portrayal of WW2. The movie is a good representation of how it should have gone down. From the opening scene to the glourious finale ,Tarantino delivered the goods from A to Z. In fact I had no clue how long the film was when I first went to see it, when I exited the theater 3 hours later ,it seemed the movie was only an hour and a half to two hours. Not only is the film 2 hours and 40 minutes, but I was mad when it was through, I could have watched it all night!!! There aren't too many films I want to see over and over again, but this is one of them. If you're a fan of movies where the good guys kick the villains ass, this is the one to see. It's like Tarantino took an old ""Speggetti Western"" and made a Nazi movie from it. This movie is one of my top 10 of all time, it's tied with Pulp Fiction in my opinion. Go see it NOW!!!!!"
"madbandit20002000","10","5","15","24 August 2009"," Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho, To Kill the Nazis We'll Go. . .
","Who would have the audacity to create a film about a group US Army soldiers, composed of Jews, that are commissioned to either capture, kill, scalp and swastika-brand any Nazi they come across in World War II? Quentin Tarantino, that's who! And he had a more than interesting time with the film, under the name, ""Inglorious Basterds"". Slightly sharing the name of a 1978 grindhouse take of ""The Dirty Dozen"" (the second ""a"" is purposely replaced with an ""e""), ""Basterds"" isn't a remake but another mark of art-house action by a mad cine-fanboy. Both are shameless and brave.<br/><br/>A character actor in an A-lister's body, Oscar nominee Brad Pitt (""12 Monkeys"", ""Snatch"", ""Burn After Reading"") is half-Indian Southern boy Lt. Aldo Raine (a homage to the World War II hero-cum-actor, who played Lt. Muldoon in the awkwardly pro-Vietnam War film, ""The Green Berets"" with John Wayne), an ambitious sort with a lynching rope burn scar around his neck, who leads the band into Nazi-occupied France, striking fear into the fear-mongers.<br/><br/>But there's a second narrative involving Shosanna Dreyfus (a fetching Melanie Laurent), a movie house owner/manager who's the sole survivor of her family's slaughter by the Nazis, conducted by the panther-like Col. Hans ""The Jew Hunter"" Landa (brilliant Christoph Waltz, who won the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival, slightly echoes Richard Harris's role in ""Major Dundee"" and could be a possible Oscar nominee). Under an alias, Dreyfus learns her theater has been chosen to showcase a propaganda film, featuring the Nazi hero, Frederic Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), who has a ""love jones"" for her. Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich cronies are slated to attend, making this a trap for Dreyfus to execute. The Basterds, using the intel of double agent/actress Bridget von Hammersmark (the equally lovely Diane Kruger of the National Treasure films), get into the act, and the effect is a cinematic hellstorm.<br/><br/>If you expect ""Saving Private Ryan"" by Tarantino (Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction and the ""Death Proof"" vignette of the underrated ""Grindhouse""), get the **** lost and stay the **** lost. This is pure exploitation fare, bowing at the feet of exploitation classics like ""Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS"", ""SS Hell Camp"" and the original ""Bastards""(its'director Enzo G. Castellini has a cameo here) while using a five-part narrative that alternatives between the vengeful Jewess and the slap-happy ""Nazi-busters"" at 152 minutes. Sure, there's a lot of dialogue, but it's Tarantino dialogue; movie-referential, playful, intricate, campy and subtitled (the French and German languages are spoken).<br/><br/>Pitt and Waltz are sly dogs, and the ladies are too exquisite for words. The Basterds are polluted by violent and loyal oddballs. My favorites are baseball-bat swinging Donny ""The Bear Jew"" Donowitz (director Eli Roth of the Hostel films); knife-wielding Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger) and the dutiful Smithson Utivch (B.J. Novak of ""The Office, US version""). Comic Mike Myers is notable suitable as British c.o. Ed Fenech where there's a wish for more from Rod Taylor (""The Birds"" and the original ""Time Machine"") as infamous Britain P.M. Winston Churchill. Tarantino stock actor Samuel L. Jackson has a nice part, narrating on how a certain prop in the film is flammable.<br/><br/>The other Tarantino trademarks are here too: brutal violence, nods to older cinema (a movie trivia game is played among German soldiers, Ennio Morricone's spaghetti Western tracks, Dreyfus's escape echoes the ""doorway shots"" from John Ford's ""The Searchers"") and foot-fetishism.<br/><br/>""Basterds"" is the only summer 2009 film I've seen (""Watchmen"" spoiled me, being an art-house cake with blockbuster frosting, and I think its' villain, Adrian Veidt, is probably Landa's nephew) and it's damn good one, being a throwback to dirty tough action films. Vive Tarantino!"

","This was one of the most suspenseful and exciting movies I have been to in a long time. For so much of the movie you are watching a scene unfold where you know the horrible end is coming, but you just don't know when and how. As the scene progresses you realize all the characters know the horrible end is coming, but they play along looking for the way out. What else can they do? I have never seen a film that captures the quiet terror of living with the enemy that the Resistance endured fighting the Nazis. I never felt that the film was slow or should have been edited. <br/><br/>A word about the criticisms.<br/><br/>Yes, it is bloody. Yes, it is full of violence.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","15","22 August 2009"," Tarantino in top form
","Major film critics unanimously hail this movie as Tarantino's best since ""Pulp fiction"", and for good reasons. While PF's ingenuity is unsurpassed, ""Inglorious basterds"" comes with a seasoned polish while retaining Tarantino's characteristic unpredictability.<br/><br/>While Nazi-occupied France provides an excellent platform for dramatic tension and espionage intrigue, Tarantino has a lot more to offer than a WWII or a spy movie. In terms of history, it is fictional fantasy or, put it more mildly, an alternative course of history in the realm of imagination. A very key theme here, however, is movie makers' love for making movies. Francois Truffaut made ""La nuit americaine"" (1973) about making movies, and for love of it. The culminating climax of PF is a ""German movie night"" attended by the top 4 Nazi leaders (including Hitler) and the plots (yes, there are 2 separate ones) to annihilate them, thereby ending the war (a welcomed alternate, fictional history). Let's back up a little. <br/><br/>With a retro opening (""The green leaves of summer"" playing hauntingly in the background) and retro ending credits shown in the good old ""dots and brackets"" presentation of the 50s and earlier, this 152 minutes movies is shown in 5 titled chapters. The first two are establishing sequences for, respectively, German security chief ""the Jew hunter"" Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz, a Cannes award-winning performance) and American Nazi hunter from the Smoky Mountains Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt, continuing his fun-seeking roles after ""Burn after reading""). So is Chapter 3, in establishing a third key character Shosanna Dreyfus (Melaine Laurent), a young French Jew who escaped 4 years ago from the claws of Landa while her family was massacred (in Chapter 1), now the owner of a small cinema in Paris. Towards the end of this chapter, the first plot thickens – to set fire on her own cinema which was to host the ""German movie night"" mentioned above, the event being organized by her young suitor and German war hero Federick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl). Chapter 4 picks up and completes the establishing scenes with the second plot, in which the British and Americans collaborate to plant bombs in the same event, for the same eventuality. It then continues onto the most intensely entertaining scene where double agent German actress Brigit von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) arranges a secret rendezvous in a bar between Raine and British spy Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) undercover as a German officer, which rendezvous was stumbled in by a sharp and suspecting SS agent. Chapter 5 bring it all together. <br/><br/>Before going to the characters, let me focus on a few special aspects of this movie. The best thing is the many individual scenes that take dramatic tension to a new height – not the blood-chilling type of tension as in the Coen Brothers' ""No country for old men"", but a playfully palpably tension that keeps jostling you off balance and eventually erupt into an abrupt outburst of violence. The very opening scene and the bar rendezvous scene mentioned above are the best, among many other good ones. The whole, however, is not as good as the parts. By the time it gets to Chapter 5, the movie has become so busy that it losses some of its charm.<br/><br/>As in many Tarantino movies, references to other movies are hurled at you continuously and you'd be a good, seasoned moviegoer if you can catch just a fraction. But even non-movie (many sub-cultural) references can be found in abundance, from Cinderella's shoes (with an ominous twist) to Sherlock Holmes' pipe (which is obviously unrecognized by Ms Manohola Dagris of New York Times, which goes to show that even the best have their limitations). <br/><br/>Most remarkable however, in the employment of English in an essentially foreign language (mainly French and German) film taking place in Nazi occupied France. We have seen how, in Judgment in Nuremberg (1961), German characters played by Burt Lancaster and Maximilian Schell start with German when they first appear in the movie and switch to English as a proxy language after a few sentences. In FB, the French and German characters in some key scenes switch to English because they want to converse in English, which comes across as a little awkward and even absurd. But Tarantino with his movie magic soon makes you believe in anything.<br/><br/>The billing of this movie in the English-speaking part of the world is very misleading. The true star is Waltz, who completely owns every scene he appears in, a most deserving Cannes Best Actor. Pitt is good, another hit in his continuing fun in seeking out non-main stream characters. Eli Roth as Landa's side-kick Sgt. Donny Donowitz does not have a co-star, or even major support role. While interesting and entertaining, it's a lesser role compared with at least half dozen other male supports that are played brilliantly by unknown (to the English-speaking world) German actors. For the women, only Diane Kruger is generally known to the average Hollywood fan. In this movie, she has a major support role for which her somewhat limited range of expressions (beautiful face notwithstanding) is quite adequate. The true star is Laurent, a beguiling mix of Shirley Jones innocence and Catherine Deneuve's sophistication. Under Tarantino's exquisite camera work, she is bewitchingly mesmerizing, especially in the last scene."

"alma-42","7","4","11","20 September 2009"," Despite the excessive runtime (a few minutes shy off 2.5 hours) there lingers a strange feeling that everything has been rushed up in a way.
","This is quite a long film. The premise and plot are both simple and straightforward. Save Waltz (Landa), there is nothing at all worth mentioning when it comes to performance, except perhaps Laurent (Shosanna) in a few of her scenes, especially the restaurant confrontation with Standartenführer Landa where she managed to form a living driving force only with her eyes and facial expressions.<br/><br/>Pitt (Raine) kept a cowboy accent and an annoying Marlon Brando imitation to the bitter end. Brühl (Zoller) played the classic méchant chevalier with an extra layer of innocence up to his last scene.<br/><br/>Music is nostalgic with many homage pieces, a characteristic of Tarantino's work.<br/><br/>At least two stand-off's occur to satisfy the director's passion for pasta; the first one is a three-way (Chapter Four) and the second one is a hit-miss-hit (Chapter Five.) Now I have to watch the film one more time when it goes on DVD to form an opinion on the cinematography and décor work. However, as far as it goes for a first watch, I cannot but fail to find any possibility for this title to achieve any honours (except for Christoph Waltz)-- there is almost no memorable pieces in the dialogue, and the performance of many actors sealed the film's fate, especially the flat performance of Pitt-Brando and the secondary high-ranking characters, notably Gruth (Goebbles) Wuttke (Hitler.) The other Germans did put up a not-so-bad performance though.<br/><br/>For a final verdict: An extremely boring, very Tarantino 'loan-y' film, with emphasis on tics, accents and speech patterns over any intelligent or comprehensible dialogue. Lukewarm, straightforward flat writing which favours in-scene slow tension-building over the overall progress of the story, again in a usual Tarantino style. The assassination scene (Chapter Five) and its build-ups turned out quite nicely though, in a genre-blending manner.<br/><br/>3 out of 6 (for Waltz' and some of Laurent's performances and the assassination scenes. The remaining 4 points to the 10 mark are reserved for cinematography.)"

Quentin Tarantino takes you on a roller-coaster ride, full of great shots, incredibly thrilling conversations and lots of unexpected plots. Although the length of the movie is above average, there no single boring moment in the movie, it continuously stays exciting. The actors in the movie do a formidable job especially Christoph Waltz as German Colonel Hans Landa and Sylvester Groth playing Goebbels in a formidable and funny way.

","While Quentin Tarantino's love for movies is unquestionable, Inglourious Basterds tops his previous efforts in genre revolution, tossing a whole of of ingredients together and mixing them up, and you'll be put into a mental dizzy just keeping track of the numerous odes, homages, and pure love for the cinema that Tarantino included in this film, a misnomer most definitely that this is anything but a WWII movie about a group of US-Jewish guerrilla soldiers inserted into enemy territory to strike fear through their inhumane ways of exterminating Hitler's army.<br/><br/>Told in chapters (which I felt could actually stand alone as short films) and running some 153 minutes, Inglourious Basterds isn't your father's war movie, where it's flat out action from end to end. In true Tarantino fashion, you've got to brace yourself for a lot, and I mean a whole lot of dialogues and conversations as only how Tarantino knows to craft in an engrossing, engaging fashion. While the violence and F-bombs have been considerably toned down, the way the characters interact, from egoistical monologues to a pair of lovebirds realizing their calling, from intense conversations to foolhardy game play around a table, are pure gold, with such talky scenes getting milked dry, before mayhem got unleashed akin to pressing the reset button, only to have the next chapter repeat itself stylistically all over again. I continue to stand amazed at how Tarantino fashions and crafts his dialogues.<br/><br/>If you're geared up for some rowdy action as the trailer made it out to be, then you'll be disappointed outright, since you don't really get to see the Basterds in action all the time, especially after that rousing speech by Lt Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) outlining the Basterds' mission, with the narrative fast-forwarding many years to the tail-end of the war. Not that I didn't mind of course, as there are a lot more going for the film, than a straight-out action whack fest, knowing Tarantino being at the helm.<br/><br/>And in Tarantino-verse, the chapters here are designed with a lot of precision, despite having a lot going for it. I especially enjoyed the opening, quite unconventional in a way, but what an introduction to the villain, played in such low key terms as it built up toward quiet revelation. The gem of the film is undoubtedly Christoph Waltz's chilling performance as Col. Hans Landa, aka The Jew Hunter, earning a reputation of always getting his man through extremely convincing techniques of interviews, interrogation and negotiations. Tarantino has crafted a highly complex villain, and I dare say the best amongst his stories thus far, who's always full of surprises for his enemies. A cunning linguist as well, he's tremendously gentlemanly in his demeanour, never betraying the sick and ruthless core hidden behind that shiny medal-filled uniform. Waltz is definitely worthy of all accolades coming his way by virtue of his sterling performance here.<br/><br/>The other scene which worked magically, was that in a tavern, where Lt Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) and Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger) meet up with double agent actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) to discuss plans for Operation Kino, only to be constantly interrupted by Major Dieter Hellstrom (August Diehl). What transpired is something that bordered on the hilarious, yet constantly teething on knife's edge given our heroes' bluff on the verge of being exposed. And with two Mexican stand offs done in Tarantino style, what more can you ask for as it continued being played out with pure glee.<br/><br/>The story arc of Shosanna Dreyfus may run typical of a revenge flick, where the victim swears vengeance over her once German hunter, but thanks to Melanie Laurent's luminous presence as Shosanna, it got elevated to a lot more as she held her own, allowing you to sympathize with her plight and steely resolve in her mission. This arc is also one of the most beautifully shot (especially the scenes in the movie theatre), having importance as the melting pot primed for regime change. Filled at every moment with nuggets of cinema information that only Tarantino can weave together in an engaging fashion, it even features a movie-in- movie directed by Eli Roth, who had also donned his acting hat as one of the Basterds.<br/><br/>Tarantino continues to leave his indelible mark on modern cinema, and like the final, permanent branding, this film has certainly served to be the masterpiece reflective of what he does best. Definitely worth repeated viewings just to lap up all the gems you've missed the first time round."
"venomfufu","7","4","11","17 September 2009"," Ehh
","Marvellous director, needless to say, this movie is geniously written. And the acting is just exquisite. I mean it is worth the money just to see the Nazi officers - the one getting killed by a baseball bat, the one in the pub with the accent ear and of course Hans Landa, probably one of the best performances you get to see in the cinematographic world.<br/><br/>But is this movie Tarantino's gift to the Jews or what the hell is wrong here? I mean.. this is probably something he did not intend, but this whole movie very, very much resembles the movie all the Nazi officers and leaders are watching in Shosanna's cinema. Just consider it, how all the Nazis sitting there are enjoying the mindless killing, and just look on the focus of how the Basterds enjoy killing Nazis, and the emphasis put into portraying it.<br/><br/>This I did not enjoy, since I was left with a feeling, that in order to enjoy this movie, I'd have to be same as a Nazi watching 'A Nation's Pride' (or a Jew watching Inglourious Basterds).<br/><br/>Just my two cents."
"bigfella2k1","9","4","11","8 September 2009"," Great End-Of-Summer Movie (mild spoilers)
","Had the fortune of seeing this the day after Labor day (furlough day) in an almost-empty theater. Loved the titles, the music, the storyline....Tarantino is already pretty well known for tense scenes but this movie is packed with them, and surprisingly less gore than expected, save for the last 10 minutes and the ""scalping"" scenes. One of the main action sequences the movie hinges on lasts only about 10 seconds of screen time, which gives the movie a great feeling of existing in real time, in the moment.<br/><br/>Great performances all around, especially Pitt (who seems to be playing a variation on his Thelma and Louise character) and Shoshona, the heroine and movie buff. By going against audience expectations (140 minutes of expletives and flying Nazi body parts), Tarantino creates one of his most fully imagined worlds yet. And I love the use of subtitles and the actors speaking primarily French or German (or bad Italian)- one of the characters even taunts the Americans for speaking only one language.<br/><br/>Entertaining completely. One of my favorite Tarantino movies, better than Jackie Brown, not quite as good as Pulp Fiction. A grower for sure."
"dewrules1001","10","4","11","4 September 2009"," I have a Jewish friend, I took him to see this movie, I hate Nazis, and apparently Brad Pitt does too.
","At the beginning of the movie it starts off with a German soldier coming up to this mans house. They begin to talk for a little bit and the German soldier questions the man if he is hiding any Jews? At first, the man said no. Then later on in the discussion he points out the exact spots under the floor boards where they are hiding. He was consider a traitor as said by my Jew friend. It started off as a dark, kind of depressing movie but you will be surprised what went on during the film. I thought this film was going to be like Defiance or Valkyrie (never saw any of them) but it wasn't. It was like a mixture of The Hangover and a war movie. For example, when Brad Pitt is pretending he's Italian. Brad Pitt says ""Bonjouro"" and that's definitely not Italian. He also said a little Spanish as he was pretending to be Italian as well. One of the main points of the movie was the 100 scalps the basterds needed. They got their 100 scalps I can say that. ""I imagine you gonna take off that Nazi uniform..."" Brad Pitt would carve the Nazi symbol into the foreheads of those he let live. He did this at the end of the movie was well to make a statement. Overall, this movie was amazing. One thing though, if you can't read, don't go see it because there are many times in the movie where they speak in German or French."

","I watched it yesterday and (not really a surprise there) it's really a great movie. the trailer promised a little more action than the actual film delivered, but thats OK. (kill bill 2 didn't have a lot of action and it worked just fine.) but i'd like to point out one aspect of the movie that really amazed me. being swiss, i'm very sensitive when it comes to German or French in American movies. i'm used to hearing awfully pronounced German lines in big Hollywood productions. i always say to myself come on, seriously? you couldn't afford a decent vocal coach, or do you simply give a f...? inglorious basterds is loaded with German and French and it sounds wonderful!!! what a pleasure! Quentin t, thank you for choosing German actors and by doing so making the movie a lot more authentic! he even jokes about the language problems by having brad Pitt killing the Italian word 'grazie'. hilarious! well, thats what i wanted to add to the (probably) hundreds of comments already existing. No need to point out the other good qualities of the movie, i'm sure thats already covers a dozens of times!"

","What a crafty sidebar to mix historical fact with ideological fiction. Who hasn't daydreamed about a world where Hitler was caught and brutally killed? As opposed of course to the limp dick fashion in which he actually checked out. What a beautiful fantasy to imagine all of the third Reich's principals bar-b-que'd in unison instead of slipping off to Argentina and anonymity.<br/><br/>Brilliant, that's the adjective best describing Tarantino's use of historic escapism embedded in this beautiful piece of cinema.<br/><br/>The acting is incredible, the sense of closure in the form of slaughtering one of the most heinous villains of history is brilliant, brilliant!"
"renedewaele","6","4","11","1 September 2009"," Another cool yet shallow film by Tarantino
","I understand the overly enthusiastic user reviews of this movie very well.. I was also 18 once and thoroughly enjoyed all of Tarantino's films. His characters, the conversations, the action were all very cool. And that seems to be the keyword in all of Tarantino's movies: cool. <br/><br/>However, when watching a film of war (or any movie for that matter), I'm interested to see what the director has to say on the subject - what is his philosophy on revenge for instance? This is where Tarantino's films suddenly become very boring, as they contain little more philosophy than, e.g. revenge is sweet. <br/><br/>The other thing that pisses me of, are the shallow characters in this film. After watching the movie's first scene, I thought this was going to be a great movie. The characters were excellent, the suspense was killing, and you felt this could actually have happened.. This was before the ""inglorious basterds"" entered the screen. What a waste - who were these bastards and where did they come from? Ironically, they spoiled the movie most. Had the movie been about the hunt (and revenge) of Shoshanna I think it would have been much more interesting. Now it became a slap-stick comedy like ""Allo Allo"" where the Germans were simply ridiculed. 6/10."
"tj19","9","4","11","24 August 2009"," ""Basterds"" was worth the wait.
","The man who brought us ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"", and ""Kill Bill"" has finally brought his highly-anticipated WWII film, ""Inglourious Basterds"" to the screen. Quentin Tarantino lives up to the hype in his highly-stylized, albeit not so factual, war epic with the intertwining stories of a Nazi-detective (Cristoph Waltz), a Jewish-French survivor (Mélanie Laurent), and a group of misfit, Jewish-American soldiers also know as The Basterds (Brad Pitt and company). The Basterds are focused on one thing and one thing only: ""Killing Nat- zis."" The opening scene takes place in 1940 French farm country, where Col. Hans Landa (played by a vicious and brilliant Cristoph Waltz) has arrived on a family's farm who he believes is sheltering Jews. The scene is a long one, filled with Tarantino the witty Tarantino dialogue we came to love. As the end of the scene nears, Mr. Tarantino gives us the chills with the eery music and the inevitable climax (yes the scene itself has a climax!) that is about to unfold, and we see the true evil of Waltz's Col. Hans Landa and his Nazi brethren. If Cristoph Waltz doesn't get an Oscar nomination, I will be greatly surprised. At the end of the first scene, we see a girl escape (Mélanie Laurent) Landa's Jew-massacre, who will vow revenge on the Nazis who killed her family. Next we see The Basterds, led by the hilarious Brad Pitt. He lets he and his fellow soldier's ""distaste"" for Nazis and their leader be known. The stories of Shoshanna, Col. Landa, and The Basterds all collide in the final scenes of the film, and it is both literally and figuratively explosive! I'm not going to give anything else away, but the rest of the ""Inglourious Basterds"" delves into the sick and brilliant mind of Tarantino, who gives us one hell of a stylish and unique interpretation of WWII. The acting is amazing, Brad Pitt was meant to be Lt. Aldo Raine, and is comical to the last. Critoph Waltz gives an Oscar-worthy and menacing performance of one of the greatest villains in film history. Our leading ladies (Laurent and Kruger) fit well into the story and dazzle in their respective roles. Tarantino definitely puts his stamp on both the script and in the direction, as the viewer sees and hears many songs, lines, and stylish undertones that they have seen in previous Tarantino films. ""Inglorious Basterds"" is not for everyone. It is a gory, biased, and non-factual WWII film. Many will be turned off by the nonfactual accounts of the film but then I guess that means that those people must hate the ""Indiana Jones"" films as well... However, if you have seen and liked Tarantino's other films than you'll be just fine. If you have not liked Tarantino's other films, I'm puzzled as to why you would watch this in the first place, because you will hate it. The running time is a tad long and some of the scenes are paced a little to slow, but all in all, ""Basterds"" delivers and it delivers more than well. Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a glorious masterpiece and is the best film of 2009 thus far. It's heavy and stylized action and witty dialogue shock and make us laugh all at the same time. ""Basterds"" was worth the wait and I'll add it to my collection of other Tarantino masterpieces when it comes out on DVD. ""Basterds"" is a movie-lover's movie and does not disappoint.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 stars."
"JackBenjamin","9","4","11","24 August 2009"," Basterd within the Basterd
","I thought this was brilliant. Tarantino is a wonderful stylist. He captivates with perfectly framed shots, rich colors, a choreographed camera eye. These scenes dance around like a leaf in the wind, slow, steady, then swooping in a direction you couldn't predict, much like the story does.<br/><br/>He seems to be getting a lot of flack for his mistreatment of history. Wasn't ""Pearl Harbor"" more egregious? Wasn't ""World Trade Center""? I think Jews -- and I am one -- will get a lot of pleasure from watching this movie. A lot.<br/><br/>The real genius here though is the crafting of the story. Five acts, each seemingly unrelated until they slowly converge and meet at the end, in, of all places, a movie theater. QT is always self-referential, his films are always self-aware, but this one more than most. The top Nazis are caricatures. Goebbles is a diva with a poodle. Hitler is a guffawing baboon. The film within the film is the type of film that QT is perennially accused of making. So here we are, us, watching these idiots laugh and cry at this moronic movie about empty, brutal killing as we, us, laugh and cry at QT's movie about empty, brutal killing. A slap in all our faces. And it feels great.<br/><br/>Tarantino is the real basterd. He basterdizes history, he truncates morality, he throws away formula, killing off whichever characters caprice seems to want. His morality is cinema. That's his shrine. That's his sacrificial temple where the battle between heaven and earth takes place. The film is maybe 5% action and violence, 95% suspense. Wonderfully crafted suspense. He dismisses rhythm in favor of chaos so you forget what you've been attuned to expect from a movie, and once your eye starts wandering in this wilderness of un-expectation he hits you with whatever he wants.<br/><br/>Brad is the top-billed, but I doubt he has the most dialogue. Waltz is the real star of the film, and behind that, Tarantino the scribe and Tarantino the director.<br/><br/>Behind each movie screen is a pile of combustible film reels waiting to consume us. QT has lit the fire behind this one. I loved it."
"leiser18","10","4","11","23 August 2009"," Ingenious
","I am not a Tarantino fan. As a matter of fact, I hated Pulp Fiction and I haven't seen any of his other movies until now. Watching this film could possible change my mind about Quentin. Inglorious Basterds was superbly written and acted. It's a fantasy and action flick all rolled into one incredibly well done film. The fact that the Nazi elite, including Hitler, didn't really die in the fiery blast, makes me wish that the movie version were true. What imagination! I loved the fact that the actors spoke their own languages, which made it more real. Christoph Waltz's performance deserves an Oscar! And Bratt Pitt was fantastic, southern drawl and all, y'all! This is a movie worth seeing more than once. Ten Points!"
"tim-mcgreevy","10","4","11","23 August 2009"," Another incredibly entertaining film from Tarantino
","I don't even know where to begin. Quentin's style oozes from every scene in this film. Once again he breaks all the rules of what is expected of a major Hollywood film and does so with style. His quirky, odd sense of the way things should be keeps this film fresh for the entire 2 1/2 hours it plays. Perfect choice of actors, scenery, violence, humor and action. He uses several languages in this film, but the subtitles never seem to get in the way of important action scenes. His sets are incredibly believable, even stunning at times. I don't want to sound as though I'm in love with the man, but I find his movies to be refreshingly different. With all the horrible movies this summer that rely only on special effects and bad acting, this is a must see. Hollywood needs more Tarantino types. It would get me in theaters a little more often."
"max von meyerling","7","4","11","8 August 2009"," How I Won The Weird
","INGLORIOUS BASTERDS might be the weirdest big budget studio released film I have ever seen. Though it looks like a WW2 movie Tarantino disagrees and says that it isn't a WW2 movie at all, I guess in the same vein of Magritt's painting of a pipe C'nest pa une pipe. This is not a documentary Tarantino says relieving him of the burden of historical authenticity, anachronism and accuracy. There are many arguments in Tarantino's favor (he ends the war and kills off Hitler in Paris nine months early). Most films are unhistorical in direct proportion to the remoteness of the subject. Recently I saw this Hallmark version of MARCO POLO and it was like an insane man's version of reality. But who knows or cares. ONE MILLION B.C. move to the front. Westerns are notoriously anachronistic, even recent ones like Blake Edward's SUNSET which perversely turns all of the facts 180 degrees. These are not documentary's after all. IB has been preceded by Jerry Lewis' codeine drenched WHICH WAY TO THE FRONT (1970) and WHAT DID YOU DO IN THE WAR DADDY? (1966) This film was written by one of the worst comedy writers ever, whose scripts must have looked hilarious on the page to executives with no sense of humor. These films are basically time travel films where modern day people are thrust onto a period set in rented costumes and play out a made up story. Everybody speaks in English and putting on a Nazi uniform and pretending to be a high ranking officer is the de rigor scene in every film. It's not abut WW2, its about two hours. Its only a movie. As long as you can get punters to accept the premise you're home free. High school cute kids playing medieval knights with a David Bowie soundtrack, nothing new. The difference is that most educated people know how WW2 ended but few know how the Third Crusade ended. What Tarantino has done is place WW2 in the same remote territory as every other ""historical"" film.<br/><br/>Most of these films (WHAT, WHICH) are negligible because of the Ed Wood factor, their meanness of spirit matched by a meanness of creation. What's shocking about Tarantino's film is that it is fluidly cinematic and masterly made. I recently saw SECRET MISSION (1944) about a clandestine British mission in France. It was a wartime flag waver that everyone took seriously at the time, as if, yup, this is the way it is or near to it. Now of course we've all seen better films on the subject, endless documentary's on the Hitler (History) channel and memoirs and biographies and Ph.D. studies and obituaries and we know better. I now realize that a favorite Brit-com of mine 'ALLO! 'ALLO, made 40 years later, was nothing but a broad parody of an absurd pretend rendition of reality. It's set in WW2 but not any real WW2. The ridiculousness is obvious now but today we know better. When it comes to IB we don't even care anymore. It's only a movie, an alternative reality anyway so don't sweat the history.<br/><br/>So the environment occupied by IB is acceptable as a fantasy, a place to play in and to make a movie in. The big problem for me was one of tone. Nearly every extended scene seems to occupy a different logical environment. One scene is played for comedy the next for horror the next for melodrama and are paced for their singular needs. And some seem to exist solely as a set piece.The opening title ""Once Upon a Time in Nazi-Occupied France"", coupled with Ennio Morricone's music evokes not a fairy tale but a continuation of the Maestro's work, Sergio Leone. One might expect sparse dialog and action sequences or maybe even burlesques of action sequences and a story of emotions driven by image and music. Alas the script features dramatic set pieces consisting of dialog and situation to drive the story. It's strangely static for long stretches. BTW the music has mostly been adapted from the soundtracks of other films, dozens of other films.<br/><br/>A word about Brad Pitt's performance-He pulls some excellent Clark Gable faces and I couldn't but picture him as Dillinger. Lost performance.<br/><br/>I usually am not concerned with such things as opening week-end box office and the like but I wonder how this will go down with the general public. I don't think the anachronisms will offend the greater audience but they don't care about period films at all. In terms of commercial bonanzas this might rank with Colorization and synthetic movie stars of the past. Very interesting. But pointless.<br/><br/>P.S. It might be churlish of me to mention this considering how thickly the anachronistic broth bubbles but surely the Jewish ""Bear"" who bashes out Nazi brains with a baseball bat would seek to emulate Hank Greenberg rather than the goyish Ted Williams."

","If you love Quentin Tarantino's style, Inglorious Basterds is going to be an absolute treat for you. It's widely considered by many, even Tarantino himself, to be his ""masterpiece"" or his best since Pulp Fiction, and it is absolutely, undoubtedly worthy of such praise.<br/><br/>The dialogue here is arguably sharper than it has ever been - even Pulp Fiction has a couple minutes worth of conversation within it that aren't particularly entertaining, as only one scene in this film failed to completely hold my interest, and that is quite possibly the shortest scene in here! Every other moment of IB manages to completely hook you and draw you into the world, whether it's the vibrant Brad Pitt making you laugh, or the scene stealer Christoff Waltz making you anxious, with Tarantino crafting some of his most memorable characters and using dialogue in this film to fuel the suspense, making conversations that go on for 20 or 30 minutes worth of screen time a never-ending spiral of anxiety that reaches a satisfying peak each time.<br/><br/>The performances and writing are even more worthy of applause considering a great deal of the movie is spoken in another language, an element of war that other directors choose to ignore, but which Tarantino uses as a tool for suspenseful storytelling and sequences, fixing an issue which we didn't really know we had as an audience. As Tarantino so eloquently put it, other films ""have this opportunity for a great scene, but you're pissing it away by having German be English"".<br/><br/>It also offers a great deal of memorable Tarantino moments, including a tense 20 minute opening, a baseball bat, quite possibly the longest bar scene known to man, and an ending that doesn't limit itself with what really happened throughout history.<br/><br/>As a result, while Pulp Fiction may be a more iconic and witty flick, IB is the Tarantino film I think about most, from the characters, to the conversations, to the ending, to the direction, if you weren't already obsessed with Tarantino, Inglorious Basterds has a good shot at changing that."

","To me Mr. Tarantino is a strange and an odd entity. As a director of his movies, he's pretty good, but as everything else ... I've watched this one for the third time now and am finally ready to write a review. Where do I start? He's unpredictable at storytelling. Sometimes good, sometimes bad and sometimes unbearable horrific, the basic problem being - he does not know how to finish the story/movie so he abruptly just stops. Or, as in this case, invents some fictitious plot, thus prolonging the ""experience"" for at least one unnecessary hour. Otherwise good actors (except for Mr. Waltz who never performs bad, no matter what) perform horribly as on purpose. Like in exploitation movies. In this movie the ""good guys"" are presented as in the title, being no better than their enemy. Mocking? Not sure. Anyway, the story, editing, acting (mostly) and all other stuff sucks big-time. A lot of idling mixed with some graphic violence. If this movie is ""just a movie"", with no message/moral and for entertainment purpose only, it may pass (but shorter, at a 100 to 120 minutes rate). Just as Wolfenstein game. You play it, laugh (or not) at jokes, kill everything that moves and sleep well. In all other cases, it's a waste of time and fail. So, you decide what to do with it. Mr. Waltz is excellent. Everything else - a cartoon. Not to be mixed for good taste's sake. I'm not going to watch it ever again."

","Like all of Tarrantino's films, he's really making a movie about movies, or about a type of movie. Inglourious Basterds is by far my favorite, and it's about war propaganda films. <br/><br/>I realized a long while ago that there were two important, yet distinct, types of ways to enjoy this movie. There are those who get excited at the prospect of seeing ""our boys"" kick Nazi @$$, and there are those who realize that is exactly how a propaganda film wants you to feel. It's more harmless today, since the actual Nazi party is a thing of the past, but it is important to realize that this film is trying to make get us to realize that we have selected a category of person and we generally tend to glorify subjecting them to horrific levels of violence.<br/><br/>Much like with fairy tales, it is important to ask when watching a movie ""Why does the movie think violence against this person is justified?"" Why is it okay for Rumplestiltskin to be ripped in half, or the witch in Hansel and Gretle to be burned alive? Why is it okay for Omar to fill the collaborating French interpreter with as many bullets as they do to the higher ranking members of the Nazi party?<br/><br/>To counter the inevitable person who thinks I'm reading too much into it, recall that the film premiere at the end is a fictional Nazi war propaganda film, where Zoller slaughters close to 250 people in front of a laughing, cheering, and energized audience. Hitler laughs at dying Americans in much the same mood that we might have earlier laughed when Donowitz bashed in a soldier's head with a bat.<br/><br/>Again I am impressed with Tarrantino's ability to write lengthy dialogue scenes about topics as mundane as glasses if milk and King Kong which are nerve-wrackingly suspenseful due to their context."
"jakebirkel","9","2","4","13 August 2018"," Not a fan of Tarantino, but I can't argue with this!
","I'm going to be honest, I haven't been a fan of Quentin Tarantino's work. Most of the time, it's just too much. Django Unchained (2012)? This movie played it nearly perfect though.<br/><br/>Tarantino's writing captures logic, thought, and, most of all, suspense in a way that few have. It's an excellent piece of satire with some of the most expertly written scenes I have ever seen. The opening scene might be my favorite opening scene of all time. The story was great, as was the plotting. <br/><br/>The performances are all around great. No surprise that Christopher Waltz sticks out the most in the cast. He definitely deserved his Oscar for his work done here. He plays Colnel Hans perfectly.<br/><br/>Tarantino's direction seems more confident here. And it reflects his own writing perfectly. Props to you, Quentin!<br/><br/>The production design is actually quite well done, surprised nobody pointed that out. It's something that seems glossed over but, for some reason, really stuck out to me.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: Don't watch this with your kids. Very gory and mature at several points.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a 9/10. Very well done."

","Inglorious Basterds is one of my all time favorite movies, right up there with Pulp Fiction and The Godfather. It is brilliantly written, directed, and acted (Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent are incredible.) All the main characters have depth and their true manipulations don't fully come to light until the climax. Language barriers play a major part in this film with French, German and English all spoken regularly throughout the film, and Tarantino's decision to change history will always be remembered for years and years to come."

The production team made the actors only resemble enough as to hint at the historical characters. I laughed my rear off reading the uninspired reviews and tantrums.

","'INGLORIOUS BASTERDS' was directed by Quentin Tarantino and stars Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Melanue Laurent. ​It is the first year of Germany's occupation of France. Allied officer Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) assembles a team of Jewish soldiers to commit violent acts of retribution against the Nazis, including the taking of their scalps. He and his men join forces with Bridget von Hammersmark, a German actress and undercover agent, to bring down the leaders of the Third Reich. Their fates converge with theatre owner Shosanna Dreyfus, who seeks to avenge the Nazis' execution of her family.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds is a fantastic war movie. No it is not overrated. It is rated perfectly as far as I'm concerned and is one of Tarantino's best movies. Christoph Waltz is god damn incredible in this movie and provides a truly chilling, milk obsessed villain that will go down in the greatest of cinema. I'm not exaggerating. Tarantino was at his best with this retelling of history. You know what, screw it. This IS how WW2 went down. Tarantino has convinced me of that. I defy anyone to prove me otherwise!<br/><br/>Let me break it down how incredible this movie is. The story is a genius intertwining of two entirely separate stories that mould into one during a simple five chapter story. This movie is so well written that it changed history. Tarantino convinced me that this was exactly how WW2 went down. The ending is perfect and mirrors the entire movie as a whole. Well done Tarantino, you done did good!<br/><br/>To top of the excellent story, we have a stellar star studded cast to pimp out Tarantino's epic war movie. Honestly, if Christoph 'The Milkman' Waltz didn't at least get NOMINATED for an Oscar in this movie, I would have started a riot. This was probably one of the best performances in modern movie history and sends shivers down your spine. If one man can make me fear him for ordering a glass of milk, he deserves the Oscar trophy to be redesigned after him. Accompanying Walkz' Hans Landa is Brad Pitt's awesome Aldo Raine who, while having a smaller role than expected, elevated the movie above it's previous pedestal and made me think of Brad Pitt whenever I think of WW2. The jury is still out on whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. Diane Kruger was also great as Bridger Von Hammersmark as was Michael Fassbender as Archie Hirox and Daniel Brühl as the creepy Frederick Zoller. Melanie Laurent was good as Shossana Dreyfus. Martin Wuttke was on steroids or something as Adolf Hitler. Despite possible drug use, he was great as the most evil man to grace this Earth; good look adding that to your resume. <br/><br/>This movie is also nearly technically flawless. The effects were great and the inclusion of blood and gore was, while not necessary, a welcome addition that was the definition of Tarantino style. I will say, however, that some shots and scenes were overly comical and it took me out of the movie for a brief short moments. <br/><br/>One minor, minuscule gripe is with the dialogue. Not to say it was bad, it wasn't but the movie is VERY dialogue heavy and due to the majority of it being in foreign languages, it could sometimes be difficult too keep up with the subtitles and could be sometimes frustrating to decipher what was being said. Probably not an issue for many but was certainly one for me.<br/><br/>You can dislike this movie all you want, I don't care. But if you dare say this movie was made up and FICTIONAL(?), I will hunt you down and... I dunno... order a glass of milk... and then shoot your floor. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie, it will change your perception on history and is honestly just an amazing war movie that will stand the test of time."
"rsvpdavid","10","2","4","4 October 2015"," The 1-star reviewers are the REAL Nazis
","I must admit when I saw the preview for ""Inglorious Basterds"" I gave myself big expectations. THIS FILM DID NOT Disappoint. It only won one Oscar but deserved, at least, another. <br/><br/>I have to say I am a little biased towards Quentin, I grew up with ""Pulp Fiction."" I watched it when I was 12 and it is still my favorite and most influential film.<br/><br/>However, since then Quentin has not really lived up to his billing. His style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar, the quality honestly wasn't there (I never watched Jackie Brown, and then there's Grindhouse). That is until ""Inglorious Basterds."" What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre, a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but seeing how Leone is dead, Tarantino's the self appointed guy on this masterpiece.<br/><br/>So let's look at the movie. The writing was spot on, a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie. Not to mention this movie was set up in the classic Tarantino mold, great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action.<br/><br/>The acting was superb!! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, seriously. I don't say that often, but honestly the man should get one for this movie, he spoke every language in this movie, and delivered with such amazing touch and poise. He stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive.<br/><br/>I have no problem building this movie up, because this movie is the best film I've seen all year, and probably all of next year. Quite frankly the more I think about it, this movie may crack my top films of all time, and is Quentin's best movie since ""Pulp Fiction."" Take it from me, watch this film. I loved it doesn't do this movie enough justice.<br/><br/>For any one-star reviewer who is a Nazi sympathizer I say the following: Hitler killed himself like a PUSSY in a dirty, damp basement after he LOST and destroyed his own country. Get over it. Get a job.<br/><br/>I watched it yesterday and I'm still blown away. Thank you Quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie. You're back on top again. I can't say enough for ""Inglorious Basterds!"""
"donuthaters12","10","2","4","14 January 2014"," Risky, Unique, Fresh, And Fun
","Many people regarded Death Proof as a disappointment and they were all hoping that Tarantino will come back to his best form in his next film, though I did think highly of Death Proof, and what a come back he did. Inglourious Basterds is his 6th film and it shows Tarantino going back to the things that made his film great whilst doing something unique.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is written by Quentin Tarantino, and he has definitely made something fantastic here. Tarantino here has brought back the non-linear approach to his storytelling. He dedicates the first three chapters of the film as an introduction to the key players of the last chapter, and having the 4th Chapter 'Operation Kino' as the driving plot point. It kept me hooked because with each chapter, as he adds on more information that we didn't know which builds it all up for the last two chapters of the film. The film shows off entertaining and quirky characters, which hasn't been found in his films since his 90's flicks. Tarantino has given his characters much more depth here than most of his previous films would give, and he continuous it with his next film, and it does allow me to connect with these characters more and understand their inner workings due to their given back-stories. The dialogue in this film is top notch, at times very reminiscent of the style that was used for Pulp Fiction, as it kept me more interested as more words come out from these characters. To some people, they may see it as a return to Tarantino's indulgent style of dialogue but that's what makes his films special in the first place, so the more the better.<br/><br/>Not at all did the film bore me, this is because Tarantino is in love with his own dialogue and he makes it the star of the scene. Tarantino fills the scene with dialogue, as a build up of sorts towards the violent and explosive ending that the scene needs in order to be relieved and pumped for what comes next. As I said before the non-linear storytelling of the film and using the bulk of the film to create and introduce it's characters, it doesn't get boring as it doesn't repeat itself and always give off something new. Some people find a lot of Tarantino's films to have a pacing problem and I can understand where they are coming from, but Inglourious Basterds is one of those films that felt like it moves forwards all the time regardless how still a scene may seem because it keeps throwing interesting things your way and in a lot of scenes, Tarantino was able to convey tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat thinking something might happen. Tarantino has used non-English dialogue with subtitles in his previous films, Kill Bill, and now he has put that up front with this film, using it as a style in making this film unique and allowing the film to feel more genuine.<br/><br/>Robert Richardson is back to do another of Tarantino's film and with each film I start to see a connection and understanding of each other's visions. Richardson understands what the film needs to create that homage atmosphere that Tarantino intends his films to look like. Richardson and Tarantino has brought back their trademark shots like long takes and the trunk shot. Because this film is a dialogue driven film, Richardson contains a lot more closeups than his previous films and this does allow us to get in touch with these characters and see the emotional rumblings that they hide behind the facade due to the current situation, especially Melanie Laurent's character. The film's photography seems to strip away the over saturation of it's colors, like Kill Bill and Death Proof, and takes a more darker and grimier look for the film.<br/><br/>The film doesn't contain a composer writing an original score, instead it uses soundtracks that are more score driven. The tracks that are chosen are Sergio Leone/Ennio Morricone inspired, which on paper would be an odd choice as it suits more of the Western era but after seeing this film, you hardly even notice it and at the end you realize that it actually works. There are specific moments that are supported by a track that makes the moment seem perfect but Tarantino has the habit of cutting it off and not giving the scene a proper conclusion, which gives off a comedic feel and prevents it from being too melodramatic.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt may be seen as the frontrunner of the film but the film is more of an ensemble piece. The first three chapters are dedicated to a certain character(s), and this allows these actor(s) to shine in their segments. Brad Pitt definitely brings a surge of energy in this film, working with a character that feels almost specifically written for him. The other standout was Christoph Waltz, playing a character that has a personality that I have haven't seen before. Waltz brings such charm and personality to a character that is regarded by most people as the ultimate Jew killer. Tarantino has used an international cast before but not as diverse as this film. Inglourious Basterds has made a star and showcased the talents of actors like Melanie Laurent and Daniel Bruhl. Though Michael Fassbender has been on films before this like 300 but this film put him on the map, the bar scene segment was tense and thrilling and a part of it is due to Fassbender's performance.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is a remarkable film and a demonstration of Tarantino's ability to take something that has been used a billion times in films and make it feel fresh and unique. The film boasts wonderful dialogue, amazing sequences, fantastic performances front actors, smart choice of music, and excellent photography. Inglourious Basterds is a rival for the number one spot for my favorite Tarantino films."
"aabaciu","7","2","4","30 December 2013"," Tarantino is a Nazi in denial
","This movie tries to ""empower"" the good guys with the wicked means of the enemy (the Nazis in this case). This IMO is insulting to the people who actually fought those \nazi bastards.<br/><br/>I think Tarantino is your average repressed sadistic white male who can't come to peace with his own intrinsic sadism and thus needs to pretend like he's actually being altruistic when portraying Jews as vicious killers who are basically behaving no better than the Nazis. The same thing he did with Django unchained only there we had black people behaving just as bad as white slavers. <br/><br/>What pisses me of is that he won't admit it. He won't admit that he's just as evil as all the white men who committed horrible atrocities in the past and he desperately feels the need to bring Jews and blacks to that same level so that he may feel better about his own whiteness. <br/><br/>It's OK, Quentin, just admit who you are! People will understand. We'll still watch your movies! Just spare yourself the pain man, it's OK."
"mykesmessages","8","2","4","11 December 2013"," This film takes place during World War II, in France while it is occupied by Nazi's (IMBD, 2009).
","This film takes place during World War II, in France while it is occupied by Nazi's (IMBD, 2009). The allies, primarily the U.S. and England, put a plan in motion to assassinate the German high command, including Hitler, and Joseph Goebbels, the Minister of Nazi propaganda (IMDB, 2009). While they attend a movie premier gala for a movie called, Nations Pride. The allied assassination plan, calls for using a squad that specializes in guerilla warfare, led by a notorious sergeant and made up of Jewish-Americans, called the Inglorious Basterds (IMDB, 2009). By happenstance, the allied mission is set to occur at the same time as another plot conceived by the theater owner, Shoshanna, who is Hebrew and the lone survivor of the massacre of her family (IMDB, 2009). This plot is about revenge for her.<br/><br/>The movie stars Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raines, and Eli Roth as Sgt. Donny Donowitz. The primary supporting cast is Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna, Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark, Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa, a detective of the Waffen-SS, also known as the ""Jew Hunter"", and finally, Daniel Brühl as Fredrick Zoller (IMDB, 2009). There are lots of action and violence scenes in the plot, mixed in with more sophisticated types of acting (Boggs, Petrie, 2008). One central theme in this movie is the struggle for human dignity, which is emphasized primarily through the plot of the movie, and particularly in Shosanna (Boggs, Petrie, 2008). Through the character of Shosanna the theme of the struggle for human dignity is vividly demonstrated because of the lengths she has to go through to survive, and because she was willing to lay down her life to end German conquest of Europe (IMDB, 2009). Many of Shosanna's scenes interacting with Fredrick Zoller, the star of Nations Pride, are examples of the sophisticated acting mentioned above (Boggs, Petrie, 2008). Because she is Jewish and has assumed an alias of ""Emmanuelle Mimieux"", she cannot reveal just how much she hates Zoller and Nazi's (IMDB, 2009). It is through her body language, facial expressions, and how she handles a cigarette in one scene, which reveals just how contemptuous she is of Zoller and any that, hate Jewish people (Boggs, Petrie, 2008). In the café scenes with Colonel Hans Landa, the man that slaughtered her family, her eyes giveaway just how terrified and loathsome she is of Nazi's and him in particular. <br/><br/>The use of camera angles, which were primarily subjective in this movie, empathized, not only the intensity of the action, but also the emotional mood, and inner thinking of many of the characters (Boggs, Petrie, 2008). For instance, in Chapter One, Colonel Landa visits a French dairy farmer, named Perrier LaPadite (IMBD, 2009). While having a tension loaded conversation in French with LaPadite, the camera angle starts out as objective, keeping them in frame (Boggs, Petrie, 2009). As the tension builds, however, the camera angle slowly becomes powerfully subjective, first showing the perspective of Colonel Landa's, from behind and over his shoulder, looking at the humble and terrified LaPadite (Boggs, Petrie, 2008). Then slowly, painstakingly so, which intensifies the tension, the camera angle rotates to the perspective of LaPadite, giving the audience the perspective of being LaPadite and facing the menacing Colonel Landa (Boggs, Petrie, 2009). This kind of subjective use of camera angles and perspective is used very effectively throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Other effective techniques used in this film are the settings and costume and makeup (Boggs, Petrie, 2008). The production of the settings and costume and makeup lend this movie a degree of creditability that should thoroughly suspend disbelief in all but the harshest of critiques (Boggs, Petrie, 2008). Given that this film is a period piece the staging and costumes and makeup had to be impeccable and come across as believable, which both did (Boggs, Petrie, 2008). In particular, the military uniforms of both the U.S. and German personnel were excellent. <br/><br/>Another film that may come to mind while watching this movie is Defiance. Both movies highlight the Jewish struggle for human dignity against Nazi Germany (Boggs, Petrie, 2008). And both of these films are excellent examples of this genre and each conveys just how terrifying this struggle was for the Jewish people. Defiance, seemed more historically accurate than Inglorious Basterds, but both are well worth watching!"
"xjbkelly","8","2","4","18 November 2013"," Spoiler Alert.
","To be given prior warning that Quentin Tarantino is a master of the offbeat genre of movie making still doesn't quite prepare you for this classic,where deciding who is good, will test your average moral expectations. It is 1943, the Allies have yet to land in Europe as German bad guy Col. Hans Landa aka the Jew hunter ( Christoph Waltz), strikes panic into the hearts of the local village communities with his charming smile and relentless interrogation technique. A pretty young French-Jewish girl, Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) escape s his merciless execution of her family, and establishes a new identity as a cinema owner. Simultaneously, an Allied plan is enacted sending a small squad of American-Jewish soldiers into occupied France to create an atmosphere of terror and havoc by killing Nazis. American Army Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) leads this scalp hunting, head splitting, band of brothers across France, frustrating a comic styled Hitler and narcissistic Josef Goebbels as The Fuehrer and his Propaganda minister prepare to launch a major cinematic misinformation program in a small French village theater. Raine, whose artistic embedding of the swastika into the foreheads of his victims using a Bowie knife, is an inspiration to his troops as they bludgeon their captives to death with baseball bats. After a bloody shootout in the basement of a side-walk café, he meets up with film star and undercover Operative Bridget Von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger). Together they plot the demise of the German High Command at Goebbels' lavish film premier, unaware that it will be held at the theater owned by Nazi hater, Shosanna Dreyfus and her black French lover, who have devised a deadly plan of their own. The film is rich in dark humor and there are moments in-between the violence where you want to laugh but the uncertainty of what might come next, holds you back. Christoph Waltz gives a chilling performance as Hitler's SS detective Landa, such that watching him enjoy a glass of milk in a farmhouse while his subject sits inwardly terrified, or in a restaurant eating apple pie and cream with such poise and refinement while he interrogates the placid Shosanna, leaves you holding your breath and willing her to withstand the mental pressure. Brad Pitt clearly enjoys his character's easy going, lay back style complete with a southern Tennessee twang and his not-quite-there appreciation of the moment, giving us some occasional and cherished moments of comedic respite in the middle of the sadistic manner in which his character Raine, pursues his mission. Claiming an Apache bloodline, Raine chills the blood of the ordinary German soldier at the mention of his name, and his hapless victims shudder at the thought of capture. In return he grants them no quarter. It is, however, the demure and so-lady-like nature of Mélanie Laurent's character Shosanna Dreyfus, and the devastating nature of her plan for retribution that grips you, as she plots against the German hierarchy, and deals with the unwanted advances of a young German war hero, Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl). 'Inglourious Basterds', is Tarnatino at his very best, with continual action, never a dull moment and a musical score that carries the viewer along at varying speeds whether we like it or not. Cameo appearances by Mike Myers and Australian actor, Rod Taylor almost unrecognizable as Winston Churchill are just another example of Tarantino's eccentric cinematic mind working overtime. While his critics will find flaws in some scenes, only the most fastidious nit-picking for whatever reason could betray this thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking classic. Comparisons with earlier features such as 'The Dirty Dozen' are a waste of time. This film stands alone in creative genius, cinematography and outrageous script writing, and one wonders what Tarantino is dreaming up in the dark recesses of his mind, to top it. Completely absent are the street combat, crumbled buildings, hand to hand fighting and tank battles one expects of a war film; some scenes such as the meeting of the boyish war hero Zoller and Shosanna outside her theater after the evening's performance are positively refreshing when set against the harsh realities of an Occupation army. Their exchanges give us a moment to experience some peace and sanity in a fractious world before returning to the brutality we know is just around the corner. Following the fiery climax at the premier, the final scene in the forest where Raine's Bowie knife cuts deep into Lando's plans for a safe retirement leave us uncertain for the future of both men and the world at large. This is not a film for the faint-hearted or those who struggle with erratic time-lines that zig-zag backwards and forwards telling a complicated, interwoven tale not quite consistent with historical realities. One has to keep in mind that with Tarantino we are dealing with a seductively wicked imagination and a penchant for re-writing history the way he thinks it should have happened."
"tracytucciarone","3","2","4","10 June 2013"," What a Shame
","I have a great fondness for Tarantino. ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Jackie Brown"" (his best, in my opinion), ""Django Unchained"" -- all good stuff, especially the first three. I even enjoyed the ""Kill Bill"" movies. But this -- it's almost unadulterated rot. I say *almost* unadulterated because Waltz was great. He is, though, pretty much the only thing in this movie worth watching aside from the opening chapter. Though the latter went on a tad too long, it was nicely suspenseful and well-filmed.<br/><br/>But that great opening and Waltz's performance don't make up for the rest of the film. My biggest issue is that the morality of the movie is way, way off. It's pathological. I'm speaking as a fan of ""Reservoir Dogs"" here, so it's not violence per se that's problematic for me. I mean, it's one thing to see bad guys blow each other up, or to see good guys deal with the bad guys while having some heart about it; it's another thing to see what are supposed to be the ""good guys"" engaging in torture and mayhem, with our being asked to identify with it and cheer them on. I found it pretty disgusting, quite frankly. Scalping? Carving swastikas into people's foreheads? (so much for recognizing the possibility of redemption) Bottom line: the Nazis were shown as having a lot more integrity, honor, and soul than the Jewish ""heroes"" here, and I doubt that that's what Tarantino meant to convey.<br/><br/>Tarantino's movies are almost always, at least, interesting both visually and in terms of dialogue, but in this movie, there's no evidence of that. Conversations go on and on. And on. And in four different languages. Sheesh! Subtitles work for movies like ""Dances with Wolves"" or ""The Passion of the Christ,"" but in a Tarantino-style, darkly comedic revenge flick, what he put out there is far too much. The dialogue itself was bad enough, but our being forced to read most of it in sub-titles made the pacing of this movie really tedious.<br/><br/>I am willing to suspend disbelief some for the sake of a good flick, but here, too many questions are just too big (for ex., how *did* that milk maid from the countryside end up owning a cinema in Paris? Why *did* some of those ""inglourious basterds"" blow themselves up rather than just set some explosives and bolt?) It saddens me to have to dislike this movie and give it a bad review 'cause, like I said, I like Tarantino (I think I'd really enjoy his company. He's so passionate and fiery! I'd even let him play with my feet if I could hang out with him for a day!). But I just gotta. Sorry, Quentin."
"jcbutthead86","10","2","4","10 May 2013"," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made And One Of The Greatest War Films Ever Made. A Tarantino Masterpiece.
","Inglorious Bastards is one of the greatest films ever made that combines excellent direction,brilliant acting,a great screenplay,amazing Action,wonderful soundtrack and black humor. It is one of my favorite movies,a classic war film and a Tarantino Masterpiece.<br/><br/>Set in France in the 1940s during World War II,Inglorious Bastards tells the story of a secret army known as The Bastards,a group of Jewish soldiers led by LT. Aldo Raine(Brad Pitt)who hunt,capture,kill and scalp Nazi soldiers. And while The Bastards hunt Nazi soldiers they soon have to deal with Nazi detective Hans Landa(Christoph Waltz)who is nicknamed ""The Jew Hunter"". Meanwhile,young Jewish girl Shoshanna Dreyfus(Melanie Laurant)who owns a local theater wants revenge on the Nazi when the Nazi wants to show one of their films at her theater. The tension builds up to a conclusion that Aldo Raine,The Bastards,Hans Landa or Shoshanna Dreyfus will never forget.<br/><br/>Inglorious Bastards is a masterpiece of cinema that will have you mesmerized and glued to the screen,a big and epic War film that is brutal,intense,violent and funny. With Bastards,Quentin Tarantino takes the genre of the Spaghetti Western and applies it to the World War II backdrop and gives viewers not a realistic world,but a Tarantino world where everything is bigger than life and everything is exaggerated beyond belief. Tarantino has never made a conventional film or has never played by the rules and IB is as about as unconventional as it gets because with IB Tarantino gives viewers a WWII film unlike we have never seen before where Tarantino boldly rewrites history and real life characters without a problem and in it's own way makes the revisionist history believable. Tarantino also fills the film with lots of anachronisms using songs and music scores that are not from the 1940s but are from later in the 20th century,it seems like a risky move but songs fit in well with the scenes in the film and you never ask about realism and accuracy. The Screenplay by Tarantino is excellent and unforgettable,with Tarantino giving each of the characters in the film great dialog that's funny and humorous and delightfully over the top. The dialog in the film is very memorable and well-written it stays with you for a days and you will quote lines from the film again and again. The pace of the film is amazing because even though the film is 152 minutes at times it feels like it's 90 minutes thanks to the dialog from Tarantino and editing by Sally Menke making the film go by smoothly and making IB one of the fastest 2 and a half hours you will ever watch. The three main characters in the film Aldo Raine,Hans Landa and Shoshanna Dreyfus are classic Tarantino characters who are very memorable in their own way. The two characters Aldo and Hans are both mirrors of each other in some ways because while Aldo hunts down Nazis and Hans hunts the Jews both characters use similar tactics such as talk,smarts and cleverness to do their job. Both are dangerous and great at what they do. Characters and revenge is a common theme in most of Tarantino's film and Shoshanna Dreyfus is another character looking for revenge. With Shoshanna you feel her rage and anger because of what the Nazis have done to her people and when you see Shoshanna you can relate to her and wanting to have revenge. These are three classic Tarantino characters that will stick with you after watching the film. The violence and Action scenes in the film are done with brilliance and style because every Action done with an air of suspense and great build up and when build up stops and when the Action comes it's like an explosion. This film also has one of the best shootouts in film history and when it happens it will be like someone punched you in the face. The ending of IB is classic Tarantino and it is so powerful that you will be in awe at it's intensity and brilliance and it is truly an ending that you have to see and believe. It's a great explosive ending and is one of the reasons Inglorious Bastards is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The whole cast does an excellent job in their roles. Brad Pitt is excellent as LT. Aldo Raine,with Pitt bringing humor and over the top greatness to the role. Christoph Waltz won a Oscar for his brilliant and masterful performance as Hans Landa,one of the best villains in film history. Waltz is menacing,powerful,terrifying and unforgettable in his role. Great performance. Melanie Laurent is wonderful and sexy as Shoshanna Dreyfus,with Laurent bringing intensity and depth to the role. Eli Roth is funny and tough as Donny Donowitz,nicknamed ""The Bear Jew. Michael Fessbender is great as LT. Archie Hicox,a British soldier who works with The Bastards. Diane Kruger is fantastic as Bridget Von Hammersmark,a double agent working with The Bastards. Daniel Bruhl is great as Freddrick Zoller,a German war hero who likes Shosanna. Til Schweiger is tough and intense as Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz,a German soldier killer who helps The Bastards. August Dieli is wonderful in his role as German soldier Major Hellstrom. Gedeon Burkhard is smooth and cool as Cpt. Wilhelm Wicki. Martin Wuttke(Hitler)and Sylvester Groth(Joseph Goebbels)give fun and over the top performances. Mike Myers(Gen. Ed Fenech),B.J Novak(Pfc.

Omar)and Denis Menochet(Perrier LaPadite)give good performances too.<br/><br/>The direction by Quentin Tarantino is excellent,with Tarantino bringing a beautiful and gritty cinematic style to the film and moving the camera at all costs when needed. Great direction by Tarantino.<br/><br/>I love music that is used in this film which is mostly composed songs from Ennio Morricone and other composers. I also loved the use of the song Cat People from David Bowie. Great soundtrack.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,War Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Inglorious Bastards,an epic Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"Ziya90","5","2","4","9 May 2013"," It has its moments, strong cinema feeling throughout, but the humorous tone and the ""deja-vu"" revenge story cause disappointment
","Inglourious Basterds was a little bit, in fact quite different film than previous Tarantino films which disappointed me at theater personally as a fan of him. The movie has one of the greatest opening sequences ever filmed, it proves how genius Tarantino is, but unfortunately the rest of the film was a let down after this sequence. This sequence is an example of quintessential cinema, pure genius. The vision and the mastery of the director shine such as the timing of the camera down or the suspense, atmosphere or the acting, it is a perfect sequence, but as said the movie was lack of the magic that this part had. For example, the revenge story in this movie was a little bit bland or lack of spark, especially in comparison with Kill Bill. Also, the similarities between the two stories make it even worse! (blonde avenger, the same songs etc.) In addition, the heroine of this movie was not likable like The Bride, she was rather cold that's why I couldn't identify with her throughout the movie. Christopher Waltz's performance is jaw dropping, incredible, however Pitt is not ""so so"" as some people claim, he is great too! I have no idea why some people doesn't accept that he is a very talented actor. His performances in 12 Monkeys, Burn After Reading and Tree of Life were Oscar worthy for example. Diane Kruger is the third best of the cast, her subtle performance is outstanding. Returning to the film, the movie was somehow ""cold"" in comparison with other Tarantino movies and that annoyed me. I don't say soulless, but somehow lack of any real spark except for the famous opening sequence or let's say the movie was lack of emotional involvement. The violence in the movie was very brutal, so unbearable at times, but that's OK. Some action scenes are stylish, but some of those are not, too brutal and raw like the baseball bat scene. If the point of those kind of scenes is to disturb audiences, yes it delivers! Hitler was portrayed in a comical tone which harms the seriousness and realism of the movie (in contrast with the movie, Valkrie for example) He just shouts people around him. I hate Eli Roth because of his sick and sadistic director identity, but his persona and his role suits him very well in this movie and he works as a post-modernism tool of Tarantino. The camera usage in the translation scene was another example as Tarantino highlights ""cinema"" over everything else. The villain of the movie, Hans Landa was a great character study, however, until the end, somehow the character lost his mystery? impact? And one of the biggest disappointments for me was the theater sequence because of the over humor or the funny tone. I had expected a suspenseful, exciting or even interesting climax, but instead got a sequence that works more like a parody! May be Tarantino tried to make his own Stalag 17 or Dirty Dozen (both movies have funny moments which I don't like particularly either), but comedy just doesn't work in this movie. Another problem was the confusing and controversial aspect of the film. In a scene, ""a good guy"" of the film torments a woman to get some information, he is a hero, also an anti hero, may be both may be neither of them! In another scene, a German soldier who has a wife and a baby gets shot, in those scenes, I know, Tarantino tries to throw us a curve, but personally I wasn't amazed, instead frustrated. He did the same thing to the relationship between the heroine and another German soldier, I won't go further not to spoil anything, but many twists in the movie didn't amaze me as the director would expect or wish. However, the last twist at the theater shows that Tarantino doesn't take any side or has some ideological thoughts, instead his only purpose is to amaze or surprise audiences and gets applause! The bar sequence was great, it shows us again that Tarantino is a dialog expert for sure! The ""deserve"" scene was stylish and also powerful. The ""hot"" climax was unfortunately lack of suspense, excitement or real action. At the end, if he can rule his ego a little bit, if he can forget about the cheers that he would want to get, instead focusing on his art, sure he will make much better movies."

"arturprego-582-411966","10","2","4","12 February 2013"," The Masterpiece
","Inglorious Bastards is a cinematographic masterpiece. It has a fantastic plot, where history is recreated to a point that makes you think it couldn't be done, bringing this movie to another level. Alongside this, there are spectacular dialogs, most of them evolved by great tension, since most of them are done between enemies, or between persons that have animosity between them, which I believe was one of the great challenges writing this movie. Also, Tarantino took a great decision, when he chose to put actors playing characters from their country, since it enriches the movie, and plays it is his favor, creating scenes based on the language barrier.<br/><br/>But to talk about this movie is to talk about it's actors performances, in particular a German actor, named Christoph Waltz. In an interview he said he had the opportunity to play one of the greatest characters ever written. I believe he is right. And the most amazing, is that he was able to be up to that character. He won the Oscar for best supporting role."
"piratecannon","9","2","4","29 December 2012"," The Alternate History of WWII
","Quentin Tarantino. Love him or hate him, there's no denying the man is an auteur who has changed modern filmmaking. His films ooze a peculiar flair that, more often that not, is reminiscent of the ""style over substance"" breed of movies from yesteryear. Tarantino has a dark sense of humor that tends to balance out his absurdly complex (though sometimes serious) plots, and, thankfully, he's got an eye for characterization that tends to save his movies from oblivion.<br/><br/>Though I enjoyed his recent Death Proof, it was somewhat underwhelming when viewed in the context of his other goliath, game-changing offerings (though that was the whole point, I still felt there was more that could've been done–and Death Proof is one instance where I think he let his ""too cool for school"" dialogue get away from him). But I digress; we're here to talk about Inglourious Basterds, a movie that's had a lot of buzz surrounding it ever since it went into pre-production.<br/><br/>Basterds is unlike anything Tarantino has ever tackled, yet it's strikingly similar to what I consider two of his greatest films–Kill Bill (Vols. 1 & 2). It explores the familiar theme of revenge, has the same ""Chapter"" scene dividers, and even recycles much of the same music for its soundtrack. Some might view this as lazy filmmaking, but I think it's a sign that Tarantino is starting to mature as a director. Like all noteworthy filmmakers with certain stylistic hallmarks, he seems to have found his rhythm, as it were, and has crafted a movie that's more emotionally resonant than any of his previous offerings.<br/><br/>The opening scene, for example, is simultaneously understated and absorbing. It features Tarantino's trademark dialogue—as do virtually all other scenes—and it gives all of the players involved a chance to fully flesh out their characters. To avoid spoilers I won't go into detail, but suffice it to say that it'll have your heart thumping; it's also immediately evident that Tarantino has become a master of wringing every drop of emotion from his actors and actresses.<br/><br/>Then, in the very next breath, we're thrust into the realm of Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and his squad of Jewish-American soldiers known as ""The Basterds."" Their mission is simple: to brutally murder Nazis and spread fear throughout the Third Reich. Forget what you know about the history behind World War II—though there is apparently a kernel of truth as to what inspired the plot, Inglourious Basterds is, on the whole, a completely fictitious endeavor. While this has upset some critics, it is, in many ways, a credit to Tarantino as a writer, as this decision causes us to remain on our toes throughout the entire 153 minute runtime (because, of course, we have absolutely no idea how the events in the film will unfold).<br/><br/>But I digress. Let's return to our previous topic—that regarding the violence found in Inglorious Basterds. As you'd imagine, Tarantino allows Raine and company to accomplish their assigned mission by forcing us to watch the most gruesome of occurrences (such as captured German soldiers being scalped, knifed, and beaten to death with a baseball bat). While the subject matter automatically calls for an undisclosed amount of violence, there are times—as with his other films—where it's obvious that Tarantino is indulging his own insatiable desire to douse the screen with blood. The question, then, is this: Is all of that gory violence a bad thing?<br/><br/>Essentially, Tarantino has used the backdrop of World War II to create a combination revenge flick/dark comedy—but Inglourious Basterds is so much more. What makes this stand out from his other movies is the fact that it's often deeply serious—much more so than I would've imagined, in fact. Many critics have found the movie disrespectful because of the liberties it takes with history and its comic nature. I take some contention with this assessment. Based on the emotion present here (and the care with which its so skillfully woven into what would otherwise be a blood and guts revenge story), it's clear that a fair degree of ""respect"" was front and center on the director's mind as he worked on this uncharacteristically affecting piece. Really, Basterds is a sort of non-comedy that knows how to keep its very adult themes serious without being so serious that they're steeped in an inaccessible gloom that makes viewers feel cold and detached from the things happening on- screen.<br/><br/>My only problem with the movie has to do with the shift in tone found at the ending (I'm talking the end-endthe very end). Based on the level of maturity found throughout the bulk of the movie, it felt just a little too out of place—just a little too whimsical, perhaps—and it seems to undermine an especially powerful scene that appears only moments before.<br/><br/>On the whole, though, Inglourious Basterds is superb. It's got that certain Tarantino flair, and, if you can handle the gore, you'll see a smartly written movie that's both entertaining and emotionally gripping."

","I have read some of the other reviews and was surprised about comments that mentioned Quentin had either lost touch or had reached his end of fame etc and I beg to differ. I feel this is one movie which thoroughly has Quentin Tarantino's stamp. Every chapter was good, engrossing and built enough tension for the story. Graphic violence - like I said - had Quentin Tarantino's stamp all over and I loved the reality behind that. Okay - the story , the screen play, the music , the violence , the plot and the sudden twists of events in the plot - like for example when Fredric meets Emma in the projector room - all are good. This movie can be seen twice or thrice as the dialog give it the special touch making us want to hear it again and again. My rate - 8 to 9."
"StevePulaski","6","2","4","15 October 2012"," From annoyingly isolated to cynically satisfying
","I do not consider Quentin Tarantino to be the godfather of auteur-driven cinema nor do I consider him to be one of the men who continue to ""ruin"" it, so to speak. I consider him to be a director with a solid style, a talent for witty, eccentric dialog, a natural at erecting characters that we like for their quirky societal views and their strange talking points, and overall, the non-linear coherency of it all. What I like about Tarantino can easily be turned into what I do not like about Tarantino without changing a single word above. After viewing Grindhouse: Death Proof, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs, I was convinced that the man was a breath of refreshing cinematic air; a man more concerned with the things in cinema that can easily create a wonderful cacophony of energy and spunk. But after viewing Inglourious Basterds, my enthusiasm for the man hasn't lessened but came to a stunning, unexpected trip back to reality realizing like many other directors working in the medium, the man is not perfect.<br/><br/>Perhaps in the right eyes, Inglourious Basterds is a perfect movie. I suspect that everyone who will see it or has seen it has emerged with completely different viewpoints. That's the beauty of a Tarantino film, again, one person can like specific things about the film and love it for those reasons and another can point out those same little things and hate the movie just for that. Dissent is a beautiful thing, and it seems that's one of the many things that ""The Tarantinian Formula"" intends to do.<br/><br/>The film begins rather maturely as we are presented with a title card saying that the film is set in the Nazi-run areas of France, and then we see Colonel Hans Landa (also known as ""The Jew Hunter,"" played by Christoph Waltz) arrive on a desolate country farm to meet farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa is going around to different locations to try and find out if people are hiding Jews to protect them from Nazi persecution, and after a lengthy discussion with Perrier, the farmer informs Landa that he does in fact have Jews hiding in the house and Landa's goons immediately try to kill them under the floorboards of the house. The scene is particularly tense and gratifying, mainly because of its constantly unsettling nature and intimate shots, and serves as one of the best scenes in the film.<br/><br/>From there on out, we are greeted with a number of other scenarios seemingly taken from all over the grid. Now we are three years in the future and see Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) giving a mean pep talk to his boys, eight Jews recruited to accomplish one assignment; to kill Nazis, or in Raine's southern, twangy accent, ""nat-zees."" Among Raine's crew is Donny ""Bear Jew"" Donowitz (Eli Roth), a rather unnecessary, obnoxious caricature who is used as the violent soul of the whole operation. In a later scene, we seem him viciously beat a man's head in with a baseball bat, even after he breaks his neck upon being struck the first time. Certain scenes like that do not offend me, particularly, but I question their presence in a film dominated by dialog and sequences set in bars or elegant locations.<br/><br/>Another subplot, arguably the most interesting, involves a German sniper (Daniel Brühl) striking a friendship with a young Jewish woman who owns a French cinema (Mélanie Laurent). And another subplot involves a German film critic named Lieutenant Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender), who will become involved with a secret operation to bomb the premiere of the Nazi propaganda film the German sniper is a part of.<br/><br/>Now that we've got the continuously twisty, absurd narrative out of the way, we have the content and the aesthetics to explore. For starters, one can not deny, this is probably the strangest work of Tarantino yet, drastically different from his previous installments, for the sole reason that it does not rely much on the things that I listed above. He breaks form, creating long, somewhat poetic dialog scenes to set the mood, rather than the cut-throat, bloody, unapologetic goriness the trailer promised us. The problem with Tarantino, which even existed in Pulp Fiction, a film I awarded a perfect rating of four stars to, is that once the man gets started, he doesn't know when to stop. Certain scenes become long and winded, many of them overstaying their welcome, and consistently thriving on repetitive, uninteresting chatter that obscures the purpose and the enjoyment one anticipates walking in.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the film has some of the finest, rawest performances of the 2009 year. Brad Pitt gives a fine, no-nonsense performance as Raine, Eli Roth is capable as ""Bear Jew,"" and Michael Fassbender, once more, is continuously wonderful in one of the many diverse roles of his career. Yet the highlight here is the merciless, unmatchable, truly divine work of brilliance done by Christoph Waltz as ""The Jew Hunter."" His performance alone elevates the film to the point where when he's on screen, we forget all the monotony and watery dialog we've just sat through.<br/><br/>Consistent readers of my work will take note that I do greatly appreciate dialog in my films. But even I have a limit. There is enough dialog here to sustain two or three films, and that's a sign of a prolific, uncompromising auteur. If only the dialog had been easier to listen to, rather than just a good chunk of it being nonsensical, irrelevant banter would we have had some substantial meat to this story. This is a film that fluctuates from annoyingly isolated from its audience to cynically satisfying during a majority of its highlighting scenes. For a Tarantino fan, I can't expect they'll look for anything less.<br/><br/>Starring: Brad Pitt, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender, and Christoph Waltz. Directed by: Quentin Tarantino."

"bbbiefstuk","9","2","4","14 August 2012"," Raw excellence.
","Inglourious Basterds is nothing short of a masterpiece. The unique Tarantino style: taking a walk with history, historical characters and events and melting it down into a over-the-top cinematic masterpiece. <br/><br/>That what makes Inglourious Basterds great is first this unique style. Tarantino ignores the rules of cinema and creates unique and unorthodox characters and plot. The score is very bizarre, but spot on. In one scene the music can change from modern hardrock into a very old school 30's thriller movie score. And yes, they pull it off. <br/><br/>Also the acting is excellent. Christopher Walz in his role as Hans Landa will haunt you for a long time leading the long list of terrific actors in the flick. People that were negative about the Nazi characters saying they were 'sympathising with them' really didn't get the point. In the very first scene the character of Walz is established as a highly cunning, brutal and despicable character. Comparing jews to rats in a skin-crawling way. Also the way the 'jew-hunter' practices his job is simply horrifying, because he always wears a smile on his face while mentally torturing other characters. This mind-messing way of putting a character out there is not only original but also extremely brilliant.<br/><br/>This movie has (just as many other Tarantino films) the feeling of a comic book, patched with unorthodox scenes and angles, mixed with a bizarre, brutal alternative to reality. Long dialogue in the many thrilling scenes will leave you on the edge of your seat. People that hate this kind of movies don't see the art in this 'devil may care' way of making movies.<br/><br/>This is not a history movie. This is another unique view on making movies by Tarantino. Hate it or love it. This is excellence. There are many who love it, because I remember watching this in the theater and every scene people were cheering. Give this film a try, you might just love it."

Very deliberate introduction of the players involved accompanied by a clear purpose for the movie sent everything in motion and carried through to the finale. A really enjoyable movie. It is really easy to enjoy a band of freedom fighters led by Pitt (Aldo) who kill Nazi's in an effort to end the war. A few twists and turns make this movie a standout. I finally caught this movie 3 years later and it is awesome.

"darcy_writer","5","2","4","3 June 2012"," Embarrassing script
","I kind of like Tarantino in a way. I loved Resovoir dogs, Pulp fiction and some other of his films. He has a great style that is unique in its kind. He tells his stories nicely. This film is no exception. BUT, what incredibly silly story - a gang of Jews working undercover in WW2 France? They are stupid enough to paint themselves into a corner. The avenging Jewish girl gets a free chance to get her revenge on her family's executioner, with no questions asked? And of course there is almost no guard's in the theater to protect Hitler and his closest men. All this is so far-fetched that I get red cheeks on Tarantino's behalf. He has often chosen naive alternatives to solve situations in his scripts and this is no exception. The only thing is that it's not working at all this time. The end has no finesse and you regret that you have spent a couple of hours on this nonsense. But I will give the film five stars because it is technically well done."
"the_woodwose","8","2","4","27 May 2012"," Say what you will, Tarantino knows his craft.

Inglorious Basterds isn't it.<br/><br/>But it's still a compelling film"
"fikamugg","6","2","4","11 December 2011"," Shallow and pretty forgettable.
","As pure entertainment this movie is solid as most of Tarantinos movies are. But he has nothing to say or add to the history of WW2. The major idea of the movie, it seems, is to present cool violence in a different context compared to his other movies. Watching this movie you get no idea what so ever of the sufferings and horrors of the war. It's very shallow and forgettable with exception of 2 scenes and Christopher Waltz interpretation of the Nazi officer Hans Landa.<br/><br/>The opening scene of the movie when Landa visit a house in which the house owner is hiding Jews in his basement is already a classic and can easily be lifted out and shown as a separate short. The dialog is brilliant and shows Tarantino at his best. Another memorable scene is the supper in the basement of the inn where the basterds have an appointed meeting with the Nazis. Again Tarantino shines in his abilities to write an outstanding dialog. As a whole the movie rests on Waltz performance and the most brilliant with this film was to cast him."

Brad Pitt was fabulous as always and the other actors did a great job as well.

","I watched this film longing to be entertained, although I do admit however that this was something I had not experienced previously on any Tarantino film. The first 15 minutes was a revelation, the hauntingly beautiful ( but pinched!) theme from The Alamo, the spaghetti western flavour, the John Huston photography were matched by acting of the excellent Christophe Waltz. Alas this height was never reached again.<br/><br/>The film then fell into a long, tedious, slow,drawling and sometimes painful tale that didn't seem to want to end! But it had to and did so in a Sam Peckipah type flurry of gratuitous slow- mo gunfight and explosion! Totally over-rated."
"MBunge","6","2","4","23 July 2010"," Tragically, this is probably as good as Taratino will ever again be
","Inglorious Basterds is a bit of a mixed bag. It demonstrates that Quentin Taratino hasn't completely lost it as a filmmaker, but it also indicates that we'll probably never get any more truly great work out of him.<br/><br/>Theoretically, this story is supposed to be based on a team of Jewish-American soldiers during World War II who were sent into occupied France to fight the Nazis. It's pretty clear that Tarantino lost interest in that idea at some point, so he throws in a remedial primer on the early 20th century German film industry, inserts an extraordinarily charismatic Nazi, adds in some of his ""I love the 70s"" stylistic flourishes and wraps it all up with a crude and oddly-timed Jewish revenge fantasy.<br/><br/>The first thing to know about this movie is that it's fairly talky, even by Tarantino standards. He's coming awfully close here to doing with dialog what Michael Bay does with explosions. Virtually every dialog scene goes on too long, to the point where it's obvious that Taratino's just dragging things out for his own amusement. I know a lot of people love Tarantino's dialog and the fact that much of it is in French or German helps to disguise how a decent portion of it is as aimless and meandering as what he did in Death Proof, but that doesn't change the fact that most of the conversation scenes in this movie would have greatly benefited from a little editing.<br/><br/>The second thing to know about Inglorious Basterds is that it has some spectacular performances. Christoph Waltz is brilliant as the complexly civilized Jew hunter, Colonel Hans Landa. He does some genuinely Oscar-worthy acting up until the end of the film, when the script rips the character away from him and makes Landa a servant of the Almighty Plot Hammer. Diane Kruger is also very good as a German movie star working for the British and Michael Fassbender is the epitome of English charm as a British soldier who used to be a film critic. Til Schweiger gives a small but compelling performance as a German Nazi-killer as well and Daniel Bruhl as a German war hero is surprisingly human, again right up until the scripts rips the character away from him.<br/><br/>Though he's the titular star of Inglorious Basterds, Brad Pitt does not do a good job as backwoods leader of the Jewish-American soldiers. He's like a stand up comedian on open mic night who tells the same joke over and over and over and over. Some folks might find that ironically funny and I don't think Tarantino wanted anything else from Pitt, but it's just not good. Mike Myers also embarrasses himself in a small role where he looks like he's playing a character from a fourth Austin Powers movie.<br/><br/>The third thing to know about this film is that Tarantino is again playing around with story structure. He's not doing the whole non-linear thing again, thank goodness, but it appears as though he only wrote individual scenes and then stretched them out as far as he could. He largely dispensed with the connective tissue of the story so he could focus on what he thinks is ""the good stuff"". The problem is those little moments in between the big moments are often where the story gets a lot of its depth and where the big moments get a lot of their power. By cutting away all those little moments, Tarantino leaves us with a story and characters that are far too shallow.<br/><br/>The final thing to know about Inglorious Basterds is that there's a tin-eared quality to its emotional resonance. This is a revenge fantasy about murdering Hitler and while there's never a bad time to killer Hitler, doing such a film might have made sense in 1950, 1960 or 1970. Making such a movie in 2009 is sort of fetishy. The story is built on a visceral hatred that Tarantino and his actors don't actually feel, because it's almost impossible to viscerally hate someone who died several decades before you were born. Someone who viscerally hates Hitler, like Mel Brooks for example, would have been driven by that hatred to make a film that was either much darker or much funnier. Inglorious Basterds always seems alienated from the very emotions at the core of its story.<br/><br/>If you thought Kill Bill and Death Proof were great, you'll think Inglorious Basterds is a masterpiece. It's much better than those two movies. But if you recognized the flaws in those films, you'll be able to see the problems in this one. There is a lot to enjoy here; the acting, the dialog before it tests your patience, a more restrained example of Tarantino's flair for cinematic violence. The problem is that there will probably always be something to enjoy in Taratino's work. But his last three movies (Kill Bill counts as one) all have obvious, significant weaknesses. With Inglorious Basterds, I'd say the good outweighs the bad, but the bad is still there. I don't know if no one will tell Tarantino when there's a problem with a film, if he won't listen or it he isn't willing to work hard enough to fix it.<br/><br/>Granted, Tarantino has already made more great movies than most filmmakers do in the entire careers, but it's frustrating to think he'll never make anything that good again."
"MasterGuns2077","4","2","4","1 January 2010"," So much potential...
","I was pretty excited to finally get to see this movie after all the hype it received. It looked like a genuinely gritty Tarantino flick that would have all the required cool cut shots, gruesome beatings, and bada** feel to it. I was very disappointed. First of all, if you're one of these people who thinks that beating Nazis to death is wrong, well, don't bother watching this movie. This isn't meant to be some look at the morality of brutal executions, it's supposed to make brutal executions entertaining, something which Tarantino is usually good at. He failed here. The movie is called Inglourious Basterds, yet every single scene with the basterds in it (and I'm not exaggerating here) was shown in the previews. The majority of the movie was a very dull and boring story about a girl who owns a theater which is going to host all the top Nazi brass for a premier. She burns the place down, killing everyone. The basterds... well they unwittingly help by shooting up the crowd and getting themselves blown up. Clever Tarantino, but not his best. This provided some cool shots, but we saw them all in the previews...what a let down. This movie needed to be an hour shorter and have about twice as much basterd perpetrated violence to whet my Tarantino appetite. It seems like he tried to make this movie a bit more mainstream than his others, and managed to gain broader appeal with it. But if you expect more out of your Tarantino flicks, you'll be disappointed in this film. Christoph Waltz outclasses everyone in this film, yet fits in well, and is the only reason I rated this film higher than two stars. He was outstanding, a truly diabolical Tarantino character if there ever was one. Bottom line: This movie could've been so much cooler, so much better, and it just fell short of every mark I felt had been set for it. Perhaps it will grow on me, but I couldn't help feeling cheated."
"kentashcraft","4","2","4","23 December 2009"," Tarentino falls short
","I'm sure I'm in the minority here, but I was disappointed in this film. Partially, no doubt, because Tarentino's formula (long periods of off-the-wall dialog punctuated by short periods of extreme violence) is wearing a bit thin for me. But mostly because the plot features two unrelated protagonists and is therefore emotionally diluted.<br/><br/>A better plot would have pitted either Shoshanna Dreyfus or the Basterds against the Nazis, but not both, since they were not working together and either could have unintentionally disrupted the other's plot. It's difficult to root for a character who might scuttle the plans of the other character you're rooting for.<br/><br/>Other complaints: 1) Brad Pitt's Tennessee accent is way over the top, particularly when he attempts to speak Italian. This is not a slapstick comedy. 2) There is no reason given or implied for Col. Landa's choice to defect. That was the turning point in the movie, yet inconsistent with his personality and unexplained. 3) Shoshanna's murder served no plot purpose whatsoever. If you're going to kill the hero, at least make it consequential. Hey, I'm a great fan of Tarentino, but there are basic principles of storytelling that even he can't ignore. Clever dialog and creative violence only go so far."

","Tarantino explores his own film making career with a fizzing demonstration of his writing and directing craftwork and zeal. Unbridled joyfullness in the extreme finds it's apogee with an adventure pulp fiction regarding cross and double cross under the Nazi empire in occupied France in World War Two with vengence and rebellion and spies and secret agents, Gestapo and SS, and almost every Nazi celebrity.<br/><br/>'Inglorious Basterds' has multiple strands unflatteringly and inconsistently brought together in an orgy of climaxes.<br/><br/>Tarantino used to write characters in the 1990's but often in the 21st century he seems to write caracitures and archetypes, when it works it produces screenplays that ooze Tarantino's vision and films fetid with his styles and signifiers. In this film I believe that it doesn't quite work out.<br/><br/>In 'Inglorious Basterds' this forceful pulp fiction treatment of characters certainly inhibits nuanced or implicit acting by all except for the actors playing the cinema owning French ""undesirables"" who are playing their parts as if in a different film from the rest of the cast. And in many ways they are. Which is the central criticism of the film as a whole.<br/><br/>In a worthy effort at irreverent and intemperate iconoclasm and madcap imagination regarding the second world war 'Inglorious Basterds' seems less than the sum of it's considerable parts.<br/><br/>At times gorgeous scenes, particularly in the first period, contrast with the vile behaviour of Nazi Germans in uniform and stylish violence and chaotic action scenes are trademark stamped like punctuation through the two and a half hours that the film lasts for.<br/><br/>However my sense that this is an incomplete work, because it's own parts are somehow incompatible, despite the best efforts of Tarantino to write and direct them until they do gel, is my abiding impression.<br/><br/>I rate a 6/10 overall because there is a good 4 films worth of bombastic and vibrant historical adventure material here and taken in smaller degrees much is to be appreciated but the work as a whole is not a fair comparison to the great work put into it."
"blueangel-76133","5","0","0","20 October 2019"," Not the film that should be considered Tarantino's best
","I have to join the minority dissenting opinion who didn't like this Tarantino take on WWII history much at all. The stars are for Christopher Waltz's terrific performance as the wonderfully charasmatic evil ""Jew hunting bast@#$"" (as Pitt's character puts it) and the talented Brad Pitt's solid performance with wonderful lines like: ""I'm in the Nazi hunting business--and business is good."" But it's Tarantino's rewriting of history to represent the Nazi's, and particularly the absolutely bufoonish Hitler laughing maniacally in every scene, that cripples this film's chance of being taken, as it clearly wishes to, seriously. I don't believe this is an attempt at farce, but if it is, the genuinely talented Tarantino has badly mischosen his material for such a treatment.  A much more realistic and powerful depiction of Hitler's true personality can be seen in Anthony Hopkin's deeply nuanced performance in the film ""The Bunker"", and there's a wonderful illustration of the way the Nazis slowly but inextribly took over their own country (before going on to attempt to subjugate so many others) in a somewhat forgotten film of Jimmy Stewart's called ""The Mortal Storm"". Films like these (and many others) give a much more meaningful understanding understanding of why the allies knew they had to sacrifice millions to combat the Nazi menace. As Churchill famously put it, ""You can't reason with the tiger when your head is in its mouth!"" See Tarantino's other strong films like ""Django Unchained"" or ""Jackie Brown"" to appreciate his undeniable talent that will almost surely ultimately net him a best picture award."

This could be a revelation at what he would do eventually (at the end of the movie, Hans Landa rats against his own Führer).

","In my humble opinion, Quentin Tarantino has only made three really good films (although I have yet to see ""Death Proof""): ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Jackie Brown"", and now ""Inglorious Basterds"". While indisputably a strong film, this film gets dropped a notch or two relative to other two, because, although it's exceptionally slick and well-made, it's likewise simple-minded and undemanding. <br/><br/>We all know that Tarantino likes violence a lot and will find any excuse to depict it. He'll always claim artistic pretensions, but actually he just really, really likes to see people suffer and bleed. While he won't be honest about it, the rest of us can be. <br/><br/>""Pulp Fiction"" had some heavy violence, but wasn't too harsh, and ""Jackie Brown"" was nearly devoid of violence by Tarantino standards; on the other hand, I found some of the violence in ""Inglorious Basterds"" to be somewhat disturbing, although, admittedly, it would be quite unexceptional for a modern horror movie. <br/><br/>More disturbing to me is that I found it only somewhat disturbing. If this movie had come out in the 1970s, it would no doubt have gotten an X rating for violence, but our culture has gotten utterly inured to this kind of thing, which might not be totally healthy (just saying). <br/><br/>If you can get past the violence (likely not hard for most people nowadays), this movie is totally captivating and never flags from beginning to end. It's never dull, and you can't believe that 2 1/2 hours have passed when it's over. <br/><br/>Lacking spoilers, a brief summary is that it's an alternative fictional history of WWII, which plays like a live action adult graphic novel with the expected minimal depth, subtlety, ambiguity, or moral or intellectual complexity. <br/><br/>It's a flawless homage to classic B-movie, ultra-violent, grindhouse fare. At the same time, it's also like one of those restored cars that are way nicer than they ever were when they originally left the factory. They don't make them like they used too, at least not in this case, they do a much better job."

They discover their targets at a movie premier at a cinema owned by a young woman whom escaped a Nazis attack years earlier. Now she sees opportunity for revenge, which results in a rousing climax. Director Quentin Tarantino delivers on dialogue and inner hatred ranking this among his best, which includes Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill films. Brad Pitt is amusing as the Southern Basterd commander who takes risks particularly when unable to master accents. Christoph Waltz steals the film as a sly and cruel Col. Landa whose charm conceals a sadistic nature that will eventually come full circle with karma. Diane Kruger plays an undercover agent and actress who becomes injured during a shootout. She will become the unwilling victim of Landa's cunning brilliance. Melanie Laurent delivers the second best performance as an escapee of Landa's raid but will seek the ultimate vengeance.

Please realize this is pure fiction, although QT does put a lot of attention to some details you may not realize you are seeing (everything from posters in the backgrounds to uniforms), as well as his nods to films styles of a few decades ago.

","In Inglourious basterds, Quentin Tarantino succeeds to mix a war movie (with all the violence, explosions, deaths, etc. that we expect) and a comedy (with caricatured characters, funny situations, etc. that make you laugh). And these two types of movies, which are normally opposites, merge and form a great cinematic experience that you wouldn't want to miss.<br/><br/>This movie deals with a fictional World War II. It takes place in the occupied France and follows the story of both Shosanna Dreyfus (played by Melanie Laurent), a young Jewish girl who saw her family members murdered by an SS officer, and a group of American soldiers, ""the Basterds"", who came in France with only one goal : to kill as many Nazis as possible. And, while they use different ways, they all have the same mission: destruct a cinema during a premiere that all the leaders of the Nazi Germany (Hitler, Goebbels, etc.) will attend.<br/><br/>But, let's focus on ""the Basterds"". They're leaded by the lieutenant Aldo Raine (played by Brad Pitt) who asks to each of his soldiers to bring him 100 scalps of Nazis and to show no mercy to them in order to make them pay for the atrocities they accomplish, especially against the Jewish people. And, even if their mission is noble, these American soldiers are depicted as cruel and violent, and we can think that it's the will of Tarantino to show in his movie that all people, especially at war, are capable of intense cruelty. It's pleasant to finally find an American movie where American soldiers are not glorified but are just represented as normal soldiers with all the abuses they may commit! <br/><br/>Moreover, in this movie, World War II is represented, in the same time, from the points of view of civilians, Allies soldiers and Nazis and, even if it deals with fictional events, it's nice to see almost all the aspects of this war. <br/><br/>At last, Inglourious basterds is a movie you wouldn't want to miss because of the amazing performance of the actors. Indeed, we can quote Cristoph Waltz (who played the SS colonel Hans Landa, the Nazi who killed Shosanna's family) who manages brilliantly to give to his character all the depth which makes Landa an intelligent, sadistic, scary but fascinating character. <br/><br/>To conclude, this movie is one of the best of Quentin Tarantino's and, despite the fact that it lasts a bit too long with slow and long scenes, we have a good time and it is worth to be seen!"

"drkisa4","7","0","0","11 January 2015"," Disappointing to the point of irritation
","First of all let me say that in general I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino movies. But this one left me cold. I've given it a day or 2 to think about it and I've decided that this is not a very good film.<br/><br/>Now we all know that Tarantino knows his cellulose - and there is homage throughout all of his movies to some of the greatest films of all time. We know already Quentin! Why keep doing it! Isn't it about time you moved on? <br/><br/>For me the worst point of this movie was its counterfactual content. Everyone of a certain age and intelligence knows that Hitler blew his brains out in a bunker in Berlin in 1945. But I wouldn't mind betting that many watchers would have skipped out of the cinema thinking that World War II came to an end in 1944 because of some huge explosion in a cinema! Not so.<br/><br/>Now defenders of this movie will probably claim that ""it's an art movie - anything goes"". Okay fine. But it is still a movie. Art films don't have to be counterfactual, but they can be fictional, example, Babettes Feast, Jean de Florette, Once upon a time in the West, they still tell stories fantastically well and look brilliant. You can also have art movies that are factual, for example, the Passion of Joan of Arc, Amadeus. These are some great movies! But Inglorious Basterds doesn't hold a candle to any of these - not even in the same league. Why? On this showing Tarantino has reduced the war movie to a comedy. It's a very odd comedy, a violent comedy, a character's larger-than-life comedy. But it's a comedy nonetheless.<br/><br/>Tarantino is trying to do a lot of things with this film. For one thing, he is making a statement about the power of film and its propaganda qualities. For another he's trying to say, "" yeah, the Jews had it rough"". Yes Quintin, we know already. He's also trying to say people will sell each other out if the price is right. Okay, we know. You told us before.<br/><br/>The film just doesn't hang together. But then Tarantino films can have separate stories running within them, Pulp Fiction being the classic of this type. Pulp Fiction contains larger-than-life characters and is hysterically funny. I didn't want for this movie to be a comedy especially since it begins with the brazen ( and predictable) murder of a basement full of Jews hiding from the Nazis. Okay Quentin you got my attention. But then the film descends into comedy and parody and homage and we've seen it all before."

Incorporating history into the movie was an element I greatly enjoyed in the movie since it allowed me to see what history is like through Tarantino's wild imagination. Inglorious Basterds also had one of the best casts I have ever seen in a movie. Their were a number of supporting characters played by great actors and actresses such as Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, BJ Novak, Michael Fassbender, and Christoph Waltz that I wish would have gotten more screen time due to the excellent performance of an excellent cast. Brad Pitt also gets major, major props for his historical yet spot-on portrayal of the lieutenant of a group of Jewish-American, Nazi killin' soldiers.

"williampsamuel","9","0","0","7 December 2014"," Every bit as crazy, bloody, and awesome as expected
","So Quinton Terantino, best known for his gangster and martial arts films, has decided to make a war movie. At first I wasn't sure how I felt about the idea. He's one of my favorite directors, but I had to question whether pop culture references and the Second World War make a good match. I am glad to say that this film exceeded my expectations. Terantino has crafted the best revenge fantasy since Kill Bill. He's wisely left out the pop culture nods and insider references (besides a few allusions to early German cinema) but has all of his usual wit, penchant for dialog, and over the top violence.<br/><br/>The basic setup is that 'Aldo the Apache' (Brad Pitt) an eccentric OSS lieutenant, has recruited eight Jewish young men to form a guerrilla unit that will raise havoc behind the German lines using the most brutal methods possible. He makes it clear in his opening speech that he expects each of them to take 100 Nazi scalps. Oh, and as anyone who's watched any of the trailers knows, they do get to kill Hitler. Anyway, back to the scalping, we get to see plenty, a few of them at very close distance. There are also many, many shootings, a strangling, a massive fire, and explosions aplenty. At times there are so many gun barrels spouting fire and so many bodies falling that it's like a veritable orgy of violence, with too many elements for the eye to take in. In other scenes, time slows, the focus narrows, and we see every drop of blood fly as the bat strikes the head of a Nazi. It's as graphic and blood drenched as any of Terantino's works, and beyond what most would consider good taste, but still well short of the type of gore-fest that's been so prevalent in horror films as of late.<br/><br/>And in between the bursts of violence, Terantino delivers sustained periods of tension and the type of insightful, realistic conversations that viewers have come to expect from him. In regards to the former, the opening scene at the French farmhouse is a masterpiece in its own right. As the scene progresses, the tension grows and thicker and thicker until you can practically cut it with a knife. (Pardon the cliché) We don't know until the last minute how the scene will end, but the longer it goes on, the more certain you become that it can't possibly end well. Coming in a close second is the conversation in the Parisian Bistro between a Jewish cinema proprietor and the SS officer who killed her family.<br/><br/>Even when the point is to create tension or provide the lead in to a shoot out, the dialog is brilliant. As in any Terantino movie, what a character says and how he says it can tell you every bit as much about a character as his actions. In the farmhouse scene, it's apparent that the SS officer is every bit as intelligent and cultured as he is evil; the perfect villain. And the German war hero's early attempts to woo the secretly Jewish young woman are as earnest and awkward as any in real life. Reminds me of experiences I've had- up until it starts getting creepy.<br/><br/>Aside from the SS major and the war hero, most of the Nazis in this movie are little more than caricatures, affirmations of all we know about the evils of the Reich. Goebbels comes off as a buffoonish hack director, this Hitler does little more than give a few perfunctory rants, and I'm not sure if Goering and Bormann had any lines. But that doesn't matter, since they're only in the movie to be loathsome and to die. Hatred is of course a base emotion, and normally the vilification of any large group is a great injustice. But with Nazis that's simply not an issue. They showed such callousness and committed so many atrocities that anyone without a passionate hatred of them and all they stood for would be considered an outlier. So in a revenge picture, the more one dimensional and disgusting you make them, the better.<br/><br/>There's no denying that the violence and language earn this a fairly hard R rating, and it appeals to a side of human nature that many of us would like to ignore. But that's the point really. After all, this is a Quinton Tarantino production, and honestly, who hasn't wished they could kill a Nazi at some point? It may not quite be Pulp fiction, but trust me, it's bloody good fun."

","Of course there's violence, of course there's bizarre dialogue. And of course there are tons of side stories, background action and clever wit that you would expect from a Tarantino film. But this film is also surprisingly personal and has a heart, more than the usual Tarantino film. While the story may not exactly follow historical facts, no one ever said this was a documentary. And just before it stretches too far into the borderline ""too much"" category, the film gets back to its solid motif by the end and leaves you wanting more. I have always been a huge fan of Tarantino's work, but this film seems to reach a new level of storytelling. Perhaps Quentin has grown up since the days of Reservoir Dogs, but I'll bet he never forgets his roots of shock, awe and humor that we have all grown up on."

","For me, this is Tarantino's best work. Five minutes in you know this is Tarantino's hand. His style figures are all there with amazing cutscènes, characters and a short moment featuring himself. That also means viewers expecting a serious and historically correct wardrama will probably hate it.<br/><br/>First of all, more than half of the film is spoken in foreign tongue. A big plus for me, because there are some great films out there that fail to fully star because of language. Schindlers List is a single example.<br/><br/>Secondly, the actors are GREAT. Walz was fantastic, as usual. Playing games and being awesome from the beginning. But really, I can name everyone in there. Diehl, Fassbender, Schweiger and even Myers, who I do not rate at all. Pitt deserves some special praise though, portraying an extreme -nazi hatin'- Mississippi yank who 'dropped out of a f'ing aeroplane', in the best way you can imagine. Chemistry all over. <br/><br/>To summarize, while making this film Tarantino, Pitt and Walz all fired on maximum cylinders resulting in the best movie I've seen in a long time. <br/><br/>Oh, and fresh up your German, 'cause this is quotable as hell."

","Tarantino's back, and it was worth the wait. Great WW2 movie, though very unorthodox. From rewriting history to the use of David Bowie's ""Cat People"" (one of my favourite songs, by the way) in a scene, there is nothing conventional or reverent about this movie, but Tarantino makes it work.<br/><br/>Great action, and great plot. Does drag at times, as Tarantino sketches the background and builds the suspense. (""Jackie Brown"" had that problem too). <br/><br/>The use of French and German, and not just English, plus subtitles both adds and detracts from the movie. Many of the scenes rely on French or German being spoken, so there's the plus. The minus is that it stunts the usual witty and swagger-filled dialogue that is Tarantino's trademark. Reading the subtitles isn't the same as hearing it in English. Plus, while you're reading the subtitles, you're missing some of the action.<br/><br/>Though Brad Pitt is billed as the lead actor, the star of the show, for my mind, is Christoph Waltz as the cunning and sadistic SS Colonel. Superb acting on his part. Brad Pitt, Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger are also very good. Eli Roth was unconvincing, though.<br/><br/>Overall, not as good as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs (though nothing is) or either Kill Bill, but very entertaining and certainly worth watching."

","I really enjoyed ""Inglourious Basterds"" overall. It has all the Tarantino mannerisms you could shake a stick at, but I did get pretty bored halfway through. In a nutshell it's 2 hours of solid dialogue and directing, culminating with the final 20 minutes being an utter absurd spectacle.<br/><br/>I'm glad Brad Pitt finally make his way into a directed Tarantino film, and his presence doesn't upset the balance or feel out of place in anyway. Eli Roth as Donny Dolowitz was a solid performance, and the appearances of Michael Fassbender, Mike Myers, Lea Seydoux, Melanie Laurent, Diane Kruger, Rod Taylor and Daniel Bruhl make for one of the greatest casts of that year. But you all know who stole the show, WHAT an unbelievable find in Christoph Waltz, who won so many deserved awards and I still thought that under-rated him. Tarantino went on to say he believed he wrote a character who couldn't be performed, and that Waltz had ""Gave him his movie"". What an incredible performance from a completely unknown actor.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier I really enjoyed this film, but I hope Tarintino starts shaking up the formula in his films. I loved ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" (2003), but ""Vol.2"" suffered a major pacing problem as well as ""Death Proof"" (2007), even though that finale was amazing.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Very good stuff, as always you can look forward to a Tarintino movie. 8.5/10."

","Seldom, you will see a War period film that's completely fictionalised and extremely interesting.<br/><br/>It's a film that is in English/FRENCH/German/Italian, but just gave English coz it's directed by an English Director, Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>War films are mostly dramatic or even melodramatic and in parts boring, coz we know that a War hero either survived a great war, or dies with great glory. But here, Basterds do neither, they live with great glory and kill the enemies (Nazis) including Hitler Just see, how they did that and that makes a great film. Had a girl not got theatre, had there not been any films in 1940's, this film would not have been made.<br/><br/>Tarantino the great and a uniquely gifted director brought so many elements in his story telling, that it's not easy to simply put a finger one thing and say ""I liked this one more than the other"" Performances by the whole ensemble cast is super. Christoph Waltz shines as the cold blooded ""Jew Hunter"" Hans Landa. Brad Pitt does Aldo Raine with a niche that his his own, be it uttering American accent or killing Nazis with guns. Melanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus is vulnerable and shrewd. All others, just right for their roles. So casting director and Quentin Tarantino pulled off a great cast and all did extremely well.<br/><br/>The cinematography, art direction, production design and even the sound, the music, be it Ennio Morricone's touch of ""Fur Elise"" or Dmitri Tiomkins ""Green Leaves of Summer"" or David Bowie's ""Gasoline"". Wow, what a sound all that was apart from the heavy explosions and Hitler's ""Nai, nai, nai, nai, nai"" squeals. So to put it simply its is technically brilliant and dramatically terrific.<br/><br/>Now, let me get to Quentin Tarantino, this man has given us a film like Pulp Fiction that is in any sense cannot be considered less than the most influential film in last 20 years. Now, with Inglourious, he took the writing to a very new level, where anything can be done, said, preached, and even followed. So just do what we believe and make it interesting, something that you as audience would love to see and it will work. Inglourious is a prime example of that.<br/><br/>The writing is so very exemplary here that the script itself is enough to be read many times, lot many characters, few plots all gathering for one big climax. Too much of happening in too little, and yet we have to figure what happens when. It's based in Chapter based narration and that too non-linear, so it's a kind of puzzle where we must figure out what happens when.<br/><br/>I am not sure how many times, I would have watched it in last 2-3 years, but each time I learn a new thing, a new dialogue, a new camera angle, a new emotion and I still can't get enough of this. But 2 and half hour now started to seem so much longer than it originally was. So, cutting this down to 4/5, a great movie and a must watch movie for all the movie lovers. Post Pulp Fiction, I rate this as best movie of Tarantino. Though this is inspired hugely from the 1978 film ""The Inglorious Bastards"", I still love this version.<br/><br/>A 4/5 movie, that is just great in every way except the length."
"Bleke01","9","0","0","2 September 2014"," Tarantinos Masterpiece
","Inglourious Basterds may be Tarantinos masterpiece. The story and the look of the film goes together in a harmonious state, and this is truly a Tarantino-esque film, but it also a great attempt at making a classic. It contains all of the right elements. It looks great, the colors, the framing of the pictures, the use of light, the acting, the directing, is of the highest quality.<br/><br/>When first seeing this film in cinema I instantly exclaimed to my friend that Tarantino was back. Referring to the flop of Deathproof, and the ""hiatus"" with guest directing with CSI and Sin City, since Kill Bill 2 in 2004 it seemed that Tarantino had faded away, but now that the Inglourious Basterds would put him back on the map, in 2009. (Even though that Deathproof is one of my Tarantino unsung heroes)<br/><br/>I think that the film never has a dull moment, a very bold statement, but looking back at the first time I saw the film, and every time I see it again the film is even better. The various stories and characters we are presented with, coupled with great dialog and cinematography, the film comes together in a unified greatness.<br/><br/>Other (American) films that centers on WW2 often focuses on the experiences of America, even though that it almost never a moment that seem to be a true story from WW2, it is one of the realistic WW2 films in the way it uses language. Where Americans seems ignorant(many might have known German), and that most Europeans fluently talk in English, German and french fluently.<br/><br/>Interesting points with the film is also, in the way that Hans Landa rarely seems cruel, but the American troops is out to kill for the pleasure of killing. And Tarantino seems to mirror the applause and shouting with pride, the Nations Pride gets from its audience, with how the Basterds both kill and scalp the Germans with joy. Should we applause? Feel prideful? If so, do we get at the ""same level"" as the ignorant Germans? Are the Germans right in applauding the unlimited shooting from Pvt. Zoller?<br/><br/>But aside from the WW2 classical dilemmas and often clichés, its a fresh film with such a strong narrative from Tarantino, but a very Tarantino-esque film, with the addition of being a very strong film on its own rights. I am very fond of the way Tarantino tells his stories, but this is his masterpiece, where also non-Tarantino fans can/should enjoy it. He is not trying to make up a new form for filmmaking(which much of his early films can feel like), he is just trying to make a great film, and in my mind he succeeded."
"nkt1911","5","0","0","26 August 2014"," Like it but disappointed as well.
","I feel uncomfortable watching the movie because there are so many impossibilities in the plot, in other words, I find many of the scenes are illogical which rendered it an unrealistic atmosphere in general. For example, the SS Major in the tavern who, as we can all see, did lived up to his name as a cunning SS officer, who could detect the unusual accent of the in-disguise-lieutenant just in a few words, and he did showed his remarkable knowledge when playing cards with the Basterds. But he strangely did not recognize Hugo, who infamously killed 13 SS officers as an enlisted man, the majority of whom are of major rank, same as Hellstrom. And supposedly, Hellstrom had served quite sometimes in France, as we can deduce from his conversation, but it is like he didn't take into account of the Basterds. His decision to point his gun at the English guy, is so premature and risky that I don't think an officer of his calibre would ever take, didn't he know that there are 4 enemies surrounded him when he did that? There were a bunch of soldiers behind him that he can rely on, but he carelessly took the risk alone, what? He is not Heydrich. And after the shooting in the tavern that resulted in the deaths of almost everyone, Hellstrom included, the Willhelm guy taking cover behind the bar stand cautiously with his MP40 pointing out. But when the guy out there negotiated him to drop his gun, he suddenly walked out of cover which makes him immediately vulnerable to gunfire, which was proved true. Seriously? Where is the survival instinct of a father that wanted to live? Moving out of cover right after dropping his gun? There is a separate chamber in the tavern that he could have hidden (where Hellstrom had been reading book), but after all it is just Taratino style of killing characters, abruptly. In other scene, during the film premiere, the re-enactment of Hitler personal security is pathetic. There were only 2 guys guarding him, killing the final boss has never been made so easy, but still it is the director style of abrupt killing, I bet. And before that, there are no guard, not a single German guard in the whole kino! Anyone can run around cooking, sleeping, stair sliding, make-believe suicide bombing,.. in a small place that currently holds more than 300 high profile persons of Nazi war machine. And that helps make the assistant guy block the exit so easily (?) and then burnt it down because no Nazi intelligence knew what ""behind the scene"" (Landa didn't know, he only knows about the bomb). Even if Landa ordered the guards to leave, it is still strange enough that nobody in the room noticed anything, or none of them wanted to go out during the movie playing to do something ""private""? The absolution of how things happen in movie always gives me an uncomfortable feeling. These 350 people are so soulless. And what also matters to me, in the end of the movie, the driver got shot by a single bullet in the belly and fall to his death in a sudden (?). Did no one recall how the Basterds survived 3 or 4 bullets in the tavern and returned fire? That is it for how my disappointment is for the illogicality of the screenplay, or plot. I try to see it as a masterpiece but it just couldn't reach the standard. The only thing that is good is the superb acting of the actors/actresses. There is high profile Brad Pitt on the cover but there are really no memorable moments of the Basterds' individual role that is left in my heart, they are more like supporting crews, while the other German, French actors that are however, truly the great guys that make this film great. The director Taratino famous (as what I have heard) style of character progression is again showed in the movie, he makes us love the characters, then suddenly lets them die in a sudden and violent way, pretty much I have no issue with violence but I just don't like it, because it is so stressful for viewers and the causes that lead to the deaths of his characters are pretty much nonsensical in my views and that does annoy me, but that is maybe because I rarely watch his movies, or recent Hollywood blockbusters in general, so my opinion is not rightfully just, and I do aware that this is just the artistic aspect of movies, Tarantino's that are. All and all, the movie just falls short of, but I do recommend it and I do like it, just not enough for me to say I love it."

","I did enjoy this movie, although it is a little bit fragmented and the 'message' (if there is one) is rather confusing.<br/><br/>It's certainly unique. It's great to see a modern movie that isn't frightened to operate in different languages and make a real effort to understand and represent other countries' cultures.<br/><br/>It's also great to see a war movie that focuses on some surprising and quirky settings and characters - the scenes in a bar and in a cinema are excellent.<br/><br/>Best of all, Christoph Waltz's performance as Hans Landa, the 'Jew Hunter', is simply superb as I think many others have said. Brad Pitt does a good job too.<br/><br/>The problem is that the great scenes and performances aren't joined up into a coherent or compelling story. It is basically a revenge plot (like other Tarantino movies) and invites you to glory in the Jews getting one over the Nazis in an alternative-history storyline, but it didn't have any depth or complexity. The ending is bit too neat and satisfying for a movie about WW2.<br/><br/>All in all I did enjoy it but I wouldn't list this under Tarantino's greatest movies."
"gerfalcon7","7","0","0","11 August 2014"," Even after Django, people don't seem to understand how to watch this film.
","This review does NOT contain spoilers in terms of plot development or outcome, but it does discuss a few intermittent scenes.<br/><br/>I will give a 'reading' of this film as briefly as I can. I can't believe I'll spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but maybe at least some who have seen it will re-consider their assessment. I would think that after the release of Django, viewers would figure out that Tarantino creates 'homages' and some people have pointed out the 'homage' aspect of 'Inglourious Basterds.' But the 'homage' of this film is a bit different from others. The major difference, I believe, is that it is an intentionally BAD film to make a statement on film convention. To sum up, I found Inglourious Basterds to be one long cinematic joke--an ironic joke.<br/><br/>Nothing in this movie should be interpreted without considering that Tarantino wants you to understand you're watching a movie. The problem is that many people who watch movies don't think about the fact they're watching one, or forget they're watching one (suspension of disbelief, etc). Tarantino wants you to be aware of this--what better way than to create some very ""bad"" cinematic moments? Why? Because if the film were 'good' you'd focus on the things most films are meant for you to focus on"": plot, story, dialog, acting, art direction, structure, mise en scene, etc. Bertolt Brecht used a similar method in his plays; he wanted the audiences to be aware that they were watching plays so that they would consider and contemplate the political message of the play rather than entering that 'fictive dream' that is a form of escapism.<br/><br/>One thing about this film is that it is difficult to 'escape' the fact that you're watching a film. Hence, it is an instructional film on filmmaking. A film like the Dirty Dozen, for example, has you rooting for the dozen and cheering when they firebomb the Nazi upper-crust because you get riveted to the story. There's nothing in Inglourious Basterds to get riveted to except thinking about how it pays homage to this or that movie, or how implausible it is as a story. IN other words, this movie is a satire of movie convention.<br/><br/>I think that is why there are a number of 'sitting around the table' scenes that are are very long and tedious. They are not meant to be believable as cinematic art because if they were they would be defeating the purpose of the film. They're artifice and the best way to demonstrate artifice is to point it out directly. Jean-Luc Goddard did this when he filmed light cables that threaded their way through a mise en scene right where the actors were performing to keep you aware that you were watching a movie. Tarantino does it here by creating both utter clichés and utterly 'bad' filmmaking. For example, in an opening scene, when a German officer speaks perfect French to a French farmer, then stops, says he has limited French-speaking abilities, and then speaks in English to the French farmer who also happens to speak English is pretty goofy,implausible and even boring. But It's meant to be. When a Nazi hunter doesn't order his men who are sitting around a jeep to run down and kill a Jewish girl while she is running through the countryside--and instead had a grin on his face is equally absurd--the suggestion is that they will meet again one day. How does he know this? Because it's a movie.<br/><br/>But that's OK, because we're not seeing an attempt to create a cinematic version or interpretation of historical events because all such movies are fabrications. All movies are fabrications, of course, and Tarantino is trying to remind the viewers of the fact. We are seeing an exercise in how a filmmaker controls what goes into the art. If Tarantino wants to create a bad scene, then he does so. It's as if he were saying, ""I'm so in command of the grammar of cinema that I I'll make this scene too long, contrived, clichéd, dull, etc., just to show I know the good and bad aspects of cinema.<br/><br/>He even has one actor, Mike Myers, play a clichéd version of his own clichéd actor's persona. Myers is not portraying a British officer. He's portraying Mike Myers as an actor. Consider the range of jokes in the film. They go from the sublime to the ridiculous, the latter evident when Brad Pitt tries to fake an Italian accent at a gathering of SS officers. That is straight out of The Three Stooges or Mel Brooks. Additionally, the alteration of the Nazi sniper spy movie and the subsequent flames leaping around the movie screen have all the production values of an Ed Wood movie. You don't see ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" because it's a good movie. You see it because it's a bad movie, although you might say it's so bad that it's good.<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting that I'm a Tarantino fan. I really don't care what movies he makes or why. I haven't seen ""Kill Bill"" which I believe he directed. This stuff isn't rocket science, so I wouldn't use such words as 'genuis' or 'brilliant.' But at least it's a change of pace from the usual Hollywood garbage.<br/><br/>You could take every scene and shot, and about every line of dialog from this film and find a meta-communicative aspect. That's why it would be way too tedious to truly critique the film. It would take a thousand pages or so. But you get the idea. Now go find a few 'bad jokes' of your own if you have the inclination. BTW, what better way to show the artifice of film titles and to draw attention to a film title, in particular, the way titles of films are used as a function of public relations, than to misspell one?"

","It's very daring for talented filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino to make violent films that can turn out controversial and change historical facts in them, but get the result of an amazing film. QT creates 'Inglourious Basterds', spelled wrong on purpose and about a group of American Secret service men called the Basterds who kill Nazi's during WW II. Lt. Aldo Raine is the leader of the group, a militant American who has no mercy for the Nazi cowards. Raine is played hilariously by Brad Pitt. 'Inglourious Basterds' has a million sub-plots. Christoph Waltz is a high-ranking German who ends up interacting with the bastards and is surprisingly funny and likable, which is realistic. Out of their evil work, the Nazi's were normal people which is Tarantino's point. A young Jew also tries to get revenge against the Nazi's as well for murdering her friends and family in the opening scene, which is as riveting as any cinematic experience you'll ever see. This WW II film has Hitler and history changed in unimaginable ways outside Quentin Tarantino's brilliant mind. Tarantino's originality in not only this masterpiece, but his other works is so unique and sophisticated that it should be cherished in the art world. His directing is great as well, giving us great shots and creative visuals that make the film unique visually as well. The other aspects such as editing, cinematography, production and costume design help this creative gem become even realer, and believable. Not a second in this film is goofy to the point that it feels like a spoof. Tarantino makes every scene believable to the point that it gets weird. The film has hilarious scenes, to depressing and riveting scenes that make your blood curl, to absolutely heart-pounding action that make this masterpiece and instant classic and one of Quentin Tarantino's true works of art."

Or as Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) would have suggested, getting a whack at planting Uncle Adolph would have made this a horse of a different color.<br/><br/>Well I've always liked Tarantino's story telling style. Somehow he makes the grotesque entertaining, or almost entertaining if you're squeamish about things like scalping Nazis and branding foreheads with swastikas. OK, entertaining is probably not the right word, more like fascination with a train wreck that you can't help watching as the train cars collide and smash into each other as you stand by helplessly.<br/><br/>He also gives you something to think about. Like Colonel Hans Landa's (Christoph Waltz) squirrel/rat comparison. The colonel's explanation made perfect sense, there's not much difference between the two if you just forget about the tail. That was just a stunning observation.<br/><br/>Well this obviously is not the kind of movie for everyone, and by now most fans know what old Quentin is up to with his pictures. You're going to get generous amounts of blood and gore, but also a fairly intriguing story if you stay with it. No happy endings of course, but that comes with the territory.

","Even though the title is virtually identical to Enzo G. Castellari's 1978 Italian warsploitation 'classic' The Inglourious Bastards, Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is most definitely NOT a remake. Far from it. Not only is it one of Tarantino's more original efforts to date, but it also one of his best films for a long time, a riveting tale of derring-do that features plenty of everything that made his first two movies such a success: great dialogue, wonderful performances (Christoph Waltz is brilliant, as is an almost unrecognisable Mike Myers), excellent pacing, impressive direction, explosive violence, fantastic use of music, and more than a few playful visual touches of the kind that only Quentin seems to be able to get away with.<br/><br/>Despite being fairly talky in places, with the bulk of the dialogue spoken in either German or French (and subtitled in English), the film is a thoroughly absorbing experience, with not a boring moment in its entire 153 minutes. The long conversational scenes are brilliantly executed and entertaining in their own right, but they also serve to make the violence seem even more explosive and brutal when it happens. And boy, is it nasty when it wants to be, with bloody scalpings, repeated baseball bat blows to the skull, and point-blank gunshots to the nether regions amongst the graphic carnage on display.<br/><br/>It's not all typically cool Tarantino monologues and OTT gore, though: in an extremely bold move, the writer/director eventually steers events into fantastical territory, rewriting history to suit his whims. Those who have slated the film for its lack of historical accuracy are completely missing the point: Quentin is giving us his version of events, entertainment being the number one priority, facts be damned. It's daring movie-making and a whole lot of fun when approached with the right attitude."

From the mind of a man who has made some of the best violent films of all time, you have to expect a little blood and you get it too, I personally felt that the film was firmly very good, and here is why I think so below.<br/><br/>The story is fun and energetic and although it starts of in a darker tone than most of the film goes in, it still manages to pack fun and action that is half humorous half absurd. I especially enjoyed that the film doesn't take itself too seriously as a history piece and as is seen in the final scenes, they have never read a history book but it works and you feel you have thoroughly entertained as well. Finally the plot also works well as the characters bring so much diversity to it with varied performances that just the make the story even better.<br/><br/>The cast do a solid job and although I did feel Brad Pitt at the helm wasn't anywhere near his best, as a group it goes well anyways. I as I think many others loved the deliciously evil Christoph Waltz as the Nazi officer who is a weirdly kind of nice person who also can slaughter everyone he comes into contact with. I did feel actors such as Michael Fassbender and Til Schweiger Were under used and had a lot more promise to give the story but it doesn't hurt the music that badly at all. Lastly on the cast, Melanie Laurent does a great job, and having seen her mainly in Romance's and straight Drama's, this is a majorly good turn for her.<br/><br/>Tarantino writing and directing does a job that is rare in film, producing yet another at the least Very Good film and he isn't finished yet either. He crafts this sweetly with his fine touches of brilliance and although this isn't his best, it does a job in itself. Eli Roth helps Tarantino with the directing and is uncredited so maybe a shout to him for his help, on another note although the gore may disturb some, I have to say the prosthetics used are magnificent and beautifully crafted into some horrible looking wounds, great work from costume too make this a respectfully good looking film + great cinematography used also.<br/><br/>The film is very long yes, and by the end is can start to drag also with some parts where you just want them to leave and move, but in any case it is fun even for the running time. Sometimes the violence and gore can seem very unnecessary and as if they could have just the left that person alone for the sake of not offending the viewers senses, but yet again it somehow manages to do it well enough to not offend you, well in my case it didn't but some people will dislike this film with a vengeance.<br/><br/>I think Tarantino fans will love this as he continues his good work on and on and with a completely different setting we see him grasp new situation, so it is fun. Those who also like War setting films should enjoy as it truly grasps certain elements that other popular WW2 films have taken, although this isn't really based on any WW2 missions and it isn't the US army so just a heads up. Those who hate blood etc will absolutely dislike this so stay away, I don't want to put people off but I guess you have to be warned before you criticise it. <br/><br/>Overall a 8/10 from me, it was Firmly Very Good and although at first I was saying it was Great and Excellent, I gradually lowered it as I felt it is of course very good just not any higher than that. Sit back and enjoy Tarantino at his best though and although this isn't so much on par with ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Kill Bill"", it still turns out Very Good truly showing the talent of this man as both Director and Writer, here's to another load of years of his work."

","I've seen this film twice, the second time on TV only last week. It's about a group of US Jewish Soldiers who are in Europe during WW2 who go about killing Nazi soldiers in the most brutal fashion. Somehow they get mixed up in a strange caper to wipe out the entire Hirearchy Nazi regime including Hitler, Goebbels, Goring, Nazi Generals, wives and girlfriends etc, etc, by locking them in a cinema where they are viewing pro-Nazi propaganda films. The violence throughout the film is shocking and vile, but of course WW2 was a shocking and vile war. The outstanding actor in the film is Christoph Waltz who plays the Nazi Col. Hans Landa who in his scenes uses excellent underlying menace without always using violence itself. The scenes with actor Denis Menochet, who is excellent, and another scene with actress Melanie Laurent, who is also truly wonderful, were memorable. However, I must say that even Christoph Waltz's portrayal of a brutal Nazi is not as good as Ralph Fiennes Nazi, Amon Goeth, in 'Schindlers List.' And August Diehl, who plays Major Hellstrom certainly deserves a mention as do most of the rest of the cast...... Oh, and I almost forgot, Brad Pitt is in there somewhere but I'm not at all sure why....."

","Inglourious Basterds is yet another film to add to Quentin Tarantino's list of masterpieces. It's filled with genius dialogue and heart pounding suspense that will make viewers very anxious at certain points. This historical fiction World War II movie is about a group of Jewish-Americans and a vengeful woman trying to exterminate Nazis and their leaders in Nazi occupied France. This movie also contains some brutal violence and may not be suitable for people that are squeamish. Christoph Waltz, an actor who I had not known before this film, is the ""Jew Hunter"" Col. Hans Landa. Waltz plays this character so well, well enough to win a best supporting actor Academy Award. This movie features a phenomenal cast including Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo ""the Apache"" Raine, Michael Fassbender as Lt. Archie Hicox, and Daniel Brühl as Nazi ""war hero"" Private Fredrick Zoller. They fit their roles so well as if it were made especially for them. Overall, this is a great flick and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys good dialogue and acting as well as two and a half hours of extra time."

","Inglourious Basterds, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, tells the intertwining story of several different characters during World War II. The movie starts with the story of a German Nazi officer Hans Landa, played by Christoph Waltz, questioning a dairy farmer named Perrier LaPadite, played by Denis Ménochet, about whether or not LaPadite was hiding any Jews on his Property. Landa is an infamous officer known as the ""Jew Hunter"" because he is so effective at finding Jews. To keep his family safe LaPadite is force to tell Landa that he is hiding a Jewish family under his floorboards. Landa and his troops open fire on the floorboards, killing everyone underneath, expect for a teenage girl named Shosanna Dreyfus, played by Mélanie Laurent. This opening scene sets up the theme of the movie which is revenge. The following scene is another one to help build upon that theme. In the next scene Brad Pitt's Character Lieutenant Aldo Raine is briefing his troops on their mission to be dropped behind enemy lines and kill as many Nazis as possible. ""And once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhackin' guerrilla army, we're gonna be doin' one thing and one thing only... killin' Nazis."" (Tarantino 2009) All Lt. Raine's Troops also happen to be Jewish-Americans. After this scene the movie goes to Adolf Hitler interview a Nazi Soldier who had a run-in with Lt. Raine and his Basterds and tells of how they carved a swastika into his head and beat another Nazi soldiers head in with a baseball bat. The next scene shows an older Shosanna, who now goes by the name of Emmanuelle Mimieux, working at a theater in Paris. While working she meets Fredrick Zoller, played by Daniel Brühl, who is a German war hero. Zoller is attracted to Shosanna and in an attempt to impress her, he convinces Joseph Goebbels to hold the showing of a Nazi Propaganda film about Zoller's actions during the war and also starring Zoller at her theater. When she learns of the plan to show the movie at her theater and who will be attending, she takes the opportunity to finally have her revenge against the men who killed her family. All of the characters stories finally intertwine at Shosanna's theater where all of the remaining characters are there for the preview of the Nazi propaganda film. Lt. Raine is there undercover with two of his troops as Bridgette Von Hammersmark's film crew. Hitler, Landa and several other Nazi officers are also in attendance. Shosanna runs into Zoller behind stage where he makes an advance and she denies him. Things get physical between the two and she ends up killing him but not before he fatally wounds her.<br/><br/>While the film is running a spliced clip airs showing Shosanna telling the crowd they are going to be killed by a Jew. While this is happening Shosanna's lover Marcel locks down the cinema and lights a pile of highly-flammable film on fire. At the same time two of Raine's troops burst into the cinema and open fire on the crowd. The next scene shows Landa taking driving Lt. Raine and one of his troops to the U.S. line where Landa Surrenders to Lt. Raine. Upset that Landa is going to get away with everything he has done Raine carves a swastika in his forehead so he will always be known as a Nazi. Revenge is a common theme in Tarantino's Films. Whether it be in Inglourious Bastards where Shosanna takes revenge on the men who killed her family or be it in Kill Bill where Uma Thurman's character is seeking revenge on the people who ruined her life and killed her baby. Tarantino was also able to effectively use the lighting and music in the movie to really help you feel what Shosanna was feeling in the end when she had her revenge on the men who killed her family. The theater goes dark and Shosanna comes on screen to tell the audience they are going to die by a Jew. From the music playing, the fire on the screen and the audience screaming you get the satisfaction that she finally gets her revenge"

And yet, this bizarre, over wrought, over written, over scored excuse for a Dirty Dozen remake ranks higher than one of the most unforgettable films of all times. Tarantino's affection for French 'noir', with subtitles, complete with an Ingrid Bergman look alike, actually works. He just can't trust it. it ties it him up it knots to tell the truth. When he gets too close...bring in the vampires! Well. wtf.. the kids love it. He'll get an 8.2.. higher than Citizen Kane.

","In 1940, France is occupied by Nazi Germany. Nazi colonel Hans Landa found a family of Jews who was hidden in a farm. He killed all of them except Shosanna Dreyfus WHO manages to escape. She has fled to Paris where she acquired a theatre. At the same period, in France, the American lieutenant Aldo Raine has created a group of Jewish Americans. Their name: The Basterds. Their goal: kill a maximum of Nazis and take their scalps. Shosanna Dreyfus and these men have the same goal, they will need to join their forces in order to strike a heavy blow...<br/><br/>This Quentin Tarantino World War II movie shows the exact reality of war. Nazi soldiers are described as preys whereas the basterds are represented as heroes. Tarantino switched the roles. During the second World War Nazis killed Jews with brutality but here it is the Nazis who are roughly executed. However, even if evil is fought by the good guys, there were too much violence for an audience composed of children. Tarantino uses humor in order to appease the brutality of executions. We can see that in the nicknames he uses to introduce heroes. He has given fun nicknames which refer to the different ways they kill Nazis. For example, sergeant Donny Donowitz is called the ""Bear Jew"", his nickname refers to the brutality he shows. Nazi soldiers are introduced with an other kind of humor. They speak with a German accent and are really afraid of the Basterds. The excessive wrath of Hitler when he had learned that he lost soldiers is also a way to play down the raw reality of the Second World War.<br/><br/>The opposition between Jewish soldiers and Nazis is sometimes too manichean. But we can't criticise Tarantino's vision of WWII for being too manichean because it should be. That was a war with an unambiguous conflict. That allows a great catharsis for the audience: the evil is killed. That catharsis mixed with Tarantino's humor allow the audience to have a good time. The audience can see heroes who were the victims in history take their revenge against Nazi who represent the executioners in history. Overall, that is a realistic and new kind of WWII movie which gives a new image of this war. The fear changes sides. Tarantino's humor makes you leave the theatre with a smile."

","IT very much depends on what you go in expecting from this movie. Myself i speak fluent English and french so i didn't have to read that much because i would say 40% of the movie is in English, 40% is in french and the rest is either German or Italian. However if you are an English only speaking person and you go in expecting an action movie and you spend more than half the movie reading you might find some scenes very long. <br/><br/>Also if you are not a fan of intelligent LONG dialogue obviously you wont be able to appreciate the beauty of the film and you will get bored. In relation with what I said earlier, understanding more than just the English parts of the movie makes it a far better experience. This is due to the fact that the actual dialogue is a lot better than the subtitles. <br/><br/>Even though I have very average vocabulary and language skills I very much admire people who are able to speak endlessly while staying interesting so I always enjoy a Tarantino movie. (I am a big Stephen Fry fan) <br/><br/>In my opinion these are the things you SHOULD get into your head before watching this movie:<br/><br/>-That it will not be historically correct (obvious to me but some are complaining about this) -That the action is there to compliment the acting and dialogue not the other way round -You WILL have to read a lot -There are miner plot holes that can be aggravating to some -Some gore type scenes"

","I've just recently seen Django: Unchained in theaters, and I must say I was impressed but nothing like I was when I viewed Inglorious Basterds for the first time.<br/><br/>First I just need to say that Christoph Waltz instantly became one of my favorite actors after seeing IG. The opening scene was one for film history. He was able to capture so much tension, and intrigue. Every scene where Waltz's character appears I'm just captivated by the performance.<br/><br/>In no way did this film feel like 2 and 1/2 hours. The time flies so fast. Such a roller coaster. Just watching how the characters will react to there current situation, and the tense/hilarious conversation that will ensue. I should also add (for those of whom do not know) QT is a master at his craft and a master of conversation. I just never get enough of it.<br/><br/>If there is a reason you haven't seen this film then do yourself a favor and go buy (yes BUY) this DVD/bluray and watch it immediately. At least to watch the scene's that contain Waltz.<br/><br/>I should also add that the ending came as a big and much appreciated surprise. Something I would have never expected to have happened, and which caught me off guard in a good way.<br/><br/>So like I said before this is by far one of QT best films.

"advaitkamat","6","0","0","18 January 2013"," An ambitious film that falls short of its potential.
","Four years ago, when I first saw ""Inglourious Basterds"", I felt that it was one of the best films based on World War II. However, after repeated viewings, I could not shake off the feeling that it could've been something extraordinary, given director Quentin Tarantino's penchant of a bunch of complex characters populating an exquisitely structured plot. Yet ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a painfully strident portrayal, and a fictional one too, of the events that transpired to bring down Hitler in 1945. What could be more frustrating than to watch a film cripple slowly because the many ideas it chased for over two hours limp towards the end? Tarantino tries too hard to give it a nice finishing touch but instead turns the plot bland. <br/><br/>Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), a Jewish girl, watches her whole family being massacred by SD Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), a Jew-hater, but escapes death and runs away into hiding. Four years later, Shosanna, now owner of a cinema in Paris, is offered to host the premiere of a Nazi propaganda film based of the exploits of Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), who has taken a liking to her. In the quest for vengeance against the Germans, Shosanna secretly decides to burn down the cinema during the premiere. Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) recruits eight Jewish-American soldiers to take revenge against the Nazis and teach them a lesson in humanity. His ambition is to kill as many Nazi leaders as he possibly can. When Raine learns of the premiere which many members of the German Third Reich will most certainly attend, he cannot resist the temptation to strike the Nazis at the premiere. The film follows the intertwined stories of two parties simultaneously trying to carry out vengeful plans and bring down the Nazi rule.<br/><br/>Though the premise of the film is admirably ambitious and wonderfully detailed, it is brought down by the staggering weight of its ambitions. A peek into the world which Tarantino devises with much cleverness sets the ball rolling, for the opening sequence of the film is nothing short of magnificent. The sequence, mostly relying on dialog between two men, is Tarantino at the top of his game, with its disarming wit and love for language. Tarantino sneaks some suspense in it too, and we delightfully succumb to its marvelous execution. ""Inglourious Basterds"" has got plenty of sequences like this, most notably the bar sequence, which is grisly violent and funny at the same time. Tarantino, a writer of great repute, plies the viewer with a generous dose of witty dialog and keeps the humor consistent throughout the film. Cinematographer Robert Richardson effectively captures the lush greens of Germany in his lens and costume designer Anna B. Sheppard follows it up admirably, thus providing the right atmosphere to the film. I quite enjoyed the film's stylized look, though I'm used to war movies being somewhat rugged. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a well-executed film, and although it has its share of criticism, Tarantino knows his craft well, because the film is thoroughly entertaining.<br/><br/>Though some drawbacks can be overlooked, some of them are too derogatory to be done so. For one, I found the film way too shrill for my taste. Tarantino heavily indulges into irony and his reluctance to embrace some of the facts tends to get infuriating at times. Apart from a few actors, many of them hand in over-the-top performances. It's not hard to guess that they're having the time of their lives trying to dissect some of the characters from the pages of history and adequately trying to portray their interpretation of them but failing, some miserably. The deft script is dealt with a hint of arrogance which, in my view, is the film's weakest point.<br/><br/>Of the performances, Christoph Waltz is absolutely sublime, easily overpowering his fellow actors by stealing every scene he's in. Pitt's performance is shockingly over-the-top, with his raspy voice trying to give Lt. Aldo Raine an identity which doesn't quite connect. Melanie Laurent is the saving grace of a strangely mixed bag of performances.<br/><br/>""Inglourious Basterds"" has the skill which films seldom boast of but the over-the-top performances and the amusingly ambitious plot weaken an otherwise fine film. It is not Tarantino's best film, but if you prefer fiction over facts, it's one film you've got to get hold of."

","I like most of Tarantno's movies so I don't write this review as a QT hater by any means. That being said, this movie is just too self-absorbed for its own good. Way too much dialog that just rambles on and on...seemingly without end in some places. It's a 2.5 hour movie that could have easily 2 hours if not a little less. Couldn't QT bring himself to cut anything from this movie?? It's filled with scenes that are pointless and add nothing to the plot, and many of the scenes that DO add to the movie are simply too long and glib for their own good. Sometimes I think Tarentino is addicted to the sound of his own dialog and as a result has his actors just prattle along without end. ""Death Proof"" had the same problem.<br/><br/>Overall it was a solid flick but it could have been far better."
"slokes","5","0","0","25 December 2011"," Blood And Guts
","The cruelty of various nations in war is measured against their ability to value good international cinema and speak in multiple languages in this frightfully confused, only occasionally arresting offering from Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>People coming to this movie cold may be surprised to discover the title characters, a group of mostly American Jews, really don't figure too much. One can imagine the film going the way it does pretty much without the help of Donnie Donowitz the ""Bear Jew"" (Eli Roth), the anti-authoritarian non-Jewish German Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), and country boy Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), all of whom bring considerable if wasted brio to the proceedings. The central issue is really decided by a pack of brave, cool, cruel Germans and the French chafing under their heel. The Inglourious Basterds themselves just offer a marketing peg.<br/><br/>What was Tarantino aiming for here? I think it was an anti-war film of the art-house variety, where the Germans are presented as majestic if nasty adversaries, in several scenes facing death with a singular calm designed to win us to their side. There's a reason why the most intriguing character, SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), pushes us to accept his humanity even as he commits various atrocities, which is to remind us that war is hell no matter who is on the receiving end.<br/><br/>How can anyone really hate Landa, especially as deliriously played by the alternately vicious and amiable Waltz? ""I love rumors, facts can be so misleading,"" he encourages a Frenchman in his power in a memorable opening scene. ""Rumors, true or false, are often revealing."" The Americans, compared to the quad-lingual Landa, are pretty pathetic characters, so much so one of their German allies moans very understandably at one point: ""I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?"" Well, they better, or at least read subtitles. Tarantino presents a Babel of a film, with a multitude of languages on display.<br/><br/>The film suffers from serious defects, like an unreasonable need to display the director-screenwriter's cinema knowledge at every turn. One sign of the Nazis' strength in this film is their understanding of cinema, whether it be a German sniper's preference of Max Linder over Charlie Chaplin or a Gestapo agent's ability to grasp the black American subtext in the story of King Kong. Joseph Goebbels even approvingly notes the ""church-like quality"" of a theater where he plans to screen a film for his Fuhrer.<br/><br/>Tarantino also extends scenes well beyond the breaking point, occasionally with good results but more often exhausting our desire to follow along. Terrific as this film is from an acting standpoint, and as impressive as its last 30 minutes are, one wonders whether Tarantino the screenwriter overrode Tarantino the director too often. Talking-head shots dominate, and the idea of breaking the movie up into chapters suggest either an overlong novella or a series of idly-connected episodes from a miniseries. Focus is too often lacking.<br/><br/>""Inglourious Basterds"" never bores, but it drains one of their ability, or willingness, to follow along. Tarantino's intentions were in the right place, but did he think people really wanted to watch a bunch of stupid Americans kill stolid Germans? Maybe he wanted to make a point of an American audience cheering on a war movie which features a German audience cheering on a war movie with similar mindless bravado? Impressed as I was at times, I can't say I enjoyed it or felt better from watching it."
"Doylenf","9","7","24","21 August 2009"," Tarantino in top form with brilliant WWII anti-Nazi salute that dares you to look away...
","Quentin Tarantino has taken his anti-Nazi fantasy to new heights with this engrossing dark comedy/fantasy that has ""The Basterds"" (led by BRAD PITT) out for Nazi scalps to add to an ever growing collection. But first and foremost, he has constructed a screenplay that never lets up veering between tension and laughter, and gives several members of his cast a chance at Oscar-winning performances.<br/><br/>Foremost among these is CHRISTOPH WALTZ who waltzes off with all of his scenes by playing the ""Jew Hunter"" with subtle bits of characterization that remind me of a young Conrad Veidt at the height of his powers. He never misses an opportunity to give greater depth to his character's personality quirks and sudden changes of mood that always heighten the tension. The farmhouse scene that starts the story rolling is one of the greatest pieces of sustained suspense I've ever seen any director pull, even Hitchcock.<br/><br/>My only quibble with the film, in fact, would be the extended bar scene in which a clever plot to trap some Nazi officers goes awry. The director could have tightened the whole sequence with a cut of some ten or more minutes.<br/><br/>But who's going to voice complaints when the film is fiendishly clever from start to finish, and so well executed that you leave the theater after being spellbound for the duration of the lengthy story. All of the performances surrounding BRAD PITT and CHRISTOPH WALTZ are pitch perfect and Pitt himself is mighty amusing as the Southern lieutenant who likes to cut Swastikas into the skulls of his German foes.<br/><br/>DENIS MENOCHET is superb as the farmer in the film's opening scene, matching the convincing performance of CHRISTOPH WALTZ every step of the way. Not enough praise can be said for the performances Tarantino has gotten from his entire cast and that includes MELANIE LAURENT who has a key role as the only woman who manages to escape the massacre that opens the film. Her interaction with a German officer (DANIEL BRUHL) who is attracted by her is a fascinating one, especially since she has no intention of succumbing to his courteous flirtations.<br/><br/>This is definitely putting Tarantino's best foot forward--and if it doesn't end up with several Oscar nominations in both acting and technical categories, I'll be very surprised.<br/><br/>Just brilliant."
"filmiky","4","6","20","23 August 2009"," Tarantino sold out...?
","Overall good effort, with some memorable scenes and dialogues. While some people complain of stretched dialogues, I quite enjoyed them, even though they really drag here and there.<br/><br/>However, this film was too serious to be a comedy and too messed up to be serious. It was trying to be many things, which ended up like a goulash, which wasn't that tasty.<br/><br/>Christoph Waltz was the magnetic presence on screen, while Brad Pitt was relegated to sticking his chin out and delivering a completely flat and uninteresting character of some kind of ""leader"". The central plot seemed to be that of a personal revenge, which a chance encounter delivers to the sole survivor (Shoshana) of a family killing executed by none other but Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). Then we have the ""basterds"" who really appear only occasionally and come off as a group of amateurs, who are at the same time supposedly very dangerous (their reputation is never built up properly in the early parts of the film, but the spectator is to take it for granted). Then we have the English and the secret operation which goes bust. Hitler is depicted as an incomplete nitwit, with Goebels as a little more complete nitwit. The story of the ""basterds"" was not developed to be that glorious, just as the story of the revenge by Shoshana (even if completed successfully) felt a little patched. What's left is the 'underlying' story of Colonel Landa, who just truly enjoyed doing what he was doing best - hunting people and taking care of security.<br/><br/>But on a higher scale - my problem, anyways, with this movie is a slight ideological undertone. When it was done, I realized this is a story about ""how the WWII was won by a group of American Jews"". As other people pointed out, the finale does not feel very satisfying in terms of a climax of a 2.5 hours long film, and there are some really questionable scenes of shooting into the crowd of anonymous movie goers. If this movie is there to serve as a 'catharsis' of sorts for Jewish moviegoers, then it probably succeeded. Even though the whole film did not pretend to be anything serious, there was way too much of historical realities, scenery and props to create the feel of real Nazi-occupied territory. Basterds finally shoot Hitler, the rest of the Nazis burn down or are blasted in the final explosion, and Shoshana laughs diabolically in the background, saying something like ""this is the Jew's revenge on your head...etc"". Something wrong with that scene, from my perspective anyway. And consequently, from the beginning of the movie, I couldn't quite shake off the feeling, that Tarantino was rather approached by others to make this film, as opposed to writing it out of his own motivation.<br/><br/>And come to think of it - the main villain (Colonel Landa), pivotal in the Shoshana's revenge story, manages to wiggle himself out of trouble, negotiate a pretty good settlement with the Americans, and not be shot by Aldo in the end. (It is quite insignificant that Hitler is shot, as he was portrayed as an idiot anyway). As it turned out - Aldo (Brad Pitt) had to answer to a higher command too, so the aura of adventurousness and righteousness in this group of ""basterds"" falls flat, especially after lines like ""we don't leave no survivors"" and such. The swastika cut into Lando's forehead will most probably be taken care of by some very skilled plastic surgeon in his new home...so the ending from that perspective is a little confusing.<br/><br/>On top of that, Tarantino decided to pay homage to great filmmakers of the past with visual and dialogue references, but what was the real effect for the film is unknown. Visual and narrative styles vary and switch, as if to cram as many references into the film as possible. By referring to the masters of the past, Tarantino then invokes necessarily a question whether this is his shot at greatness as well...? Question in my mind after the movie was this - would any of the great directors of the past made such film? I don't think so.<br/><br/>The only thing, as mentioned in the beginning, were some memorable dialogues (the story of the Negro in the American world!) and how the director managed to weave even into a war anti-Nazi movie the topic of the movies itself - the German actress, the cinema owner, Goebbels' propaganda movies, hero-actor, and the story basically built around a premiere screening of a film."

I agree with half of that; the film is beautiful, and really truly beautiful not just through the shots (some of which are incredible, no doubt) but through the atmosphere created by the film.

","A Tarantino effort equates to a movie of extreme violence but usually with a purpose. This time he tried too hard and creates a mess. It starts off well; the opening scenes are well crafted and gripping. But with such a poorly written screen play, the film can do nothing more than free fall into a near slap stick farce. Brad Pitt is likable but his acting is at best average. He seems to be allowed to do whatever he pleases. Use any accent you want because this film is not a serious work of art anyway. <br/><br/>Now understand this is a work of fiction. However, let's not be so open minded that our brains fall out! Sorry that I must spoil the movie a bit to make the point that fiction does not give you license to ignore all plausibility. A poor teenage Jewish girl who lived under a dairy farmer's house escapes to own and operate a valuable theater in Nazi controlled France in less than 3 years! She has a black boyfriend. Hitler, Goring and Gommels are coming to a premier at her theater with hardly any armed guards and little security. A black man can pile a mountain of flammable film on stage behind the screen and not one German check it out even though the most important men in the German government are coming. The black man can just walk around and lock all the doors without anyone caring. American men who can barely speak understandable English pretend to speak Italian and can walk right in with 20 pounds of dynamite strapped to their legs. Incredible war-ending-deals can be made by short wave radio in mere minutes. Hitler and his most trusted advisor's are all killed and the deal is honored. Why bother just shoot the German, Pitt could do no wrong in the movie. Ugh. No rules, no plausibility, no story, not even a good revenge angle for the Jewsih girl that was dying to be told. Instead a lame death for her and a poorly crafted ending with the Scarlet Letter theme. <br/><br/>Yet like all Quentin Tarantino movies, many scenes are artfully done and can be very entertaining. Still powerful because it generated so much after viewing debate. The effort here just seems wasted."
"Chris_Docker","8","5","16","16 August 2009"," Hillbilly Brad
","Motor-mouth director, Quentin Tarantino is rather good at killing people. Fast. Slow. Or slo-mo. But always inventively. Death may be delayed with deviously droll asides or a bit of creative torture. An ear deliciously sliced off in Reservoir Dogs. An all-girl singalong with action replays of our fatal car-smash for Deathproof. Wedding massacre in Kill Bill. Or death requiring an internal carwash in Pulp Fiction. Inglourious Basterds is no exception. Death is nasty, funny, almost operatic. But never boring. One could almost write an outline based on who dies and how.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt (Aldo Raine) leads an unconventional group of Jewish Americans behind enemy lines in World War II. Their fighting style includes Apache Indian tactics to terrorize the Nazis. Graphic violence is mixed with tongue-twisting wittiness in Tarantino's peerless signature style. The dialogue is developed to delay inevitable slaughter with ingenious irreverence. Stock characters are engineered with comic book gusto - and are so colourfully convincing that departures from historical fact seem mere details. A mesmerisingly multilingual special officer, Hans 'The Jew Hunter' Lands (with an award-winning performance from Christoph Waltz) is main antagonist to Brad's 'Basterds', as well as two other camps (French Jew Shosanna, and Churchill's Brits plus Diane Kruger) who similarly plot to blow up Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels and the big bad guys. All in a giant conflagration of dynamite, double-agents, guns and plenty of old nitrate film. This happens at an old cinema which is showing a triumphant Nazi propaganda movie-within-the-movie, coincidentally directed by (Jewish) Eli Roth. Who coincidentally plays baseball-bat-bearing Donny Donnowitz, 'Bear Jew,' and who dispatches Nazis by beating them bloodthirstily to a pulp.<br/><br/>When you expect violence, you get just sardonic wink. When you don't, you get full-on, glorious, extended, blood-and-guts. Femme Fatales meanwhile deconstruct stereotypes and inject fashion into daring mise-en-scene and plot-devices. Shosanna (Melanie Laurent)'s enviable red dress kicks off a climactic chapter with feminine visual splendour and predictably subverts the traditional macho of war films. Obscure soundtrack references are abandoned for Bowie's more visceral Cat People which explodes into our eardrums, and the fire of the Fuhrer is threatened with a heavy dose of gasoline. Zoe Bell leaps invisibly from Deathproof leading lady to stunt-double for Laurent and Kruger and the action finale delivers pay-off for a rather wordy middle section.<br/><br/>There are more historical and cult film references (of varying levels of difficulty) than you could shake from a shibboleth of war movies. It is very clever. It is very Tarantino. It is very art-house. But is it good entertainment? Stylistically, it recalls Pulp Fiction more than any of the director's other work. But the extended inter-action dialogues sometimes flag more than in his earlier glories. It still has great commercial appeal - fortunately for Mr Weinstein, whose flagging production company needs shekels to offset 500 million dollars of debts. But is it Tarantino's masterpiece that has been ten years in the making? For some, Inglourious Basterds could seem like Tarantino-lite. Perhaps more blood-letting and less word-games would have better satisfied our lust for passive cinema, big stars, three-second cuts and more explosions than obscure eponyms. And for serious cinema-goers, while acknowledging Tarantino's nod to French New Wave, are we not entitled to ask if his films are going to have a point? ""We're French. We respect directors in our country,"" Shosanna quips. Yes, but should they not also demonstrate substance to deserve it? Godard shot a lot of film just to question film-making styles. Only later did he seek to make films of depth. Each of Tarantino's films is like the arrival of a new voice in cinema. Yet having found his voice, what exactly does he want to say? Any new ground with Inglourious Basterds is firmly in the realm of genre manipulation. I didn't feel it said anything new about Jews and Germans. And questions of race or language seem necessary conceits within the film rather than earth-shaking profundities. Tarantino can justify every aspect of the film to anyone who listens. Maybe I'm making ungrateful quibbles. Maybe our children's children will speak of him with reverence. And if you are a Tarantino fan like I am, you will probably watch it twice anyway, whatever it's faults. Does a film need any further justification?"

"jdkraus","10","4","12","29 August 2009"," Violent as hell...but I think Quentin Tarantino has made himself another good one
","I wouldn't call myself a die-hard Quentin Tarantino fan, but I appreciate his work and the stories he tells in his movies. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a true Quentin Tarantino film. It is another great film of his, but it is not his best.<br/><br/>When I say ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a true Tarantino film, it is a story made up of a bunch of other stories that are related and tied together for one big finale. This maybe considered a boring approach to a film, and yes, the movie does drag quite a bit, but it's still interesting.<br/><br/>Also, like in his other films, the characters conversations are made up of small talk and BS. In fact, there's scene halfway into the movie where several Americans are undercover, secretly discussing their plans while surrounded in a basement full of drunken Nazis. What seems to be a boring scene is intense, because you don't know if one of them might say or do something that might start the next ""OK Coral Shootout"". <br/><br/>Adding more authenticity, the characters that are German speak German. Those who are French, speak French. It gets somewhat tiresome in keeping up with the subtitles, but I personally like that Tarantino did this in his film. It makes the movie feel more realistic, while other Hollywood directors take the shortcut in having everyone speaking English. <br/><br/>In addition, the characters rarely tell the plot; rather it develops through the characters actions and their solitary schemes. This really helps humanize all the characters, most of which are quite despicable but you still love them and it hurts to watch many of them die horrible deaths. The Nazis are depicted as the ""bad guys"", but somehow Tarantino magically makes them people you can both pity and even respect.<br/><br/>The best performance in the whole movie, in my opinion, belongs to Christoph Waltz, who plays Colonel Hans Landa aka ""The Jew Hunter"". He doesn't just deliver his lines, he makes them flow in such a way that it complements his character. He's a guy to hate, but also one to respect. He's not a bumbling idiot, a stereotypical Nazi like in The Indiana Jones films, but a cruel, charming, and intelligent German soldier. I've never heard of Christoph Waltz before, but I hope at the very least he gets an Oscar nomination. <br/><br/>All the other actors are superb because they become their characters. The other two noteworthy performances belong to Melanie Laurent as Shoshanna and Brad Pitt as Aldo Raines. I've never heard of Melanie Laurent, but to me, her character, Shoshanna is the one I like the most. I consider her the ""femme fatal"". She's stunning gorgeous, but because of what the Nazis had done to her, she becomes a schemer who plots to kill Nazis but is marked by a complete, unanticipated downfall by her hatred. I hope she gets an Oscar nom in the supporting category too. <br/><br/>As with Brad Pitt, I consider his role as Lt. Aldo Raines as one of his best. He maintains a good ""hick"" accent, and he delivers some of the funniest lines ever while keep a straight face. It's easy to say he had a blast making this film. He probably won't receive a nom, but I'd keep my fingers crossed. <br/><br/>Overall, script, performances, direction, editing, and cinematography all excellent. I even enjoyed the music that Quentin Tarantino uses from the old ""Spaghetti Westerns"". It is somewhat ridiculous, but it actually blends into the film nicely. <br/><br/>But there are two things that prevent this film from getting a perfect score. One is the pass. There is some action in it, but most of it comes at the very end of the film for the big bloodbath. Some of the dialog was too drawn out and unnecessarily long. When a movie is over two hours, my butt starts itching in the theater seat. And the other thing is the violence.<br/><br/>I know that when I walked into the theater, I was in for a violent movie. In his past films, Tarantino over-exaggerates his violence, almost to the point that it is comical, like in the ""Kill Bills"". Some of the violence in ""Inglourious Basterds"" is rather comical, but most of it comes to the point that it is unbearable and sadistic. Tarantino has no limits in what he shows in his films, but I do. Some people can handle it, many others can't. It became too much for me. <br/><br/>In fact, I found it distracting from the story. I get the idea that Nazis are getting mowed down with machine gun fire, but it doesn't need to go on and on and on. I like this movie, but it becomes too much towards the end."
"max-vernon","9","4","12","28 August 2009"," Emotionally satisfying revenge for the Holocaust
","Tarantino's Holocaust film is to be welcomed. It is intelligent, entertaining, witty, stylish and, above all, well-written. I felt as though I had just watched a European film and not just because most of it is in subtitles. <br/><br/>The film raises several interesting issues:<br/><br/>1. Adorno posed the question, ""Can there be culture after Auschwitz?"" The answer is clearly 'Yes'. For some Holocaust survivors with 'survivor guilt' the answer to this question was an emphatic 'No': they killed themselves. But theirs is a different narrative to ours sitting in our comfortable cinema seats. Time moves on and the generation with first-hand Holocaust experience is dying out. In fact, during the last 60 years their perspective has remained largely incomprehensible to the rest of us. The Holocaust has become part of the warp and weft of Western civilisation and pops up all over the place. It has become integral to our culture as well as our history. It is a subject for cultural projects, just like baroque composers raiding ancient history for their operas. Making art out of human suffering is, it appears, part of the human condition. Sensuous music is written about the Passion of Christ.<br/><br/>2. Demonising the Nazis may be emotionally satisfying but has never made much sense in terms of understanding their history. The Christoph Waltz SS character dominates this film: attractive, multilingual, cultivated, urbane, efficient, well-mannered – but still capable of strangling a female traitor with his bare hands. He deserves an Oscar. This sympathetic portrayal of individual SS men is nothing new: witness the Muntze character in 'Black Book' (2006). Likewise, Branagh's Heydrich in 'Conspiracy' (2001) is no beast. The Romans thought themselves civilised. So did the Southern planter aristocracy. So did the owners of British country houses built on the profits of the Slave Trade. Intelligence, culture and refinement can go hand in hand with brutality. The multi-lingual talents of Daniel Bruhl are used for the same effect.<br/><br/>3. Tarantino refers to the success of the Nazi film industry. High art could flourish under the Nazis, which is why so many intellectuals and artists continued to work under the Nazis in both Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe. 'The Triumph of the Will' won gold medals in Venice and Paris. <br/><br/>For all their sentimental peddling of folkish, 'back to the soil' nostalgia to the masses, the Nazi elite were really into high culture. Essentially lower-middle class social climbers, they organised galas around theatre, film, opera and classical music where they could rub shoulders with Germany's old elite whom they intended to absorb and supplant. Brutality went hand in hand with culture. Living in the confiscated villas of wealthy Berlin Jews, stealing works of art from all over Europe, the Nazi elite were, quite literally, on the make socially and on the take materially! Tarantino's film conveys a flavour of this Nazi beau monde in which the SS were a new chivalric order, a knightly class based on blood purity, loyalty and self-sacrifice.<br/><br/>4. The 'Basterds' are the thugs of the film rather than the Nazis and are responsible for most of the gory violence. The idea of scalping dead Nazis was a brilliant leitmotif. Famously Hitler thought there was no difference between his project of extermination and settlement in Eastern Europe and what was still going on in the American West at the time of his birth. Indians scalping Whites who were wiping them out. Jews scalping Nazis who were wiping them out. Makes perfect sense!<br/><br/>However, here we have an American director engaged in self-parody. Hitler thought of Americans as decadent mongrels emasculated by a Jewish-Negro culture. The Brad Pitt character is a parody of this concept: monosyllabic, monolingual and almost one-dimensional. Not really as appealing as the Waltz character. Yet these dumb (unsophisticated) Americans did win the war and the Pitt character prevails to inscribe (literally) his own (sophisticated?) brand of justice at the end.<br/><br/>5. Post-1945 history and culture are littered with references to Nazis in hiding and others who raked over their Nazi past. UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, Adolf Eichmann, Josef Mengele, West German President Lubke, The Odessa File, The Quiller Memorandum - fact and fiction, the list is endless. As late as the 1970's many people believed that Hitler had faked his death and was living in South America. George Steiner even wrote a novella about his capture. The world was full of closet Nazis and their collaborators!<br/><br/>Tarantino's other brilliant leitmotif is carving swastikas into the foreheads of Nazis he allows to live. Historically such branding was used for social ostracism and many would agree that too many Nazis escaped their past too easily.<br/><br/>6. Ultimate vengeance is wreaked on the Nazis by a young Jewish female and her Black lover. This is both banal and emotionally satisfying. The film has recruited women, Blacks and Germans into the anti-Nazi camp as well as Jews and Allies. Nazis in occupied Paris were appalled by the number of Blacks they saw. The fact that Hitler did not die in the summer of 1944 does not exclude the possibility that he could have: 'Valkyrie' (2009) explains this. Tarantino dispatches Hitler and his cronies with his own contrived fiery holocaust. This is emotionally satisfying and a clever play on the Nazi concept of Twilight of the Gods as well as a reference to the millions of Jews turned into ash.<br/><br/>History and the cultural representations of history are fast becoming an indistinguishable melange. This was always the case in literature and film is accelerating the process. I fear a growing number of people are unable to distinguish between what is real and what is not. Yet another reason to support the teaching of history in our schools."
"jcdugger","10","4","12","27 August 2009"," ""I think this just might be my masterpiece""...
","Quentin Tarantino. What else can possibly be said about the most admired, fearless, and successful Director in Cinema over the past 20 years? During that time, the self-proclaimed ""film nerd"" has turned the movie world upside down.<br/><br/>The film's final scene sums up Tarantino's brilliance...not just with Inglourious Basterds, but with his entire career. In that final scene, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize Tarantino is speaking through Brad Pitt to the audience. It has Brad Pitt and BJ Novak looking downwards at the camera, Tarantino's signature camera angle, with Pitt saying ""...I think this just might be my masterpiece"", then the screen going to black with the words ""Written and Directed by Quentin Tarantino"". Wow. What a great ending to a tremendous movie.<br/><br/>And Tarantino just might be right. Inglourious Basterds is a glorious, nerve-racking hit. QT's best ever though? In the words of John Travolta from Pulp Fiction...""That's a bold statement!"". Pulp Fiction just might be the best film to ever hit the Silver Screen. Personally, I would consider Pulp Fiction as Tarantino's masterpiece, never to be topped. And Kill Bill, both volumes, have to easily be consider two of the most ""fun"" movies to watch in the history of film. Add the brilliance of both Reservoir Dogs and Death Proof and you have a resume that is difficult to top. But Tarantino nearly outdoes himself with IB. This is truly a monumental film. It combines all of these aspects into one movie: WW2, the early 40's, two separate plot-lines, American, French & German actors and languages (along with some Americans hilariously trying to speak Italian), and one huge Hollywood star. Imagine the scope of this project...I firmly believe only Tarantino could have thought of something so brilliant, written it, and made it. The performances he brought out from the female leads in particular, Diane Kruger and the stunningly beautiful Melanie Laurent, were beyond reproach. And how about a big, big thumbs up for Christoph Waltz's performance as Colonel Hans Landa. Once again, Tarantino shows off to the world his ability to cast the PERFECT actor for a character. His knowledge of actors, some whom most of us had never even heard of, is second to none. It is hard to overstate the brilliance of Tarantino and his movies.<br/><br/>As with most Tarantino movies, it takes a 2nd viewing to soak it all in. I strongly suggest taking the time to see it twice within a week. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>JD"

He has a real talent of comedic roles -- a real actors' actor -- a leading man who tackles character roles with gusto and finesse. My major concerns were dramaturgical -- too many scenes depended on someone or something being ""discovered"" for their dramatic tension -- so much so that it got a little boring and predictably tense. And, I don't know if the Nazi everyone is going crazy over could have lived up to the hype and I wasn't in love with the casting for Shoshona -- but, it all pales in the full experience.

","Inglorious Basterds was hyped as a wild ride gorefest by the legendary Tarentino.

The dialogue is not nearly as cartoon-like as Kill Bill's, it just felt uch more real, but it had that same elegance that all Tarentino films are suppose to have. And that is what makes this film, it is as elegant as it is brutal.<br/><br/>The opening scene was one of the most powerful scenes I've ever watched in theaters, it was extremely tense, not so riddled with jokes. The performances were all fantastic, down to the smallest characters. Of course the big name here is Brad Pitt, and he truly delivers a great performance, funny, and exciting. Eli Roth surprised me in this one, giving a good performance as the Boston native known as the Bear Jew. Even the smaller roles, Mike Myers and BJ Novak delivered in what manner they needed to as well.<br/><br/>The highlight is the dialogue, Tarentino truly delivered what I consider to be his most exciting and real dialogue ever. The music was fantastic also, perfect placement, from the very beginning to the end you don't even realize how long you have been in the theater due to the fact that the movie grips you so much.<br/><br/>All and all, what a fantastic movie from QT, he is back and I can't wait for his next on already."

Hans Landa (Waltz, a shoo-in for Best Supporting Actor, as the evil hubris loving baddie here) whose uncanny knack for finding the truth may be his Achilles' heel. Blood-drenched with enough gallows' humor & QT's signature dialogue spewing get the best of the film's intentions in the long run but how can you fault him when this is clearly a valentine to cinema overall. One of the year's best."

","First of all I would like to say not only do I think this is Tarantinos' best film to date but I'm am also putting it in my top 10 best movies of all time. For all those guys who didn't give it a good review, it is my personal opinion that you have no clue what your talking about when it comes to cinema. This movie was phenomenal. Beyond all expectations, even though I wasn't expecting anything. I knew this was going to be an outstanding movie when I heard he was writing it 5 years ago. Everything about this film was great. It made me laugh more than any comedy could have, while at the same time displayed true beauty and violence like I have never seen before. I have always been a true fan of Tarantinos' work, but he has truly outdone himself on this one. He has made a true masterpiece."

","Chapter 1: Once upon the time, in Nazi occupied France in 1941, the shrewd and sadistic SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) presses a French farmer to disclose the hideout of the Jewish Dreyfus family he has hidden and executes all the members except Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) that escapes. <br/><br/>Chapter 2: Inglorious Bastards is the name of the brutal Jewish-American elite forced teamed up by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) in 1941 to terrify the Nazis, scalping and slaughtering their troops. They become famous in France, sparing the German soldiers that collaborate with them but marking a swastika in their foreheads. <br/><br/>Chapter 3: A German Night in Paris. In 1944, Shosanna changed her identity to Emmanuelle Mimieux and owns a movie theater in Paris. When the decorated sniper Private Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl) meets her, he tries to flirt with her ; then he convinces Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) to bring the screening for the summit of Nazi leaders of the film ""Nation's Pride"" about his deed to her movie theater. Shosanna plots to trap the Germans inside and set on fire the theater.<br/><br/>Chapter 4: Operation Kino: Meanwhile the British command uses the German actress and collaborator Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) to plot a scheme to bomb the movie-theater. They schedule a meeting in a tavern, but things go wrong and the three Bastards that speak German are murdered and a shooting.<br/><br/>Chapter 5: Revenge of the Giant Face: Col. Landa discovers the plan to attempt against the Nazi leaders and arrest Lt. Raine. However, he surprisingly asks to negotiate with Aldo's superior to surrender. Meanwhile both plans against the Nazi leaders are set in motion.<br/><br/>""Inglorious Bastards"" is a funny daydream of Quentin Tarantino that makes a joke with the history of World War II along five chapters of insanity. The first chapter is the best part of this movie; the second is silly; the third is also great; the fourth is boring; and the last one is madness on the screen. I found this movie entertaining, despite the lack of respect with history and with those that indeed fought in 1941 in France, with a caricatured and annoying Brad Pitt in the role of a ruthless military. The production is very careful and unusual in American movies, with the characters speaking German, French, English and Italian. Inclusive there is a joke of Bridget von Hammersmark with Lt. Aldo Raine when she tells that Americans are unable to speak a second language. Christoph Waltz steals the film in the role of a sadistic and smart Jew Hunter Nazi, and Diane Kruger is extremely beautiful in the role of a famous actress. But the greatest joke is the nomination to the Oscar. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Bastardos Inglórios"" ('Inglorious Bastards"")"

","The acting in this film is quite good. The storyline is ok but wanders off at times to being ludicrous. It contains violence, which you would expect in a war film, but it some scenes are just gratuitous. The biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. It contains all parts of drama, war, action and black comedy. That maybe the makers intentions, however, the ongoing result is it's frustrating and annoying. It's not a bad movie but in no way deserves high scores or classic status."

","How the hell can people rate Inglourious Basterds with the lowest possible score? That is just completely ridiculous. That you don't like the movie I can get but scoring it a one is just infantile behavior. So those reviewers never saw a worse movie then this one? It's just pathetic. I guess they must be right wing Nazis scum and they don't like watching Nazis getting beaten. Well I give it a ten. I thought it was an excellent movie. One that I will watch again in the future, and even more then once. Even if I remember every line in the movie I will watch it again. The dialogues are just sublime. The acting is far above all the crap we are used to watch. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa is just outstanding. Probably the best role he ever played. And even though he plays a mean German Nazi Jew hunter he's still very enjoyable to watch. He should get an Oscar for his acting in Inglorious Basterds. Brad Pitt as Luitenant Aldo Raine is just great fun to watch. I mean what is not fun about watching killing dirty Nazis? It's just hilarious, certainly the conversations they have about killing as much Nazis as possible. The rest of the cast is also very good. Every single character in this movie is top notch. I am a big fan of Quentin Tarantino and with Inglourious Basterd he shows us again that he's one of the best movie makers ever. Great movie!"
"antoniatejedabarros","10","3","8","11 January 2016"," Such a pleasure watching Nazis being killed!
","Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt): ""Nazi ain't got no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a Jew hunting, mass murdering maniac, and they need to be destroyed. That's why any and every son of a b---- we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're gonna die"".<br/><br/>Such a pleasure watching Nazis being killed! Tarantino uses his art for doing what history couldn't do: to kill the f------- Nazis.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is a masterpiece. The film is bloody violent (violence which is so characteristic from Tarantino it ends out being funny), but a bit of justice does not hurt, does it? Let's cheer for every f----- German & Austrian Nazi shot and dead!<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie is spectacular. The dialog between Christoph Waltz and the French farmer, brilliantly performed by Denis Ménochet, is awesome. The dialog lasts for 12 minutes (it starts at 6'50"" and ends at 18'50""). Tarantino worked on the script of Inglorious Basterds for 10 years. The music of the film is amazing and includes works by Ennio Morricone and a song by David Bowie.<br/><br/>The casting, like in all Tarantino movies, is breathtaking. Waltz surprises us speaking 4 languages, Brad Pitt glows in his role of Aldo, Fassbender appears irresistible in his role as a British spy cinema critic disguised as an SS officer. Mélanie Laurent plays well enough the role of Shosanna, Daniel Brühl appears both nice and macabre, Diane Kruger is the perfect diva (her German is exquisite), and August Diehl appears impeccable in his role of a Gestapo pig. One of my favourite basterd is Hugo Stiglitz, performed by Til Schweiger (a German actor who always refused to wear a Nazi uniform in a movie, but he accepted it in Inglorious Basterds because there he was given the privilege of killing Nazis).<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is the last Tarantino movie edited by Sally Menke, who was the editor of all Tarantino's movies from Reservoir Dogs (1992) (she died in 2010).<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds got 8 Academy Award Nominations (Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Writing, Original Screenplay, Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Achievement in Cinematography, Best Achievement in Film Editing, Best Achievement in Sound Mixing, and Best Achievement in Sound Editing), and won one Oscar (Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role: Christoph Waltz).<br/><br/>Just as Saul fia is the best movie about the Holocaust that I've ever seen (it is terribly real, breathtaking and depressing), Inglourious Basterds is the great antidote to all the sadness, pain and anger that one feels when reading about the Holocaust and watching WWII movies. A pleasure for the eye, the ear, the mind and the heart. Tarantino makes justice to the horrible history of humankind. A cool, funny, brutal and surprising film.<br/><br/>Fun facts: Samuel L. Jackson is the narrator, Tarantino appears twice as a cameo (he is the first scalped Nazi and an American soldier in 'Pride of Nation'), and the OSS American commander who talks to Waltz on the phone at the end of the movie is Harvey Keitel. These performances are uncredited.<br/><br/>In Germany all the swastikas had to be removed or hidden from all movie posters, since Nazi symbols are banned by law in Germany (except for historical documents).<br/><br/>The best: the dialog between Waltz and Méchonet, the names that Brad Pitt gives the German Nazis, Hitler asking for a chewing gum, Fassbender's irresistible smile, the music, the script, Tarantino's style, and the dirty Nazis burning in flames.<br/><br/>The worst: the bad French actress at the tavern, some cuts, and some anachronisms."
"alucard2072","10","3","8","28 May 2012"," A nation's pride
","I consider this is more of an analysis of the film rather than a review, as my aim is not to summarize this film for those who might wish to see it, but give those who have already seen it something to think about.<br/><br/>Made up of five chapters, watching it I am reminded of Kill Bill because separating these films into several chapters makes perfect sense. Each Chapter tries to accomplish something very different from the last, which is why many people will not appreciate every chapter.<br/><br/>The opening feels very much like the opening of a Sergio Leone film, which is far from coincidence, but Tarantino's ability to use that style is nothing less than masterful. The First chapter is more of a character study than a scene of suspense. It moves at a pace that is lifelike, because as we should know, movies normally move at unnatural speeds. Hans Landa, played by Christoph Waltz, is the most fascinating person in this film. He is very prideful of his position, enjoys showing off his detective skills that rival Sherlock Holmes, and is a little on the flamboyant side. He takes pleasure in appearing to be great and using his skills to find Jews more than he enjoys killing them.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino is obviously fascinated by how violent people can be, much like Takeshi Kitano. Both of their greatest films revolve around violence as a subject of the movie, which brings us to the next chapter. Chapter two is all about the extremely violent Jewish group of Nazi hunters. They are no less disturbing than any of the Nazis in the film, they hunger for violence, but they have a clear and honest motive that serves as an excuse for the horrible things that they want to do. It is normal for good men to want evil men to be punished and be made unable to continue to perform evil deeds. But is it normal for good men to want to scalp, shoot, and bludgeon evil men and enjoy every second of it? <br/><br/>Chapter three is just as much about Fredrick as it is about Shosanna. He is so confident in who he is as a war hero, it makes you wonder what he was like before the war. Shosanna is most desirable to him because she wants nothing to do with him and he doesn't seem to believe she will be able to resist him forever. His limitless confidence is fascinating to watch. Consider the scene where she meets the director of the film Nations Pride. All of the men speak to her as if they know the pleasure of the meeting is all of hers as she is someone of no importance in the midst of pure greatness. All the while, she is doing everything she can to hide her disgust.<br/><br/>Contained in chapter four is a masterful scene of pure suspense. The bar scene has a feeling quite like that of the opening scene, it moves at a lifelike pace and never loses its realism. In both of these scenes, lesser directors would focus more on the killings and less on conversations which precede them.<br/><br/>And finally comes Chapter five. We have now met all of the main characters in the film and character development seemed to be of the highest priority at the beginning and the focus has slowly been shifting more and more to the plot throughout the film, or so it would appear. As Landa tries to make a deal with the Basterds we see that he is two-faced and he doesn't care about the Nazi cause as much as he pretends to. Fredrick also seems troubled by his victorious killing of 250 enemy soldiers. Perhaps he doesn't have sincere pride for the Third Reich and he is just overwhelmed by the pure adoration that he is faced with and maybe being prideful is the only way to justify his actions. I believe Nation's Pride would have worked just as well as a title for this film. Certainly having pride for being a part of the Third Reich was the popular way of the time. All throughout history a nation's pride has had devastating consequences."

","The film is about a group of Jewish American soldiers who are going throughout Nazi occupied France killing Nazi soldiers. The film Has some of the most animated characters including Brad Pitts character Lt. Aldo Raine who requires all his soldiers to collect him one hundred Nazi scalps as payment for being apart of his unit. Another big character is a Jewish girl named Shosanna Dreyfus who inherits a movie theatre that ends up being a movie theatre that the Nazi wan to hold a premiere for there movie ""A Nations Pride"" which stars a Nazi soldier who snipes hundreds of soldiers from a watch tower. The Nazi's don't realize she is Jewish but she plans to keep it a secret because she has a plan to kill Hitler by burning down her theatre on the movie premiere night. The third biggest character in the film is the Nazi col. Hans Landa whose job it is to hunt down hiding Jews. His first scene he finds some Jews and begins killing but the one that got away is the girl who later inherits the movie theatre, but he doesn't know that she is the girl that got away. This movie depicts a story that I wish was true. The way this movie played out was nothing short of genius. Having group of angry Jewish soldiers terrorizing over France hunting down Nazi's and scalping them. There reputations spread through the Nazi army and it puts fear in their hearts. The one bastard tat scares them the most is the bear Jew. He is this big muscular Jewish guy from New York that wealds a baseball bat around. He brought the bat from home and Jewish people in his community signed this bat. He used this bat to bash in the brains of the Nazi soldiers who did not comply. For those that did comply they were given the right to live, but they could only live a Nazi soldiers so they carved the swastika in their foreheads so everyone would know there shame as Nazi's. The bastards devise a plan to kill Hitler by bombing the theatre on premiere night while simultaneously the Jewish theatre owner and her boyfriend plan to burn it down. On this night was one of the best scenes of the movie. Shosanna sets fire to the theatre with a spliced film of her laughing at their pain playing on the screen. So the bastards make there way to Hitler's box and machine gun his face in what appeared to me as the biggest triumph of the film."

","After having sat through this film, I can say with certainty I know why there are so many subtitles in this movie. Quentin Tarantino had to include them in order to keep people watching! <br/><br/>This movie is seriously that boring and that bad. The acting is awful and the pacing is excruciatingly slow. It's starts off very slowly and doesn't pick up speed at all. Several of the characters can't keep their accents, which begs the question of why they even bothered trying to use them in the first place.

","I don't care that Brad Pitt's southern accent was terrible. I don't care that it wasn't as violent as ""Pulp Fiction"" or the Kill Bill movies. And I don't care that I had to read subtitles for the majority of the film. What spoiled ""Inglourious Basterds"" for me was the lack of character development. Quentin Tarantino has a talent for creating irresistible characters that could do laundry for the entire duration of a film and we would still think to ourselves, ""Ugh, if only I could be that awesome!"" Each character had enormous potential, but so little time was spent exploring them individually, that they never drew me into the story. Tarantino set out to make the ultimate revenge film, and he achieved a wholly satisfactory plot, but he neglected his characters in the process. And though I shouted a victorious ""f**k yeah!"" every time a Nazi got what was coming to him, I also found myself thinking several times throughout the movie, ""So, um... is this it?"""
"lediscipledessocrates","8","3","8","9 March 2010"," Waltz gets The Oscar ......that's about it.
","I became a Tarantino fan rather reluctantly . To be honest I had formed quite an unfavourable opinion of the fellow after watching Kill Bill many years ago . <br/><br/>But as they when wisdom comes slowly it comes for good. In the light of Tarantinos entire filmography , I admit he has to be one of the most ingenuous brains around in the movie making business today.<br/><br/>Pulp Fiction need not be cited here as an example of his ingenuity. We all know how good the movie was. Our purpose out here , however is to analyse and then give judicious responses to the movie which was titled ""Inglourious Basterds "" thereby affording Microsoft Word the opportunity to cyclically raise the spelling and grammar check warning.<br/><br/>This movie friends is beautifully made and true to the Director's claims, falls right in the lines of the Westerns which preceded it. Playful screenplay. Some exquisite acting and a highly unconventional form make this film a delightful piece of 21st century cinema.<br/><br/>Christoph Waltz dominates the screen through some splendid method acting which never allowed anyone in the movie hall to take their eyes off him. He executed his role perfectly. Linguistically one the most refined and impeccable performances I've seen. I mean to speak to Languages for a character who in the movies knows none of them perfectly is surely one great concept conceived by the writer.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is not as impressive but his presence can be tolerated. <br/><br/>The opening seen is perhaps one the best scenes in the movie and sets the ball rolling.<br/><br/>Like all his movies the Director sometimes succumbs to the seductive charms of his own proclivities , thus ending up in a slightly ugly area of moribund plot progression . But then such instances are rare.<br/><br/>Not his best by any means though better than most other films on offer today.<br/><br/>I give it 8 for Waltz, who has just earned an Oscar (he should have received it in the Leading role category..!!!!!) and for the Tarantino effect in the screenplay."
"chopendoz","4","3","8","4 March 2010"," Mixed feelings
","I have mixed feelings about this movie. It is interesting, violent, boring and silly in equal measures. I also found the music a bit odd and somewhat inappropriate. However, Christoph Waltz deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The movie falls into the trap we see increasingly these days. It's a question of morality really. A good guy killing a bad guy is not murder apparently. Some of the action we see in this movie could be easily classified as war crimes. However, it's only a war crime when perpetrated by the losing side isn't it? I can see no funny side to killing someone but all too often it is dealt with as though there is. When we hear the 'Bear Jew' coming down the tunnel knocking his baseball bat against the bricks, we are aware that he is going to beat a man to death and we should be sickened. But were are not. We watch in fascination. We have become inured to death by violence and there are those that actually enjoy seeing it. So much for civilization. At the beginning of the movie Brad Pitt is telling a group of men that he is looking for Jewish/American soldiers for a special 'behind the lines' squad but late in the movie we discover that none of his remaining men seem to actually speak German. Surprising that Brad Pitt (as leader) cannot speak German either. My biggest problem lies with the genre which should have a special category of 'Holocaust Movies'. At the risk of being accused of being anti-semitic, may I say that I am sick of hearing about it. 65 years have passed since the end of WW2 and I can understand the Jewish people will never forget. But as a Gentile, why should I have to be reminded over and over again. There have been quite a number of movies and TV productions dedicated to and indirectly referencing the Holocaust over the years. The sight of a tattooed number on an old man's arm was commonplace in TV series back in the 70's & 80's. Yes, I understand that 6 million Jews died but I can't help thinking about the homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and gypsies who also died in the concentration camps. Has anyone made a movie about them? What about the 50 plus million Russians who died under Stalin after WW2 and the 50 plus million Chinese who were massacred by Mao after WW2 ? - who speaks for them? I suppose it all boils down to who is producing movies these days - or better yet who is financing them."
"siderite","6","3","8","7 February 2010"," Tarantino has lost it...
","Tarantino did a few things right: Pulp Fiction, Four Rooms, Natural Born Killers, From Dusk till Dawn. He did it in between '94 and '96. Compared to those films, all his others suck, although, if you compare them with other films, they may be OK or even great. This movie is neither. It's all like a long (very long) bad joke.<br/><br/>What's it about? There is this group of American Jews that fight a guerrilla type warfare behind German enemy lines. It's what today would be called terrorism. Is this film about them? No. Are you confused yet? There is this Austrian actor, Christoph Waltz, who plays the role of a German psychopathic officer, speaking English, French and Italian to perfection. He does it well, got an Oscar for it, although I suspect more for the fact that he can speak 5 languages, which is rather astounding to Americans. Is the film about him? Not really. There is an actor playing Hitler. About him? No! Brad Pitt? No.<br/><br/>As any Tarantined story there is a lot of talk. Only in this film, it amounts to nothing. The characters are completely impossible to identify yourself with. Actually, the one taking the top for this would be the psychopathic German, so that says a lot about the others. The script makes no sense, mostly, and the little it does, it is completely boring. As for any message the movie would have, I call them racist, any of them, as every nationality is stereotyped to the absurd.<br/><br/>Bottom line: one thing the movie got right. No one deserves any glory for the film, including Tarantino. It can be fun, obviously, since so many people liked it, but I hated the time lost on it."
"TxMike","Null","3","8","29 January 2010"," Definitely a Quentin Tarantino film, brilliant writing, but you gotta have a high tolerance for blood and gore.
","I have sort of a love/hate relationship with Quentin Tarantino's films. I've seen the highly-regarded Pulp Fiction twice, but it does nothing for me. I don't consider it a good movie at all. But I always am amazed by Tarantino's writing, his characters always have the most interesting dialog.<br/><br/>The premise here is WW2, and a small band of Nazi hunters are called ""Inglourous Basterds"" by the Nazis. This small band are lead by Brad Pitt as LT. Aldo Raine, from the south, and he inspires his men to not only kill as many Nazis as they can, but also ""bring me their scalps."" (The scalping scenes are very realistic.) <br/><br/>What I enjoyed most about this movie are the scenes. Unlike many modern movies where the editing switches away to something else frequently, here Tarantino spends ample time developing each extended scene. As the movie begins each one in sequence takes up about 20 minutes running time. First we see the Nazi character nicknamed ""the Jew Hunter"", visiting a farmer suspected of hiding a Jewish family. Some directors might have filmed this in 5 or 6 minutes through its conclusion, but here we get 20 minutes, and every second of it is tense and interesting. Master film-making. And the rest of the movie uses a similar technique. <br/><br/>Mélanie Laurent is Shosanna, a Jew, who escapes to Paris and now runs a small movie house. She has taken a different, non-Jewish name, but eventually the Jew Hunter, superbly played by Christoph Waltz as COL. Hans Landa, gets on her trail. <br/><br/>The other key character is Diane Kruger as German actress Bridget von Hammersmark. A meeting is set up where she will help the Nazi hunters, but we are never sure which side she is on. <br/><br/>This movie is not for everyone, but for those who enjoy good film-making and superb dialog, this one is a real treat.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The conclusion comes at the small Paris movie theater, as all the Nazi brass, including Hitler, attend the premier showing of a film which glorifies a young sniper who killed about 300 Allies over three days in a village. Unknown to each other, 3 different groups independently plan to exterminate all the theatergoers. With guns, or explosives, or by burning down the theater. In this fictional story Hitler dies and the war ends early.<br/><br/>Feb 2012 edit: I watched it again after two years, still a very absorbing film.<br/><br/>May 2015 edit: Watched it again, every time I come away with an even better appreciation."
"Polaris_DiB","6","3","8","6 September 2009"," And dirtier and dirtier
","The original Inglorious Bastards had the tag-line, ""Everything the Dirty Dozen did, they did it dirtier!"" Other than that, Inglorious Bastards had next to nothing to do with The Dirty Dozen. Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds has little to do with Inglorious Bastards, minus a generalized subplot that is more like a synopsis. Instead, it is a lot closer to a remake of The Dirty Dozen, complete with a few word-by-word lines (such as the whole ""All of our rotten eggs in one basket--and we're going to blow up the basket"") and the same vaguely moral-disturbing ending in the name of committing Nazis to carnage.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the movie is somewhat of a mis-sell. The trailers and the title have it that this movie is about Brad Pitt's character and his fun-loving Yank-accented Nazi hunting, but actually the bulk of this movie is a vengeance plot involving one Shosanna, daughter of a murdered Jewish family who finds herself in key position to eliminate all of the heads of the Nazi party in one explosion of burning celluloid (and I'm speaking literally, here). The Inglourious Basterds running around the country-side just provide a little extra bang for your buck (again, speaking literally), and in the same way, the real emotional base of the movie is Shosanna whereas the Basterds are mostly, well, comedic relief.<br/><br/>Except they're not funny. They're monsters. But that's all ""c'est la guerre."" It's not even really worth getting into the specifics of why these people should be detested rather than appreciated, because nobody cares, so I won't even bother. It's just now that I've sat with audience members laughing at the borderline personality in ""Observe and Report"", cheering the sociopathic Rorschach in ""Watchmen"", and applauding the megalomaniacal Basterds in this flick, I'm feeling modern audiences are becoming severely poor judges of character.<br/><br/>Anyway, Tarantino refines his logocentric palate with a few more languages (and has some fun with them, hopefully to the chagrin of a few subtitle-phobic audience members expecting more Sam Jackson/John Travolta tete-a-tete), some very tense moments build based on the use of said languages (refreshing), and eventually Shosanna's vengeance narrative comes to a very satisfying close--and one that may not be quite what you expect. Meanwhile, the movie is laced with slightly more oblique movie-references than usual, providing extra interest to those trivia geeks out there. Indeed, this is still Tarantino being in top form, a real testament to his skills as a director if not a particularly ""good"" movie per se. Minus a few b-movie references and sight gags, the faux-serial structure (which actually didn't make much sense), and the Basterds themselves, this is a very tense and original WWII thriller. Add those things and this is back into pastiche-land, a not-unenjoyable place where some things might not really fit, but it's all done for love.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

And his ability to create tension and make the Nazi terror palpable should be stated to all those grumpy critics and humourless spokespersons of political correctness who don't get the gist of this huge Jewish revenge fake history joke.<br/><br/>But all in all, the pic's just above average: some scenes go on for too long, some jokes fall flat, most characters remain opaque and while the cinema showdown features some nice gags, the last scene (concerning Hans Landa's fate, who's, by the way, brilliantly portrayed by Christoph Waltz) isn't half as clever as it should be.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 marked Krauts"

However, yet again i come away from watching his latest movie with a sense of wanting.<br/><br/>Reservoir Dogs was his first film i watched, shortly followed by Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. These remain to be my favourite Tarantino movies. Since then i feel as though he has been lacking that special formula to create yet another masterpiece.<br/><br/>Firstly, the most obvious change from, in my opinion, his best films is the violence. Tarantino still remains to be the only director to make a torture scene with the removal of one's ear, or the blowing off of a man's head in a car funny. Yet in his latest movie, i found myself cringing at the all-intensive violence (an example being a Nazi having his head beaten and cracked open like a watermelon with a baseball bat.) Too many times did i lose myself in the violence that i momentarily forgot that i was watching a film. I didn't pay to watch Saw IV after-all.<br/><br/>Another downfall of his latest 'epic' are the acting performances. Brilliant casting was what created strikingly good scene after strikingly good scene. Whoever knew John Travolta could pull off such a career defining performance? Or Michael Madsen with his sickening yet brilliant roll as Mr.Blonde? Who on earth will ever say 'waht' to Samuel L.Jackson? Yet in this movie, Brad Pitt is, to be frank, dreadful. I am genuinely a Brad Pitt fan, 'Fight Club' being one of my favourites, and i also believe he deserved an Oscar for playing an 'ageing man'. Yet not once did i see his jaw move from what must have been an uncomfortable position. A bad decision. On the other hand, Christoph Waltz was a great bid for the director, pulling off a stunning performance. If only more than one of about 15 actors could do the same.<br/><br/>My final point is about Tarantino himself. With his first 3 films he seemed so pure, so brilliant, so relaxed yet scientific about his work. Since then he seems to have been lost in Hollywood. In the Reservoir Dogs commentary, Tim Roth makes an interesting point. He stated that film writers make mistakes because they write for Hollywood, for the Oscars. He makes sure we know that with his first film he wrote it to make a genuinely good film. Now i seem to feel as though he is writing for Hollywood. He is writing for the Oscars. If there's one piece of advice i'd give to him, it would be to bring the old Quentin back."
"Smeagol-Gollum","6","3","8","29 August 2009"," Mr. Tarantino, you have lost me.
","I want to like this movie, just because I like Quentin Tarantino's other movies. I loved Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Kill Bill was really quite good. But Inglourious Basterds, this I could not enjoy.<br/><br/>The 'basterds' were a most vile, despicable band of senselessly violent excuses for people, hardly better than the Nazis they hunted. They were not characters who could be hated whilst still caring what happened to them or understanding their actions, they were just plain hateful. Shosanna was able to be sympathised with, as were Landa and Zoller. In a way. They were still unpleasant individuals, but they added some tinges of humanity to the story, I guess. At least they seemed to have some actual reason for their actions other than mindless killing.<br/><br/>The violence - I have previously thought the violence in Quentin Tarantino movies was well done, whether it was Mr. Orange bleeding to death at a realistic rate or Yakuza exploding with blood. This revised my opinion. It was just senseless, pointless, thoroughly inglorious and unpleasantly executed. It also added to my complete hatred for all the characters. Watching them die horribly was little compensation.<br/><br/>There were some moments of humour, and of course the interesting addition of captions at seemingly random times, the fonts used now familiar from other Tarantino movies. But there was no honour, no integrity and no humanity. And really, the ending was just ridiculous, though perhaps fitting.<br/><br/>I will give points for the soundtrack - Mr. Tarantino has not lost his touch there; it was excellent.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this, I just couldn't. I am disappointed, and very sad. I guess I'll have to live in the past and enjoy early Tarantino."

","As the lights of the theater began to brighten and the credits began to pop up I found myself struggling to close my jaw. I guess that's just one of the many side effects you get from watching something as amazing as Inglorious Basterds. The movie is everything it needs to be: A Tarantino movie...that's it! If you like Recervoir Dogs and If you liked Pulp Fiction don't think twice about watching this flick, it's simply Tarantino doing what he does best: long dialogs, amazing action scenes, brilliant characters and an incredibly unrealistic yet attractive situation. Q.T somehow took the secret spices out of all his best movies and combined it into a genre that's old as the event itself but always great to explore: The second world war. The cast is as close as you can get to perfection. I don't understand why people complain about Brad Pitt using the southern accent, I thought it was one of his best performance not simply because he pulls it off so well but because the character is so over the top you can't help but notice him having fun as he recites his lines. The rest of the cast does an amazing job at filling the atmosphere with that intensity and humor that Tarantino has trademarked and you simply can't get enough of any of them. Although it runs for more than two hours, I.B feels short, mainly because the times goes by really fast as you watch it. Many will undoubtedly hate this movie and that's why I suggest the following: if you like Q.T movies (like me) go see this film. If you DON'T like Q.T movies....well...don't go see this film. I think i've made my point<br/><br/>9/10"
"dfranzen70","4","6","22","30 August 2009"," Disappointing: slow and skillless
","Tarantino's latest, a WWII revenge tale, is also his most disappointing, somehow managing to be like a bowl of plain oatmeal: tough to stomach, lumpy in spots, and ultimately flavorless.<br/><br/>I confess to being a full-throated fan of Quentin Tarantino. (We both come from solid video-store-employee stock, you see.) I have enjoyed all of his films, including the ones he wrote but didn't direct. And I have to say that compared with his other works, Inglourious Basterds falls short of all of them.<br/><br/>The (fictional) story is about a group of Jewish Americans recruited by one Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) to hunt Nazi soldiers and, well, scalp them. Raine's Basterds are very good at their jobs (Raine's required 100 literal scalps from his crew), and their notoriety has spread. The team is assigned by the Americans to rendezvous with a German actress/double agent named Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger), who has discovered that the location of the premiere of Joseph Goebbels' latest propaganda film has been moved from the vast Ritz theater to a smaller venue in Nazi-occupied Paris.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to von Hammersmark and the Basterds, the young owner of the new venue, played by Melanie Laurent has her own plans for the premiere; she and her lover will set the theater on fire, killing all the high-ranking Nazis inside, including Goebbels and Hitler.<br/><br/>There are also two other smaller stories (all four dovetail in the end, of course). An SS officer, Colonel Landa (Christoph Waltz), known as ""the Jew Hunter,"" has a Jewish family murdered on a remote farm in France, where they are being hid. Naturally, the one person who escapes his wrath that day grows into the young theater owner. Also, a German sharpshooter, now a national hero, is the subject of Goebbels' new film and is himself trying to woo the young theater owner.<br/><br/>My first problem with the movie is the revenge factor itself. In order for me to root for a protagonist who's exacting revenge, I need to a) sympathize with their plight and b) believe that the punishment they're meting out is suitable. And although there's plenty of style to this film, I don't think that the Basterds met either of those criteria. In fact, it would be one thing if this were a straightforward (and straightfaced) revenge flick, like Death Wish, but Pitt and his fellow Basterds take far too much glee in torturing and dissecting Nazis than I'm comfortable with. Their mirth seems not only out of place, it seems kind of sick minded and unnecessary.<br/><br/>My second problem is just as insidious: the casting of Brad Pitt. I am a fan of Brad Pitt's work, as I am of Tarantino's. I think he can turn in good work when he wants to - that is, when he's not playing the sly, smarmy character he sometimes lapses into in movies like the Ocean's films. And that's what he does here. He's not just a superspy who's in charge of an elite commando unit, he's just a thuggish jerk who's really no better than the villains he's mowing down. On top of that, Pitt uses a ridiculous southern drawl that sounds exactly like someone trying to sound like a southern backwoods hillbilly mountain man: made-up, well over the top, and really grating to the ears. Killing natsies, indeed. I just think that a better actor, in this case, would have lent more gravitas to the role; Pitt's Raine feels like everything in the movie's supposed to be a big joke.<br/><br/>Overall, I was surprised to find few real twists or any memorable dialog (other than the laughable lines that Pitt overplays, seen in the trailers and previews anyway). Tarantino is known for slick, clever dialog, especially quick patter, and none of that was evident here. The twist - such as it is - is amply evident to everyone except the characters themselves.<br/><br/>At 153 minutes, Inglourious Basterds is as long as most other Tarantino songs, but without crisp dialog and tightly staged action scenes, it drags on. In some scenes (a standoff in an underground bar is well shot), this works, but overall there's just far too much down time."
"moviemaniac008","10","4","13","31 August 2009"," Best film of the summer, and quite possibly the year's best film too! Quentin Tarantino is a genius!!!
","Besides Terminator Salvation, Inglorious Basterds was THE film I wanted to see this summer. This is not Quentin Tarantino's best work, but his third best (I put it behind Reservoir Dogs, a classic and Pulp Fiction, which is overrated to me but still an extremely good movie). That being said, it doesn't disappoint. The story itself is pretty hard to put in a plot summary, because there are too many things to say, but let me tell you that you won't be disappointed. The dialogues are as funny and as delicious as ever in a QT movie, and while the film manages to keep it's serious all around, it's still pretty funny at times. The action is present, but not as much as in Death Proof or in Kill Bill, think of it as Pulp Fiction World War II version. However when the action is present, QT doesn't cut ANYTHING, so that sums up the lack of action.<br/><br/>The actors were just plain excellent, there isn't anything else to say. As everyone seems to say, Christoph Waltz excels as Colonel Hans Landa, and he could win the best supporting actor award, but don't put all the attention on him. Brad Pitt is really amusing as Aldo Raine, and he could be nominated for an Oscar (though I seriously doubt he would win it). Mélanie Laurent is also surprisingly good and could win the best actress. Diane Kruger doesn't appear much, but she was well acted, and Eli Roth seems to be booed by the public but I found him to be awesome in this movie. Just don't expect an Oscar-worthy performance. All in all, this movie could indeed win Best director for Quentin Tarantino and could be nominated for best picture, but I doubt it could win it, but it could win a few technical prizes too.<br/><br/>It's an awesome movie. Spend your money, this is 2 hours and 30 minutes of pure pleasure, excitement and awesomeness."
"TomBon1","9","4","13","22 August 2009"," Fun filled entertainment - Best since Pulp Fiction
","Since Pulp Fiction, I have not liked Tarantino. I found his films to be over long, self indulgent and often boring. However with Inglourious Basterds, he has reminded me of the talent he clearly possesses as a writer, but this time, even more so as a director. For this film has improved leaps and bounds in cinematography and pacing to his previous few films. He has developed a method of using the camera to project his themes and ideas, which only the best directors are capable of. For example, in one of the best scenes of the movie, set in an underground bar, his camera waltzes around tables and pauses for tension and floats to show certain items under tables. A technique that must have some Leone influence to it. It wasn't self indulgent 'look at what I'm doing with the camera' like in Kill Bill with the slow motion gun blast. It as kinetic, like QT himself and had a large element of fun to it. <br/><br/>The camera-work in this film is some of the best he has done but, to be honest, when I read the script last year, I was worried. My immediate thoughts were 'Oh dear Lord! What is he doing? This mix of romance, action, thriller, comedy and drama will never work. He needs to be reined in. His imagination has got the worst of him.' And who can blame me for thinking that? The chapters go from one to another without proper linkage and I wondered how QT would make the audience care about all the different stories going on. Then I remembered, this is the guy who made Pulp Fiction. This is the guy who revolutionised cinema storytelling techniques, going from present to past to future to present with dozens of amazing characters. I shouldn't have worried about the script. I should have known he could pull it off. When I saw the film with a friend, my friend complained, 'it was dog food. That's not a film. It's laziness.' However, I answer that by reminding them what QT's favourite films are. Kung fu, men on a mission movies, Leone movies. He has said on countless occasions that he is interested in making high powered cinema that he himself would go and see and if that was his aim, then surely we can not fault him and even if it isn't our cup of tea, we have to admire his sheer audacity. <br/><br/>The one flat note of the film is the character of Shoshanna, who I found rather unpleasant despite her tragic life. She doesn't come across well at all, in my opinion and the chapter 3 with her in it is definitely the poorest. Melanie Laurent wasn't particularly good either. She didn't seem to give Shoshanna any sort of humanity to her so the audience would cheer her on in her mission. I think we were all hoping the Basterds were the ones who finished off the job. However, Tarantino can be proud that he's back to near his best and maybe his next film will be back on par with his two modern classics of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. This film isn't quite up there with them, as the characters aren't quite as dynamic and the story not quite as ingenious but as a testament to the cinema, (you have to see the end as a metaphor) Inglourious Basterds reminds you of the thrills you can experience watching a motion picture."
"dalcazar-1","9","4","13","22 August 2009"," Actively provocational and excellent, but not for everyone.
","Just like pretty much everything in life, it's very hard to combine different elements together in a way that works, and this movie is a prime example of those rare and wonderful combinations.<br/><br/>Tarantino has again proved himself to be a master that is able to combine the elements into a provocative film that pushes all the right buttons. He strives at every turn to insult, disgust or shock you into some form of a reaction to what you're seeing, then to make you laugh at the very next moment, sometimes at things that should horrify you instead. To be honest I believe that is the point of Inglourious Basterds, to force you into some form of self-questioning. Your job is to feel these questions and accept the fact that no matter what reaction you're having, the movie is right... and so are you in another way.<br/><br/>Aside from being provocational, the film never tries to take itself too seriously, a point that is repeatedly hit upon. Usually just at the time when you're starting to settle into a new set of personality labels for each of the characters The plot is not important, it's the characters that really make this movie come to life, and everyone did a very very good job. I'd rather not put particular emphasis on any single actor because everyone performed as they should have. The mish-mash of languages throughout the film was a special treat for me since I understand all of them, I always applaud filmmakers who won't settle for the American public's lazy attitude towards languages or subtitles. You see? even there is a way that Tarantino is trying to push your buttons! Watch it, see for yourself if you can take Tarantino's prodding and enjoy the ride."
"blanbrn","8","4","13","21 August 2009"," Fun and entertaining joy film that's done in a unique fashion a real action packed bloody treat!
","I must say that director Quentin Tarantino does it again, as if you've watched his films you know he always makes them entertaining by blending them with humor and action. While going over the top with violence and human blood. Well this 40's era comedy fantasy drama ""Inglourious Basterds"" is no different as it's a film that some may find to long or overstated or drawn out still it's script and story is interesting to hold a viewers thoughts for the entire time.<br/><br/>As one knows Tarantino tells stories in his own unique and assertive ways as here he shows that World War II was won through a combination of luring Germans, to the power of their own cinema which brings them to the prowess of a band of renegade soldiers all supposedly Jews. This band of outcast is lead by Lt. Aldo Raine(Brad Pitt)who's a southern country mountain moonshine hillbilly as one can tell by the twang and draw of his accent. Pitt who gives a good turn is mostly overshadowed though by the supporting cast, especially that of Christoph Waltz who as a villain Col. Hans Landa starts the film off with a direct and cut and dry scene as the ""Jew Hunter"" as he begins his search in Nazi occupied France which is the films setting thru and thru. And well worth the watch and a good treat is Eli Roth as ""Bear Jew"" Sgt. Donny Donowitz who smashes the heads of German soldiers to a bloody pulp.<br/><br/>Now that the battle lines have been drawn the film moves along like chapters from a book as many scenes seem like a game where people whether Jewish or German always seem in trouble. As this moves along with it's over the top blood and gore and a lot of reading German script as it's gross yet fun to see the gang scalp German heads. A clever and interesting plot develops to rid the evil Germans out of France. Enter Bridget a German actress who's an undercover spy played by Diane Kruger who lures a bar scene of good and bad guys to face blood. Yet the most climatic plan after this is when French Jew Shosanna who changes identity after her family is slaughtered and opens a new cinema to plot revenge. As now the Germans have fallen to the trap as they love war cinema only they will literally come to a climactic blowout in her French cinema of paradise or should I say German hell! Overall this is a fun thrill good film that's over the top with blood and unique gore that's funny as many scenes tease the audience. As it was interesting to see Quentin's interesting take on how War War II was won. Clearly always he has fun with history as historic villains like Hitler and Goebbels are played as jokes, and the female leads are interesting by ending up doomed and the performances are strong especially Pitt's southern accent, yet the strongest and most magnetic is Waltz's. So overall really this unique fun alerted history film even though full of propaganda can be classified as glorious work. Clearly count it as a feel good film to see."
"TOMNEL","9","4","13","21 August 2009"," A WWII masterpiece from Tarantino that shoves a lot in our face, but luckily knows what to do with it.
","Quentin Tarantino has a way with dialogue, and a way with plot. Along with that, he has a way with throwing too much plot into a movie, or too much dialogue into a film with not enough plot (like Death Proof). This film has quite a large amount of dialogue, and it also has many different story lines and characters, none of which are elaborated on until near the end, so it almost seems as though they've been abandoned. By the end of the movie, it's quite apparent that nothing has been abandoned and all these story lines have been calculated as to how to end them perfectly and how to connect everything. Tarantino knew what he was doing.<br/><br/>Like all of Tarantino's films, this one is split up into chapters. Unlike any of his other's, this one is almost completely chronological, aside from the infrequent flashbacks. One story revolves around the Inglorious Basterds, a group of Jewish-American soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Rein (Brad Pitt), and their Nazi scalping. Another story involves Shoshana (Melani Laurent), an escaped Jew who ran away from the evil ""Jew Killer"", Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), who is out for revenge. Perhaps she will get the revenge she wants when Landa is security at a movie premier at the theater she owns. And there's dozens of fairly main characters and actors along the way to go along with the main plots.<br/><br/>If this film could be compared to any other Tarantino film, it would have to be Reservoir Dogs. Not because of any plot similarities, or similar scenes, but this film is devoid of emotion. Tarantino has his more emotional films, like the second Kill Bill, or Jackie Brown, or even Pulp Fiction, but this isn't really one of them. With that said, this still has characters that are likable and that the audience cares about, this movie just overall isn't an overly emotional film. But that's not what it's about anyways, it's a war film.<br/><br/>The movie is rich in characters, and boy are there a lot of them with quite a bit of screen time. Brad Pitt is definitely the main character of the Americans, and he gives an over the top, often times comedic performance, but he plays a great contrast to the German's lead actor Christoph Waltz, who plays the sinister and evil Col. Hans Landa. Melanie Laurent plays a reserved (for the most part), but interesting role as the woman hell bent on revenge. Diane Kruger plays a rather minor, but interesting role as a German movie star who is actually a spy for the Americans. Every role played is played well, but unlike as it would seem by the trailers, all these actors aren't wrapped around Brad Pitt's finger, but instead Christoph Waltz's. He's the bad guy, and not just that, but he's also the smartest and most cunning of the characters. Really, this film revolves around him, and it works well that way, he's a great character.<br/><br/>My only major quibble with the film is it's set-up. The way the movie is set up, it's only loosely thrown together until everything at the end brings the stories together. So for the first hour and a half (or around there), this movie felt like a constantly changing anthology. Once chapter five binds it together and gives us a typical great Tarantino ending, it makes the movie whole. But the looseness of the film towards the middle brought up questions as to what the purpose of different characters were. Luckily, the answers are all in the last chapter.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino has yet again made another movie masterpiece. This one is one of leisure, but at the same time a constantly changing story. By the end, this film has delivered the goods. The rest of the film sets up what will happen with typical rich Tarantino dialogue, and some bloody violence. Definitely it's a unique take on World War II.<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 154 mins. R for strong violence, language and brief sexuality."
"yeah_baby_5","10","4","13","21 August 2009"," One of the best movies of the year
","Inglourious Basterds is not your typical Tarantino flick. Normally Tarantino does films that are gangster and heist related or sometimes both. With Inglourious Basterds Tarantino takes a different approach using the Second World War as a setting. However, similar to his other films, there are cases where the violence is expressed in a exaggerated and sometimes comedic manner. However, the beginning of the film does express the seriousness of the Holocaust, Nazi Germany and the Second World War in general. Then there is Brad Pitt's character Aldo Raine who adds a bit of comic relief to the film with certain one liners and ridiculous phrases. However, the best performance was by Christoph Waltz who plays Col. Hans Landa. Waltz's performance of Landa was very well done and should not be overlooked when it comes time to pick Oscar nominations in January. There are certain goofs in Inglourious Basterds that are noticeable for example using French in English subtitles however, even masterpieces for example The Godfather contained a number of goofs as well. Inglourious Basterds in my opinion is one of the best movies of 2009 so far. If I was a member of the Academy, I would nominate Inglourious Basterds in six categories.<br/><br/>Best Picture, Best Director-Quentin Tarantino, Actor in a Supporting Role-Christoph Waltz, Writing, material written directly for the screen, Art Direction and Costume Design<br/><br/>I am hoping the Academy considers these categories in 2010. In a nutshell I believe Inglourious Basterds is a masterpiece and any fans of war movies and Tarantino flicks should definitely check this out. 10/10"
"way2grimee","10","4","13","15 August 2009"," Simply brilliant!
","I do not know where to start about Inglourious Basterds, other than, that it was a delight to watch through out. The opening chapter puts you through so many emotions in such a short space of time that you feel like you just came off a roller-coaster, did the waltz, took a relaxing swim then had a shootout. Bizarre doesn't begin to describe it, I'll just say that Christopher Waltz is fantastic throughout, from the opening scene to the climax 2 hours 30 minutes later! Brad Pitt puts in yet another stellar performance, though comes in second place to the amazing Christopher Waltz who steals every scene in which he appears.<br/><br/>I went into this film wondering how Tarantino could possibly mould his style into a World War 2 film. I came out of it utterly satisfied, I sort of discount Kill Bill 1 & 2 as Tarantino having a bit of fun rather than actually making a movie. Jackie Brown and Death Proof were both actually great movies but nothing compared to the caliber of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Inglourious Basterds my friends, it is safe to say, completes the true Tarantino trilogy and is without a doubt his third masterpiece, this is an absolute thrill ride throughout with a fantastic opening sequence, gripping tension throughout and a completely satisfying ending in true blood spattered, tongue in cheek Tarantino style.<br/><br/>10/10. I couldn't fault it if I tried, I've been home 30 minutes and I'm still grinning with sheer satisfaction!"

","I have read criticisms of Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"", saying that it glorifies violence or that it glosses over Nazi atrocities. Some people apparently don't realize that no part of the movie is meant to be taken seriously. This flick should not be interpreted as a historical film. It is basically a comedic spaghetti western set in WWII.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt, playing a none-too-educated (but extremely clever) yokel leading a platoon of Jewish-American soldiers into Nazi-occupied France to kill and scalp Nazis, puts on one of the funniest performances that I've seen in years. And let me tell you, this movie leaves NOTHING to the imagination! As is the case with pretty much any Tarantino movie, this is one that squeamish people should avoid as if it was the H1N1 virus. For non-squeamish people, this is the flick for you! Tarantino is not afraid to show anything and play it for laughs. The scene in the cinema is, in my opinion, the movie's highlight: I would rank it right up there with Gene Kelly's stroll down the pluvial sidewalk in ""Singin' in the Rain"".<br/><br/>Among the rest of the cast: Christoph Waltz as Nazi Col. Hans Landa, aka the Jew Killer; Diane Kruger as German actress Bridget von Hammersmark, collaborating with the Allies; Til Schweiger as a German-born Jewish soldier with the Americans; Mike Myers as an English officer; and Melanie Laurent as the daughter of a Jewish family, now seeking revenge.<br/><br/>All in all, I recommend this movie as much as possible."
"dj_xand325","9","5","18","16 August 2009"," Tarantino's epic black comedy. Inglourious Basterds is a sprawling, rhapsodic, triumphant, ridiculously original cinematic experience
","<ul><li>Tarantino is possibly the greatest cult director to ever live - </li></ul><br/><br/>Originality and Passion is something that is relatively scarce in the contemporary film industry, many directors now simply produce films for the whopping pay check after release (Michael Bay, Jason Friedberg...). Yet, Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is a gleaming example that there is still raw passion and bundles of originality nestled in the undercurrents of cinema. Tarantino's films most definitely have an acquired taste, his style is marred with obscure film references, heavy dialogue, dark comedy and you'd usually expect his characters to go into a burst of pointless chit-chat about pop culture. This is what his cinema is and he sticks to his guns, he's not tempted by the majority audience to cash in on. The beauty of Inglourious Basterds is that he sticks to his style, but he puts it into a totally different use to produce a wacky piece of cinema of the like that I've never seen before or never will!<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is split into five chapters that all have a distinct tone and direction. It involves two bloody stories of revenge and redemption coming together in a simply outrageous fashion. Melanie Laurent plays Shoshana Dreyfus, a vengeful cinema owner who witnessed her family get massacred by Nazi Colonel, Hans 'Jew Hunter' Landa (Christophe Waltz). Whilst, Brad Pitt plays Lt Aldo Raine as he leads a battalion of hate-filled American Jews on a rampage to kill Nazis. Both stories unite in a simply epic conclusion. <br/><br/>Once again, Tarantino gathers an admirable cast that fit the script. Waltz pulled off a great performance that should expect Academy recognition, Pitt was very good as the simple American lieutenant and Laurent was perfect as Shoshana. I could only complain about Eli Roth, but I don't want to waste my time explaining why as the reasons should be obvious!<br/><br/>Like a typical Tarantino film, there are flourishes of Morricone music, brilliant yet perhaps superfluous dialogue and plenty of violence. The film doesn't take itself seriously, it's just great fun and miles away from your normal war film. Tarantino treats sensitive issues like Nazism like anything else, producing a multitude of violence never seen before in his films. <br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is a black comedy, we find ourselves laughing when in fact we should be shocked and disgusted. Yet, this doesn't suggest the story is lousy, it's actually brilliant. It's ironic and surprisingly gripping, all thanks to a script that I would describe as spectacular. The writing is subtle and at times, hilarious. <br/><br/>Tarantino's films have always been quite comical, yet this is his first all-out black comedy. The farcical story structure encapsulates a great atmosphere of stupidity, so much so that you can't help but laugh out loud at the end. <br/><br/>The film is most certainly an acquired taste, some may find the heavy scenes of dialogue as excessive or some may see Tarantino's attempts at black humour as immature and juvenile. Opinions were always going to be polarised as they were at Cannes. But I can tell you one thing, Inglourious Basterds sees Tarantino back on blistering form and I can't wait for his next project. <br/><br/>""Tarantino's hilarious film is an epic celebration of cinema"" <br/><br/>""Laurent and Waltz shine in the best film of the summer""<br/><br/>""Wildly Original. A crazy, twisted, bloody war film that certainly has its dramatic moments exemplified by Tarantino's exhilarating music choice"" <br/><br/>""Awesome, Dazzling, Beautiful. Inglourious Basterds fails to disappoint""<br/><br/>""Entertainment of the highest calibre""<br/><br/>""Has everything you'd expect from a Tarantino film.

","To be honest after movies like Pulp Fiction and Jacky Brown, hearing people comment about the new movie inglorious basterds to be a true highlight, expectations were quiet high. I was a bit disappointed, as I had expected more suspense, more specialities within this movie. But the only really highlight to me was Christopher Waltz which at least kept the level. His way of being overpolite and at the same time very evil is outstanding acting. Brad Pitt for me has showed that he definitely is not one of the top actors. What a shame having him in this film. Dianne Krueger was a waste of time. Conclusion is that I think Tarantino has really gone commercially, always repeating this mix of western and b movies which some kind is boring. His films have since Kill Bill lost the unexpected and are really turning more and more to B Movies although unwanted. Inglorious Basterds is apart from 2-3 scenes just a boring outcome. Don't get me wrong I am everything else than a average Hollywood admirer. I adore the European and Japanese cinema."

","It is now December 2013 and I finally managed to watch this movie. Or I should say the first 20 minutes of this abomination before I went into convulsions and had to stop watching.<br/><br/>This is one of the silliest movies ever made and there is no doubt in my mind that its the movie that finally made QT jump the shark. What an incoherent mess this is.<br/><br/>Does QT really need to pander to the Jews at this point in his career? It reminds me of a little kid who gets bullied at school but when he gets home fantasizes he is all powerful and strong and kicks the bully's ass. But that does not make it any more true. <br/><br/>I mean, seriously, you only make a crappy holocaust/ suffering of the jews movie if you are a new, up-and-coming director who wants to rise quickly. But what the hell was this all about from an established director? <br/><br/>I guess QT made 3 good movies - Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Jackie Brown. It's been downhill ever since. I refuse to watch another of his movies."

","Alright there is lot to say about this movie.<br/><br/>First, I find it very interesting that people are disturbed by the fact that they don't know who to root for. Somehow the usual bad guys that are the Nazis are given a positive or at least human edge. This has to be a Hollywood novelty.<br/><br/>Second, the combination of more than two different languages in such an authentic way seems to be another novelty. Sehr gut!<br/><br/>Third, I didn't expect to get a history lesson from Mr. Tarantino and I didn't get one. But I didn't expect it to be THIS absurd. The absurdity obviously was intended and gave the movie a comic-like atmosphere. Sadly though, it was not comical.<br/><br/>Forth, the acting of Christoph Waltz, Brad Pitt, August Diehl and Daniel Bruehl was brilliant to very good. Many people seem to feel that Pitt was bad, but his trashy performance was essential for the comic-like feeling of the movie. His character personalizes the flavor of the movie very well.<br/><br/>Fifth, the revenge? Well all in all this movie is heavily overrated. It is some kind of trashy artistic designer movie. Like a mixture of Schindlers List, Pulp Fiction, Sin City and a dose of LSD. It tries very hard to be cool, but it doesn't quite get there. In fact it really doesn't get anywhere. Some scenes are great, some annoying and many are stupid. Not hold together by a real plot, but by the strong underlying notion that this movie desperately wants to be unlike all the other movies out there. The only lasting memory (apart from some good actor performances) will probably be the overdone splatter-like violence. The ending was extremely disappointing -- maybe this also was intended.

"MairegChernet","9","3","9","25 December 2009"," Top notch Tarantino material
","He does it again. The king of blood and gore once again proves that he can keep audiences entertained for almost 2 and a half hours. Inglourious Basterds is a Tarantino classic in many aspects. One, it offers plenty of violence and bloodshed. From Start to finish, heads are blown off, people are shot fatally and scalps are cut off gruesomely. Second, it has Brad freakin' Pitt. Tarantino movies always have one or two stars and a million up and coming actors. In this case, Pitt and Roth shine out while the rest of the supporting cast do an outstanding job of portraying their minor roles (not to forget Melanie Laurent.) Third thing is, the direction is wonderful. The sound effects, the camera shots, all the cinematographic aspects are excellent.<br/><br/>In short, Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is an exhilarating action flick that is full of entertainment from start to finish."
"weblynx-1","8","3","9","22 November 2009"," Great start, damp end
","This movie promised to be one of Tarantino's best.. with the exquisite beginning (the subtle tension, the gradual build-up of the charming Colonel who chillingly transforms into the hunter - fabulous job from Chris Waltz), the intriguing middle part with its mysterious and haunting scenarios, the introduction of the exquisite Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) in her new avatar as cinema-owner, the Basterds themselves on their glorious vengeance trail (Brad Pitt deserves particular mention as a great character actor in this part of the movie), and Diane Kruger in all her beauty playing a rather nervous but credible role (the only in- credible role being that of the person who played Hitler himself).. despite the great build-up, however, this humdinger of a movie collapses into farce in the end, leaving one wondering what exactly was the director's intention..with such a tremendous start and accelerating suspense combined with some of the most divinely-cinematographed sequences, one is led to expect a great denouement.. what one gets however is a typical, Pulp-Fiction, Quentin Tarantino ending which is completely meaningless and indeed comical. All said and done however, a great effort and a movie well worth the watch for its many many memorable moments and characters."
"funny_diana","6","3","9","8 October 2009"," Such great expectations...
","So disappointed that I could cry ... I expected controversy, free but clever violence , dark humor, sarcasm, fascinating characters, memorable, the kind you condemn and admire in silence, intelligent dialog,.. a lot of dialog, with apparent calm and timeouts spread throughout the whole and much much more. Can't really say that these were missing completely but they weren't really there either. Tarantino's presence was felt and recognized only in the first chapter, to which I have nothing to reproach, it is clearly and indisputably the climax of his art in this movie. So much has been written about this movie, so many were excited and so many cheered and praised it. It just makes you sad. It's a painful proof that very few can recognize and enjoy the genius of Tarantino. He became a standard, a pattern in which the world situates him, no longer standing to judge the choice, a pattern which can already exist without the help of its creator, and also without any extra effort from his part. Any movie he makes, will have a default label, and the people would hardly even wait to watch it before assigning it. Well, for us to be able to enjoy original Tarantino creations, and to be able to boost him into making the effort to be ... himself, we have to cross over our hearts and give up that already prepared label and admit it when he fails. It's not a film entirely unsuccessful, it has its moments, the usual irony and humor, less subtle here, but present, although that only makes me give credit to the author's cleverness, but not to his genius. Oh, and to be mentioned two characters that made an unforgettable good impression: Christoph Waltz (Land - genius actor) and Melanie Laurent (Shosanna) plus Michael Fassbender (Hicox) who had too little time on film(a pity)."
"Troy_Campbell","9","3","9","30 September 2009"," It has been a long wait for Tarantino fans across the world. Question is, was it worth it? The short answer is yes.
","When writing a review there are normally a handful of things that stand out (either good or bad) that I know I must write about. Unfortunately Basterds doesn't have a few, there are a multitude of elements worthy of discussion. The next problem is where do I start? Tarantino's famous ear for classic dialogue? Waltz's Cannes award-winning performance? The mesmerizing music and score heard throughout? The abundance of movie references and parodies used with affection? The list is almost endless. Well, hell, let's just begin with the man calling the shots.<br/><br/>Tarantino has been working on this script for well over a decade. Just when we thought he was ready to make it, he decided to take time out to make his kung fu epic Kill Bill. Then he put Basterds on hiatus once again to work with long-time pal Robert Rodriguez in making the double feature Grindhouse. It has been a long wait for Tarantino fans across the world. Question is, was it worth it? The short answer is yes. It may not reach the heights of Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill Vol 1, but it is an entirely different beast altogether and succeeds on its own terms. His lengthy talkative scenes are sometimes dragged out slightly but make no mistake, this is a master of his craft at work. No word is accidental or incidental, each conversation from the mood-setting opening scene to the tense talk-off between opposing officers and onwards to the closing scene featuring two fan favourites is pieced together with intricate care and a clear love for his work. In fact, Tarantino obviously doesn't care if the audience don't get the plethora of references to German cinema or old-school war movies, he expects you to go away and see these films then revisit his cinematic opus with an even greater adoration for what you hear on screen. But fear not, he's not stupid either. He realises 99.99% of viewers won't understand these bite-sized references so never do these moments hinge on your film knowledge, just your appreciation that there is more importance to the chatter then you may know.<br/><br/>A picture is worth a thousand words and QT ensures that your eyes are in for a feast as well. The action as it unravels in front of you may not be quite as captivating as the dialogue however there is still one iconic visual after another, evoking all sorts of emotions. Your heart will sink when you see poor Shosanna running from the fate of her family; great delight will wash over you when you see the sanguinary Nazi-turned-Nazi-hunter Sgt. Stiglitz (Schweiger) on top of a mound cackling away; the graphic violence will have you cheering then instantly feeling guilty afterwards; and the penultimate scene (to give any more info would to give too much info) will sear itself into your brain for better or worse. In one particular breathtaking scene with French actress Melanie Laurent, Tarantino combines striking visuals with a truly exceptional song to brilliant effect.<br/><br/>Then there is relatively unknown German actor Christoph Waltz. Many don't realise that if Tarantino didn't find Waltz this movie may have never been made. Tarantino was adamant that this role required both an astonishing actor and someone who could speak German, English and French with equal fluency. He famously said that he would not even begin making this picture unless he had the perfect person for the job, such is the importance of the Col. Landa role. He picked the right person. Waltz makes his vivacious 'Jew Hunter' both charming and nefarious, you want to hate him but at the same time you can't help but smile when he is on screen. He won Best Supporting Actor at Cannes this year and you would hope to see him feature come Oscar time. Don't forget about the headlining Pitt either. His Lee Marvin-alike Lt. Rain is tongue-in-cheek at its best. Clearly having a blast working with Tarantino, the more talented half of Brangelina oozes charisma as he hams it up as the half-apache leader of the Basterds. His flawless comic timing has never been so apparent before. Fassbender, Bruhl, Laurent and Schweiger all offer up top shelf performances but Kruger can't quite keep up with them and Martin Wuttke's Hitler is a touch over the top.<br/><br/>Basterds is a self-aware romp that exists in the same world as Kill Bill's martial arts assassins, Death Proof's heroic chicks and Pulp Fiction's gangsters. Never does Tarantino try to convince us that this story belongs in our reality and nor is he ever apologetic at warping history to suit himself. Like usual he has created this following his own rules – which is to say no rules – and we thank him all the more for it.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

","Since I've watched ""Pulp Fiction"" I have continuously waited for the next comparable movie. I've liked Pulp Fiction so much, that ever since, I was comparing any movie that I liked with it. Since then, i have waited every year for the next Tarantino hit. I was not very impressed by Kill Bills (especially the second), or Deathproof. I felt that this will come. And it came, in the form of Inglourious Basterds. It was the first movie which, for me, can compare with Pulp fiction. As usual, the director is able to get the best from the actors. Brad Pitt is doing maybe one of his best roles, Cristoph Waltz (as Hans Landa) is extraordinary, incredible performance, for me it was an unbelievable revelation. As well, the other actors deliver very good performance, and i noted Mélanie Laurent (as Shosanna Dreyfus), Sylvester Groth( as Goebbels). <br/><br/>I give it an {Excellent} mark, and I say that this is worth to be seen."

","Tarantino surprises me once again with Inglorious Basterds. This movie shows that Mr. Tarantino doesn't give a damn about reviews, critics, etc. He just does what he wants, and that's what makes him a good director, he doesn't listen to what others may think and expresses his art the way he wants to. And that's admirable. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt was obviously thumbs up, he plays Aldo Raine perfectly fine. I loved him trying to speak Italian I laughed so much in that scene. I must say that this role is one of my favorites in his career, because it shows us that he is a very versatile actor and not just a cute face. But i have to say that my favorite performance goes to Christoph Waltz, he is Hans Landa a detective from the SS. He is amazing in this role, just amazing, I would give him an Oscar.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say anything about the cinematography or the directing, or the violence, it's all Tarantino style. <br/><br/>Don't listen to the bad reviews, see for yourselves. If you like Tarantino, you will not be disappointed and If you don't give him a chance. I just don't understand why people start saying all these things about history can't be changed, I mean It's a movie, just a movie. It's not realistic obviously but it's fun and it's good. Just be open-minded and go watch this. That's why I certainly recommend it to everyone who enjoys something different from usual Hollywood."

","For a movie pertaining to World War II, the action sequences are rather sparse, yet captivating. Instead of endless battle scenes, Quentin Tarantino creates optimism, enthusiasm, terror, and even humor through several characters and scenes. Brad Pitt showcases his acting ability with some similarities to his role in Burn After Reading, including humor. It is not the most historical relevant movie, but if that's what you're looking for, you're better off with a documentary. It is a classic Tarantino movie, full of violence and fanatical scenes. If you were a fan of the Kill Bill saga, you will enjoy this movie, it is definitely worth seeing."

Pitt and the Basterds roaming about scalping Nazis is funny as hell.<br/><br/>Possibly the film is not for every audience. I'd suggest though, that for someone to truly be offended by this piece they would have to have little humour at all.

","* * SPOILERS * * Great movie.<br/><br/>When the basterds decide to smash the head of the uncooperative nazi officer I was worried that the first hit would render him unconscious but no. He started screaming when the bear jew started his work with a nail studded baseball bat. Judging from the audiences response this was Tarantino's crowd pleaser.<br/><br/>My only complaint was that there were not enough scenes w/the basterd's exploits, too much overlong dialog. The finale was great when the basterds and Shoshanna trapped a whole bunch of nazi's in a movie theater and burned / exploded it. This was a badly needed reprise of the basement scene of the dirty dozen. Those animals were actually cheering when they were watching Americans being killed in Italy, now it was their turn. <br/><br/>The last scene was priceless when Aldo ordered the shooting and scalping of Landa's driver. The look on his nazi face was astonishing, 'the war is over and I am only a flunky'. He got what he deserved, good job Tarantino!<br/><br/>Great job Tarantino."
"Red_Identity","Null","3","9","2 September 2009"," Quentin Tarantino's Blast!
","I am a big fan of Quentin Tarantino. I completely loved Pulp Fiction, and has some of the best dialogue ever written. I was a fan of his Kill Bill films, and I loved Death Proof almost as much as Pulp Fiction, and had a great time with it. Inglorious Basterds is another remarkable achievement from Tarantino. It is a clever, funny, audacious and entertaining spin on World War II. I loved it. I did not know what to expect, if more of a comedy or a drama, but ultimately it had the classic Tarantino features. The film is superbly written, and I enjoyed all of the dialogue, which of course is what Tarantino does best. This is no exception. I was completely emerged into this other world, one we have never seen before. The performances were all very strong. Brad Pitt shines here, but then again, I have always found him to be a very charismatic actor, and I enjoy almost all of his work. Christoph Waltz did not disappoint after hearing all of the praise. His performance is not overly-flashy, but it works perfectly. He is without a doubt the best in the film, and that is saying a lot. Classic performance I am sure. But a lot of others impressed me a lot also. Mélanie Laurent and Diane Kruger were very good, Til Schweiger and Daniel Brühl almost equally as great as Waltz. Pitt, Waltz, and these four made the film. Eli Roth was quite good, and I enjoyed seeing him perform in this. The cameo by Mike Myers was very funny, and Martin Wuttke created a very memorable Hitler. Similar to Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, the film had a lot of blending music, and I loved it for that. The costumes and set designs were all exquisite, and I loved all of it.<br/><br/>Although I am a quite a big Tarantino fan, sometimes his films do overload in my viewings, sometimes I have some sort of resentment towards them. Pulp Fiction, sometimes I feel it is very disturbing and very violence-oriented, and Kill Bill the same, and I feel like it is stuffed with style, but sometimes I wonder about the substance. Also, I find Kill Bill sort of overrated, whereas I find Death Proof very underrated. I still love them, yeah, but I feel that way sometimes. I am not sure whether I will feel the same way from time to time with Inglorious Basterds, but I do think it is equally as great as Pulp Fiction, and I think it will fare very well with time!"

","When watching the beginning of the movie one really questions if the movie is going to consist of overextended talking scenes with limited action, but then act 2 starts and the notion evaporates. This was the best movie that I have ever seen in theaters. There is nothing better than watching Brad Pitt and a group of American Jews terrorize the Nazis. If you don't appreciate this movie you are either completely void of emotion, or are over sensitive to brutal violence scenes against the most evil force of the last 500 years. Some of the most well developed characters in the movie are that of the third Reich, but in the end it doesn't matter. One still finds themselves rooting for the right side and in the end you will not be disappointed. Inglourious basterds is the best movie of the past five years and truly is Quinten Tarantinos masterpiece."

","Austrian Christoph Waltz' menacing performance ranks among the top 5 of any actor I've ever seen (anyone tried to memorize 30 pages of dialog for a single scene and switch between languages lately?)--- reason alone to see this movie. I read where some reviwers found the scene ""boring"" (?????!). The film itself is thoroughly entertaining. Tarantino delivers phenomenal performances from everyone, wrapped around historical revisionism with an anachronistic score straight out of a spaghetti western (yes, there are innumerable minor historical flubs, but yeesh, history it ain't!). The set design and visuals are remarkable. I had some very minor gripes: Pitt's character lacks depth, to the degree that I felt like some of his stuff was left on the cutting room floor, the Basterds deserved more screen time doing mayhem and Hitler's make up was iffy (contrast that with Mike Meyers' pasty British)---- gaaah! I didn't recognize Rod Taylor as Churchill (!). The visuals are stunning (the image of the screen burning: astounding) and Tarantino is obviously up on his knowledge of WW2 German cinema (Emil Jannings was a cool touch). I thought I heard Harvey Keitel 's voice on the phone--?! 10/10. See it for the acting! Not for kids..."

","I've read so many reviews of this movie that complain about the few action scenes there were in reality when the trailer promised more, but I thought that more scenes like that would have dragged the movie out and took away its biting nature. The thing I liked about this movie was the wit and irony which could only be accomplished through the long conversation scenes. I think the ""modern"" score in this ""period"" piece added to the irony in that we are looking back on history and wishing that this was how things had actually happened. <br/><br/>This is a movie that truly deserves to be seen in a theatre. It is a communal event, the way that a good movie should be. Films were designed to be seen in theatres, and this is one movie that would not be the same viewed otherwise, no matter how big your home kino is. I felt connected to the other people sitting around me as all one hundred of us clapped when a dick-head officer (I won't say which one and spoil the fun) FINALLY got shot. We laughed when two characters debated through subtitles over whether to start speaking in English. The facetiousness of this film is just too great to be experienced alone.<br/><br/>So, if I were you, I'd go see this movie. I'm probably going to see it again. Yes, it was that good. It made me feel good about being an American (which is something you don't experience too often these days). It made me want to go watch Pulp Fiction for the fiftieth time in a row. And it made me remember that there can be comedy in everything. Even explosions. Especially explosions. In short, this movie just kept getting better with every minute, and although at times it seemed almost too ridiculous, I remembered that that was the point, and if I am not a happier person because of this movie, there is no hope for this world.<br/><br/>Read my original review at http://themoviemistress.blogspot.com/2009/08/inglorious- basterds-basterds-maybe.html"

","After hearing this movie criticized so much on TV and radio i was quite surprised at how good this is. Firstly, a lot of criticism is directed at Mike Myers in his role as the general. Now i presume most of this is coming from people who have never met an English 'Toff' as he is absolutely fantastic and completely believable and i feel i must stand in his defence. From the outset this movie is much darker than i'd have thought and usually Tarantino films are full on one liners and quotes and this movie moves away from his usual style. I think this was brave and a masterful change of direction. Its a great war movie, and not just war movie, it's great full stop. The acting by everyone is fantastic and Christoph Waltz excels himself, although i will admit that i have seen Brad Pitt perform far better. The cinema-photography is good, the dialogue too (and using actors that actually speak the languages is a great touch and something that should be done every time anyway in my opinion), and like Tarantino himself said 'Should these characters and situation have existed in the war then this storyline is highly plausible,' which i think is true. I am not a Tarantino fan, i thought Jackie Brown was over rated, resevior dogs definitely worth seeing but not all that, and kill bill was aimed at young teenagers, this however is a masterpiece and i can't fault it. Well done Quentin and everyone else involved, and to anyone who reads this then go and watch it, it's well worth the money."

"scottmannen1","8","3","9","27 August 2009"," Basterds is Irony!
","This movie is special because it is IRONIC. It is the exact opposite of what you would expect a WW2 movie to be about. The usual fare is the persecution of the jews in most WW2 nazi films. IBasterds is different because it takes that premise and then reverses it: What would happen if WW2 had been about the persecution of the Nazis? This movie manages to make the Nazis look evil, but at the same time it turns the Jews and the Americans into the true evil making victims out of the Germans. No mercy is shown to the German army and the movie is about revenge and taking the evil that the Germans personified in WW2 and placing that evil intention into the hands of the allies and the jew.<br/><br/>The movie manages to have a fair bit of tongue in cheek humour mixed in with an interesting intellectual plot. This movie succeeds because it manages to do something that no other WW2 movies have managed to do, and it does it rather well! The true star of this movie is the 'jew hunter' Nazi. This guy is very intelligent, and comes across as a nice guy on the outside with a true hidden diabolical intention buried beneath his friendly intellectual exterior. His wholesome milk drinking friendly approach to solving his mysteries makes for a very interesting character! Brad Pitt, while doing an excellent job of acting out his character is not seen very much in the film at all.<br/><br/>The movie is controversial beyond belief and is the kind of movie that leaves you thinking about it long after you have watched it. I rate this movie an 8/10. In my opinion a little more action would have done this movie more justice, and a little less screen time to the artsie visuals and what seems to be at times drawn-out conversations would have made this movie a 9.<br/><br/>A good movie for sure, and an instant classic"

","Inglorious Basterds is Tarantinos book. The storyline is told in chapter format so that each scene builds tension through the use of dialogue, that only Tarantino could create, and leads to a fantastic finish. The film itself builds to an incredible ending but at a slower pace, much like many of his other films. Sharp witty lines and references to other films keep the viewer engaged. Rather than having bullets do the talking, the actors do the talking, enough so that the viewer can become emotionally invested in nearly everyone with a speaking part. But after the actors have done enough talking the bullets do there thing and it is quite pleasing. The three lead actors are all incredible and entertaining, the dramatic acting is great and you can find the humor in nearly everything that is said and done. Also Eli Roth is awesome. Go see the movie."

","From the twisted but brilliantly acclaimed mind of writer/director Quentin Tarantino comes a movie so shocking but also surprisingly entertaining that it could only be described as a guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>Once upon a time in Nazi Occupied France Lt. Aldo Rayne (Pitt) leads a team of Jewish soldiers known as The Basterds to do dirty business and work above the law. Their job is to brutally scalp and kill every Nazi, who comes their way. The job becomes bigger when they intend on blowing up a movie theater with the German army attending. Meanwhile the theater owner (a Jewish/French refugee) has another revenge plot in mind for the Nazis.<br/><br/>Tarantino once said he's always dreamt of killing Nazis and glorifying it on screen. Now his dream's come true. Inglorious Basterds does what it sets out to accomplish: shock & entertain viewers with dark humor and over the top Tarantino style violence (it's comical but graphic.) For me though this is another cult classic from Tarantino. Every suspense sequence was chilling, every joke was a riot, and every line was quotable.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt has outdone himself again, by acing another memorable comedic performance coming from an unexpected character. The supporting cast including Eli Roth (Hostel), Diane Kruger (National Treasure), and a cameo from Mike Myers all finely turned their roles. That said the biggest surprise here is Christoph Waltz's portrayal of the clever and terrifying villain Col. Hans Landa (AKA: The Jew Hunter.) Waltz captures the dark and menacing tone of his character perfectly, and is convincing for every on screen moment. His mesmerizing performance left me speechless so therefore he has my vote for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars next year, and he's sure to be this year's Javier Bardem of villains as well.<br/><br/>That aside keep in mind that this is still Tarantino so expect gory, over the top, realistic violence, along with a teaspoon of profanity. If your family has a code of conduct then this isn't something that should come on your list. A lot of this movie is also in foreign dialogue so if you hate reading subtitles wait for it on rental.<br/><br/>To conclude this is a bloody and intense portrayal of World War 2 but with tremendous writing, breathtaking suspense sequences, a great composing score and the right amount of dark humor, it succeeds at being an instant Tarantino classic is a great way to end the summer. All hail Lord Tarantino!"

","I am a die hard Tarantino fan, the movies he writes and directs are always among my favorites, and I have been following this movie since it was rumored to be his next. Yet once i saw the trailers and commercials i was disappointed on what i believed the movie was gonna be. Shame on me for doubting QT!<br/><br/>As in all Tarantino movies, the dialog is fantastic. The opening milk scene is well written and really locked me into the movie. As well as the rendezvous at the bar whilst playing the card game, during the confrintation with the major, and the Mexican standoff. Without going too in depth about it it is just classic QT and is what makes me love his films.<br/><br/>The music is the only thing i could complain about, if there is anything to complain about. Most, if not all the songs reminded me of Kill Bill. When a song came on i just immediately shot to whatever scene in Kil Bill the similar song. I asked some other people if they felt the same way about the music and they said they could see it but not as bad as me. I don't know, it was just a personal thing.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is a hilarious, well written, extremely violent action sack. I loved it for almost every second except when it ended, i did not want it to end. I like how Hitler and his whole high command were all killed, and how it is it's own history book. In order for a movie to be good, it does not have to be historically accurate, and this movies proves it.<br/><br/>Keep it going QT! You keep this going and i will be a fan for life"
"flobersold","8","3","9","25 August 2009"," Disturbing, impressing, disgusting, funny... and even teaching
","I can't say I was a great Tarantino fan - though I like ""Pulp Fiction"". And I am German, which might be an interesting fact reviewing a movie about killing Germans (equaled to being Nazis). And - with a night gone by and time to think about it - I appreciate this one as well.<br/><br/>Because I hate stories dividing the characters into ""good ones"" and ""baddies"", drawing forth the line of good-prevailing-over-evil-tales just once more. Those are often the ones whose heroes can serve as models for a one-sided point of view and violence as means of a solution to a problem. In this movie almost everyone is or at least intends to become a murderer, fully justified by his or her own point of view as it seems. This leads to an excess of violence, cruelty and retaliation which, I was a little surprised to become aware of, had quite a disturbing effect on me. It's not that I wasn't used to bloody war movies (finding it inadequate to conceal the atrocities of war). But the unscrupulous way of (over)killing, this continuous mistreating of other human beings - consequently dehumanized by their killers - ends up in a kind of nightmare where there are no ""good ones"" anymore. It really urged me to think about the way we are treating others, how small the gap to the ""dark side"" is. How suddenly the feeling changes from desire for revenge to compassion with the punished. Wrath is more than comprehensible but hatred and revenge lead to a disastrous Nemesis. (Even the average American might know about the infamous Nazi-German ""Vergeltungsmaßnahmen"" (retaliation actions), often against civilians. Or take a look at the middle east. It's a vicious circle.) You could even call it a spiritual movie this way... weird way of delivering the message though...<br/><br/>This has nothing to do with my nationality: I would have said the same if it was a film about Germans killing Russians or Jews - f****d up all the same! But maybe I could identify even more with the ""baddies"" this time. Tarantino fosters feelings of empathy for them (for a soldier, trying to protect his comrades or for a father, trying to stay alive to see his new-born son), partly even more than for the members of the Basterds. So I suppose it's intended to blur the borders this way. Great job! In addition the multinational casting and the different spoken languages do an incredible job creating a tense atmosphere! Thumbs up!<br/><br/>Great job of course by Christoph Waltz as well, I must agree! His action alone is worth watching the movie, awesome!!! I wasn't bored by the longer dialog parts - other than in ""Death Proof"" I don't regard them as unnecessary. And they serve as counterparts to the actions scenes. I'd say it's still quite a bloody one (and I can understand everyone disgusted by such gore) but very well worth watching - and thinking about it."

I had seen many movies before Pulp Fiction, but never really sat back and took everything in the director was throwing out. With that being said i never really liked any of the other movies he has done, nor the whole generation of movie makers that emulated him. I did in fact respect him and his movies.They just didn't have anything to offer me. Going into seeing Inglorious Basterds i was expecting a lot from the movie , as i have all of his movies since Pulp Fiction and in the back of my mind was expecting to be disappointed like i have since Pulp Fiction. The movie had me mesmerized from the second it started, everything was perfect. Not a scene out of place not a second could be cut out, i was in the movie for over 2 hours. I have not watched a movie and been so wrapped up in it where i totally forgotten i was watching a movie since i was like 6 watching E.T.

"kismit","7","3","9","23 August 2009"," Entertaining but not his best
","I am a huge QT fan so went expecting a lot. My short take is that if you want something as fresh as Pulp Fiction or as eye popping as Kill Bill you will be disappointed. This film plods painfully along in the first half, setting up the later story but not in a slick way like his earlier work. It almost stumbles through the usual QT violence (although less gratuitously than you might expect from the trailers) before flowing nicely for the last half hour. It is like the first half of the film was edited by a student. Brad Pitt is a caricature and most of his band of merry men are not very well developed. The villain is maybe the best fleshed out and most interesting. Not to say Pitt isn't good because you want to laugh every time he opens his mouth and he looks like he's having fun. Not bad by any means but QT and Brad Pitt together set the bar pretty high and I don't think they quite reach it. Pitt's Italian dialogue is memorable."

"rstarzecmoviecritic","10","2","5","24 July 2019"," Review from 2015, A Perfect Movie
","I remember that this was my second Tarantino film. A few days before, I watched Reservoir Dogs with my brother, introducing me to Tarantino movies, and I was ecstatic that my Dad agreed to take me to Inglourious Basterds since the trailers made it look like a good revenge film. I was surprised that the film went beyond this notion and was simply fantastic overall, leaving me smiling as I left the theater.<br/><br/>Let me just say, the early trailers for this film are deceiving. They make it appear that the premise is simply Brad Pitt and his men killing Nazis in a brutal manner throughout. This is definitely not the case, and actually touches on subjects I never would have imagined. Tarantino shows his knowledge for German cinema throughout as the main character of the B plot - Shoshanna - comes to own a cinema, and the Nazis are dealing with where they should hold the premiere for the new film by Joseph Goebbels - Nation's Pride.<br/><br/>The villain, played by Christoph Waltz, is such an amazing character to watch. At certain points, he exhibits intellect and detective skills near Sherlock Holmes levels, and at other times he makes us laugh with how out of touch he is with certain customs. The first twenty minutes of the film is almost fully dedicated to this Hans Landa, and it proves to be among the best sequences Tarantino has ever written.<br/><br/>I fully believe this film had a better screenplay than Django Unchained, but to me, it makes sense that the academy went with The Hurt Locker for best original screenplay. It makes sense not because The Hurt Locker fully deserved it, but because The Hurt Locker was a film that this country needed in 2009 to shape our perspective on the war being fought over seas.<br/><br/>While Inglourious Basterds is not an accurate depiction of World War II or one of the most important World War II films, it is certainly one of the most fun to watch. It is tense, funny, crowd-pleasing, and at the same time it is a very smart movie with well-developed characters, an intricate plot, meta characteristics, and above all, extremely well-written. This now holds the spot of my 2nd favorite film by Quentin Tarantino, behind Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>This review was written in 2015."
"josephinemallorys","10","2","5","13 February 2019"," Masterpiece
","Every Quentin Tarantino (QT) fan must see Inglorious Basterds, like every QT movie a person's unable to assign one drama, this movie is a perfect blend of war, comedy, action, thriller, drama, and romance. I was unable to take my eyes off of Christopher Waltz's performance as Colon Hans Landa or 'The Jew Hunter.' The story is a masterpiece, but I can tell that this movie, like most QT movies are going to be underrated and will lack in awards it deserves. I think Christopher Waltz should easily be a nominee. I think this movie should also win Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. But even if this incredible film doesn't get recognized in awards I can tell that it will go down as one of the best war movies ever made in history. I think its amazingly creative of QT not to follow the criteria that history gave him, he changes the actual history of the war with his characters. Pure Genius."

"Tweekums","9","2","5","4 March 2017"," Tarantino's War Movie
","This wartime movie follows two separate stories that are destined to meet in the final scenes. In the first Col. Hans 'The Jew Hunter' Landa enters a French farm house and, after talking to the farmer for some time, shoots the Jewish family he was hiding; one of them, eighteen year old Shosanna, manages to escape. When we next see her it is 1944 and she is running a cinema in Paris. Here she catches the eye of a young German soldier; she isn't interested in him but it turns out he is famous amongst the Germans thanks to his exploits as a sniper. A film has been made about him and he wants the premiere to take place in her cinema with all the top brass in attendance she sees this as an opportunity to avenge her family's murder. Meanwhile the second story follows a small group of Jewish American soldiers, nicknamed the 'Inglourious Basterds', who are working deep inside enemy territory killing any Germans they can get their hands on. When British Military Intelligence learns of the film premiere this group are brought into a plot to blow up the cinema with the help of a German actress, Bridget von Hammersmark, who has been working as a double agent. As the big night approaches it emerges that Adolf Hitler himself will be in attendance along with other senior Nazis if everything goes to plan the war could end in 1944.<br/><br/>If you like your war stories to fit in with real history you might find this rather annoying as some real people who did not die in 1944 end up dead in this film if however you are looking for a cracking war film with a good amount of action, some very tense scenes and a spectacular finale you could do a lot worse than this. The film opens more like a spaghetti western than a war film with the Germans arriving at a remote farmhouse. Here Landa and the farmer just talk for the first twenty minutes of the film the tension gradually rising as we wait for something to happen. Christoph Waltz is delightfully menacing without ever issuing a direct threat or raising his voice; in this scene and for most of the movie. After this prologue things get more interesting as we switch between the two plots to kill Nazis at the cinema; at any time either could be exposed or they could somehow ruin the other's scheme. Given that Tarantino's previous films are pretty bloody I expected this to be very violent but it isn't excessively; there are indeed moments of violence but more often there is just the feeling that something violent is about to happen; when it does it is short and bloody. The cast do a fine job; as well as the aforementioned Christoph Waltz there are great performances from Brad Pitt as the leader of the titular 'Inglourious Basterds', Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna and Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Tarantino's earlier films as well as people looking for a thrilling war movie."
"swthrhsmandhlhs94","9","2","5","12 January 2017"," Amazing!!
","I saw that film before 5 years. I hasn't see filM from Quentin Tarantino. Now,after five years he is my favourite director and the Inglorious Basterds is my favourite time. I have see this movie 10 times. I Love It. I hate Nazi so i love the type of violent which i saw in this film. Waltz was amazing in this role. You love him and you hate him the same time. The dialogs are very interesting. I know Some people don't love the violent. But Quentin Tarantino makes you to love the violent. My favourite scene is in the bar. This scene makes me laugh... One other scene which i love is in cafe. The dialog between Sosana and Hans was amazing. Every word, every feeling is perfect. For me is the best film from Quentin. I Hope one day to make another film like this."
"shrame","6","2","5","11 November 2016"," interesting yet childishly ridiculous
","This film has some descent acting, except for Brad Pitt, although you could tell that he seemed to cherish the role and he did try.. very good costumes, nice settings. I find World War 2 and the Nazi's to be a very fascinating subject and the Nazi portrayals, including Hitler, Goebbels were a delight to watch. Laurent as Shoshana, Waltz (he won an Oscar for his role as the Nazi hunter) and Bruhl were outstanding in their roles. <br/><br/>This film had some good elements and it had it's funny moments, like when we're first introduced to a ranting Hitler. However the story line is full of plot holes, like how a penniless Shoshana ended up owning a movie theater in the middle of Paris while being on the run... Or how the entire Nazi leadership could possibly attend one event with only 2 armed guards. In reality the Nazi leadership would never be so careless as so allow infiltrators within a mile of such an event.<br/><br/>Aside from the ridiculous story line, this movie felt too much like a Jewish inspired, hate filled, anti Nazi revenge piece, bash fest that pointlessly glorified violence and actually portrays the Nazi's as having integrity and being honorable. Imagine a film where American's were scalped for fun and a their forehead mutilated with a star symbol ? How would American audiences feel about that ? My point is that violent revenge films should not be glorified and put on a silver platter, no matter which side you're on. <br/><br/>In any case, if you want a World War 2 period film with some good acting, interesting Nazi costumes and impersonations, ridiculously childish plot holes, needless over the top violence, lots of table talk and you're willing to suspend your belief in reality, then this might be the movie for you."
"cathaleoin1999","10","2","5","27 March 2016"," Quentin Tarantino is back!
","I would like to point out that I have enjoyed all of Tarantino's films, but that this film is his first film since Pulp Fiction to truly astonish me. In a period of September 2015 - March 2016, I saw this film four times. Each time I enjoyed it more than the last. From the first minute to the hundred and fifty-third minute, you are in awe, watching a master film-maker present a truly outstanding war film. The opening farmhouse scene is incredible at building tension, and I will get to Christoph Waltz's performance later on here. From there we meet Shosanna later in life and the Basterds. Instantly, Tarantino introduces us to the main characters of the film. Brilliant story-telling. The basement scene with Michael Fassbender, Diane Kruger, Til Schweiger and August Diehl is arguably one of the best in cinema, and it's barren of English! Again, outstanding storytelling by Tarantino. Now Christoph Waltz. Seven years have passed since this film was released, and I doubt there is much more I can say about Hans Landa that hasn't already been said. Virtually unknown to everyone in world cinema, Waltz was thrust into a large Hollywood production opposite arguably the most well-known actor of this generation, Brad Pitt. The way everything played out, you could argue that Pitt was unfairly pitted (sorry) against Waltz, as Waltz gives one of the greatest performances of all time. His turn as Hans Landa is so incredible that you nearly like such an evil person. That is the mark of an astounding actor. This film is not just the work of Waltz, though. It is an ensemble effort. The cast won the SAG for best cast in a motion picture. Brad Pitt, Diane Kruger, Eli Roth, Melanie Laurent, Waltz, Fassbender, Daniel Bruhl, Til Schweiger etc. The list goes on right through to Mike Myers scene-steal as General Ed Fenech. Everyone involved in this film was at the top of their game, and if it hadn't been for two small films called The Hurt Locker and Avatar, this film would have won a slew of Oscars. In short, Tarantino is back at his very, very best."
"TankGuy","9","2","5","4 March 2016"," Once Upon A Time In Nazi Occupied France...
","Following the exploits of a squad of Jewish-American GIs in Europe at the height of the Second World War as well as the revenge story of a young French Jewish woman, Inglourious Basterds(note the deliberate misspelling)is an extremely impressive effort. A gritty homage to the war movie(to be fair it's much closer to Italy's Macaroni Combat sub-genre), Tarantino's epic has all the correct ingredients to make it succeed.<br/><br/>Firstly, I thought that the episodic structure of the movie as well as it's nonlinear format were both excellent touches. Inglourious has five ""chapters"" each with their own title and the film itself is two stories in one; a behind-enemy-lines adventure and a revenge story. The way these two stories synchronise at the climax was also cleverly done. The movie is also incredibly stylish and some parts have a distinct documentary feel which I also thought was pretty amazing. The segment in which a voice-over(from none other than Samuel L. Jackson)informs the audience of the flammability of nitrate film really took me by surprise, it was refreshing to learn something in a movie otherwise populated by wanton brutality that shouldn't be taken seriously(in no way am I being harsh!). As with much of Tarantino's other work, Inglourious is as much a black comedy as it is, in this case, a war movie(satirical war movie to be precise). The bloody violence is wonderfully tongue-in-cheek and the explosive climax inside the cinema will require complete suspension of disbelief as Tarantino indulges himself with a number of amusingly deliberate anachronisms. The film does drag a little in places, although each sequence is peppered with superb dialogue. It is also interesting to note that around sixty percent of the movie is in German, French and Italian and subtitled accordingly, which is absolutely fine by me.<br/><br/>Inglourious features terrific performances, especially form Brad Pitt and the beautiful Melanie Laurent. Eli Roth also brilliant as the bloodthirsty Sergeant Donowitz-The Bear Jew as was Diane Kruger as starlet Briget Von Hammersmark. Irish-German actor Michael Fassbender was also brilliant and Sylvester Groth was on magnetic form as Nazi propaganda minister Josef Goebbels. Although who could forget Christoph Waltz' magnificent turn as the ruthless Colonel Hans Landa. As usual the soundtrack was amazing, I loved hearing all those familiar scores sampled to great effect. It was a pleasure to hear part of the sublime Morricone piece L'Arena(from Sergio Corbucci's The Mercenary)as well as The Surrender from Sergio Sollima's The Big Gundown. One piece that did strike me as a peculiar sample was a rendition of Dimitri Tiomkin's ""Green Leaves of Summer""(from John Wayne's The Alamo)which played over the opening credits, although I was pleased that this composition featured. The film's action scenes were sparse but awesome nonetheless as the blood flows and the body count rockets. Bodies spasm ferociously as innumerable bullets tear their flesh apart in a vicious shootout(bloodbath would be a better word)in a tavern. The climatic destruction of the cinema and slaughter of the leading Nazis was even crazier, more brutal and spectacularly chaotic!. Most viewers will spot an obvious reference to The Dirty Dozen. The ending was fantastic too and it's one which true Spaghetti Western fans will appreciate.<br/><br/>Tarantino's uber-violent war saga definitely gets a thumbs up from me, in fact it's right up there with the older greats. 9/10"
"mistoppi","10","2","5","22 January 2016"," A brilliant movie, managed to surpass my extremely high expectations
","I feel like all my Tarantino reviews start like this, but I remember seeing the beginning of this film when I was younger. And like every film, my dad showed me that piece. He was mostly showing it to prove how good Tarantino's soundtracks are. And that's the first thing I noticed about Inglourious Basterds. The soundtrack definitely does it job. The film is thrilling on its own, yet the soundtrack made that thrill even better. And I am very glad to hear some David Bowie on Tarantino's work. I'm starting to think Tarantino is my musical soul mate.<br/><br/>Even when you know about history, you're still very excited to find out what happens, and how the assassination plots turn out. Of course history doesn't seem to mean anything to QT, which means the story develops into something I wasn't expecting. In a way, this is way better. We all know how history goes. Any movie is a fantasy, and unless it's a documentary or a biography, why should we give a damn how it really went down? Another thing I like about the story is how the two plots overlap. You sit there watching and wondering if the two sides ever find out about each other. It's an interesting concept. <br/><br/>The characters are interesting. They are people with different personalities, different kind of back stories, yet their paths happen to cross. Well, I can't be so sure about the Nazi characters, they didn't seem that interesting - but was that on purpose, on accident or just me? I guess either of those three would tell a lot. But of course Cristoph Waltz' character Col. Hans Landa is very interesting. You start to feel like he'd be one of the most loyal people, yet he's ready to betray all the Nazi leaders if he gets what he wants out if it. That's kind of a plot twist, yet it's not too surprising. How loyal can anyone really be in the end? But almost every character adds something very interesting to the story. Raine, Shoshanna, Donowitz, Hammersmark, Hicox, Stiglitz... They are all very interesting characters, yet it's only Landa I can write about the most. It's his motives that interest me.<br/><br/>I always hate those American war movies where everyone speaks English but just with accent. I thought Inglourious Basterds would be the same. It was a mystery if it would be so good I could forgive the excessive use of English but no! Of course people speak English in Inglourious Basterds, but only when it makes sense at least to some extent. Inglourious Basterds is mostly in German and French. Thank god for that!<br/><br/>Of course I don't have too much experience with war movies, but I've always kind of assumed the violent to be different from typical action movies. Well, of course in a Tarantino war movie the violence is how he does it best.<br/><br/>It's interesting how this movie portrays propaganda films made in Nazi Germany. Well 'portray' is not the right word, because there aren't a lot of ways to portray propaganda. But knowing what kind of film enthusiastic QT is makes it interesting trying to see if you can get his views on propaganda out of the film. It would be an interesting thing to discover and analyse some more.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is a brilliant movie, and it surpassed my expectations, no matter how high they happened to be. I have to say I've chosen my favourite director well."

The second time i saw it, i relaxed a lot more and just let the film play. I must say, i enjoyed the strands of the story very much and the individual set pieces were very well acted and directed. The use of language was also very effective, French, German and English all play a crucial role in the film at various points. The performances are also a lot of fun and huge credit must go to Christoph Waltz for what is a the best depiction of a Nazi since Ronald Lacey in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. So, another big success for Quentin Tarantino, and a film that plays a lot better if you just forget he is in the directors chair and just enjoy it for all its madcap, gory brilliance."
"symonm","9","2","5","9 November 2011"," Tarantino always polarises opinion but...
","...his films are damn entertaining. At their best (Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, both Kill Bill's) they are without comparison as no one else makes films like he does. Personally I am a huge fan, I love the character development, the fantastically clever use of dialogue, the perfectly balanced music score and the story lines themselves. The lack of accuracy or attention to historical detail doesn't bother me either as I leave his films thoroughly entertained every time. However I do understand that in respect to this film particularly, QT is taking huge liberties with his historical interpretation and that will no doubt bother some people. On this occasion, it doesn't me! So we have a film about a group of Nazi hunting Jew soldiers led by the wonderfully OTT Lt Aldo Raine and a lovely interwoven secondary plot featuring the escape of a Jewish girl and her eventual revenge on the vicious Nazi that murdered her family. It's told with humour, pathos and a devil-may-care approach to the morals of what both sides are doing and it's all the better for that. Perhaps more than any other QT movie, (OK, maybe Jackie Brown's in the same category here) the inspired choice of musical score particularly when Shosanna is getting made up ready for her big final show (David Bowie's Cat People)is beautiful, powerful and moving and a fitting finale to her part of the plot.<br/><br/>Yes it's true to say that the Fuhrer, his key henchmen and a large chunk of the ruling Nazi party probably wouldn't have all attended a small provincial theatre in an occupied land for a propaganda screening during wartime and certainly not with what amounted to just a handful of footsoldiers for protection and it's possibly fair to say that Shosanna's justification as to how she was now running that theatre may have been more deeply researched by the party sent out to scope the place out before the big day. I'm sure there were many other ""oversights"" if one was critiquing a serious factual war film, however...<br/><br/>Great film. Loved it."

","When Inglorious Basterds came into theatres last summer, I studiously avoided it, like all other Tarantino films. But after some pestering, I finally sat down and watched it, and to my great surprise, made it through the entire movie with only a moderate amount of eye-rolling.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that lead characters, aside from Pitt, were not American actors and Tarantino had done the one thing that Hollywood has been avoiding for, well ever; cast foreign stars where they were required, instead of having American stars butcher the foreign languages and the accents.<br/><br/>However I have to agree with the critics concerning the French dialogue, you can very, very clearly tell it was written by someone who does not speak French. As for the German dialogue, I'm not sure but I can only assume the same.<br/><br/>On the flip side, Christopher Waltz's performance made this film. If I had to recommend one reason for seeing Inglorious Basterds, it would be his performance. He is believing, moving and quite frightening.<br/><br/>But one of the things that irks me the most is the title. Even if Tarantino had a reason for spelling Basterds wrong, it's still annoying. The second being the bloodshed. Yes, it is a war film. Yes, that means there will be blood, somewhere. But in true Tarantino style, it's mostly needlessly shown beatings and blood. Although I was pleasantly surprised by some of his more artistic choices vis-a-vis the scenic shots.<br/><br/>Also irritating is the lack of back-story on the characters. Except for a look at Shoshanna's past and a few glimpse's of the others, we have nothing to go on about the characters, which makes for frustrating conclusions come the climax.<br/><br/>It is what it is... a Tarantino film. I don't put much stock in that, and I personally would not recommend this film for more than something to watch before a better movie comes on/out.<br/><br/>Oh, and finally, whoever did the music for this movie should be shot. It's that bad."

","First of all I want to say that Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite movie directors and when I saw the trailer for this movie, my expectations couldn't be higher. Tarantino + killing Nazis = yes. So when I saw this movie I had already made up my mind that I was going to love it. But shortly after seeing this I had to admit that I was disappointed. As with all Tarantino movies there is a lot of dialog, however most of the dialog was in German and French so there was a lot of reading which was annoying since most of it had little to do with the plot. In fact the talking didn't add much to the story or character development and all it accomplished was slow down a story that in my opinion would be more entertaining if it were faster paced. This movie needed less talking and more killing Nazis. Also, this movie seemed to be lacking the silliness found in many Tarantino's earlier work. I'm not saying there is no humor in this movie, but I think it would have been more enjoyable if it had the amount of dark humor found in Kill Bill Vol. 1. I wish that Robert Rodriguez directed this movie. He has a similar style of directing as Tarantino but Rodriguez cuts much of the useless chatter. Despite saying that, Tarantino is still one of my favorite directors, but I hope that he realizes that this movie was not on par with the rest of his work and that he should learn from the mistakes made in this film."

","Alfred Hitchcock had no third act for LIFEBOAT. It happens. It also happens that the unprecedented influx of ""independent filmmakers"" of just a couple of decades ago has given us some of the worst movies of all time. The reason, more often than not, seems to be Ego. Having read glowing review after glowing review, these Vainglorious Bastards have let it all go to their head(s). Has Kevin Smith lived up to the promise of CLERKS, or Robert Rodriguez the brilliance of EL MARIACHI? Tarantino's ""breakthrough"" moment (RESERVOIR DOGS) was much (much) less convincing than either CLERKS or EL MARIACHI, but his follow-up, the vastly overrated PULP FICTION, garnered him a fawning following. Believing he could do no wrong, he proceeded to crank out one borderline unwatchable movie after another. Which brings us to INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS. Forget the fact that it's an alternate reality version of History: what makes it one for the might-have-been-great-ones is Ego. Tarantino, convinced of his own Gifts, gives us totally forgettable dialogue- and at Great Length; over and over. Brad Pitt (as the ""Apache"" taking scalps) does the goofiest Goober accent this side of Alan Alda in THE MOONSHINE WAR- with a straight face, too, as if he were likewise convinced of his Gifts. His dog soldiers (or ""ZOG soldiers,"" as our home-grown Arryan brothers might call them) are nigh indistinguishable from one another. As are the two females: I literally lost track of who was who, three and a half hours into this mess. It took me two tries to get through this one, but I did so knowing that I'll never have to slog through another Tarantino movie as long as I live."

Still I could not see Brat Pitt getting himself in something worthless, so...<br/><br/>Well, Brat Pitt did not work at all for me! But I can see, although I'm not alone in this, that the majority enjoyed him. Pulp fiction, and Reservoir dog, I have not seen and don't think I have any desire to do so, perhaps even more after watching IB. By now I probably gave the impression that I did not have a good time watching IB. In the contrary I did have a great time because there were fantastic moments, fantastic acting and good cinema. But I had to twist my values a little bit, and reach for my sense of humour, usually pretty free, to bypass certain scenes that were pretty ugly. Well this is 2009, nudity, gore and language are nothing anymore to be offended with. I probably should also add that there are no more taboo topics...everything is ""art"" these day. And nobody forces anyone to be present, no, you're paying for the privilege! For my money and taste and give an idea where I stand in cinema, I enjoyed ""The Life of Others"" immensely more<br/><br/>(M.A.Y.B.E.S.P.O.I.L.E.R) I'm a little bit of a sour grape with the beginning, and would have like ""my"" French man to be a little more heroic, but in this case there was no surrealism so he did exactly what I most probably would have done myself (and run to the nearest confessional box!)<br/><br/>Whilst in spoiler mode, toward the end I thought the behaviour of our main character, was actually quite out of character when he jumped on the German actress and strangled her. No comments I read seemed to pick on this? (E.N.D.)! <br/><br/>But as some said this movie should be seen, although perhaps these days when everything is tolerated by and large; like on the packet of cigarettes, a word of warning would not go astray - such as ""might make you throw up"", ""if you're not already mad you may suffer terrible nightmare"" ""if smiling or belly laughing is not one of your hobby, don't think about it"", ""if you like the truth, nothing but the truth we forbid you to purchase a ticket"".<br/><br/>One comment, although very well written, puzzled me a little when it referred at a may be intended pun; stating that in French the word cow could have a double meaning. For the life of me I could not find any basis for this. I spent nearly my first 30 years in France, then searched various dictionary and could not see any ""vaginal"" meaning for the word cow. Well there's always something to learn!<br/><br/>Regardless I don't think you will die if you indulge and have a go at ""Inglorious Bastered""."

The average reviewer is now a teenage boy with painfully little knowledge of cinema beyond ten years, so this film will find itself a loving audience.<br/><br/>But the real story was stunning, heartbreaking and tragic enough, there was more than enough bravery and heroism during WW2 to make a movie that at least had some basis in truth, this mythical garbage was just infuriating, and amateurish storytelling, yes, yes, the production values, acting and star power was great. but the film was lacking in the most profound way imaginable.

"LoneWolfAndCub","10","4","14","21 August 2009"," Bold, brilliant, original, tense, funny, violent, intriguing, weird...QT is back on form in this truly epic twist on WWII
","Being my most anticipated movie of this year, I was scared while watching the previews, because I was worried that this might turn out really bad. I don't what came across, maybe I just thought Tarantino did not have it in him anymore to make another Pulp Fiction. Well, he proved me wrong in the opening credits, which opens with a glorious Ennio Morricone Spaghetti Western theme over a Kill Bill style credits sequence. I just knew he had not disappointed, and after the intense first ten minutes, which I must say are truly stunning, I was bought, this is Tarantino's best movie since Pulp Fiction. It has everything that makes a movie perfect: an eccentric cast where no one actor can be faulted, an amazing soundtrack, stylistic camera-work, an intricate and twisting plot and an outrageous ending.<br/><br/>Divided up into five chapters (think Kill Bill style) the film follows many characters whose paths eventually cross (Pulp Fiction style). I do not think it would be fair to go into detail, because in a film like this it is best to let the story gracefully unfold as it does. For the people who know nothing, the Basterds, led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) are sent to spread fear throughout Germany in WWII by brutally killing and scalping Nazi soldiers. Soon the soldiers have a much bigger mission, involving a cinema showing a Nazi propaganda film with all the higher powers attending, including Hitler. However, the Basterds aren't the only people with plans to wreck vengeance on the Nazis.<br/><br/>This fairly simple storyline is told over 152 minutes and through a huge array of characters. Melanie Laurent, Christoph Waltz, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, Daniel Bruhl, Omar Doom, Mike Myers and Julie Dreyfuss are among the huge cast, and all give flawless performances. Yes, Eli Roth included, everyone seems to annoyed at this, but his part is small and he does a great job with it. Brad Pitt is, as usual, excellent in a much different role, with Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger playing excellent femme fatales. However, as I'm sure you have already heard, Christoph Waltz is the standout here in a role he will never be forgotten. He plays Lt. Hans Landa AKA the ""Jew Hunter."" He is evil, sadistic and utterly insane. His facial expressions, the way he talks, moves, breathes, it really is one of the best acting parts I have seen in awhile. It is a very theatrical performance and he deserves every credit he is, and surely will, receive.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, well, it's typically Tarantino in its over-the-top, random, disturbing and hilarious way. It's a tribute, obviously, to many of Quentin's favourite films and music, most clearly his love of Spaghetti Westerns (Kill Bill Vol. 2 anyone). The dialogue, well, not much needs to be said apart from two big thumbs up! It's extraordinarily good (much better than Death Proof's tolerable, but not great dialogue). Inglorious Basterds is mainly dialogue, with about 65% being in German or French with subtitles, however, this is a great thing due to the nature of the script. It's so intricate, I wanted to hear what everyone had to say, furthermore, it was so very funny I just wanted it to never end. That being said, the action was a welcome pay off to the intense exchange of words between the characters. The violence is filmed with such beauty, nonetheless it is harsh, graphic, brutal and in your face.<br/><br/>To think it could not possibly get better, the soundtrack is one of the best yet. Full of some amazing Morricone themes, David Bowie's ""Putting Out the Fire"" and even some of the cool Kill Bill themes, it suits the tone of the film perfectly and matches their respective scenes perfectly. To be honest, did you expect a bad movie? Even if Quentin Tarantino doesn't make a perfect film (Death Proof, Jackie Brown), they are still bloody amazing. This however, is perfect in every way and I left disappointed that it had to end. Rarely have I ever wanted a film to just continue forever as this one did. Filmed with such enthusiasm by Tarantino, with some of his trademark camera-work and techniques (onscreen graphics, character biographies, narration) Inglorious Basterds sweeps you into the Tarantino's WWII and rest assured, you shall not be disappointed.<br/><br/>5/5"

Every scene is way too long, not because of its time length, but because the dialogue is blah and the characters are grossly underdeveloped (except the Nazi Col. Jew Hunter).<br/><br/>The fighting and shooting scenes are sloppy: defying logic and lacking grace. I wish John Woo were doing those sequences. Along that thought, I wish Lubitsch were doing the dialogue (""To Be or Not To Be"" comes to mind), and Kubrick did the whole movie (""Dr. Strangelove"" comes to mind)!<br/><br/>Maybe all this is a big in-joke to you; to me, it's a bad movie I wish I didn't get.

"ryanaustinf","9","3","10","26 December 2009"," Tarantino Hits It Out of the Park Once Again
","Mr. Tarantino is one of THE best directors in Hollywood. He is one of the best writers and the dialogue in his movies is just amazing. This one is no exception and is probably one of his best. Let's jump right in to Inglourious Basterds (that's how it's spelled so don't go telling me to say it like ""Inglorious Bastards"" that's not how he spells it).<br/><br/>Our main character is Lieutenant Aldo Raine played by Brad Pitt. He sports an accent in this movie that if it doesn't make you laugh at least once, consult your doctor immediately. His accent pops in at the most inappropriate times. He's a likable character and is also kind of a badass. He just hates Nazis. He goes by the take no prisoners method. If you're a Nazi and run across him, it's either they kill you with a baseball bat or they let you live but carve a swastika on your forehead. Aldo is one awesome guy and just proves that Quentin can write the best characters possible.<br/><br/>Our main villain is the Nazis but particularly Colonel Hans Landa, played terrifyingly by Cristoph Waltz. This guy is a smooth-talking, calm, collected, and smart man. He acts in such a way that you'd expect little from him but they don't call him ""The Jew Hunter"" for nothing. This guy is one of the most terrifying villains in film history. In one scene he eats strudel in a restaurant while Tarantino's lively dialogue is happening and you can't help but think, ""What is this guy up to? Yeah he's eating strudel, but what is he up to?"" He is definitely one guy you won't want to mess with.<br/><br/>Our supporting characters are awesome. Let's start with the ladies. There are two main ladies in this movie, Bridget von Hammersmark played by Diane Kruger, and one of my favorite Tarantino characters, Shosanna Dreyfus, played by Melanie Laurent. <br/><br/>Why do I like Shosanna so much, well, she reminds me of The Bride from Kill Bill, bent on revenge, and that worked well for Kill Bill and it works here. In the beginning of the movie, Hans Landa murders Shosanna's entire family but she escapes and now, she seeks revenge on the Nazis. Since a movie premiere of a film showcasing the victory of the Nazis is taking place at her theatre, she takes this as a prime opportunity for vengeance. She's definitely someone you won't want to mess with either. <br/><br/>As for Bridget, she doesn't have much screen time but for the time she's on screen, she plays her role good enough. She doesn't stand out so much but she does her job.<br/><br/>The male supporting cast consists of Donny Donowitz AKA The Bear Jew played by Eli Roth. This guy is awesome, why? Two words, Baseball Bat. He beats people up with a baseball bat. This is shown once in the whole movie but that scene was one of my favorites, no not because of the violence but because of Tarantino's direction and writing of that scene. Aldo asks a German Soldier where the other Nazis are but he respectfully refuses. Then he asks Donny to kill him. I don't want to spoil the rest of this beautiful scene for you. Just watch it, unless you're pussified towards strong violence, that is. <br/><br/>Another male cast member is Hugo Stiglitz played by Til Schweiger. This guy has limited screen time but unlike Ms. Von Hammersmark, this guy actually kicks major ass during his time on screen. Nuff said.<br/><br/>There are a few more male cast members and Mike Myers has a cameo but they are so trivial that I won't go over them but they're still some awesome characters.<br/><br/>The story is great, I pretty much explained the first part above but what makes it so great is Tarantino's unique styles in writing. He doesn't spoon feed you with the story. There are two separate stories: One involves Aldo Raine and the Basterds, trying to finish off the Nazis' Third Reich at the movie premiere, and the other involves Shosanna getting her revenge using the movie premiere. At the end these two stories intertwine creating a marvelous finish that I won't spoil for you. And since Hans Landa and Aldo Rained barely cross paths until near the end, their encounters are some of my favorite parts.<br/><br/>The acting here is a slight problem. Brad Pitt is fun to watch but his acting is kind of meh... here. Eli Roth is also kind of meh... Cristoph Waltz is easily the best actor in here and I hope he wins an Oscar. His portrayal of Hans Landa is damn near perfect. Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger also do great jobs. <br/><br/>The direction of this movie, need I to say it, damn near perfect. Quentin Tarantino is the master of writing dialogue but his direction makes it all the better. His music choice, though eclectic, is still really good and is arguably one of the best soundtracks of the year.<br/><br/>The Visuals of the movie, how it depicts World War II, is well, pretty good. There are very few anachronisms and you really believe you're there, especially the first scene.<br/><br/>To summarize, this is a great movie but not for conventional audiences and more of an intellectual audience as there is a lot of dialogue that could bore you if you're expecting a bloodbath of action. I recommend this movie if you're willing to sacrifice 2 hours and 33 minutes of your life. Overall, I give Inglourious Basterds, 90% awesome"
"Torsti2003","10","3","10","19 December 2009"," thank you QT
","I don't know where to start.. I watched this at home, alone, with few beers to help. Not that this movie needs any help. The starting sequence only, where this sadistic jew hunter continues his extremely polite manner of speech, audience surely knows something is wrong but just not what. After some very prolonged, nuaced dialogue I was ready to scream 'Oh my God, get on with it already!'. In a positive way of course. The tension is unbearable, and special thanks must be said to Christoph Waltz, actor I have never heard of before but whose performance is absolutely magnificent.<br/><br/>The violence is there of course, as this is QT movie, but most of the time we spend waiting for it to happen, for example, when the opposition members unfortunately end up sitting in same bar and table with way too many Nazis in a bar where there was not supposed to be any. Discussion goes on and on, German major interrogating couple of our protagonists in most on-surface-polite manner, until the inevitable, or unfortunate error happens and all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>Someone already mentioned the great camera-work.. yes! I never consciously realized there actually must have been camera somewhere, nor started to think about specific angles, cutting or anything like that, which happens to me often when watching movies, it is all done in very beautifully fluent way.<br/><br/>The beautiful is there of course. Especially must be noted Mélanie Laurent in theatre, while the most unexpected but perfectly fitting Bowie song plays.. this is the showdown, underlined.<br/><br/>The humour is there of course :) Especially I could not stop laughing in the last minutes of the movie, where Tarantino decided, not caring the least of historical facts (what 'facts'? say what?) to execute just a few Nazis, not just burning them, but also shooting same time with machine gun and blowing them up with explosives.<br/><br/>Also, I think its important to mention that here now are some clichés of the evil Nazis broken for good. No more glass-wearing evil interrogators from the 70s or so, now we have a person fully fluent in English, french and Italian, eloquent, well-mannered, and at the same time totally ruthless. We see other intelligent, charming Nazis that turn out just as brutal. We see German soldiers, who are just having a drink you can't but symphatize, ending in a shootout that leaves barely no one alive. And most important, the Nazis are not anymore the force to be feared, here they are in fear of some very aggressive, native American leaded force. I find this all very refreshing.<br/><br/>I could go on and on.. but need to end this haphazard homage at some point. Be it here. I will watch this again, and recommend to everyone I meet."

","Most Holocaust movies, no matter how gory, are exercises in wish fulfilment. Today they've morphed into Jewish revenge fantasies (""Munich"", ""Defiance"", ""Zohan"", ""Debt"" etc), exploitation flicks dressed up in big budget gloss. Reflecting the now superpower state of Israel, these films typically feature Jewish action heroes dishing out punishment to cowering terrorists/Nazis and then feeling ""kind of bad about it"". <br/><br/>Quintin Tarantino's ""Inglorious Basterds"" is divided into 5 chapters. The first is a wordy rip off of Leone's ""Once Upon A Time In The West"", the audience watching as Shosanna, a pretty Jewish girl, has her family massacred by a Nazi officer known as the ""Jew Hunter"". Shosanna escapes and we cut to Chapter 2. Here we're introduced to the ""Basterds"" (""Dirty Dozen"", Casterellari's ""Bastards"" etc), a group of Nazi hunters comprised almost entirely of Jews. Significantly, the Basterds use Apache hit-and-run tactics and delight in scalping their enemies; the film is a ""victim's fantasy"" on a large scale, not only Jews fighting back, but African slaves (characters discuss the racial implications of ""King Kong"") and American Indians as well.<br/><br/>The next 3 chapters of the film involve Shosanna inheriting a cinema which is later used to screen a propaganda film called ""Stolz der Nation"", a Nazi version of ""Private Ryan"" in which German sniper Frederick Zoller fights off 300 Allied soldiers (an allusion to the Spartans). As Hitler is attending the film's premiere, both the Basterds and Shosanna plot his assassination (which they dub ""Operation Kino"", a nod to the Bolshevik propaganda movement). Significantly, the Basterds fail completely in their plot to kill Hitler. It is a flaming cinema screen and a stack of explosive film cans which kills him. In other words, cinema literally kills Hitler.<br/><br/>But the death of Hitler has no historical effect. It is 1944, the war's end. What the film allows, therefore, is simply a chance for Jews to kill Hitler days before Hitler kills himself. Like all of Tarantino's film, everything hinges on revenge. What's different, though, is that in this case the ""revenge"" plays out as an acknowledged fantasy rather than ideologically tainted history masquerading as ""realism"".<br/><br/>""Basterds"" ends with three formally and narratively connected moments of ""catharsis"". In the first, Zoller mowing down hordes of Allies is inter-cut with the cackling faces of German audiences. In the second, a Basterd named Donny repeats the motion, violently mowing down helpless Germans. Significantly, the actor playing Donny is the director of the film Zoller is trapped in and Donny is given no audience reaction shot. We, instead, are positioned as the audience, and made to giggle at the spectacle of Hitler's body perforated by bullets. It's an implicative tactic used often by Verhoeven: we are the Nazis, cheering the murder of people for what they represent rather than who they are. <br/><br/>Later, during the film's third ""catharsis"", Tarantino literally puts us in the perspective of a Nazi being marked by a swastika, the director marking his audience for their sins. It is not only that the Basterds vengeful massacre is formally identical to that of the Nazis, but that both sequences are manifestations of ideology. Brad Pitt, the hillbilly leader of the Basterds, even sports a Hitler styled moustache and hair cut. The difference is, the Basterds' vengeance is authorised by the American state and ""sanctioned"" by the iconography of American movies and pop culture. In this respect, ""Basterds"" is one step beyond Tarantino's other movies, his old fan-boys turned into Nazi buffoons whilst his ""new audience"" is granted the privilege of ironic, self critique.<br/><br/>""This is a uniform you can't take off,"" Pitt growls as he carves a swastika into the forehead of a German. The scene embodies the ideology of the Allies in its very arbitrariness: the Nazis aren't Nazis because they're evil, they're evil because they're Nazis. The victors write history and history scars the Other as one-dimensional totems of evil. Moreso, the German is denied a chance to take off his uniform, to repent, and instead becomes the scapegoat for the entirety of Western evil. <br/><br/>By making Pitt an improbably hillbilly anti-racist vigilante, Tarantino takes the endemic racism of the American South and displaces it onto the figure of a Nazi with whom he has everything in common but the uniform. Message? Jew Hunter and Nazi Hunter are one and the same, both bent on genocidal quests. Sacriledge? It's important to note that the Allies were indifferent to the fate of European Jews during WW2, Europe/America was largely antisemitic, WW2 was not fought for ""just"" or ""altruistic"" reasons (but for old fashioned Imperialism), and all of Christian civilisation is itself based on both the hatred of Jews (the bedrock figure of Judas in the Bible is itself a calculated slur against Judaism) and the racial superiority of the white man over the black.<br/><br/>But the point is, this hypocrisy survives precisely because power is adept at turning history's Hitlers into alphas and omegas of racist imperial ambition. It fetishizes Hitlers and swastikas so as to disguise how widely shared the ideologies they represent are in the West. When we make the symbol evil instead of the ideology, we only end up vindicating those who share the ideology, the racism, and the imperial ambition. Europe/America might have conquered the world to acquire living space for the white race, you see, but at least they weren't Nazis.<br/><br/>Late in the film Shoshanna and a Nazi officer battle over a projection booth. The scene portrays two propaganda films, two bodies and two identical ideologies at war with one another, both vying for the same cinematic space. The message is not only that ""historical truth"" becomes dependent on whoever survives the battle for the booth, but that, maybe, the two competing reels aren't that much different anyway.<br/><br/>8/10 - Interesting, though its form totally undermines its content."

","He may not be dishing out one blockbuster after another, releasing one off-beat movie inside one decade (in which Cinema and tastes transition from one generation to the next)... But when he DOES display his art, it is pure, unbridled joy. That is what it needs to be cherished for. No more no less. Such is the tale of Inglourious Basterds. It was to me his best work after Pulp Fiction. And to the the connoisseur of his works, this movie too grows on you with each successive viewing. Like Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds, deep down, really has no plot. And like the former, the plot just doesn't matter, as the thrill in the movie lies in the dialogues and chemistry between the actors during (seemingly) mundane bits of smalltalk. However, unlike Pulp Fiction, this movie delivers a first. That of making the subjects of the Holocaust, towards which Western Cinema and more or less all forms of media have had a biased point of view, into lovable characters! As is Chris Waltz in the movie. He is simply outstanding! And besides the downgraded profile of Adolf Hitler, the other German characters emerge not only strong but equally charming. And whereas some comfort in French and/or German may help appreciate the fine print, the brilliance in the movie lies in how little the choice of language matters to the all-English viewer! Whether it's the opening sequence at the farmer's house in French countryside, or the romantic attempts of Private Frederick Zoller towards Melanie Laurent, or that of Capt. Hellstorm at the underground tavern with the undercover 'Basterds'... the conversations are truly mesmerizing! In all, its a classy movie. It has attention to subtleties of culture, design, World War II, emotions... aspects that are hallmarks of Tarantino movies, and I would fathom, styles that mirror the Director's own personality more than any other.

","Its pulp fiction, but a different storyline and the subject of war, once again tarintino pulls it off again, suspense, surprises and loads of action, although comedy is not really the genre of the movie, there were some scenes that had me laughing. brad pitt as always did a superb job at his role. the violence was present but on the ""hackable"" side, at a certain degree it does reflect the war in the Nazi era, a German occupied France who tries to eliminate an ""inferior"" group. once again tarintino jumbled the story around again but in a genius manner. its a movie you would want to watch again and again without taking it too seriously"

Excellently made.Cast awesome Bradd Pitt is perfect fit so is Chritopher Waltz.Good Show of politics and good movie on Sir Adolf Hitler.

Excellent Drama .The Best Scene in the movie: A ""Basterd"" comes with baseball banging and the way he bashes the brain out... even bullet can't ... This Scene in particular is worth the watch several hundred times. It well shot well developed, Just perfect.The theatre scene is excellently developed. The typical tarantinos style of dividing movie in Chapters is excellent.IN short this is 2hr 30 min long movie but when movie ends u feel like u were ther for only 2min 30 sec .<br/><br/>A MUST WATCH :-)"

","Quentin Tarantino in my opinion is the Alfred Joseph Hitchcock of the 21 century,seen all of his movies ...breath of fresh air for cinematography in my opinion,this is his MonaLisa..10 out of 10 from me.The influence of African American culture is apparent in much of Tarantino's work. His references to blaxploitation films and soul music are complimentary tributes.Tarantino worked in a video rental store prior to becoming a filmmaker, paid close attention to the types of films people liked to rent, and has cited that experience as inspiration for his directorial career. Tarantino : ""When people ask me if I went to film school I tell them, 'no, I went to films.'"""

","every once in a while, one sees a work of art being portrayed on the cinema screen - and it is so intense, that one does not realize how much time has passed absorbing it... This is exactly what happened to the 4 of us who went to see the Inglorious basterds tonight. It was a 10pm show & we realized it was 1pm after we came out!!<br/><br/>The Inglorious Basterds is not a typical Quentin movie..in fact its a Bollywood style movie that beats Bollywood movies black & blue by simply concentrating on one simple thing: attention to detail ....<br/><br/>Its a simple screenplay that Quentin would have ripped from any Bollywood movie - action, love, war, thrill & loads of comedy - all of that combined! But the mastery of the director lies in ignoring the story completely!! Yes, truly that is what happens - I did not care whether the story would go one way or the other! What I craved for with each longing moment was the dialogues & depth of scenes... The complete narration is held together by 7-10 scenes, but each of this scene is brilliantly composed - each speck of dust & each monosyllable, each movement by the actor / actress contributes to the moment in the scene... If you miss the smallest of gestures, you are bound to be left confused.<br/><br/>Now, I've heard somewhere that it took Quentin 12 years to write the complete screenplay. I can only imagine how he must have perfected each of these scenes by playing them over again & again in his mind - polishing each moment - each nanosecond of the movie. I was left not only breathless with wonder, but also hoping that the movie would never end- even after 3 hours of playing time!<br/><br/>Coming to the director's attention to detail - each word spoken by the actor is made to work hard along with physical movements, music & photography in order to contribute fully to the meaning. The language provides a loud charactersketch for each actor, while long climaxes (some even 2 mins long) are held together by expert movements, ever so subtle to catch the corner of one's eye, but not appear in the conscious view of the scene. All of this - together - makes the movie an unforgettable experience.<br/><br/>Look out for Col. Hans Landa (played by Christopher Waltz) - the scripting of the character & his portrayal by Waltz are a true work of art!<br/><br/>And yes, we laughed, we shuddered, we waited for the climaxes, we cheered the action - in short we did it all!!! Final word, go see it for yourself - though some of you would dismiss it as stupid... & yes - BEWARE - there isn't any story!!"
"Idactyl","5","3","10","8 October 2009"," Pitt took acting lessons from Jolie?
","I propose a director cut. This time that doesn't mean a 'more minutes movie', but a version were all the scenes with Brad Pitt are cut out. Brad Pitt is not able to create the caricature Tarantino had in mind. I am constantly aware of Pitt as an actor, and since it is not a play of Brecht we are watching, I would say that he totally failed to become part of the movie as a whole. (in case Tarantino had in mind, to cash in on Pitt makes himself ridiculous lovers - he did a great job...) Cinematography is perfect, especially the lighting. Acting of the actors except for 'the inglorious bastards team (except for Fassbender) is very acceptable - euphemistically speaking. Music was typical Tarantino, this time that meant a big Minus for the whole movie, so let's leave it also out in the directors cut.<br/><br/>Story... Well, it's in a movie not only about the story... I am not a very moral person, so I would say: ""Tarentino, give us a full Tarantino version of Stolz der Nation, and the good old Tarantino feeling will be back again""."
"bbatt1","9","3","10","23 September 2009"," can't see what people hate about it
","I absolutely loved this movie. I think it was one of Tarantino's best. I honestly am very surprised that there are so many comments stating this is a bad movie and Tarantino trash. I understand not everyone loves QT but how can you not appreciate the writing and acting in this film? (I got the feeling that some of these comments are not fond of scenes that contain lengthy dialog. Its sad they believe this film is crap all due to their own short attention span.) Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender steal the show. I am rooting for Christoph Waltz to get an Oscar for his performance, no one deserves it more than him. I loved his portrayal of the menacing yet cordial Hans Landa, it was truly spot on. I remember Michael Fassbender as Stelios in 300 and I was excited to see him get a chance at QT dialog. The bar scene was my favorite part of this film simply because the superb delivery of Lt Hicox's fake laugh. I was having a mild panic attack due to the suspense of that scene (Saving Private Ryan kinda suspense) yet it was hilarious at the same time...never felt that before, thanks QT, Mr. Fassbender and Mr Diehl as Major Hellstrom for making a great scene even greater. I have to admit I was teeny tiny bit disappointed with Brad Pitt as I was looking forward to seeing the same dedication to his character as the one he gave in Snatch but it didn't take anything away from the film. He still gave an outstandingly funny and convincing performance and Im not sure anyone else could've fit the part of Aldo Raines. Mike Myers seemed a little out of place but it was cool to see him in a QT flick, totally unexpected but thats Tarantino for ya and thats the kinda stuff his fans love. Some people found this film too brutal. Some comments even seem to sympathize with the German Nazi's who met their fate in a few scenes and seem upset with QT for making their death a nasty one. Thats the beauty of this film though. We are supposed to feel a little bit bad for the brave German officer who agrees to meet his end by ""The Bear Jew"" rather than give up the location of his other men. It doesn't make the guy a saint, he still killed for a corrupt and evil army. You can look at the Inglourious Basterds the same way. The movie is a masterpiece of our time. I will watch it again and again the same way I can with his other films."
"jason-210","9","3","10","20 September 2009"," Violent World War II comedy fantasy
","Looking through many of the reviews here, it seems that people either love or hate this film. There seems to be an even split.<br/><br/>The film has some disturbing violent scenes, and it seems to be this that many object to. But don't we see violence in a lot of other films and think it's OK? We are fed this type of violence every day, in computer games, TV series and routine action adventure films such as the Die Hard films, and Arnold Schwarznigger films and so on. It's not often we hear people calling for those films to be banned. The violence in those films is acceptable to most audiences. Inglorious Bastards also has violence, but many think it's unacceptable. Why is one type of violence acceptable, and the other not? The same thing is happening in both films...people are dying violent deaths.<br/><br/>I think many react negatively to Tarrantino violence partly because of its graphic portrayal, but mainly because the way Tarrantino involves the audience with the dying or about-to-die characters. We don't want them to die, we think it's wrong, even if they are the supposedly bad guys, they somehow don't deserve it. And yet they die, and we see how they die. Whereas in your typical Hollywood action film the bad guys are demonized and stereotyped, and we want them dead. Personally, I think watching Tarrantino's kind of violence is healthier than watching the Hollywood action type of violence, because this makes you think, and shudder. It's not mindless.<br/><br/>Despite its dark, heavy moments, Inglorious Basterds is, above all, a comedy with some really funny characters a great dialogue. There are some extremely funny scenes in this film. Humour is often funniest when it deals with taboo subjects, and a comedy about Nazis, the jews and violence, if not taboo, is certainly not politically correct.<br/><br/>I think it's important not to be politically correct with good film making. After all, Nazi propaganda movies were politically correct..."
"flyingmongoose","8","3","10","15 September 2009"," One of the Most Entertaining War Films for Decades
","With the standard of Tarantino's films declining to surprisingly low depths ever since the release of his second film Pulp Fiction, many have debated as to whether or not Tarantino really was the immensely talented director we had been lead to believe? With his latest film, however, Tarantino seems to have redeemed himself with this new war epic.<br/><br/>Based around a fictional event in which a group of American soldiers and a vengeful young Jewish woman in Nazi occupied France plan to blow up/burn down and cinema during a premier, with many of the German high command, Hitler included, in attendance, Tarantino is able to bringing into play his usual directorial traits: his extensive, yet entertaining, conversation scenes; tough, though likable heroes; violent imagery; pre-recorded music scores and discreet film references - not to mention his obvious love of cinema, made especially clear through the events and technicalities of the film's cinema based plot.<br/><br/>Despite these familiarities, this is still new ground for Tarantino, mainly because this is the first of his films that doesn't take place during the in contemporary America (bar several key scenes in Kill Bill). Gone are the distinct fashion traits or the familiar pseudo brands that scatter his previous films that we would normally expect. Instead, he is stuck in 1940s Europe and is perhaps closer at times to directing a period drama rather than a ""Tarantino film"". However, he still manages to get his own distinctive edge on his WWII interpretation - strudel arguably becoming the new ""Big Kahuna Burger"" - and even finds room to fit David Bowie onto the soundtrack score.<br/><br/>Perhaps the thing which we can be most grateful for is Tarantino's attempt at redefining the genre. With most recent war films, made within the past thirty years, attempting to bring out the raw, grittiness of war and the obvious, yet constantly used, ""war is hell"" messages it is a relief to finally to have a war film that is made purely to entertain, à la Where Eagles Dare, Kelly's Heroes and The Eagle has Landed. The story itself is too absurd to be taken seriously yet gripping enough to be intrigued by, along with the suspense and tension constantly building to levels that would have impressed the likes of Alfred Hitchcock - pretty impressive given the audience is in on the plan and the inevitable conclusion, all they don't know is how the scenes are going to play.<br/><br/>Far from perfection however, the film does suffer from a few flaws, namely the Basterds. Whilst the characters in the remaining episodes seem to have their work cut out, the Basterds side of the story comes across as a forgotten and undeveloped. Their role as American soldiers dropped into France to randomly kill and terrorise Nazi's lacks the depth and plausibility to make their characters or stories interesting enough. Likewise, the characters themselves are incredibly bland to the point that even Brad Pitt struggles to bring something worthwhile out of his character, not to mention the bizarre miscasting of Eli Roth.<br/><br/>Despite the flawed Basterds, Tarantino has nonetheless managed to assemble a selection of memorable well cast characters. Much praise has been given to Christopher Waltz (and rightly so) for his performance as the villainous ""Jew Hunter"" Hans Landa, however much credit also ought to be given to Daniel Brühl as the young, innocent-looking Nazi war-hero Private Fredrick Zoller, trying to start relationship with the Jew-in-hiding, cinema owner Shosanna Dreyfus (brilliantly played by Melanie Laurent). Their juxtaposing relationship alone keeps the film alight with tension. Michael Fassbender also makes a hugely memorable performance as the charismatic British spy and film historian Lt. Archie Hicox along with Mike Myers' amusing cameo.<br/><br/>Whilst not quite on the same level as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, Inglourious Basterds is certainly a huge step up from Kill Bill and Death Proof, proving that Tarantino still has much to offer us."
"pivic","8","3","10","4 September 2009"," Long, very well-written, well-directed feminist film
","This film left me a bit dumbfounded, as I'd forgotten Tarantino's staunch penchant for writing female roles in the feminist sense, i.e. portraying women as they are. Stanley Kubrick notoriously once answered a question of what he likes when making films by saying he knew what he didn't like, and to me, that is the essential of Tarantino's scripting of female roles. So, all in all, a feminist script. Good. But what about the film in other aspects? While the Kill Bill series served as a complete homage to Asian cinema, especially the pulp parts, this film waves hi to the western spaghetti films while staying true to his dialogue-cum-monologues. In every scene, Tarantino seemingly has decided that one or two character steals the scene with some quite outlandish acting. While Christoph Waltz's acting is completely wonderful, the direction is tight and led me through a simple and great film, where two parallel stories start the film: one French girl is separated from her family because of the Nazis and small American group of soldiers, commanded by Brad Pitt's character, is led into Germany to ""kill Nazis"". Every scene is very non-apologetic. No big Hollywood scores are played as people are killed and most of the killing is displayed as-is. Come to think of it, most of everything in this film is displayed as-is, i.e. not sugar-coated. It's a funny, tragic and hugely entertaining story of revenge - an obvious line through most films by Tarantino - and is well worth your time."

I don't need to watch somebody taking somebody else's scalp in long and detailed shot. This is not SAW, neither it is Eli Roth's rubbish Hostel movies.<br/><br/>Maybe Quentin wanted to please Roth but it was really unnecessary. By the way Eli Roth is not only very bad director but he sucks as actor as well.

"austind69","9","3","10","31 August 2009"," Great Cinema, and a classic movie...but...
","I am a huge Tarentino fan. That being said, I cannot give this movie a 10/10 as I was hoping. I would of is there had been that ""Crazy 88's"" scene from Kill Bill, or a Pulp Fiction ""Gimp Scene"", but alas there wasn't. The action is great when it happens, and the acting it top notch. However, in the interim, I only saw bits and pieces of the Tarentino I have been a loyal fan of for the better part of 2 decades now. From the opening scene of this movie, there is a certain intensity, and that is kept by the scene stealing Christoph Waltz, who IMO stole the show, and the rest of the cast has a strong showing with witty and often times unforeseeable moments of hilarity. Still though, conflicted at times this movies drifts into plot points that are hard to follow, and you're not quite sure what direction the movie is going. A second viewing will hopefully clear some of these up. The best point of this movie are the acting and grainy om-age' to cinema. I feel as though Tarentino really captured the feel of WWII Nazi occupied France. The pacing is good, and in Tarentino is still the king of diologue only to pull the ""pin"" on the hand grenade when you least expect it, derailing th entire scene...and if you haven't been paying attention, leaving you in shock as to what just happened. I will say though, if you are expecting an action thrill ride (Which is what I was expecting based on the previews), you will be disappointed. I must score this a 9 out of 10 based on the acting, the intensity and at times ""awkwardness"" of anxiety Tarentino is a master of creating. Pitt was awesome by the way...and needs an honorable mention. This movie is a must see and only loses a point because it was missing that pinch of ""Oregano"" which is that great scene of action I/we were all wishing/waiting for. Yes, this is a Nazi killing movie...so I wanted to see an awesome Nazi action sequence of wading knee deep into Nazi's with a belt fed machine gun...or a scene of someone like Til Schweiger (Stiglitz) go to work on killing some Nazi's...and killing them brutally. There were small cuts of such scenes, but where was the monumental ""House fight"" from Kill Bill between Vivica A. Fox and Uma Thurman equivalent? I am using Kill Bill as a reference because there were so many GREAT cinematic action sequences in that film, and the previews lead us down the path that such action was in this movie, when it's not. In closing, a GREAT movie...just not an action packed flick like the previews lead us to believe. So go into it with that expectation, and you'll be fine."

","A few visually brilliant and superbly acted scenes, interspersed in plot that plods along, do not make a great movie. I'm afraid that Tarantino's narrative style doesn't really hold this film together. I found myself dozing off at several points in the film. On the other hand, Christof Waltz is absolutely brilliant as the charmingly sociopathic SS Col Hanz Landa. He leaves Brad Pitt's corny acting style in the dust. Best Supporting Actor for Waltz next year? <br/><br/>Tarantino could have easily edited out 45 or 50 minutes this film and left them for the deleted scenes section of the DVD. This could have been as good as ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", but that's not saying much. My advice is don't waste your money on seeing this in the theater. Wait for NetFlix, a the ability to fast forward through the boring parts..."

","Inglourious Basterds (IB) is an awesome movie, praise that I seldom lend to movies, especially recent Quentin Tarantino (QT) movies........ The last QT film that was worthy of my praise, was Pulp Fiction, as the characters and dialogue were some of the best ever written, IB is a true return to form by QT. <br/><br/>I went to the movie theatre to watch this movie, dreading the 2.5 hours that lay ahead, as my husband wanted to go and watch IB, and I had been cajoled into attending with him. Within minutes of its start, I was hooked, the Colonel Hans Landa character played by Christopher Waltz was amazing, what a sense of intense buried evil he portrayed beneath the outward cool exterior. The dialogue between him and Monsieur LaPadite was intense, what a menacing portrayal. I hope to see Christopher Waltz in more movies in the future, as usual QT has found an excellent unknown actor that perfectly fits the role.<br/><br/>What a revelation Brad Pitt was in this role, Diane Kruger held her end and the lovely Melanie Laurent was brilliant.<br/><br/>I can not praise this film enough, loved it, loved it, loved it!!!! One of my favourite movies so far this year, in my top 5. I hope that QT can follow up this movie with something of a par, as no-one writes dialogue like QT, if he can, then I for one will be waiting with baited breath for his next movie.<br/><br/>Well done QT, I salute you."
"CharlesHile","9","3","10","30 August 2009"," I think this might just be my masterpiece
","I think a lot of people were waiting for Tarantino's great comeback, which would include all the components that made his earlier features cult movies (I'm talking about Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction of course): good storyline, stylish dialogue, cool characters etc. Although Tarantino has never made a really bad movie, Death Proof is still unforgivable for director, who made above mentioned movies. Tarantino fans can now sigh with relief because with Basterds he prove that his talent is not lost. <br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is a bit similar to Pulp Fiction. Both films are a bit over the top (Basterds over the top parts are more over the top than in Pulp Fiction, but serious parts in IB are more serious than in PF), full of great (but not likable) characters and feature story lines, which collide during the coarse of the movie. <br/><br/>It is difficult to say, what genre of film does Inglourious Basterds belong to, but I would call it a thriller-spaghetti western with humor set during the WWII, but don't expect a war movie. <br/><br/>Tarantino has made a movie, which is very close to masterpiece (yes, IMO even closer than Pulp Fiction). I am saying close because in the middle of the film there is one scene, which is just too long. If ten minutes were cut in the correct places, this could have been a real classic, but it was very entertaining movie nevertheless.<br/><br/>My verdict: 8.5"
"m-reda","9","3","10","30 August 2009"," A Very Entertaining and Compulsive Viewing Experience
","I didn't have any expectations when I went to see this film, but I was impressed how Tarantino took the WW2 story and turned it into his own fictional portrayal of the Nazis in France.<br/><br/>While demonstrating the evil of the Nazis, mainly via the great acting from Christoph Waltz, he introduces a level of dark humour that flows in and out of the film very well. It's like eating a fine meal and finding a new taste in every bite you take....making you want more and more. 2.5 hours goes quickly and you feel stuffed, but very satisfied..<br/><br/>As always with these type of films, you become sceptical with the marketing bandwagon used to promote the film. But, in this case it was justified. Brad Pitt does a great job of being the gung ho American leader of a group of professionals sent into France to kill Nazis in Tarantino's realistic style. Melanie laurent plays the lady who earlier escapes a close encounter with the Nazis who kill her whole family. The story used show how she gets her revenge is an original idea for me and just adds to the magic of the film.<br/><br/>I saw this film in Sweden and the film is a mixture of French, German and English. Even though my Swedish is not perfect, I managed to follow the Swedish subtitles for the non-English conversations and it had no affect on my enjoyment of the film. In fact at the start of the film, the languages used are part of the film, which is cleverly used by Christoph Waltz as the Nazi general.<br/><br/>So, go and see this film. Even if you're not a Tarantino film, you will enjoy the story, but you may have to cover your eyes for some scenes if you don't like that kind of thing. But, really, those scenes compliment the film and are much less than in the likes of Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction. In fact in felt like the films I grew up with where the acting and the storyline made the film, not the special effects. The filming style reminded me of the older generation films gone by. It is one of the few films I have attended where people applauded at the end. That says it all in a nutshell."
"timmy_501","9","3","10","29 August 2009"," . Entertaining Tarantino film with troubling subtext
","When Quentin Tarantino's new film debuted at the Cannes film festival this year it was met with indifference and derision in more or less equal doses. Although Tarantino managed to win the top prize at the same festival fifteen years ago with his landmark film Pulp Fiction his new film's modest launch was not surprising to many. In spite of a few instances of pandering to both French citizens and cinema-goers in general Inglorious Basterds just isn't the kind of film that does well with the film festival crowd. The film industry folk in the movie reference legendary directors like Charlie Chaplin, Leni Riefenstahl, and G.W. Pabst at every opportunity but the style of Tarantino's movie has a different type of pedigree: once again it's easy to see the influence of ""B"" film genres such as the Spaghetti Western and Grindhouse.<br/><br/>Still, it isn't just the visual and narrative influence of lurid genre films that divest Inglorious Basterds of its film festival appeal: it also has a muddled (if not downright inhuman) subtext. While the film is tremendously entertaining on the surface level thanks to several cleverly designed suspense sequences and a touch of Tarantino's trademark dialogue it's impossible to examine Inglorious Basterds without noticing some disturbing underpinnings. The film's villain is Nazi Col. Hans Landa, a suave, clever man whose detective skills have earned him the nickname ""Jewhunter."" His opposite is downhome American Basterd Lt. Aldo Raine. Raine hardly considers his enemies human and he likes it that way, as he explains, ""I sure as Hell didn't come...to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity."" Raine and his crew of Basterds (as he unlearnedly dubs them) exhibit a bloodthirsty savagery unmatched by any of the Nazis they encounter. In one slightly nauseating scene Raine expresses happiness that the Nazi officer he has captured isn't going to give him information about troop positions since he'll derive entertainment from watching one of his Basterds beat the man to death with a baseball bat. Raine also carries a large knife with him to scalp his enemies and carve swastikas into any Nazi he leaves alive.<br/><br/>Unlike Raine, Landa seems to have at least some respect for his enemies. He generally only uses violence as a last resort and he even admits he is impressed by the Basterds' exploits. Further, he exhibits a fluency in several languages while Raine can barely speak one. With these two characters the film seems to imply that there's something undesirable if not downright evil about intelligence. Further, the one Basterd that performs the most poorly and nearly ruins one of their missions is an intellectual British film critic. At best, Tarantino is playing into anti-American stereotypes by portraying his American characters as stupid but powerful brutes and at worst he's praising this brutality while suggesting that intellectualism is a negative attribute.<br/><br/>Subtextual concerns aside, Tarantino's latest film is a welcome return to form after the feeble barbarity of Death Proof and the puerile pastiche of the Kill Bill films. Inglorious Basterds is exactly the kind of film Tarantino does best: a viscerally exciting entertainment that works really well as long as it isn't taken seriously."

The story of Fredrick Zoller mirrors that of the Basterds that we gather to laugh at.<br/><br/>If QT is such a fan of Native Americans (e.g. Bill and Brad Pitt in this film)why doesn't he create a film about the genocide committed by Americans against the indigenous of America. This blood is so rarely referenced in film that it might very well be the domain of the ever provocative QT.

","Even before ""Inglourious Basterds"", it was already well established that Quentin Tarantino is an excellent director, but this film is set apart for me in the great amount of comfort it brought me. As a grandchild of holocaust survivors, WW II has always hung over me as a somewhat vague yet distinctly dark cloud of the past. In this film Tarantino allows a way out of this cloud through some classic Hollywood escapism. He doesn't let truth get in the way of a good story, and nor should he. If only for a moment I, and I'm sure many other Jews as well, would only too happily like to shed the image of having been like sheep taken to slaughter. The rush I felt when I witnessed the Jewish triumph over the Third Reich is enough in my opinion to alter the true story in the film, for we all know too well how all attempts to bring down Hitler's regime really ended. My only quibble with this film is that Hans Landa is the most likable character in the whole movie. It is difficult not to be in awe of the Jew-hunter's ability to be holding all the cards throughout the story -- except for the last scene of course. Otherwise, I must say this is really one hell of a movie."

","Like all the above comments QT has been on thin ice with a lot of his recent work and I don't think this really makes up for it. I will say the movie is filmed beautifully every scene nice detail great lighting a lot of thought into each frame but seriously QT is a seasoned directory I expect that type of work. I found nothing shocking about the violence and that it is used to string you along with anticipation of good gore that you can get away with in a war movie and I feel that casting Eli Roth was a tease to good gore that never delivered. Some of the dialogue was great and had a lot behind it, but some was just unnecessary almost to extend a scene so he could film more. I think QT was mixing a lot of things here that in the end just did not come out well. I really hope for a Unrated or re-cut version."

"i-am-so-original","9","3","10","23 August 2009"," The best movie in a long time?
","With such greats to his name such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, it's hard for Quentin Tarantino to match his fans' expectations. As a fan of Quentin, I can say that this meets and exceeds all expectations one can possibly have.<br/><br/>I don't know where to start, so I'll begin with the acting. Let me say that the acting in this film blew away, most notable from Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent. The characters are played in usual Tarantino fashion; not very realistic, but enjoyable to watch. It is hard for us to relate to these characters, but Tarantino makes us grow attached to them in a way most writers cannot. Even the characters with little screen time earn our hearts.<br/><br/>What makes this movie work so well, excluding the acting, is the brilliant writing and directing by Tarantino. All the scenes in the film play out in his usual fashion, with a long and talkative set-up which leads to an explosive conclusion. The whole movie is played out in this typical fashion. The film is very dialogue heavy, but it is so much fun to listen to that we can't help but grow entranced and listen to every word that someone has to say.<br/><br/>It all leads to one of the more finely written climaxes I've seen in a long time. You can't help but stare at the screen in awe and amazement as everything plays out, and the writing makes it flow so well that you can't help but admire what Tarantino is capable of.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, the film is very dialogue heavy, but it is in usual Tarantino fashion. If you have the patience to sit through it, it will definitely be worth it. If you can't, you will be missing out on the bigger picture and some of the greatest payoffs in cinema today.<br/><br/>While some believe Tarantino has lost his touch, this movie proves otherwise. It is his best effort (next to Pulp Fiction) and is one of the best written movies I've seen in a long time. The explosive climax will go down in history as one of the finest pieces of cinema.<br/><br/>""This may just be my masterpiece."" Is this Tarantino's? Possibly, and if not, it is damn close."
"vovazhd","9","3","10","23 August 2009"," Fascinating epic by Tarantino
","Inglourious Basterds is an alternate history World War II war epic. Unlike other war epics, it is completely fictional, using Nazi occupied France as a setting but hardly taking into account any other historical information. The film is stylistically similar to Quentin Tarantino's other films, such as Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bills. There is a lot of exaggerated violence, quirky characters, and dialog.<br/><br/>There are several scenes of extended dialog between characters. Sometimes I criticize this in Tarantino's other films, but it works very well here to introduce the characters and develop them. It even helps demonstrate Hans Landa's fluency in multiple language. Since most of the conservations are only loosely connected to the plot, this may draw some people off. However, these scenes usually conclude with some important plot development or action.<br/><br/>The cast is very strong, although not perfect. Tarantino does not give us as much information about the characters as we would want. He always leaves mysteries open and does not have a single figure take up much of the film's time. In particular, Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz gave commendable performances. The other actors all fit reasonably well.<br/><br/>The plot is secondary to the characters, but is generally good. Split into five chapters, not much happens in the first four parts except for character and plot development, mixed in a few surprising moments. By far the most significant part is the fifth chapter, which is an astounding finale. It is shocking and exaggerated in typical Tarantino fashion.<br/><br/>It is arguable about how much of a point the film has, but for most people it should be entertaining. If you enjoyed Tarantino's previous works, then you would find this one equally worthy."
"PWNYCNY","7","3","10","21 August 2009"," Good but somewhat overblown.
","The movie is a bit long, drags in the middle and has a corny, hokey comic book story style, nevertheless the movie is good but definitely not great. Instead of an action packed movie focusing on a bunch of angry Jewish soldiers going after vicious, unrepentant Nazis, the audience is given a complex story with plots and subplots that are pursued to the point that the Basterds are almost shunted to the sidelines. There is solid acting, with Brad Pitt demonstrating a definite flair for comedy and Christopher Waltz giving a commendable performance as a suave but sinister SS colonel, but the muddled, absurd story is what keeps this movie from achieving anything approaching cinematic greatness. Solid acting coupled with a goofy story does not make for good cinema. This movie also continues the now time honored tradition of bashing Germans, which is nothing new in Hollywood cinema. Once again the Germans are portrayed as hapless buffoons. Yet despite the fact that they started and lost the war, and that it is highly tempting to mock their outrageous conduct, it is a stretch to present the Germans as bumbling fools. They might have been fools but they were far from bumbling and what they did in Word War Two was not a laughing matter. If someone wants to make a movie about inglorious basterds then make a movie about inglorious basterds and place them squarely on center stage where they belong."
"johnnyboyz","7","3","10","21 August 2009"," Tarantino's supposed 'basterdisation' of World War II sees him zoom back to form with an enthralling; gut-wrenching and stylistic war-time thriller.
","Inglourious Basterds sees Tarantino 'glouriously' return to form. What was the debacle called Death Proof, one half of an 'experiment' entitled Grindhouse, has been tried; tested; acknowledged and now buried with Tarantino close to being back in top gear. The film is pure Tarantino, with the sorts of winks, nudges and acknowledgments that are subtle, and compliment the viewing experience, rather than bash you around the head by announcing the whole damn thing is a pastiche in the first place. We've returned to the sorts of Tarantino pieces that check progress with chapters; manipulate time; break the fourth wall; flashback; present us with interesting and dynamic characters that are brought to life brilliantly – even Tarantino's love for the female foot makes an amusing appearance when it transpires an entire plot point must revolve around a woman's foot/shoe. Yes, it's a mad, mad film; but it's as equally high in quality.<br/><br/>Tarantino is still operating within that realm, or aesthetic, of escapism; and while his past, more better, work unfolded under a very grounded umbrella of realism and seemingly real-life people thinking, talking and interacting amongst a plateau of realistic, mostly unfortunate, situations; Inglourios Basterds tears The Second World War a new one with a series of scenes that rip up the rule book; re-envisage, and even have its characters outwardly speak of how certain others, inhabiting certain spaces, at certain times can be fate or ""just an amazing coincidence"". What we get is what Tarantino has confessed to being a Spaghetti Western that just happens to take place in France, in the 1940s, and with a bunch of colourful characters of whom some are French, German and British. The film even makes room for cameo appearances from some of the eras more famous faces and possesses the sheer confidence to spend a good ten or so minutes filling in detailed back-stories to characters before completely removing them from the text.<br/><br/>The opening to the film is pure Tarantino; kicking things off in a lone, road side location as Christoph Waltz's Nazi colonel Hans Landa visits a French farmer. We are plunged into a game of fear, honour and suspicion. The scene is reminiscent of Jules' visit to the apartment full of young guys in Pulp Fiction, when retrieving a suitcase. The man is in total control; he requests a drink of milk more-so than Sprite and calmly banters with the hapless home-owner as he senses exactly what he's after is in very close proximity. His guards loom, ominously, just the other side of a muggy kitchen window out in the yard; out of focus but visible enough to tell us they're there and threatening. It is a brilliant start to what turns out to be an enjoyable romp; but never really exploitative of The Second World War. We do not enjoy any of the deaths in Inglourious Basterds; American, British, German, Jewish or otherwise. Nor are we excited by the shootouts, however well constructed they are.<br/><br/>The Basterds of the title represent a group of American soldiers in Nazi-occupied France; flitting from German platoon-to-German platoon and injecting fear into the Nazi war-machine by killing, maiming, bashing and scalping the enemy. They're led by Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine, a mostly expressionless lieutenant, who self-confesses he and his men are in the ""Nazi killing business, and business is a-booming!"" I was surprised by just how much Pitt's Raine was in it; that being not very much. All the build up, talk and promotional material seemed to include him or revolve around him and his Basterds of the title. Indeed, Tarantino spoke at length about how long it took him to write the character and how much he realised he needed Pitt in the role, etc. But Raine's there for a bit at the beginning, then for about fifteen at the end. It is in no way a criticism, merely an observation, but my guess is that the script was chopped so much that Raine became a supporting character around which Tarantino's finale (which he has stated he had great trouble coming up with over the years) was built up to; and that itself involved a whole new bunch of characters mingling in and around a plot involving raw film stock and a cinema.<br/><br/>Along with these Basterds; of whom Tarantino might be drawing on real life parallels with current American soldiers-come-involvement in brutal, immoral activity in foreign wars; even if I respect those that would disagree through lack of development of this idea; we are presented with a young girl named Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent), whose family are killed by Landa and who has retired to a Parisian cinema to wait out the war. That premise alone might inspire a dynamic, revenge-fuelled, cut and thrust adventure set amongst World War II; but instead, she gets a chance encounter with a young German soldier, who is involved in film production through various reasons. Dreyfus' transition under her alias of Emmanuelle Mimieux, as a submissive and quietly nervous in the Nazis' presence, to a laughing; cackling, rather frightening face that illuminates the setting of the finale is equally refreshing to watch; the final stages of the transition is best highlighted by a montage of fetishistic close ups as she dons clothes and make-up for the climax of a screening.<br/><br/>The film is a sweeping display of tension, horror and distinct black comedy; forever flicking, effortlessly I might add, from the nastiness involved in the hatching of a dangerous plan between two lovers within the walls of a cinema; to an ever-diligent German officer attempting to piece everything together; right the way through to the ever-present, but relegated to looming in the background, group of Americans known as The Basterds. As a multi-equilibrium and frequently non-linear piece, complete with an array of influences and film references within itself, Inglourius Basters is, this time, a welcome addition to the Tarantino collection."

I buy Japanese cars because they're better than ours. So are many German cars...but I don't buy them. Why? Because for some reason, which is hard for me to figure out, I can not forgive the Germans, mostly the Nazi's for the holocaust. I can't seem to let that go. I suppose, I really struggle with the German people's insistence that they, ""...didn't know"" (that smell) was human remains burning from those overs, for so many years! They allowed it to happen, at least in my mind, just as much as the Nazi's made it happen! So, for a movie to come out and give us all the thrill to get back at these less-than-human, lying, evil Nazi's is a wonderful movie too long in coming! Thank you to all that helped produce, direct, act, fund, choreograph, sound, edit, light, grip and of course write this movie.

","I never would've thought Quentin Tarantino could successfully apply his style of story-telling to historical fiction set in World War II, and I'll never doubt him again. This movie went above and beyond any expectations I had going in, and it's Tarantino's best film since 1994's PULP FICTION. I've read multiple mentions through the years that Tarantino would be creating his WWII epic but after a while, I figured it was just rumors. I'm glad to find I was mistaken. In the film, a series of plots to assassinate Adolph Hitler and the key members of the Third Reich are put into play by a French/Jewish cinema owner (Mélanie Laurent) and a Jewish-American strike force known as the Basterds, led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt).<br/><br/>Simply put: if you're a fan of Tarantino's previous films, then you will most likely love his newest. It's got everything we've come to expect: sharp dialogue, a great story with engaging characters, and the usual visual flair with a killer soundtrack to back it up (this time borrowing heavily from those films providing the writer/director with his inspiration. Just as he's done in the past (as with PULP FICTION and KILL BILL), the film is divided into chapters and culminates in a final chapter when the all of the plans come together into an explosive conclusion.<br/><br/>In an ensemble cast, it's rare that any one actor or actress should stand out so far above the rest but, while the entirety of the cast did an incredible job, it was Christoph Waltz who stole my attention in every one of his scenes. A German actor, unknown to American audiences, Waltz's performance as Colonel Hans Landa (or, as his enemies know him, the Jew Hunter) was amazing. He was charming, charismatic, well-mannered, and evil...a villain reminiscent of Hannibal Lector and just as memorable. All of the award nominations he's received for his performance here are well-deserved. I've also got to give credit to Pitt for a great performance as Raine, adopting a heavy Southern drawl and roughing himself up to the point where I lose him in his performance and forget for a while that I'm watching Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>To be honest, each of the cast did a fantastic job, with only one of them grating on my nerves a bit. Eli Roth did a fine job as Sergeant Donny ""The Bear Jew"" Donowitz but he was annoyingly over-the-top at points. Still, it's never enough to ruin a scene and you won't be pulled out of the movie. I absolutely loved this movie and I hope most others will give it a chance before passing judgment. I realize the 2.5 hour runtime will be a discouraging factor to some but I can reassure you there isn't a single moment in the movie where the pace slows. If you're anything like me, the end credits will start rolling and you'll actually wish there was more."

","During WWII, a U.S.Army Unit called the Basterds led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Pitt) go on a Nazi killing spree and attempt to end the war by getting Hitler and his chief officers in one fell swoop. Not a true story. <br/><br/>I almost didn't take this movie out because the promos made it seem like a unit of American soldiers went to Germany in the 1940s and acted like a band of wild Indians on a killing spree shooting and scalping Nazis. So the promos didn't do a good job of promotion for me. But, I took a chance hoping I wouldn't see what I saw in the promos: silliness, recklessness, ugly American behavior, and unfunny wise-cracks.<br/><br/>However, I did see and hear all of that, but not in the quantity the promos seemed to indicate. This was a very well done movie and things were spaced out quite nicely. The DVD box said this was a revenge movie (hey, you finally read one). In other words, the story was all fiction. Things didn't happen this way. <br/><br/>I got annoyed (here we go) with 2-things. Some scenes really took their time to develop, but looking back I see the sense of dragging them out (still didn't like it though, did you?). And, the other thing was the over-use of Sub Titles. Some sentences were too long and you had to focus on the words and not on the actors. Someone ought to make a law that declares over–use of Sub Titles are against the law. Hey, they didn't need them in Valkyrie, did they? Go back and take a look at the 13th Warrior and see how Sub Titles were handled there. Both are great movies btw. <br/><br/>What I didn't expect to experience in here was tension and there was that, and I suppose the dragging out of some scenes contributed to it. It worked. <br/><br/>There is some gore in here. Some scenes will show someone being scalped (like the Indians did it?) and that is not a pleasant sight (turned away, did you?).<br/><br/>The acting, dialogue and action scenes (no CGI?) were all terrific, outstanding in fact. Brad Pitt is always good, but special attention needs to be paid to Christoph Waltz who played German Colonel Lande. He played the always suspicious SS Officer to the hilt and was outstanding (using that word a lot, aren't you?)<br/><br/>Unless I missed it, the word ""basterds"" origin was never explained. I guess it just seemed like part of a nice title. <br/><br/>The promos could have given this movie more credibility. You just have to see for yourself.<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex:Yes. Nudity: No. Gore: Yes, you see scalpings. Language: Yes, some only in the beginning"

","Inglourious Basterds is truly the best Tarantino movie so far... amazing cast... story... The BG score, though it reminded at some places of Kill Bill, was good. <br/><br/>The way each of the cast was being introduced in the film speaks volumes about Tarantino's story telling ability e.g. Eli Roth's introduction-- super-cool. <br/><br/>The long dialogs and portrayal of brutality with pleasant music are all typical Q-touch. Brad was very professional. His role required only 90% of what he is capable of and he exactly gives that without overdoing. Great acting. <br/><br/>Though everybody was just perfect in the movie it would not be a complete summary if there is no mention about Christoph Waltz - The Jew Hunter(though the way in which he surrenders at the end was a bit comical). Waltz was brilliant... I was worried he might miss Oscar because his scope was a bit limited for most part of the film being silent and kinda eerie... but the scene when he speaks to Diane Kruger, Brad and Eli and the one when he shows her shoe and kills her made his performance a bit complete. Whether they give him or not .... sure Oscar ... deserves it ...."

The scene in the theater where Pitt is ""attempting"" to speak in an Italian accent is case in point. Pitt is the overzealous American soldier while Waltz is the German Colonel who thinks they are playing a gentleman's game.<br/><br/>I loved this movie, mostly because it is so uncompromising, raw and crosses the line in so many different ways.

","Inglorious Basterds makes no apologies, asks for no forgiveness, it's a no holds barred assault on the senses. Tarantino doesn't care if he offends, if he steps all over stereotypes and clichés, this is film making at it purest. It's great to see a film maker whose work clearly isn't interfered with by the powers that be. Tarantino is a master of effortlessly cranking up immense tension and suddenly mixing it with laugh out loud moments; you're not sure if you should be looking away in disgust or rolling around laughing, either way it's a roller coaster and one not to be missed! It's not for everyone and I'm unsure how Germans will take the film, certainly if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, this may be a little hard to swallow, but never-the-less, it is a film which simply has to be seen. No self respecting film fan should miss this. And the performance of Christoph Waltz... Oscar don't you dare ignore him!!"
"SebaZava","10","3","11","30 November 2009"," Tarantino's best film since Pulp Fiction.
","Quentin Tarantino's last great movie was Pulp Fiction. Now, don't get me wrong, that doesn't mean he hadn't made any good film since Fiction. The Kill Bill movies, for example, were immensely enjoyable, but nevertheless suffered from the fact that it actually was one film divided – quite inelegantly, I might add – in two. And Death Proof, while entertaining, didn't even try to approach the greatness of previous Tarantino productions – in fact, the other half of the Grindhouse experience, Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror, was superior.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I was expecting his latest movie, this year's Inglourious Basterds, with tons of enthusiasm. The premise sounded great, the cast was interesting and the trailers actually made me more excited to watch the film. I was very excited for the film despite the fact that I knew it wouldn't come to Peru in a particularly near future, but there was hope: I've been in the States for the last week – in Connecticut, to be more precise – and I had the chance to watch the film. (My first experience in an American movie theatre actually, and despite what many critics and moviegoers might say, it was a positive one.) And although I can't say Basterds was as masterful, memorable and entertaining and Pulp Fiction, it's definitely Tarantino's best motion picture in quite some time.<br/><br/>If there's something nobody can deny – whether you like the movie or not – is that Basterds is unlike any other war movie that has come before it. This is war as seen through the eyes of Tarantino, which means it's something completely different from the likes of Saving Private Ryan or Flags of our Fathers. Granted, it does share a theme with these productions – that war is brutal and cruel – but it presents it in a very different fashion. Besides, despite the occasional bursts of violence and brutality, the movie is full of really funny moments that made me laugh out-loud, almost as if I were watching a ""traditional"" comedy. A scene involving three of the ""Basterds"" posing as an Italian film crew comes to mind.<br/><br/>Those expecting action and violence will be disappointed by the movie. Actually, anyone expecting anything traditional from the movie will be disappointed. Yes, there are some ""action"" scenes, but these are more brutal than exciting, and actually serve to release all the tension that has been building up in previous scenes. Not unlike other Tarantino movies, this one is pretty bloody at times - scenes like the ""Bear Jew"" beating a Nazi officer's head to pulp with a baseball bat certainly made me flinch, and should affect the more sensible members of the audience. This might not be a pure-action kind of film, but when it shows violence, it does so in a very unrestrained, almost ironic – and certainly darkly comical – manner.<br/><br/>Taratino's signature witty dialogue is present in the movie, and that's precisely what makes Basterds so enjoyable. Who cares if the film doesn't contain shoot-outs, battle scenes or explosions when one can listen to Tarantino's amazingly well written script come to life. There might not be as many one-liners or witty pieces of dialogue as in Pulp Fiction, but what I liked about the screenplay for the movie was that dialogue actually served a purpose; it wasn't simply there for Tarantino to show off. It either moves the plot forward, presents or further develops a character, or simply builds up tension to eventually explode in a very violent sequence. There certainly are a lot of very memorable talky scenes in Inglourious Basterds, and although all this talking might slow down the movie a bit – especially during the second act -, it certainly didn't cease to entertain me. I do understand if some members of the audience get bored, though – after all, the movie isn't for everyone precisely because it's so different.<br/><br/>Performances are excellent all across the board. Although Brad Pitt's performance as Raine has been maligned in some circles, I personally found him to be truly excellent. He is funny, he is charismatic, and even a little crazy. (His Southern accent is pure genius.) Eli Roth is surprisingly good – make sense that the creator of the Hostel movies gets to play a sadistic basterd who enjoys torturing people – and Diane Kruger is sexy and classy, but the real standouts are Melanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz. The former manages to turn her character into the most fleshed-out and interesting one – as well as the most serious one – while the latter oozes malice and shows that not all Nazi villains in Hollywood movies have to be caricatures. This is a very smart, very cunning kind of Nazi, not the kind you find in movies like Raiders of the Lost Ark, for example.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is a superb motion picture, but it definitely isn't for everyone. Although it can be many things – hilarious, touching, exciting, surprising – it might turn some people off with its graphic depiction of violence and its very dark brand of humour, but for people who enjoy this kind of thing – and especially for those who know what to expect from a Quentin Tarantino film -, it should be a highly enjoyable experience. Just don't expect a cookie-cutter, predictable World War II movie – suffice it to say that Tarantino doesn't mind re-writing history himself, and although this might sound as an insult towards the movie, if you actually get to see it, you'll understand what I mean by this, and you will also understand why it works so beautifully."

If he does not pick up an Oscar for his performance it will be criminal! As you would expect from a Tarantino movie, the cinematography is perfect, some of the shots in the French countryside at the very start of the film are extraordinary. Quentin also manages to create and build some very tense moments, notably in the basement bar and floorboard scenes.<br/><br/>Needless to say that Tarantino fans will love this film, in fact I would encourage anyone who remotely likes movies to watch this. My only gripe is that we have to wait so long between Tarantino's moviesbut then again, that may be why they are all so flawless! 10/10"

","I don't throw those words around lightly. Prior to watching..., witnessing this movie, my all time favourite was ""The Terminator"", followed by ""Pulp Fiction"" and then ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"".<br/><br/>All I wanted was a film that surpassed ""Resevoir Dogs"" so I could walk away happy. But after each 20 minutes or so, my top 5 started to cake and crumble even more. I hate that my favourite film is now from 2009. I cry for ""The Terminator"" as it is a glorious piece of cinematography. But if you are rating based on ""bang for buck"", ""script and delivery"", ""casting"" and ""awards to the viewer"", I can't think of anything else out there that comes close.<br/><br/>I do realise what I'm saying, ""Heat"", ""Vallina Sky"", ""Leon"", and the film I dare not mention, lest I get taken to the mattresses. It is hard to get to grips with, but fact is fact.<br/><br/>This is Brad Pitt's best performance since ""Snatch"". Christopher Waltz is a better bad guy than Heath Ledger. And the sub-characters all feel like they deserve to be in the front row as well.<br/><br/>I have no gripes whatsoever with this movie and Tarantino is now my all time favourite director, and I place him where he belongs proudly, right on top of Luc Besson.<br/><br/>96%"
"maggiedb-1","10","3","11","23 October 2009"," Tarantino's Inglourious masterpiece
","I really raised the bar for this film, because I am familiar with Tarantino for the intellectual film genius that he is, but I also know he likes to repeat himself and he is very indulgent. And Tarantino can take his bow. Not only is his latest adventure a beautiful work of art, painted by violence, controversy and black comedy it is undoubtedly one of the finest films we will ever experience in the cinema. The film is about a group of specially selected yanks who are chosen for their ability and stomach to kill Nazis. On their mission they get involved in the plans of an attack on the German Army during an exclusive film premiere in Paris in a cinema operated by a Jewish woman with her own agenda. The plot is not simply about the basterds trying to scalp Nazis, but it is about the genius way in which a Tarantino film comes to life. Everything is extraordinary: the exiting score, the stylish and authentic set designs, the dialogue, the cinematography, the editing and the acting. This film is not a WWII film, it has the WWII subtext, , it has spaghetti western references and KILL BILL references and it even feels as though Casablanca is referenced as the films sparkles with old Hollywood. Christoph Waltz steals the show, his performance is what film audiences dream about and long for. Brad Pitt is over the top and all of his scenes seem inadequate. Eli Roth, he certainly looks the part, but for future projects he should stick to directing, and none of his torture porn nonsense. Dianne Kruger was absolutely fabulous and burned up the screen with old Hollywood glamour. The real star of this One Director show, apart from Waltz, is definitely Mélanie Laurent. She is one of the most beautiful actresses I have seen in a long time. I loved her performance, it was elegant and glamorous, yet restrained and powerful, she can also be considered in award categories for best supporting actress. Audiences love it, critics love it. So go see this epic, war movie, with a hint of love for cinema and fantasy and have the most entertaining spectacular cinematic experience since The Dark Knight."

","This is a great movie. The dialogues, the suspense, the characters, everything is brilliant. BUT: Only if you are able to think about it, and if you are willing to think about it, and not for just a few seconds. Many people complain about the sonsense plot, about offending cruelty, about boring dialogues and the unreasonable way the story is ""solved"". This movie's director knows more about movies and the history of cinema than most of us can imagine. He knows what he is doing, in every cut, with every light, with every sound and in every frame.<br/><br/>Try to imagine and get the meaning of the scenes like the director maybe had imagined them and what their reason could be in the movie. You are going to see a lot more below the surface. In fact, this movie was almost too fast to discover all the allusions placed in it. It was the best film I have seen since The Dark Knight and one of the best of all times. All people that feel bad about this movie: I think Quentin Tarantino wants you to feel bad. But he knows that there are more persons who like it. That is important. Christoph Waltz deserves an Oscar for his flawless performance. His performance is worth to watch this film."
"edezagon","10","3","11","22 September 2009"," Incredible performances
","I agree with ""produpp"" that Christopher Waltz as SS Officer ""Jew Hunter"" deserves an Oscar for his role. And what I love about it, is the irony. If you check his bio out, you'll see he not only is Austrian, but his son is a Rabbi! I love Tarantino and he's outdone himself again. I hope to see Waltz in more US/EU productions in English. Brilliant movie. It's purely fictional, and however violent it is (and it's gory in places) it's still a superb movie. Just see it without preconception of what it is. Although it's been running a while and the theater was relatively empty, people still clapped. Of course, if you speak French, Italian and German (and English of course) then it's a feast for your ears! Wow."
"MaxBorg89","10","3","11","16 September 2009"," War is hell... and a lot of fun too, apparently!
","For years, Inglourious Basterds was one of those films many aficionados had heard of, but never actually hoped to see: originally conceived at around the same time as Pulp Fiction, it was postponed twice when Kill Bill and Grindhouse got in the way (three times if you count the kung fu movie QT announced in late 2004 and has made no further comments about thus far). Additionally, so many rumors started circulating, be it about the script's scope (Tarantino reportedly considered making two movies, or even a TV miniseries) or the casting (at one stage or another, the film was going to star - according to various rumors - Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy and the dream team of Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger), that it was safe to assume Basterds would be just another promise the director just couldn't find the time to keep. Then, all of a sudden, there it was: script completed in the summer of 2008, green-lit in record time so that Tarantino could meet the Cannes deadline and released in theaters three months after its prestigious French premiere in a ""retooled"" version (it's actually just a minute longer than the cut shown in Cannes). Was it worth the wait and speculation? As ever with QT, the answer is a resounding ""Hell, yes!"".<br/><br/>Starting very boldly with a 20-minute conversation between two people (a scene that reminds of the Sicilian bit in True Romance, a parallel Tarantino himself also acknowledges), the film then sets out to introduce its first main plot: the story of a French Jewish girl, Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), who manages to escape while her entire family has been slaughtered and vows revenge on all Nazis, ideally represented by the suave but cruel Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). Her story intersects with that of the Basterds, a team of Jewish-American soldiers (played by the likes of Eli Roth, The Office's B.J. Novak and Freaks and Geeks' Samm Levine) under the command of Tennessee-born Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). Their mission? To go to France and kill (and scalp) as many Nazis as possible, with some help of the British (cue the presence of Michael Fassbender, whose real- life first language is, ironically enough, German). Needless to say, Adolf Hitler (Martin Wuttke) isn't very happy to hear about this.<br/><br/>Although it takes its title (sort of) from a cult film by Italian director Enzo G. Castellari, called Inglorious Bastards in the US (the proper translation of the Italian title, Quel maledetto treno blindato, would have been That Damned Armored Train), Tarantino's new opus isn't a remake. Heck, it's not even really a war movie, just like Kill Bill isn't really a revenge flick. Sure, it's set ""once upon a time in Nazi-occupied France"", as the title of the first chapter (there are five of them) informs us, and it's about American soldiers fighting against Nazis, but the joy of the movie lies in watching the director take all war movie conventions and do whatever the hell he likes with them.<br/><br/>Nothing in Inglourious Basterds looks or sounds conventional: for one thing, the titular characters don't appear at all in two chapters, and Raine, the alleged protagonist, is the Basterd with the least screen-time. Furthermore, the director favors long dialogue scenes (the spectacular opening, of course, as well as the La Louisiane section) over action, although the latter is pretty visceral when it shows up: blood, dismemberment and a cheeky comment about Donny Donowitz's (Roth, in a surprisingly good role) habit of beating the enemy to death with a baseball bat being the closest these guys get to going to the movies. That thin line between absolute horror and pitch-black humor is best exemplified by the Landa character, a creation so astounding Tarantino has said he wouldn't have made the movie if he hadn't found the right actor. Fortunately he found the Austrian Waltz, who justly won the Best Actor award in Cannes and deserves several more for his chilling yet immensely entertaining portrayal of a man capable of delivering eloquent speeches in four different languages (another bold move on the director's part: half of the film is subtitled) and coldly murdering innocent people with the same ease. If you put him and Jules Winnfield from Pulp Fiction in the same room, it would be one hell of a battle of wits.<br/><br/>And what about QT's blatant love for all kinds of cinema? It's there, perhaps even more prominently than ever before: the soundtrack pays countless homages to Ennio Morricone, who was meant to score the film at one point (the tribute includes a highly ironic use of Morricone's theme from The Battle of Algiers, whose documentary-like realism is the polar opposite of Tarantino's many deliberate excesses), most of the characters' names (most notably Mike Myers' hilarious Ed Fenech) are based on revered B-movie stars (what else?), Brad Pitt is obviously goofing around with his celebrity image, and the entire, outrageous final chapter takes place in a movie theater (plus the comment about Donowitz earlier on). Additionally, Tarantino has inserted a couple of clever in-jokes at the expense of his own universe, with a discussion about the principles of a Mexican stand-off (which occurs during an actual stand-off), scenes that mirror similar ones from his previous films and vocal cameos by people like Samuel L. Jackson and Harvey Keitel.<br/><br/>Sure, some might object to the joyously OTT nature of the whole thing, not least the final line which will certainly be used by detractors to prove that Tarantino is just a self-centered, cocky geek. That may be the case, but given Inglourious Basterds is a shamelessly and intelligently entertaining piece of cinema, not to mention QT's funniest and most accomplished work since Pulp Fiction, that kind of conclusion is the perfect icing on a delicious cake that true fans will want to eat over and over again."
"boris-184","10","3","11","15 September 2009"," This movie is simply beautiful
","For all those who think you should not mess with history, you are wrong! When you only look at the opening titles and see ""western-style"" letters to show us the cast, you know that this will not be 100% history facts. This means that you will see a movie that is imagination of the movie creators. If you want to see facts on the WWII go and look at documentaries at History channel or the Discovery channel.<br/><br/>The scenes are fantastically dramatic and they used some great humor in there too. When you look at the violence, you can say that it's horrifying, but it's also good to be scared or shocked every once and a while.<br/><br/>The use of the languages is also very well done. Beautiful French, German and English sentences. I didn't hear the Italian part that much, because I was laughing to much at the jokes they made about it. So I will have to get back on that.<br/><br/>I enjoyed every minute of this movie! Note to the movie creators, of course it wasn't only Tarentino alone, great work on this movie!"
"jonnywarren","9","3","11","15 September 2009"," Laurent also deserves notice!!!

Granted, I haven't read EVERY review, but she's generally seemed a side note.<br/><br/>Hell, I started out the movie being put off by her, but that turned out to be a coldness of her character. *spoiler* But the moment after her meeting with Landa (Waltz) where she almost hyper ventilates was revealed the turmoil all that stiffness and coldness were concealing. And the rest of the movie, right up to the hysterical/diabolical laughing in the theater was brilliant. *end spoiler* She seriously deserves an Oscar as well. She pulled all that off while staying truthful and not ""overacting"" or ""telegraphing"". Brilliance.<br/><br/>As for Tarantino...I can't think of any other film maker who can be sooooo indulgent and make that a good thing. Hell, a GREAT thing. Between this movie and KILL BILL, his sheer delight in film-making infuses every frame. Unlike many filmmakers, any indulgence he makes is mysteriously elevated to art. Nothing on screen appears to be without heart or thought, and for good or ill, he commits to what he puts up there. WHY CAN'T MORE FILMMAKERS PULL THIS CHUTZPAH OFF?"

","First, the movie is more than 50% farce. E.g., Brad Pitt plays a bumbling Tenneseean from Maynardville, with accent, expressions and all. The star of the movie is Christof Waltz, who (along with another German actor) plays as a master of very subtle psychological terror. You might not see this if you don't understand German, however. Pitt is by far not the main actor. A very unusual movie, with Hillbilly English, German and French spoken, a truly international movie. I couldn't watch the many spots with bloodbath, way too gruesome. Actually, the Hillbilly English is spoken farcically, whereas the German and French are authentic. But that was intended.<br/><br/>(written by someone who lived near Maynardville ...)"
"carl-gardner-2","2","3","11","7 September 2009"," A repellent, amoral waste of talent
","This is an entertaining film, sustaining interest for 150 minutes and including a number of scenes in which tension is built and savoured very effectively. There are also some strong performances, although I think some of the praise for the very good Christoph Waltz has been a bit OTT.<br/><br/>You can't really enjoy it, though, unless you think there is no morality at all in art or that it's okay for an aesthetic of brutality to serve (wittingly or unwittingly) an ethic of brutality. Tarantino glories not only in violence but in cruelty - he invites us to laugh at and approve of deliberate disfigurement as well as a savage murder, both of which would have been war crimes had they happened in reality and neither of which is required by the plot or even serves it. It's gratuitous. And impliedly justified by the fact that they were inflicted on ""Nazis"", with the clear implication that each and every German soldier in occupied France was a committed and genocidal Nazi who deserved to be brutally killed or disfigured. So that's okay then. Kewl.<br/><br/>I don't doubt that Tarantino has talent - but this such a waste of it. Nasty and cynical, with inhuman overtones, all masked by a veneer of knowing irony. Horrid."
"ange_melody","10","3","11","6 September 2009"," ""I think this might just be my masterpiece. "" Yes, Mr.Tarantino, you were right.
","In my opinion, a good movie is, first of all, one that never bores you. Not even when you have seen it ten times. A movie which manages to draw your attention so much, that during it, you cannot pay attention to anything else, and, for those 2 hours, you feel you are in a completely different world, and you forget everything that is real, because the action of the movie becomes so real to you (more than real actually)...that the movie becomes your reality. And you don't want it to end, but at the same time you cannot wait to see what is coming next. And you empathize with the characters. You put yourself in their place and you either wish you were actually one of them or you wish you had directed the movie. In conclusion, a movie which prevents you from looking at the clock is a good movie.<br/><br/>For me, Inglourious Basterds is the very epitome of everything I mentioned above. No sooner had I finished seeing it than it entered my Top Movies. And yes, I think it is Tarantino's masterpiece. Of course, I must say that Pulp Fiction was the first best of Tarantino, and it also is one of my favourites, but Inglourious Basterds has many things that Pulp fiction lacks, such as let's say...maturity and a more interesting and important subject. Of course, I believe that Pulp Fiction also has a bunch of things that Inglourious Basterds does not have, such as witty and funny lines and in general, better dialogues, so it is very hard for me to decide which one I like best.<br/><br/>Anyway, in Inglourious Basterds, I was thrilled to see the multilingual diversity, and I think this was my favourite aspect from the entire movie. I don't know if you ever noticed this: in many movies, especially in those concerning war, the action takes place in either France or Germany, but everyone is speaking in English, although they are supposed to be French or German natives. The fact that Tarantino used so many foreign actors impressed me. But none impressed me like Christoph Waltz. His performance here not only deserves an Oscar nomination, it certainly deserves the award itself. Everything, from his voice, to his witty interpretation of the character, to his suggestive face, brought so much to the movie. I cannot believe that Tarantino actually thought at first to give Leo DiCaprio the part of Hans Landa. Nevertheless, I also have another personal favourite: Til Schweiger aka Hugo Stiglitz. I couldn't stop laughing when Hicox was telling him that they ought to remain calm while Stiglitz was sharpening his knife, and Stiglitz's answer...oh my God, that definitely showed the humor of the movie. Also, the Italian accents...Brad Pitt killed it there, I must say.<br/><br/>All in all, I recommend this movie from all my heart. And make sure you see it with subtitles, that of course, unless you know four languages :)) 10 out of 10."
"giladmg","10","3","11","5 September 2009"," What a refreshing change of pace for the genre!
","Quentin Tarantino has been widely criticized for his countless references to other movies. One user on this very site suggested that he doesn't try anything new, simply because his films are tributes to other genres, whether it be kung-fu or 60s grindhouse fare. But that's what makes him so freaking brilliant! He knows how to make those kinds of movies just as well, if not better than the original material. Tarantino has routinely tried to extract a good movie out of what people traditionally call bad movies, with mostly successful results.<br/><br/>But the film I am talking about right now, ""Inglourious Basterds,"" is more in line with his earliest and best films-""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Reservoir Dogs,"" and ""Jackie Brown""-than his most recent two. It also has strengths above those classics, including the strongest emotional core, the most iconic characters, and perhaps one of the finest climaxes in the history of the movies, which just so happens to be set in a movie theater.<br/><br/>Another real draw is the acting, most notably from Christoph Waltz as Nazi Colonel Hans Landa of the SS, and Melanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus, a French Jew whose family was killed by the aforementioned character. Some of the greatest points in their performances are their details of behaviour. When Hans Landa laughs, his face hysterically turns sharp red, and the laugh itself brings back memories of Heath Ledger as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight."" And in one scene, Shosanna has just had a conversation with Hans Landa in a restaurant, and has maintained her composure throughout the conversation. And just a few moments after he leaves, she exasperates and bursts into tears demonstrating the terror she was keeping inside. It's those details that really accentuate the personalities of Tarantino's brilliantly written reality, and makes his characters feel believable and theatrical all the same.<br/><br/>There are many things to love in this movie-the dialogue, the cinematography, the art design, the reused soundtrack from other movies, the action, and the sheer audacity of the project-, but the main draw for me is the acting. I know I haven't mentioned Brad Pitt during this review. I just don't want to go too deep into him being that Lt. Aldo Raine is more of an over-the-top caricature, but he does do a terrific job. <br/><br/>The reason for the wording of my summary is quite simple: It's the first WWII film I've seen in a while that concentrates on working on its own as a story, as opposed to being sentimental to its audience. If you're only into very conventional, sentimental films in this genre, you will HATE this movie. If you love film in general though, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a movie to celebrate. The best time I've had in a movie theater since the LOTR trilogy; it's that good!"
"quikbdr720","10","3","11","3 September 2009"," ""This just might be my masterpiece""- so Tarantino should be saying
","I don't give out 10s, except now. This by far was the most entertaining, genuine, original film I have seen in years filled with many great movies. Tarantino redeemed himself after KB 1&2. And it goes beyond Pitt's hilarious role, every character was deeply developed, had plenty of screen time, and definitely could be considered for a best cast special award reminiscent of what Lord of The Rings earned. Tarantino's flare was all over this film, over the top, yet still gory and great violence, hilarious AND despicable characters, a top notch story line and great set pieces and cinematography drive this definite front runner for Best Picture (now with 10 nods a year, it should make it). SEE IT SEE IT SEE IT!!! ""We are in the Nazi killing business, and business is A BOOMIN!"" Aldo Raine portrayed Oscar worthily by Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>10/10, 4 stars, 2 thumbs up!"

","After the self-indulgence of the Kill Bill films and the drivel that was Death Proof, my expectations were not high for Inglorious Basterds. Trailers and reviews did little to change my mind. Only on the recommendation of a friend did I go to see it, and I'm glad I did. This is an excellent film - tense, funny, compelling. There are some great set-pieces, such as the opening scene of Landa questioning the farmer and the scene in the bierkeller. The ensemble cast is almost uniformly good, with only Mike Myers awful 'Austin Powers at 60' cameo striking a false note, and even Brad Pitt effective in his role. Inglorious Basterds shows that Tarantino has, despite his own best efforts, not lost the talent that produced Pulp Fiction and that when he reigns in his ego he can be a great director."

I'd say pleasing but if I'm certain of anything it's that Tarantino didn't set out to please with this particular work of art and succeed he did.<br/><br/>One of the things I like best about this movie is that Mr. Tarantino made an honest effort to ground his movie in some 'reality'. Such as having a WWII movie where the Germans actually speak German! How very novel! I won't say there isn't a fair share of surrealism - it wouldn't be a proper Tarantino without it - but it doesn't disrupt the flow of the story.<br/><br/>All in all I'd highly recommend going to see it, even if you're not particularly fond of Tarantino's earlier works."

"Eumenides_0","10","3","11","28 August 2009"," A WWII Fairy-Tale
","Inglourious Basterds is my favorite movie of 2009 so far. I never imagined I'd praise a Quentin Tarantino again, since I've only enjoyed Jackie Brown. But this extravagant WWII fairy-tale got hold of my attention from the first moment and din't let me go until the final deranged shot.<br/><br/>Marketing promoted this movie as nothing more than American soldiers infiltrating enemy lines to spread terror amongst Nazis. As amusing as that could have been for the first ten minutes, it could never sustain a 150-minute-long movie. Fortunately Tarantino was at his most inspired here and developed a parallel subplot about a Jewish girl seeking revenge against the Nazis. And the fun becomes watching these two stories converge until the explosive finale.<br/><br/>From a technical perspective, I think Tarantino's crew did a great work with the cinematography and editing and with bringing the 1940s to life (Tarantino even had everyone talking their original languages). This movie is a pleasure to watch just for the way each scene is shot.<br/><br/>But it's the actors and the characters they give life to that really stand out. There are so many bigger-than-life characters here I don't know where to start. Perhaps with the one that's making everyone talk: Colonel Hans Landa, a sinister, charming, erudite, silly SS officer played by Christoph Waltz. He steals the show with the range of expressions and behavior his role demands: he can go from polite to homicidal in seconds. He speaks four languages fluently in the movie. His interrogation scenes are unforgettable and so is his coolness. A new villain is born.<br/><br/>Mélanie Laurent portrays Shoshanna, a Jewish girl whose family was killed by Landa. Years later she has a chance to kill him and a theater full of Nazis in one of the most satisfying revenge plans cinema has concocted in a long time. Laurent, who for me is the main character of the movie (no matter what marketing says about Brad Pitt), portrays her character as a reserved but implacable woman in her pursuit of revenge. And if anyone gives Waltz the run of his money in this movie, that's Laurent.<br/><br/>The rest of the roles are small but memorable. My third favorite would be Diane Kruger's. Knowing her only from Troy, one would think she's nothing more than a pretty but lifeless face. But when working with good material, she can lit up a scene. Her short role as Bridget Von Hammersmark, a German actress working for the Allied Forces, allows her to play a seductive, deceptive, restrained and deadly woman.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and everyone else who plays his Basterds are hilarious, but they hardly ever steal the show as these three actors do. I think Tarantino just put them there to draw unsuspecting American viewers into watching a movie that's not really about American soldiers.<br/><br/>I must write a few lines about the music. Sadly this wasn't yet the time Tarantino and Morricone collaborated on a movie. Still the director almost makes up for it by filling the movie with Morricone tracks. It's great to know that music Morricone made forty, thirty years ago is still more explosive and epic than the music being made nowadays. Aurally speaking, Inglourious Basterds does sound like the Spaghetti Western Tarantino wanted to make.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. For me it's a true cinematic experience because it's not something I could get in any other artistic medium. This isn't a bestseller or video game or comic book adaptation; it's not a 'true story' full of distortions; in fact the last minutes will prove it's anything but built on history. Tarantino doesn't give a damn about realism. This is fiction at its most uncompromising best, and arguably a fine piece of film art. Cinema needs more movies like this."

Aldo Raine, and Christoph Waltz was absolutely brilliant as Col. Hans Landa, the Jew Hunter. <br/><br/>Now, is this Tarantino's masterpiece, as he stated it was? I don't think so, but it was close. What held it back was the length. I thought that some of it was a little too lengthened. But it didn't stop me from enjoying ""Inglourious Basterds."" I would absolutely see it again. <br/><br/>If you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino, then I can guarantee that you're gonna enjoy this movie. Also, forget its historical inaccuracies. Just have fun with it!"

","I haven't seen every Tarantino movie yet, but this one is clearly the best one next to Pulp Fiction that I have seen, I can say that much. Quirky, blazing with the kind of wit that Tarantino is famous for and topped off with a dose of nasty, gritty and rogueish violence. This movie is pretty sprawling, featuring a host of characters and plot niches that span over a huge 2.5 hour timeline, and surprisingly it manages to entertain for most of it, despite some scenes that could have been trimmed down for the sake of the story. Throughout its duration, Basterds delivers memorable scenes, memorable and witty dialogue and outrageously precise directing that all comes together for a smash hit of a movie, right on the bullseye. <br/><br/>And I think what sets this apart from the other recent Tarantino films is that it actually stands on its own two feet and delivers its story mightily and without the somewhat doddering eccentricity of Kill Bill or Death Proof - both of which were good, but not this good, not quite this complete and breathtaking. This is a movie fan's movie and I am proud to have seen it. Highly Recommended."

","What a Cast! Beautiful Soundtack (although it seems sometimes You watch another Kill Bill movie :) ) Anyway, it must be said Maestro (Quentin Tarsntino) got a style, he is carrying on. One of the difficulties You face watching a Movie is Dialogues (just like in Death Proof), they take ages. Especially when English isn't Ur Mothertongue. Anyway, despite of the feeling You've got the mixture of Pulp Fiction (shooting scenes), Kill Bill (bloody violence over and over again, oh dear, I loved it so much) and Death Proof (endless dialogs), the story itself and that cast (so brilliant, especially Germans, bless them ;-) ) holds You on the best level of excitement :) p.s. Big credits for authentic languages in a Movie :) Bravo!"

","Inglorious Basterds was an extremely entertaining flick. Necessarily lengthy to weave the differing story lines together (a la Pulp Fiction)this film is an instant classic.<br/><br/>The writing was superb (as befits a script he worked on for 8 years).<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the subtle little directorial touches, such as the lengthy wait from the time ""Batman"" is introduced by Lt. Aldo until he actually shows up on screen. I particularly liked the fact that 50-60% of the film is sub-titled, lending to the authenticity, instead of having German and French actors speaking English to each other with German or French accents.<br/><br/>The casting was superb as was the acting. Whereas the entire plot line is a fantasy, I have to say Mr. T. pulled it off splendidly.<br/><br/>Typical Tarantino violence makes this film not one for the squeamish or for those under 13-or-so.<br/><br/>The scene on the final moments, where the Jewish GIs are indiscriminatingly machine gunning down the tuxedoed and evening-gowned Nazi theater goers, kind of reminded me of the scene from Schindler's List, when Ralph Fiennes was taking target practice from on high shooting and killing the unsuspecting poor Jews down below in the camp. Turnabout is great to watch.<br/><br/>I saw it at a 9:45am showing on opening Friday. Every seat in the theater was occupied. I mean 100% sold out.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds should be every Jew's ""Rocky"" or ""Roots"".<br/><br/>I could go on-and-on but what's the point? It's a great film. If you like Tarantino, if you like Brad Pitt, if you like the slaughter of Nazis, then---what are you waiting for?----GO SEE IT."
"legendaryunderdog","10","3","11","21 August 2009"," An enjoyable roller-coaster of a film courtesy of Mr. Tarantino...
","Already being noted for his stellar work as a Director, Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" is in my opinion, another successful chapter in the impressive career for the director. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Lt. Aldo Raine to me is award winning material, the accent, the comedic yet serious side, Pitt definitely out-does himself in this film. The German and French subtitles are marvelous, the cinematography is amazing, it is quite evident that Tarantino did his homework before making this picture. The Nazi leaders, Hitler, Goebbels, Goering and Bormann are all mentioned (and shown as well) so I was impressed with the historical significance that Tarantino incorporated into the film (although it is fictitious). The ending is more than memorable, for a two and a half hour film, it does fly by. With Tarantino's unorthodox blend of comedy,suspense,horror and drama all mixed together, it is beyond fair to conclude that this picture is a film that is deserved of its own pedestal."
"Jezusofsuburbia","9","3","11","21 August 2009"," Well, I've just left the midnight showing..
","I have to say this movie is more than fantastic in quite a few ways. To start it's a QT film, and that may be why the review seems biased, but to be honest I purposely kept myself from getting too amped up, and going in had ignored all other reviews. This is not QT's finest, but it makes my top 10 and his top 3. He works a lot of great camera angles, including an over-hanging shot with a shaky follow along. So, cinematically I give it a 10.<br/><br/>Now for the acting. I think Brad Pitt definitely was funny and pulled of the role quite well. The only acting I worried about was Eli Roth, now I have all faith in him as an actor, he did fantastic as the baseball bat wielding ""Bear-Jew"". Also,Christoph Waltz as Hans Landa was one of the finest pieces of acting I have ever seen, he was funny, yet frightening. It was just an amazing piece of acting. Finally, Lauren Laurent as Shoshanna, was beautiful and her words cut like a razor, it was another fantastic piece of acting. But, some of the smaller roles, like B.J Novaks was sub par. As an overall for acting I would give it an 8.<br/><br/>Finally, for the writing, which I'm judging off of the script i'd previously read, and the way characters portrayed this. I think it was pretty good. It was classic QT where characters held those deep wrenching true to human emotion conversations, but it was well played. And the way actors like Christoph Waltz brought it to screen made it have real feeling. Overall the writing gets an 8.<br/><br/>So as an overall movie, I give it a 9 out of 10."
"davidfyfe99","10","3","11","20 August 2009"," Tarantino RULES
","'Death Proof' was unfairly treated by critics in my opinion, and this is being hailed as a return to form for Mr Tarantino, which it most definitely is. He has been apparently working on this for years and now that it has finally hit the screens, it was well worth the wait. He completely outdoes himself here, there is not a single scene that doesn't work, a single actor out of place. Until I saw this, 'Jackie Brown' was my favourite of Tarantino's films, but this just nudges that one into second place. Christoph Waltz is a complete revelation, Tarantino wouldn't make this film unless he could find an actor who could really speak all the languages he speaks, and now we can see why, it simply would not have worked otherwise.<br/><br/>Anyone who enjoys films and how they are made or anyone who just enjoys films would be crazy to miss this, it will go down in history as one of the very best ever made."
"gainestillinger","7","3","11","20 August 2009"," Personally, I love Tarentino.
","It's hard not to like Tarentino, isn't it? The aplomb and charsima with which he conveys brain-exploding sequences of tension mixed with violence, or violence mixed with tension, with just enough humour to make us laugh nervously is stylised and unique. In many ways, he has become his own genre. Surely this, at some point, must or will go to his head? Inglorious Basterds sees the big Q getting a bit carried away with... well, just about everything. Some scenes run on for far longer than they should and the soundtrack races far past his usual post of 'quirky' and 'hip' and keeps rolling to 'just plain strange'. In one of the film's many tragedies the chosen song is quite clearly in no way affiliated with the genre of the film or the tone of the scene. This seems to matter little to Tarentino – it's as if he thinks we are happy to take a bit of 80s rock ballad with our World War II Flying Fist of Judaism revenge film because, after all, he is Quentin Tarentino.<br/><br/>This is a revenge fantasy war film set in the Second World War where a dirty dozen-type-platoon, led by Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine, is dropped into occupied France to brutalise and terrify the Nazis, and eventually to assassinate a number of high-ranking SS officers, including Hitler, in a cinema. Before this, however, the Basterds will 'collect one hundred Nazi scalps' to petrify the hell out of any Nazi soldier daft enough to believe that Hell is not where they are headed anyway.<br/><br/>It is not hard to feel an intense support for Pitt's boys, and this feeling is heightened all the more after having met Christoph Waltz's Col. Landa, the Jew hunter, in the first scene of the film. In a charismatic smile and a stare of cold efficiency, Waltz captures the polished leather and lapels of the administrative Nazi; his sense of self-authority oozes from every pore of his being. He is so fantastically overbearing in his authority that I have never in my life watched a man eat a strudel and feel as tense as I did in one key scene from this film. This is the man that the Basterds must avoid... Ha! Of course, they meet, of course the tension and violence Quentin-meter shoots back up into the red and we remember why we love Mr T so much.<br/><br/>Due to the ultra-graphic nature of the final slaughter scenes, some have called this film 'Kosher porn'. I disagree. Many of us gentiles will watch the cleansing of the Nazis with a similar 'well, they deserved it' smile. This, I think, is the most interesting thing about this film. It makes us ask the question: what, really, does this say about us? Overall, Inglorious Basterds is beautifully shot, majestically edited, painfully funny and violent at the same time and it makes us question the nature of justice. Is it a nice neat courtroom and a well-carpentered gallows, or is the fiery bullet-soaked hell of a burning room where criminals slowly melt into the floor and metal of red-backed theatre house chairs? With the right soundtrack, it could be anything Quentin wants it to be."
"neil-476","7","3","11","19 August 2009"," Interesting....
","I long ago stopped believing Tarantino's publicity, and I approached IB (if I may refer to it as such) with trepidation. And I must say that whatever his faults - and they become clearer with each subsequent film - Tarantino never fails to present a piece of work which is startlingly individual.<br/><br/>IB is a case in point. The story is an interesting, unusual war story. It starts with Gestapo Col Hans Landa (a fabulous performance by Christoph Waltz) killing a Jewish family but allowing daughter Shosanna to escape. Then we meet the Basterds, a group of eight Jewish American soldiers lead by half-Apache Brad Pitt, whose brief is to go behind enemy lines and slaughter Nazis. We jump ahead in time to a point where Shosanna now owns and runs a cinema in Paris. When the cinema unexpectedly becomes the venue for a movie to be watched by all the German high command, she determines to set fire to the place with them all trapped inside. Unknown to her, both British intelligence and the Basterds are involved in a similar scheme....<br/><br/>There are some excellent elements to this movie. Christoph Waltz, as noted above, is one - both amusing and chilling. Diane Kruger, as German actress Briget von Hammersmark is another. The sequence in the bar is brilliant. And the proper languages are used, subtitled (with several cast members showing themselves to be fluently multilingual), with over two thirds of the film taking part in French and/or German.<br/><br/>Now let's examine what is not so good.<br/><br/>Shosanna's escape shows elements of a set-up for something which never materialises. A number of aspects of the ending don't really play fair with the audience (characters who die, and those who survive, contrary to audience preferences, plus the actual ending itself). There are some downright bizarre music choices. Brad Pitt is awful, playing a character directed (but not written) so broadly that he may as well have been playing panto - he seems to be trying to channel a comedy version of Marlon Brando in The Godfather, and his gurning is painful to watch. I found the whole interplay between violence and humour difficult to deal with - one sequence with someone being beaten to death with a baseball bat had the audience laughing.<br/><br/>And the film is far too long - it could usefully be cut by an hour (the opening sequence takes 20 minutes and needs only 5).<br/><br/>But I had no trouble with rewriting the end of the war - the ""Once upon a time"" at the start makes it clear that this is a fairy tale."
"CatDayAfternoon","1","2","6","14 April 2020"," Proof that people are sheep

compliments for this abysmal piece of self indulgent crap ends. I'm not sure if Tarantino is just making fun of his fans or what. This movie is horrible and the fact that it's rated so high on IMDB just shows how people follow along with what they believe is ""supposed"" to be good. I'm still dumbfounded by how bad Brad Pitt is. Did he win the Razzie for this? If not, WHO...was worse? Worst Tarantino film of all time. Really it's been all downhill since Pulp Fiction."
"nickmat-2","4","2","6","10 December 2019"," Such an overrated film
","The film was going well during the first two of its five chapters but it fell flat on its face after that as if it were a different film. It became superficial, highly disjointed, without a strong direction and way too cartoonish, let alone that it presented a ridiculous history version of the second world War showing events that are obviously mythological eg how things ended with the top Nazis Hitler, Goebbels, Goering and Bormann. I really can't understand why this film is so highly rated.<br/><br/>I would have given it less than 4/10 but I liked the wonderful performances by Christopher Waltz playing the ruthless but fakely polite Nazi Jew hunter Hans Landa, the pretty French actress Melanie Laurent playing the part of the Jewish girl Shosanna and the charming Daniel Bruhl as German officer Frederick Zoller chasing persistently after Shosanna with whom she fell in love not knowing she is Jewish. Not much to say though about Brad Pitt in his role as the vindictive Aldo Raine ""Apache"".<br/><br/>If you want to watch a decent film about second world War France go for Suite Francaise starring Mattias Schoenaerts."

","Inglorious Basterds does one of the many things cinema was designed for: killing Nazis in the most beautiful and over-the-top satisfyingly done way possible. It's a revenge flick through and through and proud of it; Quentin Tarantino planned this masterful with a powerful and important message: 'Fuck Nazis and Anyone Who Supports Them'.<br/><br/>The film is divided into chapters much like Pulp Fiction. It starts off with a Nazi inspecting a French farmer's home for Jewish refugees, and unfortunately blackmails the farmer into revealing their whereabouts where the Jews are brutally machine-gunned in his home. Only one of the Jews escapes the massacre, Shosanna, but she becomes crucial to the film's later developments. And Shosanna delivers the ultimate meta-revenge to Adolf Hitler in the final act.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds is through-and-through an utter joy of a film and immensely satisfying seeing Earth's most evil political force seeing righteously deserved vengeance served upon them tenfold.

"oOoBarracuda","10","2","6","30 January 2017"," Inglourious Basterds
","""I do believe this is my masterpiece""<br/><br/>The final line spoken by Brad Pitt in the 2009 film, Inglourious Basterds is one I have often hoped was a declaration of director Quentin Tarantino's. I do believe Inglourious Basterds is Tarantino's masterpiece, excelling his 1992 film Reservoir Dogs, and his 1994 classic Pulp Fiction. The script is airtight with every line of dialogue having a purpose. Starring Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz-- in an American breakout performance for the ages, Inglourious Basterds exceeds the film mastery audiences have grown to expect from Tarantino.<br/><br/>Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) has found a home in German- occupied France harboring Jews in 1941. Landa slaughters the family with the exception of young Shosanna (Mélanie Laurent) who is able to escape. Shosanna vows to get revenge against Germany and bides her time plotting after her escape. Three years later, the cinema she owns is selected to host an illustrious movie premiere to honor German war hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl). Zoller immediately takes a liking to Shosanna, convincing Hitler (Martin Wuttke) through his reservations about the venue. Shosanna isn't the only one plotting a massacre at the movie premiere, however. Unbeknownst to her, a group of Jewish- American guerrilla soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine also have a plan for a massacre at the cinema the night of the premiere. The group who does one thing only ""kill nazi's"" have developed a plan with German movie star Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) to sneak explosives and artillery into the cinema which will be filled with German military and the high command. The two plans are developed, independently of each other, ensuring that, one way or another, Hitler will meet his demise on the night of the premiere.<br/><br/>I am, unashamedly so, a big fan of Quentin Tarantino's. He's one of, if not the best, modern dialogue writers, in my estimation. A script carries a film, and if the script is good, the film will usually be good, as well. No one writes dialogue like Tarantino, with the notable exception of Woody Allen. The other unique thing about Tarantino is his lack of formal film schooling or training. Tarantino never went to film school, yet amassed a wealth of film knowledge from reading an extensive amount of film history, and screenplays. Every Tarantino film is riddled with bits of film history throughout the film, making his movies a cinephile's dream. Film scores are also incredibly important to Tarantino and pivotal to his films. He is able to arrange a film score that seems like it doesn't work, only to reveal that it's perfect. I could spend decades writing about how riveting the interrogation scenes are in Inglourious Basterds, solely due to the fine script, or I could spend an equal length of time talking about how many plot points Tarantino brings seamlessly together by the film's end; Inglourious Basterds, however, is simply a film that begs to be seen and experienced first hand. The lighting, the nods to classic cinema, and every Tarantino-esque moment comes together perfectly creating a film that will be difficult for the director to top."
"MUFCOK","8","2","6","26 January 2017"," Tarantino takes on Hitler, no wonder so many people chose to hate this movie.
","Tarantino takes on Hitler, no wonder so many people chose to hate this movie. Baffling however, why they chose to watch it in the first place as it's likely very certain that they knew they were not going to enjoy it.<br/><br/>A quick scan through user reviews here on IMDb will show you an unbeieveble amount of reviews with 1/10 ratings claiming it's 'one of the worst films I have ever seen' or 'complete waste of time and money'. <br/><br/>Why watch a movie from a director you don't like, complain about violence, long drawn out dialogue scenes and unorthodox story- telling of a controversial historical topic? Why complain about plot holes and rate is as 1/10 because of this? People don't like Tarantino yet they still pay their hard earned money and spend their precious time watching his movies at the cinema simply to go home and give their two cents worth of how awful it was and how unintelligent you have to be to be entertained by such garbage. <br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds may not be perfect but it is exactly what I expected from a Tarantino film. It's violent yet not as violent as some of his other works, some of the scenes are graphic but nothing that I would class as morbidly excessive. The dialogue is impressive in stops and starts with a couple of the scenes in the movie being among his best work in terms of dialogue, the opening scene in particular was so tense and perfectly constructed that it truly did showcase Tarantino's skill at creating such great film. Setting the bar so high in the opening scene had a slight negative impact on the rest of the movie though as the remainder of the film couldn't live up to that first scene on the milk farm. <br/><br/>Split into 5 chapters which is essentially 5 long scenes, Tarantino tells the story of a Nazi-occupied France during World War 2, following the harrowing journey of 'The Jew Killer', the backlash of the 'Inglorious Basterds' and the story of a Jew with cold revenge on her mind. There is no sole focus on any one character as the story isn't told through anyone's perspective, the story simply moves through the different characters scene by scene.<br/><br/>We are lead to believe from the movie title and trailer that the movie will focus completely around The Inglorious Basterds. This isn't the case and they act as a cog in a big wheel of different characters, they never really feel like the main people, we are given little back story to them and develop no emotional attachment to them. Brad Pitt was the poster boy for this movie yet he didn't feature half as much as I thought he would and sadly the screen time he did get was quite disappointing. His character wasn't very interesting and contained far too many clichés, often looking out of place and struggling to adapt completely to his role. Some of his script did however add some humor to the movie but the better scenes in the movie were ones which he wasn't a part of. Christoph Waltz was fascinating as 'The Jew Hunter', his calm and somewhat friendly persona makes him so edgy giving you the feeling that he could do anything at any moment. His performance was completely faultless which was by far the strongest aspect of Inglorious Basterds and the best scenes of this movie are ones which he was in. <br/><br/>There are some big plot holes in this movie, which i will not go into as they would contain big spoilers. The plot holes didn't stop me enjoying this movie though as it isn't a movie of realism, you would be a fool to believe that Inglorious Basterds was trying to even attempt that. I don't necessarily think it is down to lazy writing either, I personally think that some of the plot conveniences were purely to move the movie along. Tarantino may have stuggled to fit all of the story he wanted to tell into the two and a half hour run-time and in doing so, possibly in the trimming down process to keep it a respectable length, some of the the plot lines got a little choppy and dysfunctional. <br/><br/>Overall, Inglorious Basterds is a movie made for my tastes so my rating will be high. I can see it isn't a perfect movie and I can acknowledge these flaws however I wouldn't be telling the truth if I said that I didn't enjoy it. The time flew by and i found myself completely captivated in the story, the tense scenes made me tense, the humor hit the spot, the violence was graphic and uncut and the climax to the movie felt fitting and powerful. <br/><br/>Tarantino creates a unique movie experience on a topic which was never going to please anyone. He made complete fiction out of one of the most notoriously disgusting people in the history of the world and did it completely on his terms. I have no issues with that whatsoever.<br/><br/>8/10"

I've watched one too many films in my life, which makes it easy to guess what's going to happen next, but this film really exceeded in enigma.

","This film is remarkable for several reasons. The first is that it does not take sides in order to glorify any one philosophy. Another is its brilliant depiction of the people who are ""good"" at war, sadistic,distorted, prejudiced, brutal people, on both or even all sides of the conflict. Which seems to declare, war happens, it is wrong, and the reason it is wrong, is it attracts people who are almost caricatures of evil.But what most surprised and delighted me was Brad Pits performance, an actor I had dismissed as just a pretty boy, playing himself, with empty swagger[ a la Tom Cruise, except for collateral, brilliant ]. Even in Spy Games with Robert Redford, always masterful, he played Brad [ bad boy swagger Pit]. In this film he gave a flawless, awesome performance, albeit brutally distasteful. Close ups, vocal delivery, gestures, timing, come on Brad always get it so right."

"CinemaClown","Null","2","6","4 January 2016"," You Know What? This Just Might Be Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece!
","The sixth film by Quentin Tarantino finds the esteemed filmmaker in sublime form as he blends the genres of war & spaghetti western into one stylish, violent & vengeful cinematic delight that brims with Tarantino's patented wordplay, fascinating characters, uninhibited violence, outstanding cast & excellent performances to deliver a thrilling ride that enthrals, entertains & satisfies on all levels, and keeps getting better with every subsequent viewing.<br/><br/>Set in Nazi-occupied France, Inglourious Basterds intercuts two story lines. First concerns a young Jewish girl who, after witnessing her family being killed by an SS officer, plots her revenge several years later when a German war film is arranged to premiere at her theatre. The second plot follows a team of Jewish-American soldiers who plan to assassinate all the Nazi leaders attending the film premiere. The two plots of revenge eventually coincide as the story nears its conclusion.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, Inglourious Basterds is told in five chapters and features the best opening scene of any Tarantino movie to date. The first twenty minutes is a pure exercise in unabridged, patient & flawless filmmaking for the director allows the dialogue-heavy segment to instil an unnerving ambiance on its own and keeps a firm check on the pace & camera movements. It also introduces us to the villain in grand style and by the time the first chapter ends, we know all there is to know about Hans Landa & his cunning tactics.<br/><br/>Tarantino's direction is terrific while his screenplay is a gem in itself. Adding enough meat on every character's bone, he manages to carve out many suspenseful moments from the most unexpected corners and while his usual elements, such as pop culture references, dark humour, blood-soaked violence are in tact, the writer-director also removes the veil of hypocrisy to show that all humans, regardless of their labels, are capable of intense cruelty. Also, by setting his narrative in a fictional alternate history, he frees himself from following the fact formula and plays as per his wishes.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are fabulously carried out, each adding something to the movie. Production design team does a really fine job in setting up the World War II iconography, albeit with little dose of western landscape. Cinematography gives its images a sumptuous look n feel, while exquisitely moving the camera around to capture the drama in splendid detail. Editing is expertly carried out & its 152 minutes of runtime is consistently paced. And as always, Tarantino manages to put together an amazing soundtrack, comprising of wonderful tracks that seamlessly integrates with the scenes and effortlessly uplift the whole experience.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Inglourious Basterds features a stellar cast in Brad Pitt, Christopher Waltz, Mélanie Laurent, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassbender, Eli Roth, Daniel Brühl & others, and all of them are fabulous in their given roles. Pitt plays a character that belongs to his comfort zone & does well with what he's given. Fassbender is present in just one chapter yet manages to leave his mark. Kruger & Brühl balance their act really well, Roth gets to play the coolest basterd of them all as that skull bashing scene had all the build-up elements of a spaghetti western Mexican standoff. However, the best performances come from Waltz & Laurent.<br/><br/>Making a lasting impression right within the opening segment, Waltz brings this ingeniously written character to life as per the exact demands of the screenplay and delivers an absolutely impeccable performance that easily goes down as one of decade's best. The character of Hans Landa is one of Tarantino's finest creations and Waltz only gets better in that role as the story progresses. Without Waltz's contribution, Inglourious Basterds amounts to pretty much nothing plus it's a rare instance of perfect actor-character marriage. Laurent is another revelation and plays her part with stunning finesse plus and just like Waltz, her input is devoid of any faults.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Inglourious Basterds is another original, sophisticated & downright captivating extravaganza from Quentin Tarantino that, like few of his earlier flicks, requires a little getting used to. Jam-packed with vibrant flavours & accomplished in nearly every filmmaking aspect, the movie brilliantly exhibits just how far this master storyteller has come over the years in tightening his grip around his craft. One of the best films of its year and certainly amongst the finest from Tarantino's filmography, Inglourious Basterds is a slow burner but it has all the ingredients of an instant classic and considering numerous other positives, I think this just might be his masterpiece."

","There are no benefits to allowing people in any society to watch this reckless dive into violence. It only fuels hatred towards one particular group, in this case obviously Germans. (No doubt, the purpose of a film like this.) Does it make you feel proud as an actor or actress to have starred in a movie which makes plunging into violence a thrilling fiesta? We are in the 21st century and there have been millions of atrocious acts committed by all kinds of groups and nations since the Second World War. It is time for all real Germans to refuse to participate in any more hate-filled anti-German media productions! Have the guts to say, ""Never again!"" And keep in mind, if a revenge-fantasy film like this is permitted to be produced and distributed in supposedly civilized societies, then every group on earth has the right to create this kind of hell-inspired drivel.

"headhunter46","7","2","6","21 March 2010"," This is truly a love it or hate it movie
","Reviews from 0-10 should tell you love or hate hinges on love-hate for Quentin.<br/><br/>There are some in this movie who played their role exceptionally well. People who have never been in war will have difficulty comprehending the imminent danger. I am glad the majority of Americans have not been in a war situation, but that means a great many of them cannot sense the danger building. Especially behind the smiling pseudo-friendly face of the Nazi who portrays Colonel Landa. His behavior when we first see him, made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I felt, and KNEW this was a psychotic, homicidal maniac the instant he began to speak. And I didn't even understand the language! The way he leered at the farmers daughters was a veiled threat suggesting, ""You cooperate with me, or all three of your daughters will be raped."" My heart trembled for the poor farmer. He knew he had no options. Soldiers outside with machine guns and motorcycles so there was no escape for him. He had vulnerable daughters to protect and no weapons with which to defend them. That Nazi colonel made my skin crawl with his phony, ""I'm a nice guy doing you a favor"", act. I could feel my heart beating faster with every second knowing he was capable of extreme cruelty.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt does a respectable job of portraying a gung ho soldier who is dedicated to ridding the world of Nazis. He does NOT adhere to the Geneva convention rules for the treatment of prisoners. Some viewers will find themselves cheering for the unsympathetic treatment of what they perceive as ruthless, murderous Nazis. It made me cringe to see soldiers abusing prisoners because that is against everything the US is supposed to stand for but hey, it is a band of renegades bent on raising havoc with the aggressors so it was intended to portray returning evil for evil I guess.<br/><br/>Melanie Laurent does a very believable job of portraying Shoshanna. When she faces Col. Landa knowing it was he who ordered the killing of her family, her fear and loathing barely show through. I sat there expecting her to explode in a rage, pounding the hell out of him and of course he would have shot her. But no, she held it in until he left the room and then she broke down in a most convincing way. Makes me wonder if something terrible actually happened to her that she could draw on for realism. Wow! <br/><br/>Major spoilers follow. Read this AFTER you have seen the movie and decide if you agree with me or it might ruin the whole movie for you.<br/><br/>Some major flaws necessary to the plot.<br/><br/>#1 At the farm: Col Landa would never have allowed Shoshanna to escape, he would have ordered the soldiers to chase her down on motorcycles and get rid of her. Her escape was necessary to augment the irony of the finale.<br/><br/>#2 The meeting in the basement: Lt. Raines foreshadowed the disaster of meeting in a basement. I KNEW it would turn bad but not how terribly bad.<br/><br/>#3 In the basement: When the persistent Major Hellstrom suspected Lt. Hicox of not being a true German they end up with pistols pointed at each other under the table. The Basterd teammate was foolish to aim his pistol at the majors crotch and fire. That started the whole massacre. It would have been wiser to shoot the major in the head. That way he might not have been able to fire a round at Lt. Hicox. They would have had their hands full dealing with the other Germans but the bartender and the woman, Hammersmark, would have been able to assist. It would have been four against four. The basterds might have survived.<br/><br/>#4 Shoshanna: In the projector room, she shot the German ""hero"" and then approached as if she was worried about him. Maybe Quentin wished to depict her as a tenderhearted woman trapped in a dangerous situation but she should have put one more bullet in his head and she would have lived. I wanted her to live, most people I know wanted her to live. The tormented, brave heroine died. Bah humbug.<br/><br/>#5 Ms. Hammersmark: It was foolish of her to pretend to have gone mountain climbing. Had she made up something more believable such as being hit by a bicycle or falling on stairs in the basement it would have made more sense. Then Col. Landa might have asked her to explain the napkin signed by her and she could have told the truth about giving it to the proud new father before she fell on the steps. That would explain the missing shoe. He was a very shrewd investigator so he may still have killed her just to be safe but at least there was the chance he might have believed her. I wanted her to make it. She was one of the ""good guys"". There WERE Germans who hated what the Nazis were doing to Germany.<br/><br/>#6 The assault on the theater: It is ludicrous to think all those high officers of the Nazis would be in one place with only a bare minimum of security. The basterds would never have pulled it off with a couple hundred guards watching everybody.<br/><br/>#7 The massacre in the theater: Our heroes manage to kill Hitler and all the high officers thereby rewriting history and ending WWII very early on. They saved millions of lives and the greater part of German cities.<br/><br/>Also that halted the Russian advance and prevented Berlin from being divided. That probably prevented the cold war, the Korean war, and Vietnam. Peace reigned over all the world and everyone lived in prosperity.<br/><br/>Wow, wish to God it had been so."

","If you love Quentin Tarantino, or, if you think it's cool to love Quentin Tarantino (I'm in neither category); and, if you are ""Pulp Fiction"" worshiper (I'm not), and if think that long, drawn out senseless sub-titled dialog somehow makes a boring movie more artsy and 'chi chi' (which I don't), and you are spellbound by excessive close-ups of inanimate objects, including several of a bowl of whipped cream (I do, however, like whipped cream), then, and only then is this movie for you. I should have known that weak movies advertise the only decent scenes in the film. When I forked over 3.99 at Blockbuster, I expected to see an over-acting Brad Pitt win World War II with the help of some Jewish commandos, ie. Clint Eastwood. While playing a big part of the movie's relentless commercial advertisements, the almost comical scenes with Pitt are all too scarce. The one saving member of this international cast was Christoph Waltz whose portrayal of a remorseless Nazi SS officer, rivals Ralph Fiennes', characterization of Amon Goeth in ""Schindler's List"", and is worthy of awards and praise. Otherwise this Tarantino mish-mash of a movie is worth a mere three stars, which I consider generous, and makes me glad that it was a rental."

","It is interesting that the day after I saw this movie, I saw a B/W WWII movie, ""Sahara,"" with Humphrey Bogart in the lead role. It was a much better movie to me than the pretentious interpretation of war savagery envisioned by Tarantino. That 1943 movie had a quality of realism Tarantino's did not: the action was plausible, the actors seemed like actual humans. Tarantino's movie is for all intents and purposes a video game rendered in cinematic form. I can understand why it appeals to many; like a video game, it has its intriguing moments. A lot of people like hardcore video games. A lot of people like the violence in video games...<br/><br/>On the plus side, there are some true strengths to IB. The lighting, and color, and camera work are at times very very good. But they are not consistent: Tarantino must have watched WWII movies before making this and occasionally mimics the static single angle camera, almost as homage to those films. There is one shot of Laurent bathed in the light of the projectors worthy capture for a museum.... Truly beautiful cinema at times. The acting is wonderful. Brad Pitt shines: his charicatured good ol' boy from the American south never falters. Chris Waltz's ""Jew Hunter"" evil SS man should place in Oscar contention for Best Supporting actor, he's excellent. The entire cast is very very good. Taratino's writing (if he in fact is the writer... Tarantino has used others' talent previously and claimed it as his own) sparkles. Laurent is also most believable as the French cinema owner with an ax to grind.<br/><br/>I only wish Tarantino was more grounded as a human being. His puerile fantasy could easily have been a more credible movie. What he has produced is art, but it is not art rendered by a mature artist with polished composition. My complaint is his inability to create anything with serious depth. His movie works on many levels but fails totally on one in particular: credibility. <br/><br/>Damn shame, that. Work this good deserves to be taken to that next level. And even though Tarantino will disavow that his intent is anything more than reveling in movie making and the glorification of cinema, I don't believe him. I don't think he is capable of taking a movie to that missing realism---it is missing in him. <br/><br/>On a personal note, I also believe that QTarantino is incapable of understanding human suffering past an intellectual construct of it. He is so cerebral he studies human cruelty just as a child pulls wings off a fly without any empathic sense of the event. Those who enjoy violence, cruelty, won't get this themselves, but there is strong rationale for making violence hideous since we are already so desensitized to it. Tarantino will himself not understand what I just suggested. I don't think he feels as much he thinks about feelings. He lives in his head, not his heart. Empathy is for Tarantino an abstract concept.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 7.5 . . . . it is in ways much better than that but the storyline left me wishing for more so much so it detracted from my final experience. Tasty with the first mouthful, but a little bland after the final swallow."

"gradyharp","8","2","6","19 December 2009"," Vengeance, Tarantino Style
","INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is a romp that takes a bit of horrendous history and makes an entertaining film about it. For those who admire the strangely off kilter Quentin Tarantino's films, this may just appeal as his best and fanciest production yet. It is a way over the top story about revenge as carefully served out by Jewish American soldiers known as Inglourious Basterds on the Nazis who during the occupation of France sought out and murdered thousands of Jews. This may sound like a grim topic for an entertaining film, but in Tarantino's hands it becomes not only a grisly look at reality but also an at times hilarious parody. <br/><br/>The cast is almost secondary to the story: Brad Pitt as the leader Lt Aldo Raine sports a scarred throat and a somewhat tiresome Tennessee accent but seems to enjoy every grisly moment of his command to have all members of his division gather 100 scalps from the Nazi killers; Denis Menochet provides a sensitive opening as the French father who is hiding Jews (namely one Shosanna Dreyfus- MÃ©lanie Laurent - whose escape from her family's slaughter begins the lead seed for the story ahead), Mike Myers portraying a German parody as only he can, Daniel BrÃ¼hl, Marin Wuttke as a pitch perfect Hitler, B.J. Novak as Pitt's sidekick, Sylvester Groth as Goebbels, etc. But the crowning actor in this film is the amazingly gifted Christoph Waltz as the multilingual, sinister, smarmy, yet elegant Col. Hans Landa who drives this wild tale to its grisly conclusion. <br/><br/>As with all Tarantino films this is not a film for the faint of heart, but it is surprising how entertaining this sprawling story is in his hands. It goes on a bit long and is chocked full of grisly incidents, but it is fine film making. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"janinegirl84","Null","2","6","19 September 2009"," Great collection of scenes.
","I was captivated by the German lead actor. He was sensational. The opening scene set the stage for me and the pacing. The French guy in that scene with him was also great. And the British guy who plays a German spy and gets busted because of his accent and the way he displays three fingers (I thought that was clever) was great, along with the German guy who interrogates them at the bar. I'm a chick and I love seeing female actors and I thought both the spy German actress and the Jewish theater owner actress were awesome. I couldn't decide which one was me (I always relate to the female characters). They were all great and believable and even the smaller roles were good, for example, the guy who was a German soldier and then sided with the basterds, the army hero, Hitler and the guy promoting the who event (sits next to Hitler in the movie theater) were all great. Had a problem with the basterd troop more than anything. Love love love Brad Pitt (super hot), but the rest of the crew (especially his main right hand guy, the guy with the bat who is the bear) was a little on the weak side, it's like he was a not as good actor that someone put in the movie because they were his 'uncle' or something. A tall glass of water so to speak, pretty, but he had a couple of chances to be as good as the actor's in the movie and he fell way way way short. He made me realize I was watching a movie. Again, the acting was just so intense I could have just sat there and watched more and more scenes. I hope that German villain guy wins an award. He deserves it."

","I had really high expectations of this film, and sadly have to state I'm a bit disappointed in it. I've liked most of Tarantino's work, especially Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. <br/><br/>I liked the introduction and the presentation of Landa and Shosanna. Many of the scenes are quite good with well-flowing dialogue. Technically the movie is a masterpiece. <br/><br/>However, there are certain aspects of the film which are not to my liking. I strive to see how Landa should be motivated to change sides and give himself up in the way he does. Also some of the dialogue in my opinion go on for far too long, making me waiting for the action to get going again. This is not a criticism of all the dialogue - much of it is really good, but the flow of the movie as a whole is disrupted. <br/><br/>There are other things which could be said about how Tarantino builds up the world in the film, and how things are not logical within it, but I won't go into details here. All in all this is an entertaining piece, but not what I've come to expect from Tarantino."

Brad's character is interesting and so screams the input from the director as its so like a Tarantino character from another movie. He plays his role well - but sorry its just not that good a role. I was fascinated by the under stories and the roles of the German actress; the German Jewess that survived the massacre... Just like pulp fiction,,, I guess this is what I don't like about this movie its so Tarantino. The comparison is logical as the side stories of pulp were as entertaining as the core story and the contribution all made to the outcome were logical. However this concept does not carry true for this film - the side stories are good but the main ""story"" just does not exist and what is there is weak.<br/><br/>I am not sorry to have spent the time watching it - just glad I didn't pay any money to see it."

","This being what I believe to be Quentin Tarantino's first writing/directing work since the Kill Bill movies my expectations were certainly high for this movie. I was discouraged to read so many mixed reviews so I went into see the movie with an open mind. Overall I enjoyed it. After the second chapter the film slows down and gets pretty boring until the thrilling and violent final chapter really saves the day. Brad Pitt is by far the most entertaining presence in the film but Christoph Waltz really steals the show with his acting performance. I felt there was not enough time devoted to the Basterds themselves and the excitement factor really suffered as a result. All in all though great acting performances and an acceptable amount of action and violence.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino. Pulp Fiction is one of my all time favorite movies and I've loved just about everything he's done. While I enjoyed this film, there were too many slow portions and it was pretty hard to watch for a while until the amazing final chapter.

My question is this-if Marcel locked the auditorium doors, how did Private Zoller get out to go to the projection booth, and how did the two Basterd's get out to get to Hitler's box? If I am remembering this correctly, it is a huge error by Tarantino from a continuity standpoint. Along with reestablishing history (he could have just as easily made the same movie but substituted some high ranking generals or field marshals), and portraying Jewish soldiers as even more blood thirsty and vicious than the Nazis, I found that I wasn't as pleased with this movie as I have been with other QT pictures."
"sethisawesome89","7","2","6","26 August 2009"," The new film by Quentin Tarantino
","Inglourious Basterds is not a war film. Nor is it historical. Inglourious Basterds is a spaghetti western. Nazi-occupied France is no more than a canvas for Tarantino to scribble his colorful stories and characters. Sometimes the results are insultingly simple doodles, but more often than not they form into cathartic assaults of aesthetics coalesced from the director's encyclopedic mind of cinema. History be damned.<br/><br/>Because of this emulation I found the film decidedly more fun than QT's previous efforts. That distinct ""movieness"" is more present than ever, in large part due to a literally film-oriented plot. Cinema is is the mcguffin here, and there were some unsettlingly surreal moments, for me as a viewer, in which the camera paints the characters as audience members themselves.<br/><br/>Though too high-concept and stylized to resonate emotionally, the film left me pondering the deterrence and deception of not only war propaganda, but the figurehead-edness of modern media. During the climax when the film bravely barrages into alternate history (more so than before I mean), consider the alternative; the obvious fabrication is anything but."

","In middle of the second world war in the occupied France an orphan woman, a privates group known as ""basterds"" and an SS officer carry out their objectives so that they will be lead them to a place and an event where they will see their purposes fulfilled. Along the stories it can be appreciated a remarkable work with the usage of different languages on several scenes, unlike some titles developed about similar contexts such as ""Saving the private Ryan"" which is more focused in the characters' development, or the most recent ""1917"" which has a breathtaking photography arrangement. Therefore, is even more recommendable to avoid watching this film with dubbing. Especially, Christoph Waltz did an awe work with his command of the language in the commitments in which his character Officer Hans Landa is immersed. At the same time, the basterds and the woman using the name Emanuelle Mimieux are more motivated by their desire for revenge. In the case of the basterds It can be appreciated how this desire it may degenerate into an excess of cruelty justified in the fact that this could end the war faster. Emanuelle Mimieux is an owner of a cinema finds her opportunity to take revenge for the murder of her family. The events drive all characters to the Emmanuelle's cinema where they can carry out their plans. Looking at the development of events it's pretty quirky how things rarely go as planned.

","""People should either be caressed or crushed. If you do them minor damage they will get their revenge; but if you cripple them there is nothing they can do. If you need to injure someone, do it in such a way that you do not have to fear their vengeance.""
Niccolo Machiavelli<br/><br/>This is in simpler terms the ethos of almost every character of the movie. It is maniacal if not sadist the style of how the characters get their gruesome job done, and is as if their identity depended on it: the Jew Hunter, Aldo the Apache, Little Man, The Bear Jew. Tarantino effectively wrote a movie in which your sadist ways define you. Col Landa was the least infatuated with violence, but nonetheless clinically effective and inquisitively meticulous on his ""detective"" role. There are so many interesting gestures on how Col. Landa navigates a fine line between charisma, sophistication, politeness, and ruthless merciless violence. He is a predator with his prey in his jaw boisterously playing with it with his wordplay.<br/><br/>The movie is not a historical documentary: It is CLEAR fiction gentlemen. Many people are understandably annoyed, angry, enraged? The movies audacity to portray a fictional world where a guerrilla force terrorizes Nazis as retribution for all the atrocities they committed hits a special place in people. We have all at different levels felt at least uncomfortable at the pain and injustice of the suffering of Jews in the holocaust. Tarantino exploits that sentiment and makes you go on an emotional ride that gives you free reign to fantasize on the injustices; you care immediately for the characters.<br/><br/>
The messages are clear on the onset. The Nazis are a relentless, organized, indomitable force that is symbolized by two characters: Colonel Landa and Major Hellstrom. Yes, Adolf Hitler is the leader of the party and is an excellent strategist, but the main focus of the power and extension of the Nazi prowess in the movie are these two characters; they are the main resistance to the Basterds intentions. Conversely, the Basterds and Shosanna are the architects of the sacrificial revenge exerted on the Nazis, and it is irresistible to not cheer and get animated by their success. This is the beauty of this movie that in many of the tense scenes the viewer gets so invested in the survival and success of the basterds that we can't help but justify their actions albeit being gory and borderline sadist.<br/><br/>The fantasy of a guerilla army stopping the genocide of the Nazi party is especially delicious, but an infiltrator that exemplifies all the positive qualities aforementioned in the form of Col. Landa was even more exquisite. Colonel Landa was a detective and a very pragmatic one at that, molding himself depending on who he was talking to, but permanently charismatic and vibrant. The Basterds, despite the opportunity to end the war that Landa provided them, were not satisfied with just letting Landa leave in peace and pleasure. They had to brand him as a person that was not able to escape the conceptual vengeance of their guerilla army. Yes, he betrayed the Nazi Party and rightly so, but, seriously, a man like Colonel Landa is not compatible with the philosophy of the Nazi Party, right?"
"greennada546","6","1","2","16 March 2020"," Disappointing
","Although the cinematic aspects of this film, as shown in the famous 'pub' scene, are undeniably entertains and suspenseful this film in fails to leave a satisfying end.
The characters. The question as to why the Landa let Shosanna escape is left unanswered. The character of Landa is 2nd and best described as evil. Shosanna and Bridget, who could have been characters to sympathize with were killed, while others like Raine survived in places they shouldn't have. It might just be American luck.
The plot, as stated before the suspense that Tarantino creates is pure cinematic gold, but I found myself skipping ahead at the end of the film. Their is really no climax, the two plot lines seems to just end up working out in the end, despite the build up. The main villain, gets a scar? People get killed. I'm not sure how to feel.
Perhaps that's the point. It was entertaining, and didn't really saying anything we didn't already know."

","Not repeating what others have said about this movie, I can only confirm the fact that the movie is great. It's acting and pacing are top notch, making every second of it a joy. Sadly, Tarantino gives himself liberty with the facts and while that doesn't make the movie less appealing and fun, it does make it to have a far less impact on us as the viewers that way. In the other hand, I'm glad that this movie isn't another ""Schindler's List"", but rather just a good WW2 movie that at the end of the day still doesn't take itself too seriously, while being about a serious theme. And that's Tarantino for you, ladies and gentleman. It's not a perfect movie. But sure is a very good one. 8/10 and a warm recommendation! :D"

"b-85674","8","1","2","24 January 2020"," An absolute thrill presented by Quentin Tarantino
","Explosive. Daring. Violent. Thrilling. These are all things that can be used to describe the work of art that is Inglourious Basterds. From the gut-wrenching action scenes to the intense dialogue between the undercover Americans and real Nazi soldiers, the film keeps you at the edge of your seat the entire time. While it might not be Tarantino's masterpiece, it sure does come close, being outshined only by Pulp Fiction.
Inglourious Basterds follows the path of an American Army Unit comprised of Jewish soldiers tasked with eliminating Nazis in both occupied France and Germany during World War II. The men of the unit, comprised of 8 Jewish soldiers, are tasked by their commander Brad Pitt, acting as Lt. Aldo ""The Apache"" Raine, ""Each and every man under my command owes me one hundred Nazi scalps."" The ""Basterds"" are truly a killing force that anyone else around dare to take on.
The antihero to this film comes in the form of Col. Hans Landa, played masterfully by Christoph Waltz. Col. Landa is the so-called ""Jew hunter"", tasked with rounding up all of the Jews still hiding in Nazi-occupied France. The second hero of the movie, apart from the Basterds, is introduced early when Col. Landa murders all of the other Jews in hiding in a small French house, except for Shosanna Dreyfus, played by Melanie Lauren, who solely escapes. She gets her revenge on Col. Landa at the finale of the film, where she is a part of a plan to kill all of the Nazi high command.
One of the most stellar elements of this film comes to light in moments of extreme stress on the heroes: the cinematography. The way that Robert Richardson (lead cinematographer) so eloquently exposes the various emotions that the actors are ""feeling"" is demonstrated in his phenomenal camera work. Even in scenes that are dialogue-driven and not at all action scenes, Richardson focuses on minute details that one might not even notice at first glance but quickly becomes apparent as to why a single detail is of absolute necessity for a scene. For example, in the infamous bar scene, the cover of one of the Basterd's operatives is blown when he uses a slightly different way of signaling ""three"" to the bartender. This minute detail might be unnoticeable if it were in another film, however, Richardson focuses the view of the camera on the real Nazi officer, and his facial emotions are telling enough that he knows the operative has made a mistake and blown his cover. These small details are plentiful throughout the length of the film and absolutely add to the audience's experience of the story.
Now for the less than perfect: the action. While the action is indeed thrilling, for some audience members it may be too much. In a similar war film, also starring Brad Pitt, Fury takes a much less violent approach to the action scenes. The audience still has the same level of adrenaline when there are action scenes in this movie but at the same time, there also is not the ultra-violence that is prevalent in most Tarantino movies. If you are are a Tarantino fan, however, this aspect will be no issue for you, as it bears a similar amount of gore to that of The Hateful Eight, another extremely well-executed Tarantino film.
In finality, Inglourious Basterds is an excellent film that keeps your eyes glued to the screen for the entire runtime. Whether it be in moments of intense dialogue or sharp jumps in an action scene, there is something for all mature movie aficionados in this film. While it does have some downsides, overall, Inglourious Basterds overwhelmingly keeps the audience entertained and is well worth two and a half hours."

"lukem-52760","9","1","2","10 January 2020"," ONE HELL OF AN ENJOYABLE WW2 ADVENTURE BY THE LEGENDARY TARANTINO!!!
","Quentin Tarantino is easily one of the greats movie directors of all time!!!
I consider Tarantino to be one of my top 5 fave directors ever along with my number one John Carpenter.
I've loved Tarantino since his blood soaked debut ""Reservoir Dogs"" rocked the world way back in the 90's & of course loved ""Pulp Fiction"" & his true masterpiece in my opinion the excellent ""Jackie Brown"" & his ""Kill Bill"" flicks were great fun too if abit over the top & absolute loved his work on ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" probably the best Vampire film ever made!!! So yeah Tarantino is great & I'm a big fan.<br/><br/>Now down to his war epic adventure ""Inglourious Basterds"" it's as expected a fantastically well made & beautifully shot movie, the best of the best from an obsessed movie geek behind the camera & his cast is excellent, even though I'm not a ""Brad Pitt"" fan at all & consider him to be one of the most overrated actors in cinema history along with the terrible ""Tom CULT Cruise"", pitt is good in his role as the scarred Lt. Aldo Raine & he's funny often & has a thick hillbilly accent but the guy that stands out to me was the incredible casting of Horror Director ""Eli Roth"" who plays the baseball bat using big ""Jew Beary"" Sgt. Donny Donowitz who is a scene stealer of a role as beats to death deserving Nazi scum, he's great fun & hilarious at times, now the cast is excellent some truly outstanding performances here from the likes of ""Christoph Waltz"" & ""Michael Fassbender"" & ""Diane Kruger"" & ""Melanie Laurent"" all incredible performances.<br/><br/>This is an Awesome piece of Action adventure Thriller & drama set in Nazi occupied France during WW2 & a team of soldiers ""The Basterds"" are sent in behind enemy lines to slaughter & scalp as many Nazi's as possible, there's some Awesome gory scenes & some incredibly intense scenes along with the big pieces of smart & interesting dialogue that Tarantino loves to spill out of his characters!!! It's great entertainment within a work of art piece of filmmaking, Tarantino is a genius!!!
I much preferred this over his ""Kill Bill"" films, it's still gritty & savage but fun & entertaining at the same time with beautiful music.
Another Stone cold CLASSIC from a master of Cinema"

","Inglorious Basterds tells you the story of few Jewish soldiers to end the Nazi era and on the other hand a woman wants to avenge her family's death by Germans. This movie might not be a typical QT flick but still this movie is entertaining, there should be a special mention for Christoph Waltz for the acting where as Brad Pitt is as good as ever. Michael Fassbender could have been used more but Daine Kruger and Mélanie Laurent were amazing, this movie is not for everyone's taste so folks without digging into the history just enjoy this good if not great WW II movie."
"fanofmoststuff","10","1","2","5 December 2018"," A masterpiece that will live on forever.
","Inglourious Basterds is just another masterpeice Quinton Tarantion has brought us. This film is truly amazing and completely redefines what makes a movie ""art"".
Every little detail in this film is polished so well, that it's easy to miss.
Everything from the dialogue to the cinematography, is beautiful.
There are multiple things to appreciate in every single scene.
Yes, this movie is violent. But the fact that it is violent does not stop it from being one of the most incredible movies made. The violence just adds more to the story. It's an important part on why it's so great. There are many extremely violent movie that don't even try because of their excessive action, but this film does an excellent job to portray good violence. Without it, the film wouldn't be the same.
The other thing that holds this movie together is the incredible acting. Every person in every scene always does such a good job. I would mention the first scene and how beautiful it is, but think everyone else has said everything that can be said about it. It is truly amazing.
There are multiple scenes later on that are just as good. They are intense and add depth to the characters and their motivations.
It's funny and exciting, and certainly worth the watch.
If you're not a big fan of gory movies, you should skip this one. You have to be 100% ok with gore if you're gonna watch this.
Just another one of Quinton Tarantino's masterpieces that I will watch again and again!"

And the opening scene is some of the best dialogue I've ever heard, it is stunning, how it keeps reeling me into the world deeper and deeper. Michael Fasbenders performance, though short was good and the score matched the film perfectly. Overall a funny at times, a serious at times and an all around great movie."
"austinfromdahood","9","1","2","20 October 2018"," This movie made my day
","I'm trying to watch more Tarantino nowadays because I want to thoroughly understand his filmmaking style and techniques and I would want to have an opinion on all of his movies. A few days ago, I picked up Inglourious Basterds at the library a few days ago, and I watched it last night by myself because I enjoy doing that and I feel like doing activities alone regain my energy. And I thought Inglourious Basterds was freaking awesome. There are so many good things about it. It is not a perfect movie, but there are so many things to love, and I provides this movie with lots of entertainment for the viewers. I think Tarantino's best skill is his interesting writing. A lot like Christopher Nolan's writing, where it is complex, gripping, and has twist and turns, but Tarantino makes these concepts funny and witty, but for this movie, Tarantino also makes the movie subtly suspenseful from his writing. The best thing about this movie is Tarantino's use of subtle suspense, and the entertaining dialogue as always. The suspense is this movie is not really in your face suspense, it's like in the back of your mind suspense. The scene itself isn't really suspenseful, but there are things happening that can give you a suspenseful vibe. A great example of this is the opening scene and the tavern scene. The dialogue is on point as always in every single Tarantino film, and in this movie, it is especially funny. The acting in this movie is also amazing, just like in every Tarantino film. Brad Pitt is awesome in this movie and his accent is so over the top, I love it. Christoph Waltz won an academy award from this movie as his performance as a german detective, and he is great as his role. The majority of this film is actually spoken in languages other than english, and I found that to be pretty accurate because this movie takes place in Europe. The things that come out of this mouth and the emotions that he shows on his face proves that he can act. There are times where he makes you laugh, and there are times where he makes you afraid of his power and might. This movie takes place during World War 2, and this isn't really a straight up war film. This movie is more like a drama that takes place during a war, but there isn't any soldiers shooting other soldiers in this movie. This movie is also very violent and there are scenes in this movie that made me cringe in disgust. During the second act, it did feel a bit boring at times, and there are scenes that didn't really need to drag as long as it should've, but other than that, I thought this film was great. 9/10"
"bowmanblue","10","1","2","11 October 2018"," Weirdly epic
","Even though I'm a massive fan of Quentin Tarantino's work, I have to admit that he's had a few 'misses' here and there. However, I'm pleased to say that, despite possibly nothing ever reaching the dizzying heights on 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Inglourious Basterds' comes about as close as it can in terms of entertainment value.<br/><br/>Before I watched it, I have to confess not knowing an awful lot about it. The fact that it was a 'Tarantino movie' was enough for me to know that I was going to watch it. All I knew, from the posters mainly, was that it was a World War II film. And, seeing as I do occasionally dip into that genre, I figured it would be Tarantino's take on that particular period in history and that, like most war movies, it would attempt to be 'historically accurate.' How wrong I was.<br/><br/>I'm sure most people know the 'basics' of history surrounding that dark period of 20th Century history and that's all this film relies on. You have the setting, i.e. Nazi-occupied France where fearsome German SS officers ruthlessly hunt down Jews, up against the local resistance and an American platoon dropped behind enemy lines to generally disrupt the occupation. However, don't expect much in the way of 'historical accuracy' after that.<br/><br/>You've probably seen Brad Pitt's face on much of the marketing material surrounding this film. Yes, he's the biggest star so why not promote that fact? And, yes, he gives good value as the leader of the American Nazi-hunting band of brothers. However, what this film never anticipated was how well Christoph Waltz would play Pitt's opposite - the fiendish Colonel Hans Landa. He steals every scene he's in and you'll be hard pressed to find a more terrifying movie villain in recent times. He's right up there with Darth Vadar, Hannibal Lecter and Heath Ledger's Joker. And, even if you don't enjoy anything else about this film, you should watch it just for him.<br/><br/>The 'structure' of 'Inglourious Basterds' is typical Tarantino. It's split into about six (quite long) 'chapters' through the film's two and a half hour runtime. Each of these could almost be a separate story on their own, if it wasn't for the fact that they all link up in the end perfectly. This sort of story-telling may feel a little disjointed at first, but the way they're told makes them impossible to look away. I may go as far as to say that this film could possibly be the 'tensest' ever made. Because the stories all have their individual characters, you never know who may or may not make it out of the chapter alive. The tension in every scene is cranked up to the max and you probably won't guess everything that's to come.<br/><br/>Whether you're a die-hard fan of Tarantino, Brad Pitt, or the genre in general, it doesn't really matter. You only have to enjoy good story-telling, fantastic memorable characters and good films in general to appreciate this (just be warned about the no holes barred violence and bad language, ala every Tarantino movie ever made)."
"AhmedSpielberg99","8","1","2","2 September 2018"," A Classic Tarantino!
","Paying Homages, romanticizing cinema, getting into characters, glorifying violence, setting scenes with a captivating dialogue, and displaying delicious food; all the trademarks Tarantino usually boasts are here twice as much as in all his other movies.<br/><br/>Considering it's not a Western, or a mere Action film, Inglourious Basterds is quite possibly the most entertaining movie Tarantino has ever made so far, and that's due to many reasons. Besides that it has all common tropes and hallmarks you'll find, and throughly enjoy, in his movies, Inglourious Basterds is a very unique entry in the extraordinary director's career. The visual style has never become so remarkably striking in any of other Tarantino's movies.<br/><br/>From the opening moments, this movie proves that Tarantino is not just a master of dialogue, but also a master of suspense, but in his very own manner. Of course, the dialogue is the most powerful aspect in this scene, and in another suspenseful scene halfway through, but what Tarantino displays doubles down on the impact of suspense in a way you've never seen before; In the most Tarantino way he never showed before that his fans, like me, know very well!<br/><br/>The idiosyncratic visual style didn't stop dazzling me with its contribution in suspense, because it simply served at every level. It has a sense of pulp fantasy, and slapstick humor that, oddly, fits with the prevailing tone, maybe because this movie doesn't seem to have a specific tone. And what's more weirder is that the movie never feels inconsistent.<br/><br/>The performances here are plainly phenomenal. Thanks to the stellar cast that includes, Christoph Waltz whose Oscar-wining performance made Hans Landa one of the best movie villains of this century so far, Brad Pitt who is the only reason I had some hope of victory against Landa's cunning, and Mélanie Laurent who played Shosanna, one of the most interesting characters I've seen in any film in a while. There are many questions left unanswered about her character, and that's exactly what makes her character so compelling. Michael Fassbender also delivered a brilliant performance as always, most notably in the famous "" German accent"" scene that was the only great thing in a boring, monotonous Chapter Four that made me feel, for the first time in a Tarantino movie, that the dialogue scenes overstayed their welcome.<br/><br/>Speaking of dialogue scenes, this movie has some of the most iconic lines in amazing dialogue scenes thanks, in large part, to Christoph Waltz scene-stealer appearance. That being said, if there is only one of Tarantino's trademarks that I felt was missing while watching this movie, it would be the riveting, seemingly empty talk in a long scene Tarantino is famous for. Don't get me wrong, I said more than once that this movie has some of the most iconic lines, and some of the most clever dialogues ever put to film, but, as a Tarantino fan, I felt that something is missing in these dialogue scenes, and I found that it's the long talk that explores the character, and delve deeper in his personality and psyche.<br/><br/>Another issue, and this time I mean a real issue, I've with this movie is its ending, its very ending. While it couldn't be more satisfying to watch, I found defeating Hans Landa by fooling him in such easy way is completely absurd, and totally contradicts with all the antagonist's wits and slyness. For me, that was very hard to swallow.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds looks pretty good. As a matter of fact, I think it has the best cinematography among all the other Tarantino films. Mostly because of the nifty classic use of shadows and lights that matches perfectly the setting of the movie. Adding to that, Inglourious Basterds also has a killer soundtrack.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is a maniac, thrill ride that has one of the best cast ensemble ever put to film. It's a rare case when a director's self-indulgence causes more good than harm. <br/><br/>(8.5/10)"

","This is by far one of the most defining movies of 21st century. It remained in my wish list for a long time and finally viewed it. Tarantino has maintained his usual class with long intrigued conversations, shoot out, violence and adding a whole new dimension of revenge and politics. I was not very impressed with kill bill series and expected this to follow suit. But this was magnificent piece of work. The casting is sublime with the stand out performance of Christopher Waltz who deservingly won an Oscar.. Brad Pitt embodies a macho and tough officer ready not only to take down but humiliate the Nazi . Micheal Fassbender did an immaculate British spy and the bar shootout that ensued will go down as one of the best not only for being jaw dropping also for the portrayal if characters. Tarantino has pursued his usual film making style of presenting the events in a non chronological and seemingly unconnected but when you look back he has the innate ability to link them in a manner that satiates your judgement. On the whole this is a visual treat from an illustrious director who used his finesse to pen down and direct on of the most brutal and intense work of a less experimented genre."

Outstanding performances especially Christoph Waltz and Brad Pit, really good Tarantino trademark camera-work by Robert Richardson, really high re watch ability and a perfect buildup to the climax that i will talk about now.

But I think that the character in the ending have a little more luck than i like and that they can kill Hitler just because Hans Landa won't their plan to work is not something i appreciates. I have to say though that it makes Landas character deeper which is important for a higher re watch ability but maybe Tarantino could have make so the call from Landa would have been to late or something like that.

","This film is another success for Tarantino as he builds on a great career. The movie is savagely funny, as Bard Pitt finds ways to make sarcastic remarks in the least opportune moments. The movie truly has it all. It's well directed and visually pleasing. The film stays exciting throughout even though it is on the long side. Christoph Waltz's Hans Landa is brilliant. He is both terrifying and hysterical and manages to blend the two contrasting traits seamlessly. This film is a must watch. Surely its very bloody, as is often the case for Tarantino, but those who allow this to deter them are missing the point. This is a story of how history is told. While the Germans were winning the war, in the film, they created a documentary exaggerating and displaying this. In the end the US was on the winning side, which allows Tarantino to show his ridiculous outcome for the war, which no matter how far from the truth it is, is entertaining nonetheless."
"pmakauloski2312","9","1","2","23 June 2015"," Almost perfection in film, bravo Quentin Tarantino!
","This movie sets the tone from the very first scene. You already get hooked and know this movie will be epic. Christoph Waltz was truly magnificent as the main nemesis, the Nazi general in charge of finding and capturing Jews. He deserves a lot of credit as his character is haunting, yet very intelligently played. Brad Pitt put on a real solid performance as a Jew from the Southern U.S who has rounded up an apache army to go to Germany and kill Nazi's. The lead female character (Melanie Laurent) did a fantastic job in this film, you can really feel the fear of being caught and the courage to avenge her family's deaths the entire film. Tarantino, who i have long been a fan, did it again with Inglorious Basterds. This movie is tough to stop watching after it gets going, it pulls you in and doesn't let go until the end. To avoid any confusion, this isn't really a war movie, there are some grisly scenes of war and violence but for the most part it is not anything like a WW2 film. Trust me, if you don't like war movies or violent movies and you think this movie is not for you, give this movie a try, the real gem of this movie is the tension that consistently builds.<br/><br/>9/10 Similar to Pulp Fiction, this movie was tremendously made, well written and pure entertainment.

","Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a big, bold, audacious war movie that will annoy some, startle others and demonstrate once again that he's the real thing, a director of quixotic delights. <br/><br/>If you see this film as a fiction, its the best world war II film with tatantino touch. The film is so stylish and gripping. All the actors did their best in their roles.<br/><br/>This is an one of the best action films i have ever seen.<br/><br/>Like lot of other movies, you will relish it more the second time. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent are seen with the Tarantino knack of taking and making an character."

","Inglourious Basterds (2009)<br/><br/>Cast : Brad Pitt, Melanie Laurent, Christoph Waltz, Daniel Brülh, Diane Kruger, Jackie Ido, Eli Roth<br/><br/>Director : Quentin Tarantino<br/><br/>Review : Quentin Tarantino brings another masterpiece to the big screen : Inglourious Basterds is an audacious and adrenaline-filled war movie. Above all, the cast is particularly well chosen. The three main characters – The Nazi killer, the Jewish girl and the Jews hunter – are played by Brad Pitt, Melanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz.<br/><br/>The story takes place in Nazi occupied France, early in the beginning of World War 2, when the SS colonel Hans Landa arrives at a farm in the countryside, where he believes the owner is hiding Jews. The owner is indeed hiding a young woman, Shosanna who manages to run away. I appreciated the performance of C. Waltz, who plays beautifully his character: he switches from one state to an other, being either diabolic, ironical or even sadistic and vicious (it is for good reason that he has been awarded an Academy Award and the Best Supporting Actor Award in 2009).<br/><br/>The French Jewish girl –the one who escaped from Landa- manages to obtain a fake ID document and hosts a cinema in the German occupied Paris. A German war hero and movie star falls in love with her and persuades Joseph Goebbels to hold the Premiere of his first movie in Shosanna's cinema. This twist of irony provides the young woman a golden opportunity to seek revenge.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Lt. Aldo Raine, an American Jewish soldier, is the leader of eight men : the Basterds. Their goal is to kill as many Nazis as possible, and Aldo Raine wants each of his boys to bring him back 100 Nazis scalps.<br/><br/>This historical war movie differs from others, mainly because Tarantino mixes both historical events with fiction and humor. Hitler is portrayed in a funny way, he looks ridiculous and he always gets angry and often pounds the tables.<br/><br/>On an other hand, Inglourious Basterds is quite touching, mainly in the very first scene, because of the allusions to the Shoah.<br/><br/>Moreover, this film is very interesting because of the international cast : Brad Pitt is American, Melanie Laurent is French and Christoph Waltz is German, and each of them speaks his mother language, even if they all speak English at a moment or another. Tarantino played the game and has chosen ""local"" actors, and this is remarkable. We can also notice that this film is less violent than previous Tarantino movies, and this is not a bad thing."

"ogasior","5","1","2","10 October 2014"," A film made to glorify Nazi's.
","In my opinion the title is as it reads for the purpose of this film. As any Tarantino film there is about 1 hour of 30 minutes of mostly useless non-plot driven interaction (however it attempts to deliver a point), and then 20-30 minute of action sequences that are over- the-top dramatic. <br/><br/>The point of the film is driven by the scenes that have no action and are entirely dialogue related, but they're not plot related. They attempt to find the essence of each character to the ""depths of their soul and character"". <br/><br/>The point of these scenes in this film was to paint the Nazi's as high standing, well esteemed, high character intellectuals who are extremely decent, yet very harsh or biting, but not ruthless or mentally disturbed/ psychotic. <br/><br/>The film spends the majority of the time on these scenes to show a positive essence of Nazi culture and even make them seem humane when referencing towards black's in not overly harsh undertones, but maintaining racist positions ""the tale of the negro coming to America"" or ""the negro not being competent to use the projector"" are very delicate insults that aren't akin to the perception and ruthless hatred these people would truly have. There are other films which have depicted this more eloquently.. and the majority of Nazi's weren't self-serving intellectuals but simply drones to a higher ordering process.. with no real thought process to what was happening other than carrying out orders. <br/><br/>The film then makes the ""good guy"" characters truly vengeful, angry, murdering assailants who are no better than the Nazi's, and equally ruthless, with their whole point and existence in the film as a plot to retaliate.. including the film sequence where the theater owner has filmed herself in a message broadcast prior to the assault (to make it seem as if this woman had some kind of personal retribution and personal ego involved rather than JUST vengeance). Another time when the female actress plays possum to the man at the bar before back-stabbing him and shooting him when he lowers his gun.. to depict her as a ""snake"". <br/><br/>This is just a film so as long as the ""bad guys"" die they're still the bad guys.. yet you can carry out a separate point or belief system on who the characters are and what they represent separate from the plot. <br/><br/>Typical Tarantino movie... Everyone is a bad guy/ everyone is evil.. and the bad guys are no more or less evil and that's the twist. <br/><br/>I haven't seen Django Unchained.. but knowing Jaime Fox and his personality type I can expect no less BS if I were to see it."
"alindsay-al","9","1","2","25 September 2014"," another fantastic Tarantino film
","I don't think there is much of an argument that Tarantino is one of the greatest and this film is another film on a list of utterly fantastic films. This film is set in world war 2 and sees a Nazi killing American group attempt to destroy the top Nazis. While also a vengeful cinema owner looking for revenge against Nazi colonel Hans lander. Brad Pitt is the leader of the group of inglourious basterds and this is one of his best roles he combines the toughness and comedic values to create a very good lead. The rest of the cast is great as well with christophe waltz as Hans lander aka the Jew hunter was just as good as Pitt. His mix of cunning and viciousness created a top quality villain. Everybody else also does a great job the woman who plays the cinema owner does a good job, also even though brief Michael fassbender is really good in his role. The rest of the basterds do a good job as well even though their roles aren't massive. The weakest point of the film is its story while by the end of the film it is okay and the dual stories have a good climax, but the journey is not really that good and their is just a few parts to each story that are a bit pointless. Just like the majority of Tarantino films the script is superb with all dialogue hitting its que and really being the best part if the film. The style of Tarantino films is also well documented and this is no different with the style of this film being fantastic with the world war 2 setting helping. Overall this is a fantastic film that should come as no surprise thanks to the director."
"RossRivero99","10","1","2","25 June 2014"," A Tarantino masterpiece
","Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds is a masterful WWII fantasy about a man who creates a team to kill every Nazi that comes in their way, that man is Lt. Aldo Raine (played by Brad Pitt). Even though this was a very entertaining movie, before I watched it I thought it was unlike Quentin Tarantino to make a WWII period piece. Brad Pitt gives one of his best performances of his career, and including Christoph Waltz who won an Oscar for his brilliant performance in this film as Nazi Colonel Hans Landa. The dialogue in this movie looks so realistic as did in his 1992 directorial debut Reservoir Dogs. Sometimes I think that Tarantino's movies are more violent than some Scorsese movies. Not only I think that it is one of 2009's best films, I also think it goes on a par with some of the best military movies ever made."
"pilotridge101","10","1","2","5 February 2014"," The Avengers of WWII
","Inglourious Basterds is one of Quentin Tarantino's finest films. Of course its writing is superb as always. Its acting is great and its storyline is very original. In the trailer of the film it makes it seem as if its chalk full of violence. But in reality it is not that violent. I mean its not chalk full of it but when there is violence its BAD! From cameo appearances from B.J. Novak (The Office) to Rod Taylor (The Birds)it adds an element only Quentin could create. Its storyline is so crazy that it seems that it could almost be true. It has a blend of comedy and violence and of course dialogue all of which you should expect from a Tarantino movie. I think that The Basterds will stay in the minds of anyone who watch's it from Brad Pitts accent to the fear caused by Christophe Waltz."
"J_Charles","Null","1","2","29 January 2014"," overrated glorification of violence in WWII
","World War II was a horrible episode in history that lasted 6 years and took countless lives away all for the sake of hatred, greed, and tyrannical madness. <br/><br/>And out of this springs Tarantino's movie about revenge, killing, and trying to find a way to kill as many Nazis on screen as you can. As with most Tarantino films the violence is over-the-top, outrageous, bloody, and definitely excessive. He makes a point with a sledgehammer when a tap would do. <br/><br/>His scenes are also characteristically Tarantino. He has long stretches of dialog that seemingly are headed nowhere. But eventually his characters start getting closer to ""the point"" and then the tension builds, makes the viewer want to know what's going to happen next. And then they start meandering again. And suddenly the scene's final climax will explode across the screen in a trail of blood and guts.<br/><br/>as far as Tarantino films go I'd put this below his most famous works. In fact I'm perplexed as to how it got so many academy award nominations. I'll definitely agree that Christoph Waltz's performance was enthralling and Oscar worthy but the film as a whole, just too much excess in a setting that required a more sober touch. <br/><br/>6/10"
"calinn_g","5","1","2","11 December 2013"," If you disregard history... then it's historically accurate
","Pretty typical QT stuff, lots of action, lots of shooting, bloody scenes, snuff deaths. In fact, i would say it's too QT typical actually.<br/><br/>I enjoyed most of Tarantino's hits so far, i love overreacted action combined with smart-ish dialogues and situations at times, i'm just that kind of a guy. The man's created a niche for himself and he made it almost an industry, you got to give him that - when you see a Tarantino movie, you know it's a Tarantino movie, even without the credits. But i wouldn't go as far as calling him the most brilliant director of our times or even a legend of directing, as his more hardcore fans are always tempted to do (and do it most of the times). He's good, no doubt about it.<br/><br/>However, i'm of the opinion that a great director is one that does not repeat himself over and over again (even if he repeats himself pretty good). It gets boring, knowing what to expect (in general lines of course) before each film and more so, to be right in your expectations every time. QT, although producing what taken separately can definitely be called great movies, didn't evolve. He didn't adapt. He didn't change. He didn't experiment. He didn't improve.<br/><br/>That's why even before watching this movie i had that feeling that i would not be very excited with it anyway and i was right. I didn't like it much because as i said, i've seen it before so many times. And i didn't like it because when i watch a movie involving historical characters and situations, i expect it to be accurate too. I accept that the particularities of that moment in history may be a fruit of fantasy, i accept invented episodes of real history figures, but i expect that at the end of it all, the film as a whole will respect history. Inglorious Basterds obviously doesn't. Hitler and the creme of the third Reich didn't die in a plot in a parisian cinema, nor did the war end with their deaths. That's rubbish, why couldn't QT just invent some ""very important members of the German Reich"" and make them die in Paris in a burning theater? That would've been forgivable, more than forgivable, it would have been plausible and combined with the overall high entertainment factor of the movie, it would have made a pretty damn good blockbuster.<br/><br/>So, without any further comments, i'll give it a 5/10 and say that if i didn't accept the surplus of fantasy in ""Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter"", there's no way i can accept in this movie just for the sake of Quentin Tarantino."

","If it hasn't been obvious over the last couple of years, Tarantino makes good movies, but he is definitely not shy to show blood and recently is as if he has been pushing the boundaries and tying to see how brutal he can be in his films. Still this is a great film with excellent acting and exceptional technical execution. And I enjoyed the comic relief very much. The film is about a German solderer who is send out to hunt the Jews that have been hiding, later on some of the Jews who has fled to the United States of America (USA) decides to go back and take their revenge on the Nazi's. They then start hunting the hunters. That is then where the become known as the Inglorious Bastards by the German soldiers. There is also a Jewish girl who fled and got herself a new identity who is running a film theater, when the soldier who hunted her and killed her family decides to hold a big Nazi event at her theater she decides to burn down the theater with all the Nazis in it."

Yet it's not really a feel-good movie like ""The Dirty Dozen"" because the smarmy, sadistic SS Colonel Hans Landa never receives his due.<br/><br/>Tarantino seldom feels the need to exercise restraint but here, at least, the killing scenes are relatively few. He has also refrained from including vampires, werewolves, and zombies.<br/><br/>I can't fault the acting (although Pitt appeared uncomfortable with his southern accent), the music, the costumes, or the cinematography, but there is nothing here to set it above other films."

Movie tickets aren't cheap, the audience deserve better music than QT's record collection.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was totally unwatchable, he got the most ridiculous southern accent I've ever heard. When you're watching a scene with Waltz, it felt like a serious ww2 movie, every time Brad Pitt's character popped up on screen, I felt maybe it's time for the loo.<br/><br/>Everyone in the bastards squad was so badly written and they goofed around like kids who's played too much video games, it's embarrassing to watch. <br/><br/>Waltz was excellent,August Dielh was very good too, even Diane Kruger was decent. I don't understand why QT could get German actors who speak impeccable English and french, and British actors who speak perfect German and french, yet failed to cast an American actor who can pull off a southern accent."
"Kubris","9","1","2","26 September 2012"," An unapologetic, **** you look at World War II
","This is a great film, and the finest example of the world through Quentin Tarantino's eyes. Taking an alternate perspective of WWII, it primarily follows Jewish Americans brutally killing Nazis. Take that in! There are other plots too, including a stellar opening segment and a theater owner's vendetta. It's tense, badass, classy and barbaric all in one package.<br/><br/>A key factor in this film's enjoyment: receive it as a drama. When I first saw it, I expected a light film heavy on bro action, almost comedic. I can thank the bizarre advertising, slogans and title for that. I was disappointed by the film. On my second time I figured it out and enjoyed it, and now on the third viewing I got to truly appreciate the film.<br/><br/>The five story chunks are all captivating, switching up enough to feel fresh. Being a Tarantino film, the script is a 10. Everything that is said is interesting, witty and natural. The pace fluctuates from a simple briefing to a suspenseful standoff and back again, but every scene is captivating- magnetic.<br/><br/>Another plus of seeing a Tarantino film is that the characters are gems, performed by all to perfection. Waltz's Landa is amazing and terrible to behold, a contained psychopath. The Basterds are all slick fellows, especially Donny. In particular though I want to mention Fassbender's Hicox as a charming fellow who I wish had more screen time, Mr. LaPadite (Denis Menochet), the dairy farmer, and Til Schweiger's Stiglitz- the most memorable single shot in the film for me is him, in a flurry of activity, stabbing that Nazi in the head- somehow. <br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is a good show: entertaining, gripping and definitely not mindless. Did I take a life changing message away from it? No, but I do hate them Nazis. I feel that the violence, though a Tarantino staple, is a bit gruesome, but that's just me. The climax is outstanding. Let's rewrite our own history. A very bold film. 8.8/10"

About half way through you give up predicting the way the film will go as you got it wrong a few times already. Some reviews have said it is patchy because of the changes in direction but I believe the twists make the film better. When watching the film I thought it was a mistake to have real life characters involved as we all know how Hitler etc died. But I admit the weight of real life characters made the story stronger and built the tension. A great film when watched for the first time, but I think when you know the twists the film is a lot weaker, not one for the DVD collection."

The basic plot has been reviewed by dozens of reviewers before me, so I'll not bother to wear my fingers out typing it again. I think that the best sequence in the film is the somewhat long one in the bar when the SS officer joins the commandos. You just know that ""it's"" going to hit the fan any minute. It was drawn out just long enough to generate real tension yet not too long that the film drags. However, my favorite part was actually near the end, when the cooperative German officer gets his ""punishment"". Poetic, I'd call it.

","I usually spend time reviewing films that I really enjoyed but I feel this film deserves a review because it had some memorable scenes in it. Too bad there were more bad scenes than good ones, but overall a very watchable film and even worth a buy.<br/><br/>The film starts off brilliantly, Chapter 1 had some of the finest acting ever, coupled with Morricone melodies to spice up tension. Waltz and Jackson were great and the movie felt serious. After the 1st chapter it turned into a comedy, maybe to take away the shock of the gore in the film, which was just unnecessary. Tarantino should forget about the blood and violence sometimes, he goes overboard with it and ruins the great writing and tense dialogue. Some actors were serious, while some were comedic.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was the latter, he just felt out of place in this film. I loved Kruger's performance, and of course Waltz was great! See this film just for his scenes, he could win an Oscar. The character's had personality, but you really never care for these characters at the same time. Like all Tarantino films, the plot isn't anything too complex. There are no plot twists except for the usual cohesion of his many chapters at the film's climax.<br/><br/>Finally, the Directing, which is just like the film. Brilliant at times, bad at times. Old School and New School mixed together. Other than the horrible action scenes at the end, most of the action was good, squibs galore, but good...just campy at times. One thing I love about Tarantino is that he knows how to shoot a long, long scene, with one camera, and from one angle. His dialogue and tension are his strengths, while his plots and character's usually remain shallow.<br/><br/>I rate it a 6/10 for it's decent writing and directing.

Tarantino is once again a marvelous director, and Brad Pitt delivers an excellent, memorable performance something we'd expect from one of the best paid actors of the moment. But is Christoph Waltz who literally steals the show. With an amazing charisma he portraits some of the most intriguing Nazi characters of all times. Pitt & Tarantino are just some tools that Waltz use to amaze you again and again, until you wait impatient to see him one more time.<br/><br/>Waltz character, created by Tarantino and powered by Pitt's antagonism, is an instant classic. There is power, there is a subtle flavor, and there are crisp details that Waltz makes you hard to forget.<br/><br/>And here is where the good things end.<br/><br/>The storyline is at most, stupid. There is no fictional story, there is no real story - there is Tarantino story. That makes you wonder why you ever bother with this movie. Oh, yes: for Waltz. And maybe Pitt, but you expect this from him. This movie is like a BMW that you heard so much about it and you buy it. True, a nice car. Black, all details well finished. Cool. That is Pitt.

Except that you found an amazing sound system in the BMW that you are thrilled to use and you brought in your iPod with 30GB of music just to listen to the tunes in such a new way. That is Waltz.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is a huge disappointment. It has no beginning, no middle and no end. There is no plot, and I will really ask my 6y old neighbor's daughter to write some better story and she will. In fact, there is no 6y old kid that couldn't come up with something more interesting than this.<br/><br/>If you really think that I am wrong, just ask yourself if that would be the first Tarantino movie, would be he so huge? Definitely not. Waltz, on the other hand, he will.<br/><br/>On the total, the movie is a disappointment: you cannot bring Pitt in and sign it Tarantino and go along with a friendly warning. You must issue a ticket here. Stop these stupid ideas, bring on real interesting scenarios and attract amazing actors as you did.<br/><br/>I cannot give it more than a 4/10, even if its about good Jews and their war persecution."

""Inglourious Basterds"" is nothing more than propaganda aimed at conditioning non-jewish people to accept that they're supposedly guilty of unverifiable crimes, and therefore that they deserve to be genocided in the most brutal way possible. Murdering various National Socialists AFTER THE WAR only builds to the list of crimes that people are discovering.<br/><br/>Why are there no movies about serving justice towards the mostly jewish/communist barbarians who committed genocides like the Holodomor in Ukraine (about 10 million White Christians starved to death and/or sadistically killed in various ways). Why do hollywood producers not bring to light the near 70 million innocent victims of the communist USSR? Are some lives more valuable to these producers than others? These double standards are quite telling. Hopefully, this film will be used one day to light a trash heap."

","I saw Inglourious Basterds on Sunday, and after seeing several negative reviews I wasn't really sure what to expect.<br/><br/>Quite simply put, this film is incredible.<br/><br/>The casting is fantastic, the dialogue is as sharp as you would expect from Tarantino and the plot is superb.<br/><br/>There is the usual mix of suspense and humour, with a liberal serving of violence as well.<br/><br/>I have seen some complaints about there being too much dialogue, but I felt that Tarantino was actually a bit more reserved than usual, and seems to have resisted filling scenes with 'pointless' dialogue. For example, I fast-forwarded through several 'talking' scenes of Death Proof without losing any of the plot, but I wouldn't dream of skipping any scenes of Basterds when it comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>My only complaint would be the casting of Mike Myers. Simply because his British accent reminded me too much of Austin Powers, and he seemed to be concentrating so hard on his accent that the delivery of his lines was poor. I think he was an unnecessary addition to the cast, and any number of British actors could have played the part better.<br/><br/>I think the top performance has to go to Christoph Waltz as Hans Landa, with Melanie Laurent coming a close second as Shosanna.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt as Aldo Raine is comically brilliant and, personally, I would have liked to see more of him. Also, his Italian accent is pure genius!<br/><br/>Basically, I can't recommend this film highly enough. No, it's not remotely historically accurate, but it doesn't need to be. And yes, potentially the title Inglourious Basterds is misleading since the plot doesn't really centre around the Basterds at all (perhaps just Tarantino's desire for a controversial title). However, it is brilliantly written, brilliantly acted (Mike Myers aside) and brilliantly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Go and see it and make up your own mind, you won't regret it."

","Not at all what the trailers suggest, Basterds is still amazingly fun and interesting. Less a movie and more an experience, the film will either amaze or disappoint (there seems to be no in between). Fans of Tarantino's other movies will more than likely enjoy it, or at least appreciate the style, originality, and violence that is at times so intense it's hilarious. With the majority of the film being in German and French (requiring English subtitles), you will hear many moviegoers throwing around the words ""boring"" and ""fucking terrible"", but I found that after about ten minutes I no longer realized I was both watching and reading a movie simultaneously. There are some memorable characters in Basterds, Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) being utterly terrifying and Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) being bad ass and hilarious. Some scenes of dialogue exceed 20 minutes, but aren't nearly as boring as that would lead you to believe. Tarantino creates brilliant scenes that feel like a rubber band being stretched until they finally snap. The long scenes create an extremely intense atmosphere that make the climaxes that much more satisfying. After seeing what was possibly the best last half hour of any movie in the past 5 years, I wanted to immediately sneak into the next showing to enjoy the 2.5 hour epic (which actually flies by and rarely feels slow) that is Inglorious Basterds."
"Apemangalore","10","3","12","22 August 2009"," Tarantino's best film since Pulp Fiction
","As an enormous fan of Quentin Tarantino's work (with Pulp Fiction, specifically, being my second favorite movie of all time), I'd been looking forward to Inglourious Basterds quite a bit. Somewhat apprehensive, given the premise of the film, but for the most part, I went in expecting to have a pretty good time. Now, as the end credits started to roll, all I could say was ""Damn."" <br/><br/>First of all, it should be noted that the trailers for Basterds are very misleading. Watching them, I expected an almost action comedy primarily about this group of soldiers going around, killing Nazis. And while there is some of that (along with its fair share of hilarious moments), that really isn't the focus of the movie. In fact, the Basterds themselves only take up about a quarter of the film (if not less). The real heart of this movie lies in Shosanna, as she's virtually the only character who's given any backstory. As a result, about 80% of the dialogue in this movie is subtitled. With that being said, it all plays out extraordinarily well, and I greatly respect Tarantino's choice to include said subtitles. Also, the more that I think about it, the more I appreciate the less-than-expected number of brutal moments in this film. They're so sudden, so few and far between, that when they actually do happen, you find them all the more enjoyable.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is superb all across the board. With his thick Tennessee accent, Brad Pitt is gut-bustingly hilarious as Aldo Raine, and contrary to what post people have said, I highly enjoyed Eli Roth's portrayal of Raine's fellow Basterd, Donny. MÃ©lanie Laurent is surprisingly exceptional as Shosanna, delivering that sense of both innocence and toughness. Even Mike Myers, who I wrote off as an actor years ago, is solid during his cameo appearance. However, the real show-stealer here is Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa. On top of being able to act well in several different languages, he manages to do what almost every great, classic villain manages to do, and that is to accomplish being both charming and menacing at once. Personally, I believe that he should, at the very least, get an Oscar nomination for his performance.<br/><br/>The movie is extremely dialogue-heavy, and again, without much action to speak of. Also, the majority of characters came across as somewhat cartoonish to me (especially Pitt's). So, I can understand why this film may not be for everybody, and even partially why some may feel ""cheated"", given the way in which it was advertised. That being said, I thought that the dialogue was heated and clever, and found that the ""cartoonishness"" of the characters added to the film's needed sense of humor.<br/><br/>For me to give a film a perfect score is rare enough as it is, but this is the first time I've given one to two films in a row (having seen District 9 last weekend). It's been a damn good year for films so far, with Coraline, Up, and the aforementioned District 9 ranking somewhere in my all-time Top 15. And while I'll have to see it a few more times to say for sure, Inglourious Basterds is perhaps my fifth favorite movie of all time. It's definitely tied with Neill Blomkamp's initial film as my favorite movie of the year so far. Aside from last year's Bolt, never has a movie surpassed my expectations by such a great amount. Go see it, right now."
"ozymandiaskingofkings","10","3","12","22 August 2009"," Tarantino's best film to date!
","Say what you will about Quentin Tarantino as a filmmaker, you have to admit that he is never less than surprising. After the boring, self-indulgent tedium of ""Death Proof"", one of the least thrilling thrillers ever made, and the entertaining but woefully uneven ""Kill Bill"", I had pretty much completely written off Tarantino as a filmmaker whose ego had got the better of him, and who just kept pumping out the same old nonsense. With ""Inglourious Basterds"", however, Tarantino has totally redeemed himself, and has produced what is possibly his finest film to date.<br/><br/>It has been a long time coming. IB, originally pitched as a ""Where Eagles Dare"" style boys-own picture, has been predicted more times than the end of the world and looked for some time to be stuck in development hell, so it is surprising that now that film has finally emerged that it is well worth waiting for, and is a much more focused, deeper and more disciplined film than any he has produced since ""Pulp Fiction"", all the while retaining the same dark wit and postmodern playfulness that has become his trademark.<br/><br/>The film is, however, far from the simple action movie that it was originally pitched as, the different chapters containing a myriad of different themes, tones and even sub-genres, creating in essence a meta-analysis of not only the war, but the war film genre itself. In fact, there are effectively three different parts to the film which come together at the end: 1) the ""Dirty Dozen"" style story of the Basterds, a group of American GIs tasked with killing Nazis to put fear into them, 2) A ""Valkyrie"" style resistance story and 3) a story of a Jewish farm girl seeking vengeance for the death of her parents.<br/><br/>Of these it is the last one, the story of Melanie Laurent's Shosanna, that is central to the film, as all 3 plot strands come to a head in her cinema at the premier of a new Nazi propaganda film. This section, and that featuring the resistance, are most similar in terms of style and tone to Verhoevan's excellent ""Black Book"", bombastic while at the same time gripping and, in parts, moving.<br/><br/>The structure, with separate chapters loosely interlinked is familiar from Tarantino's previous films, yet in this one are arranged chronologically, with a more straightforward sense of narrative. The chapters differ somewhat, each has its own style, from the slow, tense opening in which the Nazi antagonist Col Landa interrogates a farmer, to the wordy Reservoir Dogs style resistance section, before coming together for an action packed finale. Its on the whole a more serious film than his previous work, but is shot through with black comedy and trademark playfulness (look out for Hugo Stiglitz, a character greeted with a burst of electric guitar and a massively OTT flashback).<br/><br/>The performances are all excellent, though the greatest acclaim must go to Christoph Waltz as charming but evil Nazi Landa, surely this years standout villain and a sure-thing for an Oscar. Also fantastic are Laurent, who is utterly mesmerising as Shosanna, and Michael Fassbender as the British spy caught out in the middle section.<br/><br/>The same stylistic flourishes found in all Tarantino films, such as eccentric characters and idiosyncratic music, are still present, though seem far more appropriate here than ever before. His use of David Bowie in one of the later scenes is truly stunning.<br/><br/>Now, a brief word of warning. This isn't a piece of history, it is a work of absolute fiction, a fairy tale with a wartime setting, and as such should be regarded with a degree of open mindedness. Those wanting to see the next ""Saving Pt Ryan"" shall be disappointed. However, those wanting to be entertained and willing to approach this as a work of fiction, will find a film that is gripping, funny and thrilling in equal measure. Tarantino has made a war movie that practically blows the genre apart at the seams. And it is utterly fantastic."

","I have read somewhere that Quentin Tarantino worked on this film since 2001. Well I now see why. This is by far one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. He stated that he was planning for this to be his greatest movie yet, surpassing his, IMDb #5, Pulp Fiction. And so he did. Once again he uses his famed time shifting story line. This movie is full to the brim with violence, history, and on top of all, comedy. Brad Pitt and his Jewish-American comrades steal the scenes with their hilarious language, accents, and flashbacks. This film will have you literally on the ground gasping for air, as you try to stop your laughter. Unlike other movies, this one has rather long setups for action scenes, but please don't take that the wrong way! The time used in the setup scenes does not go to waste. Each setup leads to a rather climactic scene. The history in the film is remarkably accurate with only one noted discrepancy, and even it is negligible. Please take my word for it and see the movie. It is absolutely incredible. Unlike the Basterds, this movie is glorious. Quentin Tarantino is considered to be one of the greatest directors/writers of all time, along side, Spielberg and Scorsese. If anything, this is why. See the movie people, it's freaking awesome!"
"main-38","10","3","12","21 August 2009"," 10 Scalped Nazis out of 10!
","This movie was absolutely insane. I am almost speechless and I do not know where to begin. 'Inglorious Basterds' is going to get talked down for some many reasons. It is inaccurate, it is low and it is messy. I remember seeing the trailer and envisioning effigies of Quentin Tarantino being strung up in Middle American towns and burned and human chains comprised of ticked off Germans blocking people from seeing this movie at theaters across the world. No such thing happened and it was PACKED when I saw it just a few hours ago.<br/><br/>I was apprehensive at first. When Tarantino directs a movie it is going to rely heavily on its dialog. The visual effects, blood and gore and basically everything about the film is just after effect. I do not think war movie when I think of Mr. Tarantino. His movies have a feel, much like George Lucas or Wes Anderson. I thought about recent disappointing revamps like 'Terminator Salvation', or if you really want to go back, 'Live Free or Die Hard'. These movies did not feel like the originals and it was as if they were entirely different movies with just the same, or similar name just tacked on and packaged as an addition.<br/><br/>The 'Basterds' was not the same deal. Although not a sequel or prequel to any other movies it still has a similar feel to Taratino's other, more palatable works. This was a Tarantino movie, only instead of being set in an LA Warehouse, Jack Rabbit Slim's, or a Drug Dealer's living room it was set in Nazi Occupied France. All of the typical characterizations were there, as was the wit ridden dialog and to top it all off was a healthy dosage of explosions, violence and gun play. This violence was not as artistic as in 'Kill Bill'. But, IMO it was way more satisfying. There is nothing like the sound of a wooden baseball bat connecting with a Nazi officer's skull! There are going to be surprises and a shameless laughter. During the movie a lot of my fellow patrons applauded. Usually this is something I frown upon- I did pay $10.25 to see the thing, I do not need your applause every 10 minutes- but there are just some instances that are worth it. Tarantino has not just created a film here, he has created a good time. This is imagination at its best. Historical Fiction is really underrated and it is done to perfection.<br/><br/>To the haters out there(especially the person who had a problem with the film's weird spelling of the word bastard- give me a break!): SUCK IT UP! Who cares if it's politically incorrect? This is a work of fiction and it does not reflect the actual German people at all. At best its a parody and an homage to the old war flicks where American hero's impale Hitler with a pole with an American Flag on the end. This is no more harmful than Bugs Bunny dressing like a girl and giving Hitler/ Tojo a big wet kiss then giving him a gift wrapped bomb with an obviously lit fuse. You people are a real pain. If you find a problem with this movie you are probably the person who shows up to a party and complains that there are not enough places to sit down.<br/><br/>I am going to see this again as soon as I can! (note: I do respect people's opinions. I was just taking my time to be a jerk. I really enjoyed this movie but I will acknowledge the fact that other people may not have had the same experience and that is reasonable!)"
"DonFishies","8","3","12","21 August 2009"," A fantastical, imperfect, unapologetic, and totally Tarantino period piece
","Inglourious Basterds really defies description. Like other films by Quentin Tarantino, the film revolves around a plethora of characters. There's the titular Basterds, a Jewish American gang of soldiers lead by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who administer their own brand of justice to the Nazis they cross behind enemy lines. It also concerns Shoshanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), a Jewish survivor hiding out in Paris as a theatre owner. And at the same time, the film mainly revolves around Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), nicknamed ""The Jew Hunter"" for his habit of rooting out the Jewish people in France for the S.S.<br/><br/>Although Kill Bill was quite the bloody epic, Inglourious Basterds is his first true epic film in the sense of grandeur and scale. It is a fantastical period piece, combining his trademark dark humour, his great use of music, his adoration for homage and his love for blood soaked visuals. Make no mistake: this film is just as violent as every other film he has worked on. Look no further than when the ""Bear Jew"" Sgt. Donnie Donowitz (Eli Roth) makes good on a promise to kill a German official with a baseball bat to know exactly what I mean. From the moment the film opens up, Tarantino truly makes us believe we are seeing his vision of Nazi-occupied France in the early 1940s. When we are not listening to long conversations or watching people get killed in ways only Tarantino could have imagined, you may find it hard to believe that the film is a Tarantino one. The cinematography, set and costume design is just so well done that it almost feels like an epic in the proper sense of things.<br/><br/>But being a Tarantino movie, he turns that epic convention on its head and creates his most original work in years. While the man has always been of a different cut than most American filmmakers, Inglourious Basterds is unapologetically different from any other World War II film ever made. For one thing, Germans actually speak German, and the French speak French. Subtitles are almost non-existent in most war movies, and here they are on display for more than half the movie. Sure, there are a few historical inaccuracies, but the film relies on a style all its own. In more than a few instances, it is a historical epic that aims to tell the story of a large group of individuals in World War II era France. But then it also combines in the wit and bravura of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs to become something altogether different. It comes off as pure fantasy in some cases, but in others, it works to make it infinitely more watchable. I find myself hard pressed to think of a war film that ever looked or felt anything like this one did.<br/><br/>What brings the film down, and has always been a problem for Tarantino, is how winded some of the conversations get. Going in, you know that the film will be a very talkative picture, but some scenes (especially one lengthy scene in a village bar) just go on far too long for their own good. He got the formula down perfectly in Pulp Fiction, but ever since, has had a lot of trouble with brevity in his speeches. Inglourious Basterds is no different, and sadly, drag the film out a bit longer than it should be. This film could have been a lean and mean epic that runs just over two hours; it does not need to feel like it is thirty minutes short of three. The exchanges are always entertaining, but you can easily spot where some cuts could have been made. I loved the dramatic tension in suspense in almost all of these scenes (especially the opening scene introducing us to Landa), but a bit of a chop here and there could have only made them look greater.<br/><br/>What is immediately more impressive are the characters. Having such a diverse and large cast does lead to some characters being nowhere near as developed as others, but that seems to be okay for some.<br/><br/>Pitt is quite good as Raine, bringing what is essentially a tailor-made Tarantino bad ass to life in a way he cannot always pull off. He felt like a more subdued version of Tyler Durdan, albeit a whole lot more sarcastic. He spends the majority of the film as an enigma, ordering the Basterds around but from an arm's length away. Roth on the other hand, dives headfirst into what is one of the most daft and twisted characters Tarantino has ever created. This is a true headcase, and Roth is clearly perverse enough to make the ""Bear Jew"" work in ways that no one could (especially not Adam Sandler, who supposedly was the original actor up for the role). But sadly, none of the other Basterds really get a chance to shine (although all of them are good nonetheless), and even Pitt and Roth's work is sorely underwritten.<br/><br/>The most fleshed out and most extraordinary work comes from the relatively European-centric Laurent and Waltz. Laurent is both subtle and heartbreaking in her role as a Jew continuing to hide from the Germans. Her work is just as powerful as it is devastating. With the exception of The Bride, she is Tarantino's most fully realized female character. Waltz on the other hand, is simply marvelous. He is the heart of the movie. While he is not as disgustingly evil as Roth, his devilish undertones and intense ""What comes next?"" delivery is as nerve-wracking as it is frightening. His horrific atrocities go mostly unseen, but his eye-opening facial expressions are more than enough.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is flawed, but it is still a great effort on Tarantino's part. He reinvents himself in a way, and shows his maturity as a filmmaker. A touch less talking could have only improved the film.<br/><br/>8/10."
"karlito5","6","3","12","20 August 2009"," Good... but not great.
","The first thing to say about Inglourious Basterds is that it is definitely worth seeing after all for two and half hours it does at least entertain. The problem is in the end you might be left wondering what was the point of it all, Tarantino certainly conjures up some great thrills but to this viewer it all felt like one of those Roger Moore Bond films all flash but no real soul - worth the entry fee but not a lot more besides.<br/><br/>That said the opening is extraordinarily well done (though in a way it handicaps the rest of the film) and Christopher Waltz's performance is truly brilliant but beyond this there is not really anything to mark this film out as memorable even in terms of Tarantino's previous works. Reservoir Dogs will always be cleverer and Pulp Fiction always more entertaining. You cannot deny that as a war film it is different from anything else you might have seen but this alone doesn't necessarily make it all that worthwhile."
"Ramascreen","8","3","12","10 August 2009"," We're in the Nazi-killing business
","--Rama's SCREEN--<br/><br/>To say that this is a Quentin Tarantino masterpiece would be to undermine Pulp Fiction and I don't think this movie is on the same level but it is definitely nothing short of an impressive work by a great filmmaker who still believes in the power of snappy, strong, infectious dialog. It is is both fun and intimidating. Christoph Waltz deserves an Oscar nomination for his supporting role as Hans Landa.<br/><br/>They weren't kidding when they say it's WWII seen through the eyes of Tarantino because this is how WWII would end if he had anything to say about it. The only thing unsatisfying is that it leaves too many unanswered questions. If you've come to find out about the 8 soldiers recruited or if you're not familiar with Tarantino style and you're expecting to see more head-bashing business or graphic bloody violence ala Kill Bill you might get disappointed because even though this movie has those elements, and I kid you not it has those elements, they're not what it solely depends on to capture the audiences' attention. It's got drama, comedy, action, suspense, coolness all around, even Mike Myers is amusing but if you lose track of the important conversations in between, none of that would matter.<br/><br/>Let me make this clear, I enjoy this latest Tarantino work but it's not perfect. I think it could do more to make itself less confusing and easier to follow. Tarantino likes to mess around with time line, you never know when or where or which part of the story he'd take you in each scene and that's cool, I got no problem with that, I'm a big fan of his movies but the thing is this movie comes in chapters, from one to the end chapter, now, if only those chapters didn't come in chronological order because the storyline sure doesn't seem to suggest that.<br/><br/>What you need to keep in mind as you're watching this movie so you won't get too upset about not knowing what's going on is that Lt. Aldo Raine and his soldiers are just complimentary to the actual lead plot which centers on Melanie Laurent's character, Shoshanna Dreyfus, and her plan to burn down her own theater along with all the Nazis including The Jew Hunter. Aldo Raine's men and Shoshanna collide but do not interact. Let's just say that Aldo Raine's plan wouldn't work if Shoshanna didn't have hers first.<br/><br/>Every one of us who've always wished we could go back in time and kill Hitler and his posse with our bare hands would like this new take on WWII because this is no Schindler's List. It's about vengeance and who doesn't like a story of an eye for an eye. But Tarantino doesn't just let you have quickie fun; he takes his time, building up to that brutal yet awesome moment in the end. I'm mostly fascinated with Tarantino's idea of branding the foreheads of Nazis who don't want to be Nazis anymore; this is done so they could live with a reminder of their sins for the rest of their lives. Brilliant idea! If we want to talk editing, set decoration, cinematography, and all the technical aspects, you'll be glad to know that Tarantino has brought back his old crew from the Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction days so guys like Sally Menke and Robert Richardson already know how to realize Tarantino's vision and satisfy his fans who come to theater hoping to watch nothing less than a Tarantino movie.<br/><br/>Just wanna leave some room to emphasize again Christopher Waltz' excellent performance as Col. Hans Landa. The opening scene is one of the best I've seen in the history of cinema, not because of the some extravagant VFX, but because of Waltz' ability to engage you in this long yet interesting, illustration-filled speech, accompanied with a glass of milk and a huge pipe cigar. Every time his presence appears on screen, you can sense the evil radiating from his character. You just never know what he might do in a split second, you don't know how mad he can get, and that not-knowing becomes his weapon, he slowly but surely scares you into giving the information he's looking for, even through a deceiving smile. If the Oscars don't award Waltz the Best Supporting Role statuette, then there's something wrong with the system.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this might qualify as a contender for Oscar's Best Original Screenplay only because it leaves too many unanswered questions especially those about some of the characters' backgrounds. But after watching the whole thing, I understand now why Tarantino has been working on a prequel because a prequel would certainly explain a lot and fill in the missing chapters. Come to think about it, the story could even go on indefinitely. How the team got to France, what happened to the rest of the gang who don't make it to the gala premiere, what's the deal with the whipping and the list goes on. It's obvious that Tarantino only chooses a number of characters to focus on for this one and deal with the rest in another possible installment. Oblige them, Tarantino!<br/><br/>--Rama's SCREEN--"

","A lot of scenes in a lot of Tarentino movies are hard to get through; he loves to film long drawn out dialogue between characters that goes on and on...and on. If you enjoy his movies, and I have enjoyed some of them, you put up with it and just wait it out.<br/><br/>In this movie however, he not only took this method of movie making to the extreme but, just to make it even more tedious, he did most of it in subtitles. Subtitles that move across the screen so quickly that you spend most of your time speed reading instead of watching the damn movie. It was annoying, it was boring, it was not at all entertaining. I think Mr. Tarentino has cashed in on the gravitas he's built up in Hollywood to completely toss aside his inhibitions (and good sense) and let his penchant for endless dialogue run riot. The result is an almost unwatchable film.<br/><br/>Add to that several other drawbacks and this becomes a movie to avoid at all costs. And yes, I know it did good box office, all I'll say to that is there's no accounting for taste. Jackie Chan movies make money too...it doesn't mean they're good.<br/><br/>The two female leads could be twins, did Tarentino do this purposely? I didn't see why it mattered if he did but I did at times confuse one for the other. Also, both came to violent ends. And again, yes I know that Tarentino movies are ultra violent but it's starting to seem that he takes special pleasure in portraying attractive women being killed in gory detail. I've read that he even insisted on choking Diane Kruger himself, to the point of her losing consciousness, to make it look realistic. If anyone has seen Atomic Blond with Charlize Theron there's a scene in that movie in which a female character is strangled to death as well. They didn't go to the extremes Tarentino did in this movie and it actually looks much more realistic and disturbing....it's called acting. Is Sofia Boutella a better actress than Diane Kruger, I doubt it. But Kruger never got the opportunity to demonstrate that. Could it be that Tarentino just wanted to see what it was like to choke a woman? Just like he insisted on spitting in Uma Thurman's face himself in a scene in Kill Bill?<br/><br/>And never mind the total lack of historical accuracy in the film, I didn't expect it to have any, especially after I watched part of (couldn't finish it) Brad Pitt's last WWII entry; Fury. This movie was just one long, boring conversational circle jerk interspersed with moments of over-the-top violence. Which is of course classic Tarentino but this movie took it much too far...or maybe his act is just getting stale.<br/><br/>Don't bother with this movie, it's not worth your time, or the effort expended trying to keep up with the flying subtitles."

They're not even the main characters!<br/><br/>I'm going to make this review short, as I don't even want to waste time talking about this film very much. What I would like to say is THANK GOD that the majority of the top reviews are against this film. It is so stupid I felt embarrassed watching it. It has some of the most pointless settings of any Tarantino film, it has some of the worst characters of any Tarantino film, and considering this film is advertised as a film about a ""Jewish-American Unit,"" they sure don't have a lot screen time (about twenty minutes in action to be precise). <br/><br/>I was told that this was Tarantino's best film since ""Pulp Fiction."" Honestlythis film is a joke. It is so unbelievably stupid it is actually hard to review. I am going to push the envelope and say I'm pretty sure Tarantino throws more racist jokes in his movies than even Michael Bay. Overall, I would say if you have any love of cinema and movies as a whole; do not support this piece of crap. The top reviews (that hate this movie) nail most of the problems, so I would just say read them."

","""Inglourious Basterds"" is in ALL ways a really bad movie! <br/><br/>That it begins quite interesting just makes the betrayal complete towards the viewer in that it quickly turns into a perverted enjoyment of violence.

","Quentin himself considers this film to be his masterpiece, his Magnum Opus. Being written over several years' time, Tarantino manages to create an alternate Universe in which history takes a dramatic opposite turn from the reality we know. <br/><br/>Christoph Waltz's character, Hans Landa, is a creepy dude but he's also a genius. All throughout the movie, whenever he came on screen, I found myself tensing up worried what he was about to do next because just when you thought you knew what was going on, he was right there to smash your reality. <br/><br/>The Basterd's were a fantastic bunch with vibrant personalities that made them so easy to fall in love with. Some may be disgusted with themselves once they find themselves falling in love with these brutish killers. Others, like me, will feel a sense of validation by these brave men who are performing a special duty that takes a great amount of courage. <br/><br/>This truly is Quentin Tarantino's best film to date. Pulp Fiction will forever remain as his trademark, but Inglourious Basterds is what made him a legend."
"son_of_cheese_messiah","1","2","7","9 August 2012"," Tarantino's Spaghetti War-film
","One can imagine Tarantino as a young man admiring Sergio Leone's grand epic style in such classics as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and Once Upon The Time In The West. As an adult, and now with a huge cinematic budget at his disposal does his best to imitate Leone but weakens the effect by introducing cheap and frankly adolescent gimmicks. The opening scene, with its grand outdoor setting prepares the viewer for a better film than follows. This opening, although lifted from finer films, is the high point of the movie since behind Tarantino's drawn out style there is a tension dues to the viewer implicitly knowing that something bad is about to happen.<br/><br/>In the next scene, the Basterds are introduced in a manner which is equally silly and sadistic. On screen graphics and a voice over (used for the only time in the film) are indicators of the director's laziness. Someone should have told him ""Show not tell"" is the basis of good writing.<br/><br/>This film might be seen as a watershed in Tarantino's career inasmuch as his personal mannerisms -rambling scenes and sadistic violence- have come to dominate rather than inform his work. His taste for rather long-winded and shapeless scenes was always mitigated by his ability to write taut energetic dialogue. However since most of the scenes here are in French with subtitles (""pretentious? Moi?"") that attribute of his art is lost and many scenes outstay their welcome. <br/><br/>Nor is the dialogue he writes fit for purpose. He has no sense of an authentic 1940s tone. Having a black guy come on and say ""what the f***"" might pass muster in a contemporary but sounds (or reads rather, since it is subtitled) as wrong in this setting particularly as the character, a black projectionist, utters this in front of his girlfriend, something which would have been considered rather bad form at the time. A small point perhaps, but it does expose a greater deficiency in Tarantino's work. Does Tarantino have a lazy and default default ""black guy speak"" to be used on all occasions? <br/><br/>Instead Tarantino diverts the attention by focusing on unimportant minutiae, something which makes him seem deeper than he really is at least among shallow critics. The camera lingers on pipes being lit and other such details. There is an interminable scene where the heroine is interviewed by the Nazi chief, potentially interesting, but Tarantino detracts from it by focusing on cream. Why? <br/><br/>The poorly chosen music is another deficiency. Like the cream scene, this often detracts rather than enhances the experience. 1940s Germany is not evoked by blues guitar or David Bowie and the scene in which the heroine dies is ruined by inappropriate music. <br/><br/>But possibly the worst sin is the violent reprisals meted out. Here once again Tarantino reveals himself (as do the Cannes audience who gave this a standing ovation) as an overgrown adolescent. The allies behave in a truly barbaric fashion, killing surrendered soldiers in cold blood then scalping them or torturing them, usually by cutting a swastika in the forehead. This is an outrageous slur on allied soldiers."

I am disappointed from Quentin Tarantino; I think he tried to make film as good as Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill but he was not successful.

After denials, a hidden family is given up and one, Shosanna, escapes. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt is Lieutenant Aldo Raine, and his mission is to recruit eight Jewish-American soldiers to sneak behind enemy lines and kill as many Germans as possible.

"minamorkous96","10","2","7","29 November 2011"," Best war movie ever made!
","The 2009 hit film, Iglourious Basterds directed by Quentin Tarantino was a movie of great wonder. Unlike any other WW II films that are more like a documentary, this movie bent the truth. Tarantino believed that this movie will even be better than Dirty Dozen or Guns of Navarone. He spent over 10 years in writing the script and it became a big hit grossing over $320,000,000. The film's plot talks about the adventure of 9 Jewish-Americans that take role in dethroning Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. We all know that Hitler committed suicide, but in this film, the American Basterds become successful in not only dethroning Hitler, but Joseph Goebbels, Martin Bormann, and a numerous amount of Germany's top ranked army-men and police officers.<br/><br/>The plot makes the movie stand out the most.The film starts out as the Nazi's are rummaging through France to find every Jew and try to arrest them. You may think that the movie follows WW II in chronological order, but it doesn't. The plot makes it unique to understand the movie because it doesn't only show the German side of World War II. The movie only gave a small gaze towards the lives of English and also French people. The plot has 3 sub stories, one about SS Colonel Hans Landa aka ""The Jew Hunter"", a ruthless Nazi officer that goes all over Germany and France in search of every Jew. The other sub story talks about a young woman named Shosanna Dreyfus where her family were killed by Landa's raid. The 3rd subset talks about the American Basterds and how they would assault nearby Germans, skin them, kill them, and move on to the next. It all meets in the end how Shosanna premiers the Nazi movie: ""Stolz der Nation"" or ""Nation's Pride"". The basterds get there and their main priority is to kill Hitler and all of the higher ranks while Shosann's main priority is to burn the whole movie theater to the ground as revenge for what they have done to her family. Landa knows about the basterd's presence in the movie theater and arrests the main basterd: First Lieutenant Aldo Raine. Him and Private First Class Utivich get transported to German authority while Landa let's sabotage by the basterds slide by. In the end, Landa betrays the Germans and sides with Raine, but Landa get's cuffed and was knifed a swastika to his head.<br/><br/>These main events helped the plot play a vital role by both allowing the truth and lie to make it the movie spicy. Without having a good plot, the movie would have never been understood and there would be no suspense in any of the scenes. Although other people didn't like this movie because of it's plot and bending the truth of WW II, they understand creativity and putting in white lies that make it both funny and interesting. The elements seem to make sense and the theme also makes perfect sense. Therefore, if they both correlate, then the film is valid and should be understandable by everybody. Instead of just putting drama, fighting, and blood, Tarantino puts comedy in between them to make it look a whole lot better. Therefore, good job Quentin, the movie is well made."
"theholyloofah","10","2","7","10 August 2011"," I Love This Film!
","This film to me, is one of the greatest films of all time. I have two favorite films, that tie for my number one spot, this one being one of them, the other being Platoon. Quentin Tarantino is amazing, simply amazing! Christoph Waltz plays a ""detective"" for the Nazis. He's part of the SS. His character,Colonel Hans Landa, gets under your skin every time he pops up on screen. My stomach had butterflies every time he came on screen, I was afraid of what he was going to do next. Mélanie Laurent, is fantastic as Shoshana. She inspired me, and the part was played so well! Now, ""The Basterds"" are also a group of characters with wonderful actors playing them. Donny Donowitz,aka ""The Bear Jew"" is played by Eli Roth. I LOVED THIS CHARACTER! Actually, calling them ""Characters"" would be an insult. I love Donny. I love Eli Roth! The part is just played so well, especially in the early scene when he beats the German Soldier with the baseball bat. You could feel the hate he had towards the Nazis,and you're afraid to upset him yourself. To feel the wrath of the ""Bear Jew"" would be an awful way to go, and that's exactly why you love him! Now, there are plenty of other characters to talk about. Fredrick Zoller (played by Daniel Brühl)-Stars in Joseph Goebbels film ""Nation's Pride""-Throughout the entire film I wanted to hate him. I really wanted to! He was a Nazi famous for he military exploits. But he seemed like a lost little boy,and you wanted him to snap out of whatever dream world he was in. Joseph Goebbels (played by Sylvester Groth)-In this film you see Joseph Goebbels differently. He's shown as a snarky, immature, brat. He always has a rude remark to say, and of course everyone else laughs. In other Nazi type films you fear Joseph Goebbels, in this one you want him to go sit in the corner with a dunce cap on. He acts like a little child, which is really odd to see. Adolf Hitler( played by Martin Wuttke)-In the film Adolf Hitler is seen as a confused man, to me anyway, paranoid, on edge, snarky. Again, you don't truly fear him, but you think he deserves quite the slap across the face. His laughing pierces your ears and the sight of him makes your eyes roll. He deserves his ending. To keep in mind this film is not based off a true story. You'll see that at the ending. It doesn't show how the war really ended, but it shows how we really wanted it to end. I'm 14 years old, when I grow up I want to be a director myself. Films like this really inspire me, and Quentin Tarantino is an obvious inspiration. This film has a dark humor, which I love. It kept me wide eyed and my stomach in knots, I felt like I was there, I wanted to be part of The Basterds, part of their ""assination plot"" or Shoshana's plot as well. This is one heck of a film. I watch it every time I get. I LOVE IT. (:"

","Inglourious Basterds Rating: B <br/><br/>WARNING: Review may contain minor spoilers but I promise not to include anything you can't already see in the trailers. <br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is a story set in a fictionalized version of World War II involving an attempt by two different parties to kill members of the German command including Adolf Hitler himself. One of the parties is the Basterds, a group of Jewish American soldiers who pride themselves in ""killin' Nazis."" <br/><br/>From the trailers I came into Inglourious Basterds expecting an ultra-violent Nazi-killing action movie with a bit of dark humor, but the movie was not what I thought it would be. It was a much more complex story than that broken up into five different chapters (only 3 of which included the Basterds). Part of me is happy that it was more complex than what I was expecting but the parts with the Basterds, especially Brad Pitt's character were so entertaining that another part of me wishes that it was the focus of the whole movie. Regardless, Quentin Tarantino did a great job with the story and when the credits rolled at the end of the movie and I looked at my watch I couldn't believe that 2 and a half hours had gone by, the writing was just so tight that it didn't give you time to focus on the reality of the passing time. <br/><br/>I never used to be a huge fan of Brad Pitt but recently I've started to like him a lot more, and this movie was a brilliant role for him. His character, the Tenessee-born Lt. Aldo Raine, was absolutely the best part of this movie, his performance was constantly hilarious and there were a few scenes where I was in tears I was laughing so hard. It's not something that the Academy will recognize, but from a comedy standpoint it's one of the best performances I've seen in a long time. <br/><br/>As I mentioned before the pacing of this movie was very good. It had your classic Quentin Tarantino goofiness, but it also had great moments of suspense, and great human drama. The way Tarantino handles his films shows a master at work, whether you like his works or not, they just have such tight direction that the audience is completely removed from their own world without realizing it. <br/><br/>This was not Tarantino's best movie but it was very well done, my only complaints are that I wish there was more focus on the Basterds, which I thought were the best part of the movie, and there's a scene at the end that, although satisfying to see, broke the fourth wall because of it's historical inaccuracy. But I would definitely recommend it, even if you don't like Tarantino, Brad Pitt is just too funny to miss. <br/><br/>SECOND TAKE: A<br/><br/>This movie is brilliant, one of the best of the year definitely. The storytelling, the writing, the direction, the performances, EVERYTHING is spot on. I think the reason a rated it lower before was that I was expecting the whole movie to be in the same vein as the second and fourth chapters and I was disappointed that it was not. However, the Basterds are only part of the brilliance of the movie, and the other chapters are just as fantastic as the ones focusing on the Basterds. Chapter One for instance was an absolute Tour de Force tension building and brilliant writing. This movie is not to be missed."
"sabretoothmovies","9","2","7","5 January 2010"," Glorious Basterds
","Quentin Tarantino is like no other director, and Inglourious Basterds is like no other Word War II. These two statements surmise the entire two and a half hours of Inglourious Basterds, which is an incredible film. Divided into five chapters (which I'm sure someone smart could parallel to Shakespeare's five acts) the movie tells the stories of a young Jewish woman orphaned by the Nazis, and an American guerrilla unit in Germany known for removing Nazi scalps. Both the young woman (Melanie Laurent) and the military unit (lead by a southern Brad Pitt) hatch separate plans to assassinate Adolph Hitler and chaos ensues. The antagonist to all of this and one of the best parts of the movie is the chillingly uncaring Col. Hans Landa (Christopher Waltz) aka ""the Jew Hunter."" Inglourious Basterds is not a thriller, action, comedy or drama, though it's not not any of those genre's either; instead it is probably safest to say that it was made by Quentin Tarantino. For people who have not seen anything by Quentin Tarantino the term adult-fairy-tale could be used as well. The characters are larger than life, the sets are over the top, the plot is simple yet huge in scope, and of course it begins with ""once upon a time."" In addition, the cinematography, the music, the acting and the editing are all excellent and it leaves the movie with the feeling that it is too romanticized to be real life yet somehow more like real life than most other films. All of this comes out from Taratino's distinct style, which is what makes the movie work. The scene in the basement tavern showcases this in particularly, with the suspicious Nazi, the suave British spy and the double-agent socialite battling it out in one long unabridged sequence.<br/><br/>The acting as mentioned is incredibly well done; Brad Pitt becomes the southern US and Christopher Waltz impersonates an evil at par with Heath Ledger's joker. Melanie Laurent is ruthless, beautiful, angry, simple, vengeful etc. all in one complex character. Even Mike Myers and B.J. Novak, known for their comedy, pull off serious roles without problem.<br/><br/>In short Quentin Tarantino is a unique and awe-inspiring film-maker. I mean how many people do you think can pull off an out of the blue narration by Samuel L. Jackson accompanied by sixties font and music in the middle of a WWII movie and make it seem normal. He makes movies with a style so their own that they would be refreshing if the plot revolved around a blind eighty year old dictioneer (dictioneer (n'): one who writes dictionaries). So what if he slightly fudged the facts of WWII, the movie was entertaining and that is kind of the point. Inglourious Basterds deserves full praise as much as Lt. Aldo Raine deserves his one hundred Nazi scalps.<br/><br/>Like this review check out more at Sabretoothmovies.blogspot.com"
"Deleauvive","6","2","7","9 December 2009"," Fun, no ""hidden message"", brilliant dialogues, a bit too many clichés
","*SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD*<br/><br/>Was IB entertaining (is that a ""bingo"" ;) ) ? Yes, it was, but to me its ""replay value"" is quite low. Despite the sense of details in reproducing the costumes and the SS decorations profusion, it should be mentioned that this is not a historical movie at all, and it relates to WWII in a rather lousy way. Also, except from the beginning of Chapter III, I didn't find the references to Spaghetti Western movies that overwhelming.<br/><br/>It could be fun to spend a few moments trying to designate to which movie this specific sequence relates with your friends, but Q. Tarentino is smart enough to avoid the ""bad remake"" pitfalls by quickly switching to another reference just when you were about to find out a blatant similitude.<br/><br/>Most brilliant scene(s) INMHO ? 3 actually : N°1, the Tavern bloodbath, obviously. The Italian speaking imbroglio just before the movie in the movie begins, where Col. Hans Landa irresistibly confounds Lt. Aldo Raine and his two acolytes. Third, possibly, the discussion between Shosanna D. and Pvt Zoller at the café, where the latter maneuvers to have her admit she should be grateful for the attention he pays to her charms.<br/><br/>The German Officer dialogues are delightful overall (except when Col. Hans Landa is explaining by the ending he's in fact seeking protection from the Allies, I found that a bit antinomic coming from a cruel Jew hunter, wasn't he trying to know who was really at the head of the Basterds commando just before that ? I would like to add I also found this part confusing).<br/><br/>That's where the problem lies. Christoph Watlz shines partly because the other actors are not really convincing, including Brad Pitt. This said, as some critics noted, all those who play the other German officers are quite good, including Sylvester Groth endorsing a self-assured & cynical Goebbels.<br/><br/>Melanie L. gives up trying hard to act naturally during her last scene. When she orders her pretender to go away, she sounds like one of those dumb female bouncers that are to be found in front of discos in Paris, telling people to stand out the line because they are not enlisted.<br/><br/>I don't really get why some people (excluding teens) expected ""more action"" from the Basterds. To me, seeing them in their unidimensional roles, molesting Germans or obeying to their leader for a few minutes was more than enough (exception made of the preparation of the operation in the hideout). <br/><br/>The good : IB is fun, has witty and overall brilliant dialogues, some good action scenes.<br/><br/>The not so good : Should not be considered by critics as a War or Historical movie at all. Some sub-par acting and gratuitous violence (in the broad sense).<br/><br/>My grade : B, A- if you have especially enjoyed watching Kill Bill."

","I had put off this movie for quite awhile until finally pulling the DVD out of the drawer last night. I am no fan of QT but this film is definitely OK in my book, alsobeit the head scalping is a bit over the top for sure, especially when Aldo (Brad Pitt) demands not less than a 100 nazi scalps from each of his men. The film is a mockery but an entertaining one and Brad Pitt carries on where he left off with his cheek and nonchalence in 'Burn after Reading'. a very similar role but with a completely different story. Must agree with earlier comments that the guy playing the German Hans Lander (Waltz) is splendid. Agree also there is too much table talk but that is the essence of this film so lets not knock it. Waltz might make it for Oscar but nobody else will make contention, as enjoyable as the film is. There must have been some point 39-45 when the German leaders were gathered together but not as wittingly portrayed in this movie and in Paris."

","This is basically a ""jewxploitation"" B-movie with an A-list cast. It is set in occupied France during the 2nd World War, much as a fairy tale would have a far-away kingdom as a setting, and chronicles the exploits of a Jewish American commando outfit sent overseas to intimidate the Nazis.<br/><br/>So far, so good. However, it doesn't entirely succeed as a B-movie, mostly because Tarantino has a schizophrenic attitude to his material. Many sequences are drawn out too far for drama, as the scenes following them usually break the spell by bringing the viewer firmly back to self-referencing movieland, replete with inane dialogue and sadistic detail.<br/><br/>It does feature some explosive action sequences and excellent performances that make up for the boring parts. Take it as a set of postmodern grindhouse vignettes and it works quite nicely, and the finale is magnificent. Some tighter editing would have made it an even more entertaining package."

"chaos-rampant","Null","2","7","6 September 2009"," An 150 minute carnival tour through QT's bedroom with QT as host pointing out at his one obsession: movies.
","IB is a difficult movie for me to criticize because it does nothing Kill Bill didn't do first and yet I loved Kill Bill. It does what Death Proof and its talky riot grrl trashy aesthetic did but does it better and yet clocking at 150 minutes it's more tiresome than Death Proof. It's a man's movie done by a gleeful adolescent. It has interesting characters like Aldo Raine and Colonel Landa but wastes them in the wrong movie. It's a movie about QT's wild feverish love of cinema and yet it's a love of cinema reduced to incognito winks and nods and references aimed to satisfy the hardened cinephile who can smirk at himself bemused at identifying Emil Jannings and Antonio Margheriti instead of a love of cinema for its ecstatic combination of images and sounds, for that transcendental sum so greater than its individual parts which QT himself praised in Leone's GBU.<br/><br/>The movie vacillates between the banal (a Basterd shooting a wounded Nazi prison guard after he groans) and the tedious (the love subplot between Jewish girl and Nazi war hero) capping that off with wild explosions of violence. It is outrageous as much for its irreverent cartoonish treatment of a horrible war as it is for expecting the viewer to accept every improbable silly plot twist (Hitler Goering Goebbels and Bormann all attending a movie premiere in occupied Paris, Landa's defection) for the very reason they're cartoonish and irreverent. Much like a dead baby joke, IB's clever set up requires you to accept its silly outrageous premise for the very qualities that mark it as such, otherwise you're not in on the joke. And much like a failed dead baby joke, IB fails in that aspect because it doesn't push the boundaries of decency far enough, because this is a movie about a band of US scalphunters facing off with a charming but horrifying Nazi villain in occupied France saddled with a lifeless heroine who polishes Henri-Georges Clouzot's name in the marquee of her cinema and needless distracting Mike Myers cameos stretching out the tightness of the plot, because it must stop on its tracks to explain how inflammable nitrate stock is (dramatize dramatize dramatize!) and drop references to Hollywood moguls Louis B. Mayer and David Selznick, because IB is a movie about QT making a movie, insulated from reality archetype or myth, vicariously presenting love grief and loss not through real life but through other movies about love grief and loss, because unlike the best of cinema IB's parts are greater than the whole, set pieces lovingly constructed, their verbosity undercut with slow-burn suspenseful tactics, strung together to support a flimsy plot.<br/><br/>Watching IB reminded me of how I got my first movie ideas: I would drive around listening to rousing music (Morricone often enough) and I would imagine scenes to go with the music, set pieces, cool shots, openings and closings. But writing a story requires to turn off the music and put pen to paper, not to fill the mouths of your characters with fancy dialogues, but to layer and structure and hold back when necessary and invest in subtext and dramatize not with regards to small climaxes every twenty minutes of splinters of wood exploding, gunfights in basement tavers, and cinemas erupting in flames, followed by whole slabs of exposition (like the Basterds introduction), but one slow and steady climax of character and action.<br/><br/>This vacuous patchwork of quirks and eccentricities reflected in the title itself, rightfully INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS and not Once Upon a Time in Nazi-Occupied France as QT intended it to be at first, because in Sergio Leone's OUATITW, the patchwork of film references created by young cineliterate writers Argento and Bertollucci is subordinate to the story, layered inside, used as tools to expose myth and archetype, whereas in IB they're applied externally as quirks independent of the story. QT did the same thing in Kill Bill but there he had the wherewithal to reward both the genre fan who picked up on the Lady Snowblood/Sex and Fury homage and the casual moviegoer who didn't with great cinema, because he introduced Sonny Chiba as Hattori Hanzo (after the famous TV series) but made him a believable character. Occasionally funny, with a good opening sequence, an outrageous climax, and a charismatic scene-stealing villain, IB suffers because there's too much QT in the movie. If every movie is a ride through the artist's world, IB is a carnival tour through QT's bedroom because he never left it to see the world, with QT as host pointing out at his one obsession: his love of movies."
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","7","4 September 2009"," Adolsecent and indulgent but such fun
","I deliberately didn't read reviews of Quentin Tarrantino's latest offering before seeing the movie, but it was clear that the ratings of the reviewers were all over the place. Since I knew that the story was centred on a ruthless bunch of American-Jewish soldiers in 1940s occupied France, I was expecting tons of violent action like ""Kill Bill Part 1""; instead I found a five-chapter construction with extensive scenes of dialogue (much in German or French) making it much more like ""Kill Bill Part 2"". As a writer, Tarrantino gives his actors some cracking lines and, as a director, he allows those actors time to deliver them with immense style. The soldiers of the title feature much less than one might expect and the shooting comes in short but vicious bursts.<br/><br/>Of course, this re-imaging of the Second World War represents an utterly preposterous narrative but, if one surrenders to Tarrantino's adolescent and audacious vision of how he would have liked things to have gone, then this movie is enormous fun and, for a semitophile like me, something akin to what one reviewer called ""kosher porn"". There are some excellent performances - including Brad Pitt as Tennessee leader of the Basterds and Mike Myers virtually unrecognisable in a support role - but Tarrantino's casting discovery Christoph Waltz is simply outstanding as SS Colonel Hans Landa aka 'The Jew Hunter'. It may be long (two and a half hours) and it may be self-indulgent, but it is full of suspense and holds the attention throughout.<br/><br/>Whatever the film's scale of commercial success (and it should do well), this is a piece of auteurism destined to be a staple of many a film course since its reverence for the movies and countless allusions to specific works imbue almost every scene. It starts with the title, a corruption of the American title for an 1978 Italian B-movie, where the mis-spelling is never explained but is the first indication of QT's compulsive quirkiness. It ends with the last line of dialogue - ""I think this just might be my masterpiece"" - in which the director (none too subtly) is telling us something. In between, we have music from spaghetti westerns, a character who used to be a film critic, frequent references to German movies, a bar game involving a film title, a climatic scene in a cinema, and much much more."

","Admittedly it is one of the hardest tasks to make a movie about the Nazis/WWII. IB might be the best one I've seen so far. The problem I and probably many people have is that we know very much about the period of time and automatically, we keep on comparing the historical information stored in our brains with what we see on the screen. IB, of course, is far from being close to historical facts, but still the setup of the movie are ""real"". So I was very excited and my heart was throbbing towards the end, and the tension that is built up got stronger and stronger as the film goes on for a looong time, so I couldn't help being just a little disappointed of the end that seemed a bit too simple, given the complicated characters and drama that is built up during the movie.<br/><br/>That being said, it still was quite entertaining. What I didn't like was that some characters were kind of useless to the script, as Mike Myers' act, which was good, merely served to introduce the British spy, who got killed shortly after he was introduced. Also, I would have liked to see more of Hugo Stiglitz and all of the Basterds in action, not just in flashbacks.<br/><br/>But anyway, great performance by most of the actors (except maybe the German actress/spy who was a little lame) and of course the greatest idea for a movie about the Nazis. Still a must-see."
"mike872","6","2","7","25 August 2009"," Tarantino Film Violence Loses Sting Without Moral Edge
","The first scene in the film, sets a very high standard. At bottom though, Inglourious Basterds is just a new, highly stylized exploitation film. Its most troubling aspect is that it is an equal opportunity exploitation film: both the Nazis and the Americans are a bunch of cruel brigands. The Americans, led by Brad Pitt, take scalps from dead Nazis. Tarantino the storyteller doesn't root for either side. Both Americans and Nazis are treated as the same sorts of menacing caricatures. Tarantino is capable of making a very good serious movie. So why doesn't he make one of those? Hitler, in this telling, is as absurd a caricature as Mel Brooks' stage Hitler(comedian Dick Shawn) was in the original Producers. I have seen the guy playing Tarantino's Hitler in the role before. The actor was carefully selected to be a Hitler who looks almost exactly like Shemp Howard, brother to Mo, and occasional substitute in Three Stooges comedies. Tarantino even stole some particularly absurd lines from the original Producers to put in Hitler's mouth. The film is stagy, self congratulatory and self conscious. It moves at a snails pace, wandering somewhere between a savagely ironic comedy and an over the top, bashing male thriller. But it is neither. Tarantino is toying with film genres here in a way that is unsatisfying for fans of both. Without a moral compass, Inglourious Basterds is an overly long picture that doesn't stir enough audience passion."
"omahonyjason","6","2","7","24 August 2009"," Tarantino's latest is a zany mix of the Good, the Bad and the Nazi!
","Quentin Tarantino quite literally burst onto the scene in 1992 with one of the freshest, nastiest, most brilliant debuts of all time. RESERVOIR DOGS (1992) wowed critics and movie fans alike and revolutionized a whole generation of cinema fans introducing them to Mexican stand-offs, gut wrenching violence and a cinema screen soaked in blood, wrapped in cool dialogue and delivered with the best sound track to hit theatres for years. PULP FICTION (1994) cemented his place in the pop pantheon and while JACKIE BROWN (1997) was genius his later movies have failed to deliver.<br/><br/>INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is Tarantino's 6th film and sees him roaring right back at his roots with visceral dialogue, brilliantly violent villains and heroes that blur the lines between the good, the bad and the ugly.<br/><br/>It opens in the first year of the German occupation of France, with Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) witnessing the execution of her family at the hand of Nazi Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). Shosanna narrowly escapes and flees to Paris where she forges a new identity as the owner and operator of a cinema. Elsewhere in Europe, Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) organizes a group of Jewish American soldiers to perform swift, shocking acts of retribution against the Nazi regime, demanding 100 Nazi scalps from each of his squad.<br/><br/>Lieutenant Raine's men are blood thirsty killers and hot for revenge, bashing in German brains while simultaneously battering down the doors of the German psyche, becoming a nightmare for the occupying forces who dub them ""The Basterds"". His squad joins forces with German actress and undercover British agent, Bridget Von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger), on a mission to take down the leaders of the Third Reich. Fates converge in a cinema, where Shoshanna is poised to carry out a revenge plan of her own at the premiere of a movie starring an unwanted admirer of hers, Frederick Zoller.<br/><br/>Employing pulp and propaganda in equal measure INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS weaves together the infamous, oppressed, real, unreal and much larger than life stories of WWII.<br/><br/>It's opening title sequence, ""Once Upon a time In Nazi Occupied France"", is reminiscent of Leone's Dollar trilogy and his later Once movies. BASTERDS borrows heavily from the brilliant Italian, even using a number of Morricone scores, while he riffs on John Ford's THE SEARCHERS, particularly in the scene where Shosanna escapes from the clutches of the crazy Nazi, Colonel Landa.<br/><br/>Christoph Waltz is the best thing about the movie and is a Nazi that you will absolutely love to hate. He steals the pic from Brad Pitt and while it's a little early in the year to talk about Oscar winners, I'd put an early bet on him for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>INGLOURIOUS is not, as Lieutenant Aldo Raine suggests in the closing scene, a masterpiece. Not by a long chalk, but even an average Tarantino is far better than the dreck that's usually served in the cinema. Go to this movie, because you'll laugh your ass off and love it. This film might not scale the heights of PULP FICTION, but then few do. And while Tarantino might not be fully back, on the strength of this he's certainly on his way!"
"goggles2112","6","2","7","23 August 2009"," Holy way too long, Batman!
","Let me start off by saying I'm a die hard QT fan. That said, this was a disappointing flick. It is simply way too long and poorly paced. The directing is great as always, and the actors are superb, but this film has you squirming in your seat far too often.<br/><br/>Normally, a QT flick is virtually defined by the dialogue. To say the man has a style all of his own is an understatement. That said, there are moments in this movie where he is paying homage to himself. A little pretentious by anyone's standard. 80% of the writing is excellent, 20% doesn't feel right, because it's like QT is impressed by his own cleverness. And it's too long. Also, imagine Pulp Fiction with subtitles... how many nuances would be lost, or at least, hard to follow. I'm guessing you get the idea.<br/><br/>This is not a bad movie, but it falls well short of the bar that QT has set for himself. The pure shock factor is a new high, but the rest of the film is crippled by the it's yawn inspiring length.<br/><br/>I strongly suspect I will enjoy this film more on DVD, where it is possible to take a break, a'la Heat, which was painfully long in the theatre, but a masterpiece on video.<br/><br/>BTW, I do not have a short attention span, 3 hour films do not offend me in the least. A great film completely deafens you to any protests from a numb bum, this film seems to ask ""Hey, how's your butt feeling?"" over and over.<br/><br/>Plain and simple, TOO LONG."

","After the disappointing outcome of ""Death Proof"" and the un- relenting amount of build up to Tarantino's new film ""Inglourious Basterds"", I, as well as what would appear to be the majority of film lovers, was somewhat hesitant about whether this film would be deserving of the hype and hysteria surrounding its release.<br/><br/>Having now seen the film, i can now say that the numerous adverts, posters, interviews and countless other forms of publicity which were used to advertise ""Inglourious"" didn't even come close to revealing the utter brilliance that is this film. It is what can only be described as a master class of film making, with every single detail crafted to perfection in order to create one of the greatest pieces of cinematic achievement this decade.<br/><br/>Its well known to the public that this script has taken Tarantino ten years to devise and perfect, and the effort is shown clearly in every scene. The script caries with it the class, comedy and originality that Tarantino is famous for and not once does it let up<br/><br/>If you see a film this year please make it this one, you will be surprised at how different this is to how it is portrayed in the advert, but this is by no means a bad thing. Any nay sayers of this film either do not understand it or are simply looking for your typical run of the mill, action movie, which this is quite clearly and simply miles above."
"dave-crm114","9","3","13","9 September 2010"," Why did I wait so long?
","I only pulled this film off my ""save to watch later"" DVD rack yesterday, and I regret having waited so long to watch it. Rarely can a film have divided critical and public opinion so thoroughly, and I had heard many times in many ways that ""Chapter 1 is great but the rest is poor"". I had, however, managed to avoid reading any story lines or spoilers so when I sat down in a darkened room to watch IG yesterday I really wasn't sure what to expect...but I thought it might turn out to be very bad.<br/><br/>Many of QT's films divide opinion, and my own potted personal view of his oeuvre is that Reservoir Dogs is brilliant - bravura film making with some rough edges but almost Shakespearian in intensity; Pulp Fiction is great too, ground breaking and brilliant but for me it comes in second to ""Dogs""; Jackie Browne is very much Curate's Egg and disappointed me - it seemed as if it was the work of any competent director rather than a unique talent. Then Kill Bill - well I just didn't really get all this kung-fu homage at all, and words fail me when it comes to Death Proof - just awful in every respect, and I wish I could ""unsee"" it.<br/><br/>But Inglourious Basterds was riveting (although a bit gruesome in parts) with some outstanding acting performances (Christoph Walz, Melanie Laurent, and Michael Fassbender are all brilliant.) Chapter 1 as everyone agrees is brilliantly handled and as good as anything Tarantino has put on film - most people seem to agree on that. Brad Pitt and his Basterds give the film its title but give us the weakest sections, and I am reminded of the technique (see Macbeth!) of inserting a comic interlude immediately after a scene of great tension or gruesome murder...except that the ""comic interludes also include scenes of great tension or gruesome murder as well.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, and contrary to many other reviewers, I found the scenes with the guessing game in the basement bar, and the leisurely lunch with Goebbels both completely riveting where tension is mercilessly eased up, relaxed a little, then wound right up again. If you're watching and listening (like you're supposed to!) rather than eating popcorn or slurping a drink these ""long and boring"" scenes work very well indeed. I found myself right there sitting at the table (well, two different tables) simply not knowing how ""we"" were going to get out of this. Tarantino's boldness is in giving the time for the the tensions to build and fall in real time, until your own pulse rate seems synchronised with the protagonists. Utterly brilliant film making.<br/><br/>I watched some of the extended/deleted scenes immediately afterwards and if anything the extended version of the Goebbels lunch was even better than it is in the film. Towards the end of the scene (is it a spoiler if this describes a section of a scene that isn't in the film?) Goebbels loses his temper with Emmanuelle Mimieux (Melanie Laurent) and is transformed from deeply suspect suavity in a heartbeat, and just for a second or two, into a monster. When he bangs the table and shouts at her, Melanie Laurent jumps about a foot in the air - it's as if a chest bursting alien has sprung from Goebbels thorax. The shock is palpable: you suspect this apparently cultured and incredibly powerful politician is capable of anything, then he reveals that your suspicions are completely correct.<br/><br/>I'm going to need to see it again as soon as possible (before I give it the full ten stars) because, like Kubrick, Tarantino's films usually improve with age and number of viewings. Tarantino breaks all the rules and the comedic aspect of the ultra-violence (another nod to Kubrick there perhaps) is definitely unsettling to say the least, but this is a very good film which is excellent in parts. It is a must see (although my Mum wouldn't like it, and my wife wouldn't like it either) and is right up there with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction."

Definitely !!!<br/><br/>A movie means art (the cinema is the 7th art (if I remember well). <br/><br/>OK, it exist ""consume movies"", but from an ""important"" director I expect more, I expect art. Which is not the case now.<br/><br/>Because bullshit can not be art !<br/><br/>2. You can not go with the family to this ""movie"".<br/><br/>(my wife just covered her eyes and ask me if the bloody scene is finished). And I can not blame her. I also think that the bloody scenes were not bringing any added value to the movie. The same about ""lots of talk"". <br/><br/>3. In general I couldn't find interesting ideas in the movie.<br/><br/>Only childish, simple ideas.<br/><br/>Just 2 ideas I found interesting:<br/><br/><ul><li>Hitler appearance in the movie was comic.</li></ul><br/><br/>In general Hitler make a foul of himself during his appearances.<br/><br/>The first appearance was hilarious. <br/><br/>The idea of representing Hitler this way was very well managed, balanced. Still, combining good humor with pointless discussions full of tension, bloody scenes, stupid&childish suspense will not create unforgettable movie - my opinion.<br/><br/><ul><li>the Jewish killed Hitler (at least in fantasy). And with style!</li></ul><br/><br/>This is a comfortable idea (from the psychological point of view) offered to a lot of people maybe.<br/><br/>This is the best and more complex idea/thing that happened in the movie. The rest seemed to me very childish.<br/><br/>4. Too long - have the feeling that I lost my time there. <br/><br/>2.5 hour is really a lot of time lost.<br/><br/>5. As time is money maybe it's better that they pay us rather that we pay them. <br/><br/>I WANT MY MONEY BACK, MR. Tarantino !!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Can not be more clear than this. <br/><br/>This is a ""real"" opinion about the movie, not one like that, spread through the newspaper, just meant to make people curios enough to PAY for it. Publicity. Just spread anything through the mass media so that people are curious and that they just did it: they PAY for it. If they regrets afterward, too bad for them.<br/><br/>This was my impression about this movie. The goal was just to take (one more time) ""some money"" from the public. No intention for art or something unforgettable. <br/><br/>In conclusion , it is really disappointing. <br/><br/>This, really, can not be compared with ""Pulp Fiction"". <br/><br/>It's just a TRAP!"

There's so much dialog in this movie that you'd have to be a lover of language to enjoy it. I'm guessing that most of Quentin's action footage was lost in a fire. Quentin even delves into the history of French and German cinema. I thought this was an action movie? Maybe one of the problems was the acting. To sell all of this dialog you need some really great actors. Some of the actors such as Diane Kruger just didn't have the presence to carry some of the ""loquacious"" scenes"""

","Inglorious Basterds is Quentin Tarantino's new film.It's basically Tarantino's take on World War II. Of course the film is historically inaccurate, but they were not going for historical accuracy when making this film.Quentin Tarantino is a great director giving us excellent films such as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.Pulp Fiction was a masterpiece and he has yet to top it.Inglorious Basterds was a great World War II film though.The best? I'm not sure, but it's definitely up there.I'm usually not a very big fan of Brad Pitt, but he was simply excellent in this film.He plays the redneck commander of a squad called the ""inglorious basterds"", a team which specializes in killing nazi's.In my opinion, this is Pitt's best role! He is simply hilarious in an otherwise dark war film.Eli Roth and Sam Levine also play members of the ""basterds"".The plot of the film involves two groups of people who are trying to kill Hitler and the other nazi's.One group is ""the basterds"", the others are two people who run a movie theatre.The woman who runs it had her family killed by the nazi's years earlier and wants revenge.There is a German officer who is smitten by her as well.The acting & characters are top-notch.It is very violent, which is expected for a Tarantino film, though there is not too much action.A problem I had with this film was that it dragged quite a bit.A lot of Tarantino films do this, but a lot of the time, it works.Some of it works here as well, I found that the opening scene was somewhat of a nod to the apartment scene in Pulp Fiction.We knew something bad was going to happen, however the two characters just converse as the suspense builds.They could have definitely shortened this film a bit. The rest of the movie is great and any Tarantino or World War II film fan should enjoy it."

Now I know Tarantino's style is based on fantasy and fictitious plots, but come on, Adolf Hitler and 200 top Nazis Officers will be in attendance of a movie premier in occupied France and you have only two guards in the whole theater and the surroundings? Where also an American-African walks around freely with steel pipes locking doors and setting fire. These 2 guards are then executed in seconds opening the door for our 2 ""heroes"" to slay Hitler at point blank with around 100 rounds... very dumb. At least, challenge our intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time (Go watch Valkyrie). Besides, Mike Myers impersonation of a British general is more realistic and authentic than the guy doing Hitler, just picture that.<br/><br/>What ruined it further, is that the only smart and powerful character, which nailed everyone in the movie, with his psychological and mind bending interrogations, ends up to be effortlessly tricked by the most mindless character in the movie.<br/><br/>After watching the movie, I was sympathizing with Nazis, who were portrayed to have more bravery and humanity than our Basterds!!!

","Quentin Tarantino loves cinema. Even the characters in his movies talk cinema. And the ones who aren't talking cinema still seem to realize they're in a damn fine piece of it. And the major plot point of Tarantino's latest cinematic masterpiece, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, revolves around the screening of a movie! <br/><br/>Tarantino knows cinema so intimately, he smashes a conglomeration of styles together to arrive at BASTERDS; we could trace the lineage of Kurosawa, Woo, Hitchcock and Leone, but unless you're a film scholar with your hand down your pants, you just wanna get to the Jewish ultra-violence.<br/><br/>That's where Brad Pitt comes in. As half-breed hillbilly Apache Aldo Raine, he recruits vengeful Jews during Hitler's Holocaust and takes the fight to the Germans. His mission: ""killin' Natzees."" Ambushing, scalping, mutilating, baseball-batting... terrorizing. These blood-mad Jews become known as ""The Basterds."" Their ultimate plan involves strapping bombs to themselves and blowing themselves up in a cinema packed with Nazi high command, including Hitler (Martin Wuttke) and his Minister for Propaganda, Goebbels (Sylvester Groth), who was also a real life film producer (leave it to Tarantino to uncover that nugget).<br/><br/>But Pitt is here purely for marquee muscle. His screen time is minimal. And though he puts in a fine performance, impressing us with how long he can hold that constipation face, he does little else, except spouting a few lines of dialog which are far from Tarantino's most luscious work, trying to perfect a redneck drawl that sounds like it's coming from a guy who's making a constipation face.<br/><br/>This movie belongs to Christoph Waltz.<br/><br/>As SS officer Hans Landa, ""The Jew Hunter,"" Waltz's chilling performance will make your testicles shrivel. Every foreboding appearance he makes as the death-dealing interrogator makes your sphincter tremble in fear. Landa knows when you're lying. And even if you're not, you feel like you are. Because you probably are. It is such a fearsome tour de force of fatal charisma and nerve-wracking trepidation, it's like Waltz did all his acting training with Goebbels.<br/><br/>INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is unconventionally structured, in Four Chapters, four tenuously linked story lines eventually intertwining for the payoff. And what a payoff! A catharsis for Jewdom. DEFIANCE (2008) showed us Jews who actually fought back during World War II, in a story Inspired By Fact. But writer-director Tarantino, unbound by facts, rewrites history without any compunction (let's face it, like every American war movie about Viet Nam, Korea, WWII, only without pretending historical authenticity) and takes his WWII fantasy to a level that can only be described (by producer Lawrence Bender) as ""a Jewish wet dream."" It's the Nazis who burn now, not the Jews; it's the Nazis whose flesh is marked by the Jews as a sign of contempt; it's the Nazis who tremble at the brutality of the Jew ""basterds."" <br/><br/>Movie opens like a Leone western, officer Landa inviting himself into a desolate farmhouse of a poor farmer and his trembling daughters. He is looking for Jews that the farmer might be hiding. The tension that follows is like the best of Leone, hard closeups of the two faces and master shots that never budge. We are so gripped by the movie in these opening minutes and into the following Chapters, we never even realize its unconventional structure. Proving that good story wins out every time over a Hollywood system atrophying in its glossy rut.<br/><br/>It's like four TWILIGHT ZONE vignettes strung together; every time the screen goes to black to end a Chapter, we find ourselves exhaling in relief and needing a neck massage from a nude female provider slash dancer. And as every new Chapter opens, we are thrust spittle-mouthed and unbreathing into the tension-driven second act of something that started before we arrived. It's Total Tarantino.<br/><br/>In the Chapter ""A German Night In Paris"" we are introduced to Mélanie Laurent, who plays Shoshanna, doing Clint Eastwood as a sexy French, blond, green-eyed avenger. (This is what Alison Eastwood, daughter of Clint, should have become, instead of the C-Movie junkie she ended up as.) <br/><br/>Eli Roth is Donnie Donowitz, ""The Bear Jew,"" who gets his kicks beating Germans to death with a baseball bat. (Roth is the writer-director of HOSTEL, 2005 - any wonder he loves the ultra-violence? In a German interview, when asked to justify his character's bloodthirstiness, he was outraged, ""This movie is nothing but magic tricks, but your grandparents turned my ancestors into furniture! Into lamp shades!"") <br/><br/>The characterizations are formidable, each actor embodying the French and German and British characters they play. Noteworthy is August Diehl (as Major Hellstrom), another German-born actor, who - like Karl-Otto Alberty and Anton Diffring before him - scares the hell out of us like a real life Gestapo officer. And Diane Kruger also impresses with her effortless bi-lingual German tongue.<br/><br/>Being a Tarantino film, there's bound to be a scene where everyone is pointing a gun at everyone else. How Tarantino arrives at this situation is the true wonder; how it all makes perfect sense by the time everyone is pointing a gun at everyone else WHY everyone is pointing a gun at everyone else.<br/><br/>INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is that rara avis - a dialog-driven war film more intense and exciting than any driven by pretty orange explosions."

","Quentin Tarantino is back with loads of blood n violence but with content.What a movie I must say. The trailers only shown Brad Pitt & his team of Inglorious Basterds but the surprise package was some one else. Its Christopher Waltz as Hans Lada aka the Jew Hunter. But I also liked the role of Melanie Laurent as cinema hall owner. Her aspiration to avenge and fear of Nazis was clearly reflected and well balanced.<br/><br/>The chapter wise presentation of story was really helpful to develop the overall storyline of the film. The costume and art direction was stand out. Some of the scenes kept me on edge of the seat - The gunfires scene in bar when identity of moles is revealed by a German office was the best one. On downside, Brad Pitt was the big let down. His acting as well as his accent was horrible and didn't go well. Diane Krueger was also so-so. Eli Roth was okay.

"LJArney","9","2","8","15 December 2009"," An Absolute Masterpiece
","In a recent interview with Quentin Tarantino, he he was quoted saying he had the opposite of writers block, the ideas just kept coming, and that he couldn't stop himself from writing enough: the reasoning for so much time between films. When it comes to his well known genius, and his absolutely brilliant take on characters and story development,that statement is completely evident in his massively brilliant return with Inglorious Basterds.<br/><br/>The elements of Tarantino films are just as clear as always, with the violence and gore - making the points with the blood as he always has. The difference in this film was his approach to an already violent and evil event in history, perhaps one of the most with Hitlers massacre to the Jewish population in the 1940s. It is similar in the movie Munich with a final and justified violent Jew retaliation to what they were presented, but exceeds it exceptionally in the non-fictional sense. Brad Pitt and his German-killing Jew crew could have very well had an entire movie based on their events alone, but Tarantino, once again, takes it to the next level.<br/><br/>One of the greatest aspects of this movie was the use of language in this movie. With French, German, and English used fluently throughout, Tarantino uses the human perspective and understanding with the use of foreign languages like no other, especially pertaining to invasion upon France from Germany. The bottom line when watching this movie, is that NO ONE does it like Tarantino. Subtitles force you to be involved in the art and hardcore sectionalism of the parts of the movies within, but Tarantino uses the languages as a MEANING of understanding, purposefully.<br/><br/>Is this a common non-linear Tarantino film? No. Is it for the faint of heart? No. But if Tarantino hasn't reeled you in yet, he will. Inglorious Basterds- a monumental film"
"sweetaya","8","2","8","24 November 2009"," yet another QT film
","I love the way QT always goes out of his way to make movies. As a German I appreciate the fact, that he's actually got Germans to act in his film, rather that Americans that do a horrible job trying to get the German language right. I don't mind the fact that the story is complete fiction, I'm just a bit worried that the generation now, even if its just a small percentage, might actually take this for real history.<br/><br/>The movie looks good, I didn't get bored during the 2 1/2 hrs, the acting is OK, I actually think Waltz made the movie, his performance was excellent. Brad Pitt was totally out of place, he did not belong there, but being that QT's movies are usually a bit exaggerated I can let that slide.<br/><br/>From what I read in the reviews here you either love or hate this movie. If you are the person that feels that history should not be changed in movies, then stay away from this film. The movie isn't the greatest ever but it has its charm. It's fun no more and no less. Enjoy!"

","The first film, that anxiety. Friday, yesterday, Inglourios Basters, by Quentin Tarantino, expect a lot more blood to tell the truth, yes there is shooting but expected more.Christoph Waltz excellent performance in a very interesting character, who knows deep explore the eccentricities the character without losing the mystery of why that eccentricity in the pipe or giant laughter. Mr. Pitt in a performance that has a problem, because it's Lieutenant Aldo an archetype of the American soldier, the star of the actor is mistaken in the character overshadowing the last one.OK, I mean, I never thought Brad Pitt making a character so much less with a deep country American accent, he also has played Thelma in the Luise the beautiful cowboy JD, soon the fun of the movie is Mr.. Pitt talk like that , but now, so his performance loses the focus.Forward ... Tarantino uses a lot of camera features in the movie especially in the first chapter.Percebe as soon his face perfectionist movie maker man of unique style heavily influenced not let yourself be influenced, so why few films, it must have a big ego.A dialogue and long ... rather tiring, but worth it not for the dialogue, itself has limited content and metaphors worth of a children, but by Colonel Hans Landa.The extras are a good, worst Til Schweiger and better ones August Diehl that proves that the film i saw the counterfeiters who was not only a role, the guy knows the business. Parentheses in forgers, very good film that I recommend, it makes the role of a Jew who fight hard against the Nazis in this film and a major in the SS, simply fantastic, great performances. Finally the characters from the top of the 3rd Heich very well cast in the proposed demoralization of the Nazis.This Hitler recalls Chaplin in the great dictator.E the beautiful Diane Kruger her performance has improved a lot since I saw her in Michel Valliant<br/><br/>Now the best, the technique used:<br/><br/>Costumes 9, almost a character in the movie;<br/><br/>Track 8, he finally improved with the corny songs , thanks to the gods;<br/><br/>Scenario 5, did not convince me, it seems that only exists because the script calls for a space to place the shares, frankly this guy has to improve, learn from whatever they know the Chinese use scenarios;<br/><br/>Finally Inglourios Basterds is one film a little tiring and boring.BUT, big but, the best work from Tarantino's Pulp fiction since, because it shows maturity and his art and beyond with their boldness at the film's changing history, and mainly because it is as Lt. Aldo: it just looks better in your art and get your masterpiece with Hans Landa's forehead he follows principles and Hans Landa will not be an exception, the same with Tarantino is his almost masterpiece but the good thing it has matured and created a good movie and stick to his movie principles. -7.8 -- I would rate this movie."

","Well first off against my will I have to admit the movie does have a lot of bright sides. The actors are doing a great job especially the German gestapo guy you follow around the movie. The dialog with that guy had me holding my breath more than once. The script and acting in the scenes with him made me give the movie 7 just for that. The acting is 10 in many cases but one thing really struck me towards the end of the movie. How does it feel being German in 2009 and see a movie like this appear ? Thats the main reason it ended with a 7 and not a 9 or a 10 from me. The opinions on this movie can go political very quickly and to sum it up it is a fantastic film but and I do mean BUT. Can we please stop the harassment of the Germans by now. The war ended 64 years ago and it is time to start focusing on other more pressing issues. Towards the end what I had was a feeling of pity towards present day Germans that still has to watch more of these movies. In all fairness we should see more movies like ""Das Boot"" now, the Germans must begin to rebuild their confidence as a nation and move on and more films like this will not speed it up .."
"dukevega","9","2","8","15 November 2009"," Took A Second Viewing
","When I first saw this movie, I liked it but gave it a lower rating because I felt it carried on too long (too much dialogue). I went back and saw it again. This time I did not have that problem, and I was able to appreciate that this is Quentin's best work since ""Pulp Fiction"".<br/><br/>Once again, Quentin shows his love for film and infuses many facets of this work with it. We have a fugitive Jew running a cinema in Paris, a German war hero turned propaganda film star, a German propaganda star turned double agent, a British film critic turned spy (his fate is probably a slam on critics), and a couple of bloodthirsty US soldiers nicknamed Aldo the Apache and the Bear Jew.<br/><br/>While this movie is titled ""Inglorious Basterds"", and Brad Pitt does his usual admirable job (his Italian is something to be seen and heard), for me it is the actor who played Col Landa, an actor previously unknown in the US, who really turned an outstanding performance. The character is evil, as virtually every cinematic Nazi is, but he is also intelligent, charming, has a flair for languages and an infectious laugh; you simply can't take your eyes off him.<br/><br/>He alone is well worth the price of a ticket (and a DVD), with Lt. Aldo Raine coming in a close second (and the alternate ending to WWII isn't too shabby either)."
"maros612","8","2","8","31 October 2009"," Remade title with much more juice and guts
","I was really impressed by how well it turned out to be. I've seen the original movie a couple of times, and I must say, even though it was also highly watchable, the original hasn't by far reached the potential of the story. Tarantino's effort paid off especially in this part. The film makers grabbed the original concept, created a new story, and took it to a much higher level. Not only this version had a much more convincing feeling of Nazi Germany during WW2 era, Tarantino also applied his typical brutality here. As there was no better place for its application. Wars do certainly build anger and hate along with fear in people, both at the side of oppressor and their targets. Oh, I think the slangy title name was on purpose so original and this one varies. I had good time watching this movie and sincerely recommend it."

","Daring, blunt, gory and definitely not for the faint hearted..those who watch this are either gonna like it big time or hate it absolutely. This one is yet another trademark Tarantino flick, here's why :-<br/><br/>1. lengthy,witty conversations with sudden violent twists in the situation.<br/><br/>2. simply awesome/brilliant/befitting soundtrack. (Especially the Gasoline song by David Bowie...man how appropriate!!). I wonder how he gets the background so nicely woven into the scene time and again.<br/><br/>3. No holds barred assault on your senses like a slasher movie. remember Hostel(producer) and Grindhouse?<br/><br/>4.

The guy even has the balls to twist history. Thats his style, accept it and you're up for a visual treat! I reckon it has more recall value than the loads of other senseless movies, especially the so called BLOCKBUSTERS in Bollywood(India). <br/><br/>Highly recommended if you are looking for something offbeat, something unusual.watch Christoph Waltz as Lt Hans Landa..brilliant!"
"joe_a2006","7","2","8","25 October 2009"," Not that good.
","I don't really know why is this movies rated so high, I mean it's a Quentin Tarantino well, that's about it. The movie doesn't really offer much.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple a group of American Jews out there killing Nazis, they ambushed a German movie premier attended by Hitler and kill him along with most of his high commanders.<br/><br/>That's it, the rest of the movie is just long boring conversations, brad Pitt hardly appeared not to say acted, still, you get to see some action, some blood shedding along with some smart conversations but not as much as you would expect. Finally, it should also be acknowledged that Christoph Waltz is a brilliant actor, he magnificently portrayed a Nazi German commander; his performance was both chilling and theatrical."
"tomimt","7","2","8","25 October 2009"," A couple of great scenes
","I would have loved it, if I would be able to say, that Tarantino has made a modern masterpiece with ""Inglourious Basterds"". It has an absolutely stunning opening scene, that introduces us Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), a notorious jew hunter for the third Reich.<br/><br/>After that we get a much less stunning view of Aldo Reine (Brad Pitt) who is recruiting himself some volunteers to kill him some Nazis in France. It is actually from there the movie slips into a bunch of scenes of which some are less memorable than others, couple of even very good. But not only before the end do we see something that actually manages to get even close of that opening scene.<br/><br/>What I am trying to say is, that the movie feels more than once like a narrative mess. Sure, the vengeance story of Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) is very good, but more than once I felt like there was one story too much. Tarantino should have made a movie either about the Basterds or Shosanna. And I felt, that the story of Shosanna was the one he wanted to make, as the scenes including her overshadow almost everything the basterds are in.<br/><br/>Despite the narrative disagreements I have with the movie, it is beautifully shot and each frame of it looks really good. The music is okay and the actors are, with a couple of expectations, very well cast.<br/><br/>The movie ends in the words ""This might be my masterpiece"". I'm not sure if that is how Tarantino really feels, but at least I don't think it's his finest movie. An okay movie, but not a masterpiece by any means."
"joeybattsbaby","7","2","8","22 October 2009"," Excellent main characters, but...
","I liked Inglorious Basterds for the most part, but I wasn't blown away. Maybe my expectations were too high. I mean, there was a lot of hype around this movie, but it didn't quite deliver on my expectations.<br/><br/>My favorite parts of the film were the characters and the acting. Christopher Waltz was superb.<br/><br/>The story was fine. Not great, but not bad either. The dialog was quite good, as expected.<br/><br/>But the one thing that impacted my enjoyment of the movie the most was how long it was. I would'veg enjoyed it much more had it not taken over two-and-a-half hours to tell the story. I mean, seriously, 2.5+ hours is simply too long. Had this been a Lord of the Rings type of epic, then maybe I could understand--but it isn't.<br/><br/>For example, two scenes in particular drove me nuts because they were just way too long for me: the introduction of the 'Bear Jew' and a scene where the Shosanna character was getting ready to implement her big plan.<br/><br/>They both should have been shortened, at the very least, and the Shosanna scene seemed so long and irrelevant, I don't know why it didn't just get edited out.<br/><br/>In the scene where they introduce the 'Bear Jew' character, there was some sort of 'ode to old school cinema' build up that just seemed to take forever. I thought it was way too long. The scene would have been better if it were shortened. Instead, I got tired of waiting for the guy to reveal himself, and the fact that it dragged on so long turned me off for some reason.<br/><br/>The camera was facing some dark underpass or cave or something, and all you can hear is the sound of a bat hitting up against something. Then it pans to the other characters, and back to the dark entrance point--over and over. As if to build up the tension over how terrifying the infamous 'Bear Jew' is.<br/><br/>It was fine at first, but then it just got ridiculous. All I kept thinking was, ""alright already, dramatic effect complete, let see him already."" But alas, the bat sounds kept coming much to my dismay.<br/><br/>The Shosanna 'getting ready' scene was most confusing. This seemed like another 'ode to old school cinema' type of scene. But it just seemed like a forced version of old school cinema more than anything. There was just no important point to it, which detracted from what it appeared he was trying to accomplish with the scene.<br/><br/>It seems like it takes forever to watch her put on make-up, her hat and veil and everything else she put on for her big night. But why did I have to go through that? Why? Was it really that important that I go through that? Again, I was squirming in my seat at this point, hoping she would just finish already so the next relevant scene would come--and it did, but only after I was already turned off, again.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's character was sufficiently entertaining, but I had a hard time reconciling the redneck in Europe who wants to kill Nazis, and *on behalf* of Jews, no less. I haven't known may rednecks that fit this description, so that was a bit of a disconnect.<br/><br/>With more attention to editing, this film could have been much better.<br/><br/>Now, if there are back-story or sequel films made about Lt. Aldo Raine and/or Col. Hans Landa, then I'd be interested in seeing that.<br/><br/>As long as it's not 2.5+ hours in length."
"photoe","8","2","8","11 October 2009"," Important and exciting twist on the WWII genre
","I greatly enjoyed this film, and its long time flew by pretty quickly for me, so it was thoroughly entertaining. I often hesitate to see a QT movie worrying about the violence, but you can always look away, and he has a way of framing it either rapidly or humorously, which makes it tolerable. There is also often a real purpose to how it is used.<br/><br/>The Kill Bill movies were actually some of my least favorite by him, and I liked Death Proof a lot, despite its LONG intro.<br/><br/>Basterds is a much more epic film, covering an epic topic. I have to agree that Pitt's character was pretty cardboard, though he wasn't supposed to be a genius. He was the can-do rural citizen-soldier, say an Audie Murphy. That said, the leader of a covert ops squad would have something darker in him, and Pitt shows humanity, and supposed perversion, but something real is missing there. Brad Pitt is not all that convincing an actor, if very screen watchable.<br/><br/>Its not a big loss because the acting space is filled by others, including Cristoph Waltz, playing the major heavy, Daniel Bruhl, playing a creepy war hero, and a brief performance by August Diehl, an inquisitive Gestapo man. Melanie Laurent is also great, as well as a few of Pitt's crew, though they are given the least dimension. They are the easy cure, however, and Tarantino focuses on the disease.<br/><br/>I see that many writers have complained about the beating by bat at the beginning of the movie. Sure it IS cruel, and the officer IS brave, but Tarantino shows us war is not about justice in any way shape or form. Pitt offers him a way out, he doesn't take it, and well, that is that. The Basterds cheer and laugh at the beating, which is administered in more or less quick fashion. You can fault humans, but you can't fault QT. This IS reality.<br/><br/>People have claimed Eli Roth can't act. I think his inclusion as the 'Bear' jew who is physically huge is fantastic. It flies in the face of the stereotype of jews as cerebral Woody Allen types. It's also an awesome slap in the face of Aryan physical superiority. I thought his inclusion was a no-brainer.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, Tarantino has a long plot thread headed towards the end, while he also includes set tension pieces, including the opening scene in a French farm hiding jews, and the bar scene. Both employ QT effects of long moments of peace and cordiality ending in total annihilation. Tarantino bests the old movies in the way the violence is executed. You need rewind to figure out what went down in the bar. It is over in five seconds. Tarantino knows when to employ violence as slow torture, or as life-changing rapidity. In that, he acknowledges the power of violence to change. He does this better than any other director I can think of, who use it in amoral, cartoon form. QT's violence is the most real of any in film, and it is shown here again.<br/><br/>The finale is a visual spectacle beyond words. There are some stretches in credulity in its formulation, and some holes could have been filled, but the fantasy itself is effective. The tragic end of two heroines is well-dramatized, maybe as a twist on other movies where the women are the ones that live. QT's additional statement on flammable film and Riefenstahl are interesting and timely, considering her death not long ago. The turning of Waltz's Landa is quite a stretch, but feasible, since he is a calculating man above all else. However, it seems nearly impossible that a man so dedicated to Nazi ideology would so blithely turn against the entire structure. You really expect to see Pitt get a taste of his own medicine, and he just becomes a secretary. Its truly anticlimactic, but QT makes you wonder if this is on purpose.<br/><br/>The film has far less of the cutesy, hip dialogue of other QT films, which I appreciated, and the inclusion of German, French and British characters speaking their own languages adds much authenticity. The QT signature film tricks also don't detract, and are kept brief and informative. My only gripe with his music selection was the 80s Bowie song Putting Out Fire. I cant believe he couldn't have found a WWII-era French song to put behind her. That was truly a mistake.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is very watchable, and usually beautiful. Scenes in the finale mix the imagery of film, light, fire, mayhem, nazi symbols, and cartoon violence in a way that takes your breath away, and pulls you in several directions at once. The theater itself becomes a gas chamber for the whole nazi idea, with the Bear Jew firing down on the crowd just as SS men fired at jews in ditches. Meanwhile, a mini-drama of brutality, compassion, and the error of showing compassion in wartime is played out in the projection room. The film even throws in some references to the warrior philosophy of the Apache, in my mind as a goad to those who would cower to the Nazis.<br/><br/>Whatever its imperfections, the film uses (not abuses) much of the symbology of WWII to give us a cathartic fantasy rewriting of history. I don't see how people can say it has no value. The casting of the Germans and the French is fantastic, and the plot, scenes and pacing are tight. The violence is realistic, but more in the employ of a bigger reworking of the symbolism of WWII and film itself. Plus it has some great actors from not just the USA, but Europe as well. Whatever its slight errors, IB is one for the cinematic history books."
"gevalero","6","2","8","11 October 2009"," Unintersting Basterds
","Just how far can a movie go overboard without looking downright silly ?. It's not that the excellent KILL BILL series didn't go take a similar path but I found the ending of INGLORIOUS BASTARDS so violent, so silly and so out of touch with any sense of reality I really lost all interest in the story. Additionaly I would have thought ""the Jew Hunter"" would have been much, much smarter than to trust his life in the hands of the Basterds so when his fate comes I had no feelings one way or the other. Some of the dialog in this movie is as fun as that in the other Tarantino films but within a list of such, I have to place BASTERDS right above JACKIE BROWN but well below PULP FICTION, KILL BILL or even RESERVOIR DOGS."
"Argemaluco","7","2","8","9 October 2009"," Interesting but very far from Tarantino's best
","I am a big fan of director Quentin Tarantino's work, but I took a huge disappointment with Death Proof, at the same time it made me see that Tarantino was not infallible as I thought he was before watching that film.Death Proof had been full of loooooong and horribly tedious sequences which had insipid dialogs and which did not lead anywhere.I found Tarantino's indulgence on that film to be unforgiven, because his obsession for making a tribute to the 70's cinema took preponderance over the narrative and his usually clear vision.<br/><br/>So, because of that, I had a bit of distrust before watching Inglourious Basterds, another tribute to a genre (""Nazi exploitation"") which was popular on previous decades but which was extinguished over the time for finally becoming into a historical curiosity, and whose films are more interesting for their anachronism than for their intrinsic quality.And although I enjoyed many ""Nazi exploitation"" films, I did not think they are worthy of a rebirth.<br/><br/>At least that was my perception before watching the film.After having seen it, I noticed that Tarantino's intention was showing two facets which coexist on the same movie; on the one hand, he wanted to make a cathartic film with plentiful violence and action; and on the other hand, he wanted to make a sober drama about the ideological conflict behind World War II.I think those two facets are not very well balanced, but they help to each other for finally creating an interesting and entertaining experience, but which is not very memorable after all.<br/><br/>I will start with the complains I have with this movie.First of all, I think Tarantino urgently needs an editor or producer who can instill some narrative discipline on him.Tarantino has always been interested in creating juicy conversations, but he exceeded a little bit on that in Inglorious Basterds (although not as much as in Death Proof), at the same time that makes him loose the narrative focus on a few occasions.That was definitely an obstacle I had to completely plunge myself on an interesting story.<br/><br/>Besides, I do not think the story was completely well planned; I think that the elements of action and violence were the least lucky from the movie, and that includes the ""basterds"" from the title.And finally, I did not find Brad Pitt to be completely credible on his role.I consider him to be a great actor, but he honestly irritated me a little bit in here.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Inglourious Basterds has various positive elements, so I finished liking it after all.The best element from this movie is the aspect of the espionage and conspiracy from the Resistance, thanks to Tarantino's solid direction and the excellent performances from a group of European actors, where the members who mostly stand out are Mélanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz.<br/><br/>So, in spite of its various fails, I liked Inglourious Basterds and I can recommend it as an interesting movie.It is definitely an enormous step forward of Death Proof, but it is very far from reaching the heights of Tarantino's best movies (Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, by my humble point of view).Clearly, Inglorious Basterds is one of his least achieved movies, but it entertained me anyway."

"kosmasp","9","2","8","27 September 2009"," Waltz with Pitt
","C. Waltz is the new discovery in this movie. He might have had a following in German speaking countries, but with this movie, he's getting world famous. Speaking 4 languages (and that's only in this movie, who knows how many more he is able to master) and being the main actor in this, despite the title of the movie. Which leads us to one thing that might be appalling to some people (especially to those who love(d) the original ""Inglorious Bastards"").<br/><br/>The thing is that the ""Basterds"" (and yes the spelling mistake was intentional by Mr. Tarantino) do not get that much screen time. It's almost as if their story isn't the main act. You could have a problem with that (not only as a fan as stated above), so be aware that this is more an ensemble picture. And as said, Mr. Waltz is fantastic (I'm pretty sure we're gonna see more of him soon). Brad Pitt would be the second one to mention. Eli Roth on the other hand, as fun as it is to see him on the big screen, he just doesn't fit the bill. Til Schweiger and the other German and European actors are all really good. I'd say that some give the performance of their life.<br/><br/>Speaking of the actors, one of the things that I really loved, is the fact that the movie is at least tri-lingual (is that a word?), french/German/English (with a bit of Italian thrown in there for good measure). That means a lot of subtitles if you watch the original version. But it works (imo) and makes the movie that much better.<br/><br/>Another thing that you shouldn't expect though, is too much action. I heard quite a few people that criticized the movie, for being too talky. But that's Tarantino for you. There is action of course, but the long running time (might be a bummer for some) is made up by many conversations. There is tension, there is fun to be had, but the movie does take it's time to reach it's goal. Again, something that won't work for everybody. Great movie that cements Tarantinos status as great director."

"thefinisher_23","8","2","8","21 September 2009"," ""We in Tarantino-lovin business. And cousin, business is a boomin!""
","Quentin Tarantino may be the most unique American filmmaker to date. He is one of the best. He finds a way to make himself both scarce and unique all at once. His latest, ""Inglorious Basterds"" is no exception to his norm. It is an entertaining, thrilling, unique and character driven movie that excels at making us pay attention. Not to the lights and sounds of the movie but to the dialogue and those saying it. Does that not sound like the typical description of Tarantino? Anyone who has seen the trailer knows that Brad Pitt is Aldo Raine and that he leads a group of Jewish-American soldiers masquerading as a group hell-bent on scalping Nazi's. Along with Sgt. Donnie (Hostel director Eli Roth), Hugo Stigglitz (Til Schweiger who will forever be identified with this role) Lt. Raine and succeed in making such headway in the ""Nazi-killin business"" that Hitler mentions in outrage that a certain team member is not to be referred to as ""The Bear Jew."" Did you know that one of the main characters in this story has never heard of the Basterds nor will she ever meet them? The lone survivor of a blatant slaughter, young Shoshanna (Melanie Laurent in an Oscar-nomination worthy role) resurfaces as the owner of a movie theater in Nazi-occupied Paris. Soon she becomes object of Pvt. Frederick Zoller's (Daniel Bruhl) affection. Their relationship or lack thereof, is the most prominent one in the film. The one intertwining character is the film's best. The charming, curious, intelligent, disgusting, immoral, well-read Col. Landa (Christopher Waltz, who becomes the hands down front-runner for Best Supporting Actor) pursues not only the Basterds but keeps bumping into Shoshanna. Even he would have been surprised by just exactly the fire started.<br/><br/>The plot of this film rewrites history but only the crucial parts. The funny thing not only is change meant for us to revel in but I barely stopped to think on the lack of textbook accuracy. This movie is full of images that will stick with you far after the lights come back on. The only linger because they were introduced to us with such color and voice. The violence is there but as always with Tarantino it furthers the story. This film feels at times like a western set in the East. The vast majority of these characters are simple men with moral or immoral agendas. That's all. The soundtrack is great as well. Not overbearing but certainly mood setting. The acting is great to and once again proves you don't need the big names to make a movie work just the great ones. I can't say enough about Brad Pitt so I won't. If he isn't the biggest and perhaps best actor working I can only think of one other. He is effortless here as he was as Benjamin Button. In some places he is intense and you can see the wheels working (see: Fight Club). In a place like this you forget he is who he is and you just see the character. That is the beauty of this film and perhaps Tarantino's films in general. You can take it for what it is no matter what you just saw the outcome is simple by film's end. Simple but it sticks with you. The dialogue and plot maybe the most unique thing you've ever seen but it resonates as a simple outcome lead by glorious characters. This is not the year's best film but it is in fact one of the best films to grace the cinema in 2009. Congratulations Quentin Tarantino, you are this movie's starand thank you for the last line of dialogue. He is speaking right to us."

Brad Pitt was amazing, although I'm not so sure I like the revenge angle very much, but he was still great. The movie moves slow, but it's well worth the wait to see how it all pans out. There were several powerful scenes in this movie, starting from the beginning where we're introduced to one of the most complex characters I've seen in film in years. He is a man who hunts Jews in France and in the beginning of the movie he is on the hunt for people hiding in rural France. He has a long conversation with a man who is assisting some of his local country men, and in the end the man has to divulge that he is in fact hiding people. The scene is drawn-out and filled with tension. It is indicative of some of the other scenes to come. What a great movie."

","Not having read the user comments section of this web site before I saw the movie (I had read a couple of favorable critical reviews), I was quite taken aback by the divided response. No-one walked out of the packed session I went to. For one thing, it passed the watch test – in the 150 minute running time I looked at my watch not once. The blend of comedy, film buffery and action overlays some seriousness of purpose. Yes, in war both sides are capable of atrocities and generally commit them without much thought. Yes, some Nazis were witty, intelligent and charming, if not actually lovable. Yes, the world would have been a different place if Hitler and his gang had been disposed of in the summer of 1944. This is entertainment, not history, however, even if the German uniforms and wartime French bars are painstakingly reproduced.<br/><br/>I thought the whole thing was very well constructed. The 5 long ""chapters"", with their own denouements are all carefully linked. Apart from the final catharsis, they all feature the quiet build-up of tension through conversation to an almost unbearable degree – final moments of mayhem come as a relief. Yes, it's a very talky movie but the dialogue has many flashes of brilliance. I'm sorry for all those who don't like subtitles – I thought they were well used. But wasn't there too much sadism, blood and gore? That's war folks.<br/><br/>Even the sternest critics concede the Austrian actor Christoph Waltz put in a stunning performance as Colonel Landa the urbane SS Jew hunter. Brad Pitt's hillbilly chief basterd, Aldo Raine, was somewhat overshadowed, but it was not a very demanding part. Melanie Laurent as Shosanna, the young Jewish cinema owner bent on revenge, relied more on her beauty than histrionics, but her presence was unforgettable. It was nice to see that Rod Taylor at 80 can still do Churchillian tones. About the only below par performance was Mike Myers (""Austin Powers""), totally miscast as a British general. Daniel Bruhl from ""Goodbye Lenin"" was excellent as Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels' blue-eyed boy who falls for Shosanna.<br/><br/>As for the film buffery, some I appreciated, some went over my head, and some was below my radar, but I can't say it interfered with my enjoyment of the film. I didn't really see this movie as a spoof of the World War II film genre, a major part of my movie diet when I was growing up. Tarantino has added something of his own here – he's Spielberg with a sense of humour and an understanding of that allegedly rare American trait, irony. As the unfortunate (and unfortunately named) Lt Archie Hicox), film critic turned not terribly successful secret agent, might have said ""I await with eager anticipation and great trepidation this director's next work."""
"ze_fritz","7","2","8","14 September 2009"," a to b to c movie mash up that only fails to convince when you don't give in
","From what I've seen in the trailers that have been leaked in the internet early this year I didn't expect that much from this film. There has been some hype in the local Berlin press last autumn while the crew was filming in Potsdam and in Saxony which was kind of getting annoying (i.e. ""look where Brad and Quentin and Til (! the German version of Brad Pitt without the acting skills) had their night out"" etc.) and the choice of German actor's for supporting roles seemed odd, because some of them are today's B-movie guys. Unlike Pam Grier or Kurt Russell who stand for a specific time and convey some kind of 'cult' feel because of the weird quality of the B-movies they starred in back in the 70s and 80s, here we have some German TV-actors who stand for, well, not that much... especially not for the majority of viewers who have never seen them before... and it's amazing to see that some of these actors can pull off a decent performance because they are directed by someone who is very talented and knows the abilities and limits of his cast (well, Eli Roth might be an exception)<br/><br/>It was unlike what I have expected. There were great dialogues, sometimes a bit too long, sometimes a bit self-indulgent, most of the time great performances (thank God Tarrantino himself didn't show up) and suspense despite logical flaws (logic's not that important here though). Waltz (who I have hardly ever noticed before) and Melanie Laurent (so so beautiful) great discoveries, Pitt actually funny in a trashy kind of way. There are strange intellectual shifts where you have to concentrate and suddenly afterwards just throw everything (including your brain) overboard. If you are not willing to give yourself in to this 'cinematic experiment' (sounds awful, I couldn't come up with a different expression) and watch accordingly, I can totally understand all the one-star raters who find this film boring, unnecessarily violent (the baseball bat scene: I think you don't have to be emotionally dead to NOT take this seriously) pretentious and arbitrary.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, I found myself strangely satisfied by the slaughter towards the end... it obviously had this payback feeling of 80s violent street gang or Chuck Norris movies, it was obviously silly that the evil Nazi viewers who have laughed at the dying American soldiers in that ridiculously stupid film just 2 minutes before (very funny I thought) are now dying themselves and are being laughed at by us watching the film (believe me, as a German you really want to see Hitler or Goebbels being finally shot because they still haunt you even when you were born long after they died... you want to kill them for you having to feel uncomfortable with your nationality and destroying it's rep and history within just 12 years)... and it's odd to get this childish or primitive feeling of satisfying revenge. Interesting."

There is no pretending that this is the real thing, no effing way, this is just a war movie. And funny too. The reason it is funny at times is because it is not about the real thing. This is a war story we made up when we were ten yrs old and ran trough the woods with plastic machine guns and sticks which we called rifles. We actually played WW2, with a concentration camp, dug outs and trenches, and lo behold, for a moment we were in this kind of war.

","Inglourious Basterds is a fictional account of World War II and is divided into several chapters. The first of these introduces us to the Jew Hunter (Christoph Waltz), Col. Hans Landa, a detective-like Nazi who specialises in tracking down Jews that are hiding throughout France. The other stories involve Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), a French woman who has inherited a cinema after the murder of her family, and the Basterds a group of Allied soldiers led by Lt Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) who have become notorious for their brutal executions and scalping of Nazi soldiers. These threads come together when Dreyfus meets a Nazi actor whose new film will be premiering, along with the German Reich, at her cinema. Both Dreyfus and the Basterds hatch separate plots to blow up the cinema.<br/><br/>After the misfire of Death Proof, Quentin Tarantino's contribution to Grindhouse, one had to question whether one of the most influential directors of the nineties had run his course. Fortunately, Inglourious Basterds not only represents Tarantino's return to form but he has developed what could be one of the most creative films of the year. The title of the film remains as a homage to the Italian picture, Quel maledetto treno blindato – The Inglourious Bastards. The difference between that film and Tarantino's Bastards is that this is both a parody and a homage to the very brand of cinema that Tarantino's loves himself.<br/><br/>His comic book version of World War II is thickly wrapped in a rapidly shifting tone of drama, cynicism, satire and comedy. The contrast between the intense opening scenes of the Jew Hunter interrogating a farmer, to others that feature Brad Pitt's wonderful comic timing as Lt. Aldo Raine, makes the film a complete roller-coaster of emotions for the audience. Given the changes in tone, along with the intensity of Tarantino's trademark lengthy dialogue sequences, the impact of the ultra violence has been dramatically increased, perhaps more so than any of his previous films. Aiding a great deal of the tension of these scenes are the performances. All of the actors are impressive, particularly in the timing of some very funny dialogue. Brad Pitt is a standout as the squared jawed Raine but Christoph Waltz steals his thunder, wholly creepy as the Jew Hunter. His character with his wry smile is almost proud of the most heinous things he is doing. He is really impressive.<br/><br/>While many of the dialogue sequences are extremely long, one of the biggest improvements over Death Proof is that many of these conversations are integrated around some form of dramatic irony and tension – they are no longer as pointless as they were in the past. Just as we begin to wonder how long the Jew Hunter will interrogate the farmer for example, the camera slowly submerges beneath the floorboards to reveal to the audience a Jewish girl hiding and covering her mouth to not make a sound.<br/><br/>The film is also bolstered by Tarantino's pop culture references, allowing Inglourious Basterds to act as a satire of cinema itself. From the inclusion of the French cinema itself, a game of celebrity heads, to the casting of Brad Pitt, Mike Myers, Eli Roth and Samuel L Jackson in an unbilled narration, we are constantly reminded that this is a film and one that is entirely conscious of what it is: highly dramatic, over the top and ultra violent. As the Nazis sit back, clapping and cheering the onslaught on their own screen in the film, we know that this is indeed a continuation of Tarantino's fascination with violence as one of the most fun things to watch. These references seem to be a lot stronger and more prominent here than in previous films and really strengthen his brand of satire. He is a very clever filmmaker.<br/><br/>The self-awareness of Inglourious Basterds allows it to be one of the most unique experiences of the year and a completely fresh take on many of the clichés of the World War II genre. Although the brief but ultra violence may deter some, there is a sharper and cleverer film at work here, one that is often very funny and entirely conscious of its audience's expectations for Tarantino's work. It is a very impressive and timely return to form for the director."
"darrentlb","9","2","8","5 September 2009"," Tarantino being Tarantino
","The first part of this review is a critique of other reviewers. If you don't like the film, that's fine, not everyone's cup of tea, I get it. But what I cannot fathom are those who criticize QT as having lost his touch and not being up to his prior films or that he is living off his past accomplishments. Tarantino is self-indulgent? Well duh, of course he is, he's Tarantino. His movies are his art, and by that I mean he considers movie-making like making art. He revels in the process, he pays homage to other movies that have influenced him. In every movie he makes, a good portion of the movie is about the form itself. Long dialogue scenes are a pretty common occurrence in most of his films. To those who say they were overly long and added nothing to the movie, really don't know what you were watching.<br/><br/>Also, I take issue with the other reviewers moral equivalence that equates the hatred of the Jews/Basterds towards the Nazis to the Nazi hatred of Jews simply for being Jews. Why did they brutalize the Nazis? Did you miss Aldo's (Pitt's) speech to the Basterds about why scalps would be taken and Nazis would be mutilated.<br/><br/>Now, as for the movie, a beautiful mix of revenge fantasy, spaghetti western sensibility, and that classic Tarantino mix of brutal violence and sardonic blacker than black humor. An interweaving of 3 different story lines that all resolve together in a climactic, beautiful, gory, red, fiery, and fulfilling blood stained finish. Though some may have yearned for more screen time for the basterds and there grisly punishments of the Nazi troops and less of the extended dialogue scenes, these scenes each contained a palpable tension and a rising sense of dread as to where they were headed and were entertaining in their own right. I will not retell the story as I think you the reader should see for yourself if you agree with what Aldo Raine says ""might be his greatest masterpiece""."
"bennyhagen","9","2","8","4 September 2009"," Tarantino has seen and memorized every movie ever produced from 1914 - 1988
","Tarantino proves that he is a genuine genius as a scriptwriter and director as well with his most refined movie up to date. People who will say that they didn't like this because it's gory will have to rent the next Adam Sandler movie instead. Also, this is a fairytale. I wonder why a lot of people didn't get that. It was just about time someone burned the Nazi leadership after 53 years of us being forced to watch how Hitler is invulnerable to explosions.<br/><br/>I love Tarantinos special style of cinematography. Instead of experimenting with angles and tricks he lets the camera serve the story with perfectly composed, sharp images. There is also a certain concept in the colorful sets as everything seems to be put into place perfectly and looks kind of artificial. In a good sense, it's unique.<br/><br/>The only problem might have been for me, that along the fantastic conversations the main story may have got a bit short and I probably could have used a bit more stuff with those Basterds. Nothing that a terrific Christoph Waltz doesn't make up for.<br/><br/>9/10"
"matlefebvre20","9","2","8","3 September 2009"," Glorious Tarantino
","Without the shadow of a doubt, Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" is the most expensive, the most profitable, the best crafted and the most enjoyable Nazi exploitation B-movie ever made.<br/><br/>Tarantino is probably the most talented filmmaker of his generation and he shows us why once again with a gem of a picture. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a movie which, just like World War II itself, makes the viewer experience a whole combinations of emotions before it's over. Sometimes shocking, sometimes hilarious, while also having strong emotion, suspense, fascination and absurdity, the movie is a joyous mix of war movie scenes that we never get to see in any other war movie.<br/><br/>""Basterds"" contains a nice cast of stars who make the movie work perfectly. In the main role, Brad Pitt plays Southern-American Lt. Aldo Raine, the leader of a squad of Jewish-American soldiers (and a few German renegades) whose job in occupied France can be summed up as this: go hunting Nazi soldiers and giving them a free scalping session. ""Each man must carry out 100 scalps to accomplish his mission"", Raine says to his crew.<br/><br/>The surprising Austian actor Christoph Waltz plays the part of Nazi colonel Hans Landa, also known as ""The Jew Hunter"". His initial role is more or less the same as Raine, but in the opposite direction. He tracks Jews and... well, you get the idea. And much like Raine, Landa is intelligent, but also very sly. He can simultaneously become as charming as a cat, as rapacious as a vulture and as dangerous as a bear. And Waltz perfectly embodies this man. The acting prize he received at the Cannes Film Festival for his Landa part was fully merited. And he should eventually be considered for the Best Supporting Actor Award at Oscar time.<br/><br/>French actress Mélanie Laurent plays the third character in importance in the movie: Shoshanna Dreyfus, who escaped from the cruel colonel's claws and became the owner of a small movie theatre in Paris. And when she meets the star (Daniel Brühl) of an upcoming German propaganda film, she gets to receive many high-ranked Nazi officers (including Joseph Goebbels and Adolf Hitler himself), which would be the perfect moment to unleash her vengeance against the Third Reich.<br/><br/>Put all of these ingredients in the blender, press the ""hi"" button, add a few more juicy and spicy scenes, and then you get a full explosion of flavours, each one tastier than the others. Quentin Tarantino is an accomplished director, but his biggest talent still resides in his capacity to write stories and screenplays. If you think that age can get a hold on the great QT and tone down his explosive creative impulses, only a small glimpse at ""Inglourious Basterds"" will make you think otherwise. Tarantino's talent has remained perfectly intact and everything that turned his other movies into masterpieces is here to create another one.<br/><br/>And the main part of Tarantino's talent consists in grabbing our attention and to keep it firmly without inserting any action, nor making the story move forward in significant ways. Tarantino's dialogues are always filled with fascination and to listen to the movie without keeping much attention to the screen is thrilling. There is simply no other filmmaker in the world who can do such a trick.<br/><br/>And when comes the time to get into the action, Tarantino builds a story filled with twists, as well as surprising and spectacular scenes which hold the moviegoers in suspense until the very end. And you can forget all the historical veracity. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is not a docudrama, far from it. It's simply the kind of movie that a European director working with a tiny budget would have made if his only goal was to get a mock of Hitler and his Nazi pawns.<br/><br/>Don't try to get into any deep meanings regarding what you see on screen. There's absolutely no symbolic about a Jewish squad who scalp Nazi soldiers or let them live after they carve Swastikas on their forehead with a knife. Don't try to understand anything about the climax of the movie in Shoshanna's theatre, even as brutal, spectacular and unexpected as it can be. The characters' dialogues are tasty, but they are not metaphorical. The entire movie is just one big pollution.<br/><br/>Actually, Quentin Tarantino's entire filmography is one big pollution. Is there anything to understand in ""Reservoir Dogs"" ? In ""Pulp Fiction"" ? And especially in ""Kill Bill"" ? There's nothing to understand. ""Inglourious Basterds"", just like those movies, is nothing more than an unhealthy drug which you quickly get addicted to, even though you're conscious of its repugnance. But is there anything wrong about that? If the movie is funny, brilliant, intelligent and leaves smiles on the viewers' faces after the credits roll, frankly, what would be wrong about that? <br/><br/>And once again, Tarantino gives die-hard movie buffs the occasion to get into a handful of delicious movie references. Shoshanna's theatre is filled with French movie posters from the Occupation era, something film historians will love. And as for the atmosphere, we're treated with scenes which seem to come out from the more intense Spaghetti Westerns and re-worked the WWII way. And it wouldn't be complete without a few samples of Ennio Morricone's music, would it? <br/><br/>If you consider the sky-high expectations for this movie, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is exactly what we would have expected from the great Quentin Tarantino. Let's hope he'll never change his style and remain into the unconventional side of Hollywood film-making, because there's really no other man on this planet who treats cinema the way he does."

","The first thing, me and my friend are Tarantino fans and through that this film might flop, but after watching this film in the cinema we both walk out and looked at each other and said... It's a Quentin Tarantino Film.<br/><br/>Now that doesn't mean the only reason we liked this film because it's a Quentin Tarantino production, no.<br/><br/>By the advert it would make it seem like a killing spree of a film with no talking and Brad Pitt showing his 6 pack then chopping Himmler's head of and shoving it up Hitler's ass and they lived happy ever after.<br/><br/>Actually I through this film doesn't have a lot of action scene in it (compared to Kill Bill). There is don't worry about that, and when it happens you really know it's happening, but most the film does a sort of Pulp Fiction telling different stories, But unlike Pulp Fiction all the stories go to the main one, not having their own little ending and you have to assume what happens next. This is no Pulp Fiction don't worry, completely new and original. When I say original, I mean you will not say ""oh that scene's like the one out of die hard or dirty dancing"" (bad examples I know) but you should know what I mean.<br/><br/>There is a very good opening scene which shows Christoph Waltz who play an excellent part as Col. Hans Landapart aka the Jew hunter who by his name should give it away goes round and finds, you guessed it, Jews, Goes to a small French family and has a very casual at first but then powerful talk with him about hiding Jews. It shows what it must have been like back then to be in that situation the fear of having a horrible Nazi talking to you. But his not shouting or threatening to kill his children he is as I said having a casual talk with him as if he was a old friend, but his a brilliant nasty piece of work ! His one of thought's Gary Oldman bad guys who you really love to hate! You'll find out why when you see it, his very well done! Anyway back to the main film. The film itself is excellent, the action scenes involve the normal Quentin the more blood the better, but not like Kill bill with the watery blood going up in the air when an arm comes flying off. A bit more realistic in Quentin's world anyway. There's a scene in this film which makes you feel how you felt in Reservoir Dogs. When his pouring on the petrol and your thinking ""oh s***, Oh S***."" the suspense is horrible and your thinking ""Just burn him already"" whiles his dancing round him, but in that film he gets out of it and doesn't burn to death. In Inglourious Basterds the scene with Eli Roth and a baseball bat, he comes walking out of this room banging the bat against the wall and you can't see him. He does this for about 20 to 30 seconds whiles his slowly walking out... It's the longest 20 to 30 seconds in movie history, and the scene that follows his quite horrific.<br/><br/>There were two great scenes but there is a lot more where that came from. You'll probably walk out the cinema with a lot of things to think about, you might need some counselling of some sort but apart from that a excellent film .....And some great quotes! Go see this film!"

"The-Kissable-Writer","9","2","8","2 September 2009"," Tarantino is back with a bang!
","I just left the theater so I'm still walking on air and will try to tone down the praise words in this '""high"" state of writing. ""Inglourious Basterds"" - no that aren't spelling errors - is already declared film of the year by many critics, though I must add predominantly by the ones that have a sense of humor. In Tarantino's latest revenge parable, fire is fought with fire: Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) leads a group of scalping, brain bashing, trigger happy Jewish-American soldiers through occupied France. But, surprisingly, that's not the whole plot-outline. For the first time since his Elmore Leonard adaptation (Jackie Brown), The Big T. hangs on to correct chronology, and one can hardly call Inglourious Basterds a plot-driven thriller pur-sang but it's got some thriller-elements. Tarantino is restrained and he creates tension in his plot, and builds up to a climax beautifully. <br/><br/>Mélanie Laurent (playing Soshanna) is a slightly fantastic revelation and nice name to add to the list of ""Tarantino girls"", which has become an understanding much like - no disrespect - a ""Hitchcock blonde"". Her role requires her to play an understated kind of fear - the German soldiers musn't suspect her Jewish ethnicity nor her plan to blow up the cinema. After his brilliant moron in ""Burn After Reading"", Brad Pitt once again gets to fit the shoe of comic, and he wears it brilliantly. The part where he introduces himself in Italian to the German officer in quite possibly the thickest accent in cinema history floored me, and he steals about a dozen more scenes with his deadpan delivery of dialog that can only flow from Quentin's pen (""You know, fightin' in a basement offers a lot of difficulties. Number one being, you're fightin' in a basement!"").<br/><br/>I thought the scene in the bar (with the three-finger order of whiskey) easily stood as brilliant among some good and excellent sequences (I'm not the story of the Negro coming to America? Then I must be King Kong then!) The opening scene was also jawdropping, the close-up of the hiding Jew's eye through the floorboards, amazing.<br/><br/>These are two twenty+ minute scenes, very talkative and large parts in German or French. Quentin doesn't need the dialog to be in English to create almost unbearable tension! That's one of the things I admired most about the film. Did the subtitles bother anybody? I hate how Tarantino casted his director-friend (not actor-friend) Eli Roth (of the horrid ""Hostel"" movies) as the Jew Bear. He barely manages not to ruin his scenes. Barely. Diane Kruger's capable of better acting, she's another weak link, especially since that other blonde (Mélanie Laurent) is SO good, it's not a thankful role for an actress/actor with not a great deal of experience in high-profile movies, your co-stars will overshadow you if you don't watch out.<br/><br/>I'll be surprised if Christoph Waltz (Colonel Landa), come Februari, doesn't get an Oscar nomination. We already know the Academy's much less conservative these last few years. The dark ""The Departed"" won best picture and Javier Bardem also took home the gold for his portrayal of a sadistic ""basterd"" Wink.<br/><br/>At the time of writing, IB holds the number 35 spot (IMDb top 250). Pulp Fiction still stands strong on 5 and Reservoir Dogs claims number 71. Mathematical conclusion: IB is Quentin's greatest movie since Pulp Fiction. Reviewer's conclusion: damn straight! The Verdict: 8.5/10"

","This is the first time i review a movie, nothing better than a good one to begin with. I have to agree with most people that this is a great movie, and i had great expectations when many compared this to Pulp Fiction. The idea had great potential and judging by the trailer, it sure looked like it. A terrible shame that it fails to deliver the pace Pulp Fiction did, instead reminds me of Grindhouse. QT committed the same mistake with the previous one, too much dialog and few action. If you watched the trailer, be advised that it shows almost all actions scenes for the entire movie. That was a big disappointment for this déjà vu, could have been more dramatic, there should be shown some real Nazi cruelty. Don't get me wrong, it sure is a great movie, but many may consider this quite boring. The acting is great, but Christoph Waltz, does stand out for his great performance."

I had mentioned to my wife that someday, someone would write a book based on how a revenge-minded Jew would travel to Germany and become a serial killer in a community. I guess this film is as close to my prediction as I'll ever get and Mr. Tarantino pulls out all the stops. Man is this one brutally bloody two and a half hours YET highly highly interesting due to intriguing celluloid fiction coupled with exquisite cinematography,two language subtitles and a marvelous piece of acting by Christoph Waltz as ""Jew Hunter"" Col.Hans Landa. The movie is far from just being a naked tale about a Jewish American squad of soldiers led by Brad Pitt to exact murder on anyone wearing a German uniform; it also deals with love, devotion, dedication, twists, turns and betrayal.

The German <br/><br/>Born and raised in Germany, son to a French mother and a German father, indoctrinated with anti-Fascist ideology throughout my whole socialization process, being taught to always be aware of the neo-Fascist threat, always wavering between fearful revulsion for and sneering dismissing of their ideas of superiority over other races, nations and other sets of belief than their own, I watched this film and felt... repelled! Nazi characters that I have no other choice but to feel pity and admiration for, be it for bravery and devotion (the ""batting"" scene), ingenuity and brilliancy (nearly every scene with Christoph Waltz) or an unbreakable fighting spirit (the ""nation's pride""'s fight for Shosanna's sympathy)??? No way! In my opinion those people that were once German like me, with the same cultural background of the Age of Enlightenment... They lost their right to be seen and particularly being depicted as admirable human beings the minute they embraced and acted by the ideology of the Third Reich! Showing them as somewhat tragic victims or, even worse, glorifying them as quasi-heroic examples for good character with minor flaws only evokes false and misguided sympathy in the uneducated and the ignorant, spreading tolerance for their ideas! Ideologically, this is an awful movie! <br/><br/>2. The Cosmopolitan<br/><br/>Jeez, German part of me, just chill! Isn't it enough that the whole world already thinks you have no sense of humor? Do you really have to prove the cliché right by going on a rampage against a fictional piece of art? And, by the way, this film was awesome, even by the means of ideology! I mean, the brilliant story aside, just think about Tarantino's multicultural approach on the production of the film: utilization of accurate and clever dialogue in 4 languages; involvement of numerous native speaking cast and extras; his choice to shoot most of the film in Germany, thereby providing jobs and strenghtening the economy of your region... Do I really have to go on? Oh, and if my memory serves me right, wasn't there this day some time ago when you strolled through the alleys of Görlitz Old Town, saw the preparations for the shooting and wished you could be part of this film? I smell hypocrisy, my friend! <br/><br/>All in all this production is an admirable example for an inspired international and politically outstanding co-operation, that I wish more producers would follow. OK, maybe some of the plot elements are somewhat arguable, but remember: It is a fictional story of revenge, not a documentary, deploying fictional characters. Therefore, your argument against Tarantino's right to depict the Nazis as associable human beings is not valid. Also, in the end justice prevails and the bad boys, whose flaws are BTW much bigger than their good traits, get what they deserve, so the glorification you speak of doesn't happen at all. Now, my angry German friend, just sit back and relax, and let the people out there make up their own minds, OK? Good boy! <br/><br/>Craziest and most entertaining movie I've seen in a loooong time!"

It's like he says, ""Here, you can watch it. I'm through with it now."" Another director who makes movies the same way is John Waters.<br/><br/>-- By the final minutes, after two and a half hours, the audience is saying, you better pay off QT.

","My wife saw this in a packed theater in Lyon, France. She called me immediately afterward to tell me she thought it was by far the best movie of the year. I hadn't seen it yet, but I knew from what I had read and because it was a QT film, that it was fairly violent. I was shocked. This is the woman who walked out of ""Gladiator"" because she found the violence in that film ""pornographic"".<br/><br/>We saw it together last night. I did notice some people walked out after an hour or so. I found it difficult to judge my reaction immediately after the movie. I knew I liked it, but it took a while for all of it to sink in. It is so rich with dialogue, sets, costuming, and some spectacular acting performances. Christoph Waltz stands at the top. I'm not sure if the Academy will put him in the Best Actor or Best Supporting category (their rationale is confusing and inconsistent), but he deserves to win regardless.<br/><br/>This is QT's best since Pulp Fiction and an example of movie craft at its finest."
"fundaquayman","8","2","8","28 August 2009"," Tarantino tribute to old-school cinema
","Whether this is Tarantino's tribute to old school WWII film in the tradition of THE DIRTY DOZEN, or his way of paying homage to his trademarks using a war film setting, watching INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS makes me think the Weinsteins wanted to make sure the audience is not just the Tarantino fan base, but also older audiences who has their personal connection to stories set in WWII (whether from personal experience, or just from having grown up watching classic war films).<br/><br/>While Brad Pitt gets top billing, it is the European actors like Christoph Waltz, Til Schweiger, and Melanie Laurent, who really steal the show. This film, in fact, has more German and French dialogue than English. Christoph Waltz, in particular, delivers an amazing performance that is on par with Ulrich Muhe's in THE LIVES OF OTHERS. Every time the guy is on screen, the tension and suspense is so thick you could slice it with a knife.<br/><br/>If you're looking for Tarantino trademarks (including the abundance of trademarks from other movies and filmmakers that inspired those Tarantino has made himself known for), this movie is filled with them, and deviced and laid out so conspicuously that it's fit for a ""spot the trade mark"" drinking game. Whether there is any anti-war sentiment intended, it almost seems irrelevant - it's catharsis all the way through from start to finish. Any message is more of an inference the audience would need to create out of their own imagination and sentiments.<br/><br/>As with almost all Tarantino films, forgotten stars are brought back to the screen (e.g. Travolta in PULP FICTION, Pam Grier & Robert Forster in JACKIE BROWN, etc.). Whatever career boosts previous Tarantino films managed to bring to has-been stars, this one was just a nice touch with the cameo of 50's screen heartthrob ROD TAYLOR (who played lead-roles in the original TIME MACHINE, and Hitchcock's THE BIRDS) in a short scene as Winston Churchhill. The use of Ennio Morricone scores worked very well with the photography to remind everyone what made movies great before the age of CGI and video cinematography.<br/><br/>Now if only Brad Pitt could move away from his over-the-top mash-up of Southern accents that's reminiscent of Early Grayce (KALIFORNIA), the experience would have been more to my ""satisFICation."" Nevertheless, this is probably Tarantino's most Oscar-friendly work to date."
"rdforbesb","9","2","8","26 August 2009"," So Close to perfection...
","I am now convinced that quentins next movie will be one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds opens with an extremely powerful scene consisting of two speaking characters. To me, this opening was similar to pulp fiction and reservoir dogs in that it opened with cold dialogue at a dinner table.<br/><br/>The thing I enjoy most about the direction in this movie is how quentin creates so much suspense in his dialogue. Every piece of dialogue is insightful or darkly comedic. You will not find any corny ""GET DOWNS""s or ""LOOK OUT""s. Even the transitions in the spoken launguages is explained! Though I would like to have seen more Basterds, this film was a perfect Quentin Tarantino Flick. Bravo Quentin. Now bring some of the crazy action from KILL BILL and your next movie will blow them all away!"
"praxis1966-1","9","2","8","26 August 2009"," Inglourious? Quite the opposite!
","Basterds rates right up there with the top movies I've seen in the theatre this year. I'm not yet sure whether it outstrips Paper Heart, Away We Go, and Gamorrah, but it certainly comes close.<br/><br/>Tarantino's latest effort sees him return to the form and promise he showed in the early part of his career, a la Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Essentially a character study done in a 'I wonder what would have happened if' fantasy-esquire setting, Inglourious Basterds is replete with everything we've come to expect from QT: foul-mouthed witty dialogue, a broad brush color palette, and an incongruous time line.<br/><br/>I suppose if I had any complaints about IB they would be as follows. Firstly, I don't think we saw nearly enough of Donny 'The Bear Jew' Donnowitz (played by Eli Roth), as he really only features prominently in one or two scenes. Secondly, I left feeling like the role of Shoshanna Dreyfus (Melani Laurent) may have been miscast. Personally, I am of the mind that Marion Cotillard (La Vie En Rose) could have done a greater turn in her role. Though Laurent turns in a fine performance, for whatever reason I just wasn't buying her as the latent seductress.<br/><br/>That being said, in terms of performances, Tarantino seems to draw the best out of Brad Pitt, whose portrayal of Lt. Aldo Raine could have turned into a hammy over the top caricature of itself in the hands of a lesser auteur. Further, I was particularly captivated by the performance of Til Schweiger as the caustic Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz. However, this could be the result of his scene stealing performances in Judas Kiss and SLC Punk! which won my admiration over a decade ago. Either way, he's fantastic. Finally, I would be remiss if I failed to mention Christopher Waltz as the diabolical Col. Hans Landa. Waltz shines as the perfect antithesis to all the efforts of the 'good guys.' His serpentine genius steals nearly every scene he's in, and he does so in three different languages no less.<br/><br/>At any rate, even though IB clocks in at around two and a half hours in length, it doesn't view that way. Tarantino, if you can't say anything else about him, is a master of pacing, and here he keeps the viewer entertained and immersed in every scene. Yet, somehow, he does so without resorting to cheap shoot 'em up, blow 'em up tactics simply to titillate. Don't misunderstand, there are several events which are grotesque enough to put you off your tea, but those scenes will only surprise the few with short enough memories to have forgotten Pulp Fiction's overdose sequence.<br/><br/>To sum up, while the premise of WWII Allied command unleashing a small, Jewish commando force of avenging angels behind German lines may seem far fetched to pedantic history buffs, just remind yourself that it's Quentin Tarantino. The only question is, who DOESN'T want to drink the Kool-Aide?"
"Karl Self","9","2","8","26 August 2009"," Life's a Tarantino movie, and then you die
","Great movie, but let's face it: it's a bitch to review. Which might be the reason why so many professional critics weren't so glowing about it.<br/><br/>I went into this expecting a spoof of 1979 Italoxploitation schlocker ""Inglorious Bastards"", a boyish fantasy of a band of gallow birds mcguyvering against the Third Reich. There is that aspect to the movie, and maybe this was Tarantino's original intention, but it's just one aspect of it. In fact, I'd say it's by far the feeblest subplot of the entire film: Brad Pitt leads an ultracruel bunch of renegades who massacre any German (viz Nazi) they can lay their hand on. I thought that Pitt was miscast and underdeveloped, and he reminded me too much of his role in Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels.<br/><br/>By the way, professional critics empathized that the ""Basterds"" are Jewish and that the movie, therefore, was inverting the movie stereotype of portraying the Jews as sympathetic but ultimately lethargic victims. However, this isn't really the story that the movie, at least in its final cut, tells us: granted, all the Basterds are somewhat swarthy and one of them is called the ""Judenbär"" (Jewish bear), but their leader is a former Southern bootlegger and supposedly a gentile. Overall, and other than in the original ""Bastards"" movie, the background, personalities and motivations of the Basterds is mostly left in the dark. So many professional critics seem not to have watched the final release of the movie very attentively.<br/><br/>By far the greatest antihero of this movie is SS colonel Hans Landa, brilliantly portrayed by Christopher Waltz. He's like James Bond out to catch and kill Jews. Easily one of the evilest characters ever created by cinema, he's the Ernest Stavro Blofeld of the new millennium (or the Second World War, if you will).<br/><br/>The movie is an amoral, surprisingly sober roller coaster ride. I won't go into details -- it's a Pedro Almodovar-like brew of great storytelling and eccentricities mixed with Star Wars-like megalomania. But trust me, if you like Tarantino's other movies, the Basterds won't let you down."
"cpr3584-1","8","2","8","25 August 2009"," A Celebration of Cinema...
","Quentin Tarantino seems to be in a creative mood lately. His last few releases (Kill Bill, Death Proof) have been forged from Tarantino's own imaginative scripts, something he hasn't done since Reservoir Dogs (1992). The director of the essential American classic Pulp Fiction brings a new revenge fantasy to theatres with Inglorious Basterds, an overlong but hard-hitting film that will likely satisfy his fan base and bring new Tarantino fans aboard.<br/><br/>The Inglorious Basterds are a rag-tag gang of American Soldiers (an offshoot of the Dirty Dozen maybe?) that get dropped into Nazi occupied France with one mission and one mission only: to kill Nazis. Led by the darkly comic Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), these guys have nothing to worry about, right? Not until SS General Hans Landa arrives at the home of Pierre LaPadite, a farmer accused of hiding a family of Jews under his floorboards. One of the hidden children, Shosanna, escapes and runs bloodied through the countryside. The film jumps forward a few years to reveal an older Shosanna, the owner of a small cinema. To her dismay she is forced to show a Nazi propaganda film with members of Hitler's Third Reich in attendance. She then carves an assassination plot for the premiere with her fellow employee. Little does she know the Basterds have one of their own, which leads to a fiery climax.<br/><br/>QT's casting once again proves to be top notch mostly because of German Actor Christoph Waltz's portrayal of Hans Landa (""the Jew Hunter""), a well read and polite yet sinister general of the SS. His calmness and cunning wit he keeps while conducting an unspeakable genocide makes him a fearsome villain we love to hate.<br/><br/>By QT's request, the film relies mostly on subtitles, giving it a more authentic feel. The dialogue moves very fast so anyone that doesn't feel like reading needs to look elsewhere. There are some scenes that seemingly go nowhere and its epic 2 hour and 40 minute length may leave some moviegoers anxious. His scriptwriting seems to get a little sloppier with each effort, but this film carries itself with a star-making performance by Christoph Waltz and stunning visuals. Being his most mature film yet it's surprising how much dark humor QT chose to use, and when you're watching this, you aren't sure whether to squirm in disgust or laugh. But that's his style. He offends, insults and goes against the mainstream. It's nice to watch a director that does things his way and won't listen to Hollywood. (3/4)"

"enfant_perdu","8","2","8","25 August 2009"," Pleasantly Surprised
","I had low expectations for this film, given how disappointed I've been by, well, everything Quentin Tarantino has directed since Pulp Fiction. Plus, it seemed pretty obvious that the marketing campaign was misrepresenting this movie by showing only a handful of scenes and lines that didn't give the slightest clue as to what the story was actually about.<br/><br/>Fortunately for us moviegoers, almost everything the studio decided not to show us in the trailers and commercials is excellent.<br/><br/>QT's style is here in full force. What makes his distinctly modern touches (including fast-paced and unexpected flashbacks, cringe-inducing ultra-violence, charismatic villains, cold-blooded heroes, and a lot of dialogue that serves little purpose other than drawing attention to itself) especially amusing is how sharply they clash with the WWII setting. As a result, they feel even more absurd, and are even more laugh-inducing. (Hopefully this won't be the last time he looks to the history books for inspiration.)<br/><br/>But there's a lot more to like about this film than its Tarantino-isms. There are subtle moments of character development, tense scenes of nearly unbearable suspense, and an intricate plot that's in no hurry to unfold. Even without all the quirks of QT's style, the central story is strong enough to stand on its own.<br/><br/>The film isn't without its flaws, though. There are a few points where the humor and the action take a break, the plot moves at a slow crawl, and you may find yourself getting impatient. There isn't nearly enough of Brad Pitt and his Basterds. The ending is a little abrupt, and left me craving a bit more resolution (call me old-fashioned).<br/><br/>Overall, Inglorious Basterds is better than I'd expected. I strongly recommend it to any fans of Quentin Tarantino and anyone who enjoys their humor dark, their violence over-the-top, their suspense slow-brewed, and their historical fiction unabashedly modernized.<br/><br/>After my confidence in him had been waning for years, this movie has made me a born-again believer in Tarantino's ability to deliver."
"Mortalias","9","2","8","24 August 2009"," An enthralling, unique experience
","Having not seen a Tarantino film in a while, part of me was nervous how his newest flick would fare, while part of me was excited for what it could become.<br/><br/>From the beginning it's very clear the film is presented in a unique fashion. The first characters we see are both mysterious yet incredibly intriguing. In fact, for a movie that predominately consists of foreign dialogue, neither the constant need to read subtitles or the lasting task of listening to ongoing conversations proves to be boring. Every character is rich in personality, even if their story is basic and simple.<br/><br/>Pitt offers a humorous performance, yet underneath his southern accent and witty aura is the impression of a dedicated man, even if it's never mentioned. Mélanie Laurent, although seeing her for the first time, gives a superb performance.<br/><br/>The style is different, the presentation is classic Tarantino, the plot is well constructed, and the over-the-top actions and dialogue make this ""revenge"" flick one of Tarantino's finest. A must see for anyone who appreciates a great night out at the movies."

","Well now we all know Tarantino, his good films, his brilliant ones, and then his not so on target ones but Inglorious Basterds is between good and brilliant. Gory, brutal, gritty, sense shredding, but what this film really does is say; this is how World War 2 and the Nazis SHOULD have ended at least in the eyes of Quentin Tarantino. Personally I think Tarantino got it just right, it should have been the way it all ended if only for history to be different.<br/><br/>Now regarding the acting, top notch cast. Brad Pitt actually is good in this, not his handsome celebrity who does not look the part of a disgruntled Jewish-American soldier angry at the Germans and looking for revenge. He does this perfectly, and so you look forward to every time he graces the screen unlike some of his other works. The rest of the cast is brilliant especially Christoph Waltz who is just as captivating as Pitt in this film as the evil SS colonel who everyone is gunning for almost as much as Hitler himself, well there were those just as bad who helped him and either got away with it or just disappeared.<br/><br/>All in all worth the fare price I paid, and I would pay it again to see it once more. Great cast, great action, great drama too. See it, you will not regret it."
"Flyer78","9","2","8","24 August 2009"," INglourious Basterds=GLORIOUS film.
","Okay, where do I start? This film was the epitamy of brilliance in every way. The acting, particularly that of stars Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz, is above top-notch, and this was directed superbly by the man who I believe is the greatest director of the modern day and possibly the greatest of all time- Mr. Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>The opening sequence of the film is strikingly similar to that of spaghetti westerns, which is not surprising since Tarantino calls this as much of a spaghetti western as it is a war film. The sequence that takes place at the beginning of the film is rather long, suspenseful, and has a menacing sense to it. You have a dreadful feeling that you know exactly what's going to happen, it's just a matter of when it does.<br/><br/>Something else that Tarantino is reputed for doing so well is giving his characters the most unique of personalities. And although I'm sure I'm not the first to tell you this, he created a very funny and likable one in Brad Pitt's character- Lieutenant Aldo Raine, a hillbilly born and raised up in the mountains of Tennessee. Christoph Waltz's character, which happens to be the film's primary antagonist, known as Colonel Landa or ""The Jew Hunter"" does not deserve going unmentioned either.<br/><br/>This film is for the most part a War/Spaghetti Western/Drama, but there are a few shootouts, action scenes, and what not. When these come around, and there are a few of them, be prepared for tons of violence. As the trailer suggests, one of the main draws of this film is scalping. And when they say that, they mean it. What I'm saying is that there are a few scenes in this film that are rather disgusting, and forced me to turn away. Mind you, I'm not a squeamish person.<br/><br/>On the contrary, there are plenty of hilarious moments to balance out the equation that is this film. Lt. Aldo Raine has tons of memorable phrases used throughout the film, and he is a largely compelling character.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is one of those films that manage to hold your attention with a vice grip for the entire two and a half hours that it runs, and it was truckloads of fun to watch. I think everyone should check this out, but be prepared to look away from the screen at a few scenes.<br/><br/>Before I finish, I must say that the only reason this film did not earn a full 10 out of 10 from me is for the reason that were LOTS of subtitles. This is completely understandable since most of the film's primary characters besides Aldo and his men are either French or German. Tarantino kept everything realistic, but that still doesn't change the fact that I spent more time reading subtitles that actually listening to the characters speaking in English.<br/><br/>But I must admit, being forced to read the subtitles made you give your undivided attention, and the film was all I was focused on for an entire two and a half hours.<br/><br/>Oh, and might I add, the ending is nothing short of brilliant. The whole movie was brilliant. But hey, Quentin worked on this script for TEN YEARS. What else can you expect? 9/10"
"mxbishop","9","2","8","24 August 2009"," WWII with a Heavy QT Stamp
","I love WWII movies - and was anxious to see how Quentin Tarantino would construct such a film. _Inglourious Basterds_ gets high marks for: dialog, cinematography, costumes, and suspense. I really thought the film was only about 2 hours long - even though it runs 32 minutes more. The film is best when the characters are talking - and the suspense is building. Tarantino does a great job in this respect. There is violence, of course, but it is quick and highly stylized - and thus can be more properly described as war opera. I think the film would be just as good - or perhaps even a little better with less on-screen violence - or perhaps, a trade for a bit of implied violence. We also get the usual QT moments where a character blurts out something so absurd or preposterous - it just releases all the tension in the room - and gives the audience a chance to laugh. Kubrick used to do this too. Like Kubrick, QT makes movies for people who like to watch movies. That's why a Kubrick or QT movie can be watched many times - and appreciated on many different levels - without becoming a bore. The Cohen Bros also seem to understand this kind of rich, nuanced approach to film-making.<br/><br/>One other thing I noticed that was not in the trivia section, and this is a possible spoiler: There appears to be a slight nod to _The Great Escape_. In _The Great Escape_ Colonel von Luger, the POW camp Commandant, says, ""We have put all the rotten eggs in one basket, and we intend to watch this basket carefully."" In Tarantino's film, General Ed Fenech (Mike Myers) says: ""We have all our rotten eggs in one basket. The objective of the operation... blow up the basket."" Whether intentional or not - the quote stands out as something you'd expect to hear in a WWII movie."

I thought it was horrible, but years later I watched it again and then again and I finally got it. I went prepared for Inglorious Basterds to pay attention and not loose sight of the fact that normally every line and every scene has importance not just for the moment but further into the plot. Don't be fooled by a scene you may think is slow or boring because they all have importance. He was able to catch many emotions each to there extreme, anger, sadness, joy, horror and many sprouts of those. While I would agree that some portions were a bit slow the cinematography well made up for those areas and you were always interested in the action, non-action or just the surroundings. I have already planned to see it again for I know no matter how much I tried to absorb there is much I had missed. Don't miss this movie but do keep in mind it does have extreme graphic violence.

","I'll admit this up front. I'm a Quentin Tarantino fanboy. Not so much as to think that the man can do no wrong, but enough to make it a point to watch all things QT, no matter what.<br/><br/>Now that that's out of the way, ""Inglorious Basterds"" took me back to the place where I got hooked in the first place. This was ""Pulp Fiction"" (in my opinion, the best movie ever made), set in Nazi-occupied France. Quirky characters. Sharp dialog. Mexican stand-offs. Brutal murders. Samuel L. Jackson. The only thing missing was the trunk shot (which I was looking for). While I've enjoyed everything QT had made, nothing has quite been on a par with ""Pulp Fiction"" until now. My only wish is that QT had made this film straight, without inserting things at random (like Samuel L. explaining how flammable nitrate film is) just because that's what QT does. Those pieces added nothing to the film other than to blatantly stamp ""Made by Quentin Tarantino"" on it, which was pretty clear anyway.<br/><br/>If one thing could make up for that, it's the character of Col. Hans Landa, by far the most compelling character QT has ever written. His only flaw, is that he's on the ""wrong"" side. He's polite, cultivated, educated, a patriot...an all around good guy. And just when you get to like him, you remember, he's the Jew Hunter. And not only that, he can't use the excuse that he's just following orders. He philosophizes about his position and duty. But, at the same time, you have to admire him as a philosopher. You have to hate and like him at the same time. QT has made hit men sympathetic and had a vengeance crazed bride make us dry, but never has he created a character who made us feel so conflicted. It's a great stride forward for an already great auteur. I can't wait for the next one."

","Not going to write a huge spiel like some others have here so gonna keep it short... Movie was actually quite entertaining - a huge improvement from QT's last movie deathproof - Dialogue is interesting and although strays from the story a tad here and there, keeps pretty much up and down the line. The action scenes are superbly executed with tension built quite well with unsuspected outcomes. Movie ties back to kill bill with music and one character (I think) reprising her role as an translator. The final climax at the cinema perfectly ends the movie with a sense of 'that was pretty full on' Definitely worth a see if you have the 2.5hrs free.

","Insulting word in title, but an even more insulting for potential viewer! Watched 15 minutes,15 to many and the DVD box should say not for children or anyone else. This film would make a nice interrogation device forcing your capture to cave in and tell you every bit of Intel the prisoner knows about the forces their own side! If you can watch the entire stink bomb burn after watching. If you are like me destroy the DVD after five minutes viewing. Have never been a fan of Quinton Tarintino's spaghetti war comedy movies and after 5 minutes of watching I have even less respect for the director.

"TreyLovesMovies","8","2","9","8 July 2010"," Tarantino presents us with a spaghetti war film.
","Quentin Tarantino's latest yarn is a work that throws the history books out the window and instead presents us with a spaghetti war film.<br/><br/>The film is divided into five separate chapters, the first two setting up our main characters, the middle two serving as Act II, and the final one providing our conclusion. Spread throughout these five parts are two major plot threads. The first introduces us to a French farmer, who is hiding a family of Jews beneath his floor, nervously welcoming a meticulous Nazi SS Officer, Hans Landa (Christopher Waltz), into his home. Landa is known in France as The Jew Hunter, owing to his uncanny ability at seeking out even the most well hidden Jews. The visit ends in Landa's soldiers slaughtering the Jewish family beneath the floor, leaving their daughter Shosanna (a lovely Mélanie Laurent) an orphan. The second deals with a misfit band of brutal Jewish-American soldiers lead by Lt. Aldo Raine (Bradd Pitt) known as the Basterds, who are on a mission behind enemy lines to kill as many Nazis as possible and strike fear into the regime's heart.<br/><br/>The greatest strength of the film is in its presentation of these two plots and their inseparable relationship to each other despite the confident air that they each possess enough weight to carry their own films. While Soshanna and the Basterds each have their own personal motivations, they are both pursuing the same goal: to reign down death upon the Nazi party. The first chapter of the film provides Shosanna with a tragic reason for revenge, while the second shows us how much the Basterds enjoy killing Nazis. When the Nazi command decide to show their latest propaganda film to all high ranking personnel in Shosanna's small theatre, it is inevitable that both the Jewish girl and the Basterds will be unable to resist the turkey shoot. Everything in this film is leading towards that conclusion, the showdown at the OK Corral, the stand off in the cemetery. It all fits together so brilliantly, yet separately. It's almost like two separate films with different plots that are leading to the same final film of a trilogy.<br/><br/>Some may be disappointed to learn that the film isn't as action packed and bloody as the trailer seems to profess, but this isn't necessarily a weakness. Tarantino is known for his pop culture influenced dialog and while this is somewhat impossible with this film's period setting, he still manages to infuse the film with his vast knowledge of cinema through references to obscure foreign films of the time. While some scenes do get a little windy, there is usually a great amount of tension present in them that seems to heighten as the dialog plods along. Such an infusion of suspense amongst the references make them easier to put up with and forgive. One fine example of this device is the scene in which Shosanna is speaking with Nazi propaganda leader, Joseph Goebbles (Sylvester Groth), about the use of her theatre for the premiere of his latest film. We know who Shosanna is, we know that she is a Jew who narrowly escaped death, and when Landa steps up behind her the tension reaches a breaking point. It's brilliant and keeps the film moving despite the constant regressions into seemingly pointless references.<br/><br/>This working relies heavily on the strength of the actors and thankfully they are all up to the challenge. Special mention goes to Christopher Waltz for his portrayal of Landa, one most deserving of the acting award he won at Cannes. His character is incredibly sadistic and frightening, yet also charming and funny in a manner that calms you despite the fear and uneasiness he inspires. He's the sort of man you want to invite to dinner even though you are literally shaking in your boots throughout the main course. Mélanie Laurent is fantastic as Shoshanne, injecting into the character a sadness and passionate lust for revenge that is buried beneath a rather humorous exterior that we are allowed to witness through her interactions with an annoying German actor (Daniel Brühl), who is smitten by her. When the final act finally rolls around, she is clad in a stunningly red dress with her desires laid bare, a femme fatale with hate and revenge filling her heart. A final realization at the end of the film is played perfectly by her, one of the most touching moments in the film. And what of Brad Pitt? While certainly the weakest of the three leads, he does not disappoint, nor do I mean that as an insult. His larger than life Aldo Raine is hilarious and provides the movie with a hero that seemed to have walked straight out of cinematic legend.<br/><br/>It his perhaps his character that best summarizes what this movie is: a passionate tribute to cinema. Whether it be the very Sergio Leone vibe the movie gives off, or the constant references to cinematic history, this film oozes with Tarantino's lifelong obsession, one that I happily share with him. The film isn't without its weak points, a fairly disjointed structure being the most apparent and hard to gloss over, but the love that flows through its veins and the power of its characters manage to make it shine despite these rough edges. ""Inglourious Basterds"" works tremendously and may very well prove to be one of Tarantino's most important pieces, though not his best. It's a World War II film for those who love the fable like quality of aforementioned Leone's westerns, a World War II fairytale, if you will. It isn't supposed to be accurate, or even typical. It is a film that only Tarantino could deliver and I can honestly and happily say that I'm glad he did."
"RoundhayReviewer","9","2","9","17 February 2010"," Lovely Movie - Amazing Christoph
","This is a wonderful WWII movie Quentin style. He likes to think of it as a spaghetti western more than a war movie. I loved the Mexican standoff which happens somewhere in the middle of the movie.<br/><br/>I absolutely fell in love with Christoph Waltz as much as I was filled with hatred for Christoph's character Col. Hans Landa! What a devilishly delightful character! The whole movie was just a show case for Christoph Waltz. Hope he gets an Oscar. Quentin said that this was the ""greatest and most complex characters"" ever written by him, I would go on to say that this is one of the best characters I have seen in entire history of cinema, period!<br/><br/>Another great performance was by Diane Kruger who played the character of a big German Actress. I did not see a single glimpse of Kruger in her character in the entire film.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was OK. So was the rest of the crew. And that's what kind of brings down the overall acting ratings for the movie despite Christoph and Diane.<br/><br/>I felt that Martin Wuttke portrayed Hitler with a slight animated touch, almost to the point of comedy. Don't know if Quentin intended that. It was almost like Rick Moranis's Darth Vader spoof in Mel Brook's Space Balls.<br/><br/>______________________<br/><br/>Now, here's what I would have changed if I was in control.<br/><br/>* A really small observation and change, Landa says towards the end of the movie that ""you would need to kill all four, Hitler, Bormann, Goebbles and Goering to end the war"". Now I don't think the head of propaganda, Goebbles would have been able to keep WWII going after Hitler and others were removed. But that's a really fine point. * I would have saved one of the leading ladies, probably Shoshanna. * Made Hitler's portrayal less animated and a little bit more serious. Quite, with almost no dialogues.<br/><br/>This review was originally copied from my blog: http://roundhayreview.blogspot.com/2010/01/over-all-rating-4.html"
"thinker1691","8","2","9","28 January 2010"," "" There are nine million Jews watching you burn in Hell, don't ruin it by asking for mercy ""
","During World War Two, the widening German occupation spread a reign of Terror across the face of Europe to such a degree, no one could believed it emulated from the pitch black heart of one insane man. Its eventual destruction would take the lives of millions before they were finally crushed. Many special groups were counted among those who participated. This is one movie called "" Inglourious Basterds "" and is the story of American Jews who were responsible for creating fear and terror in the Third Reich. The story was written and directed by noted director Quentin Tarantino and contains enough magic to create the foundation of a Classic. The selected unit called 'Bastards' are led by Brad Pitt who plays Tennessee born LT. Aldo Raine, a no nonsense officer with only one motto. ""Kill the Nazi and bring me his scalp!"" With a special, nay unique group of elite soldiers, like Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender and Daniel Bruhl they aim to terrorize the very regime which believes itself to be 'the superior race.' Although they aim to destroy the Nazi war machine, their immediate target is Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) who fancies himself the best soldier in the German army. Actually he is one dispassionate, indiscriminate and certainly the most vicious Nazi in France. In the film one of his victims named Shosanna, (Mélanie Laurent) recalls the slaughter of her family and vows vengeance. With the exceptional talents of special guest star Rod Taylor (Dark of the Sun; signature theme included) Til Schweiger and Martin Wuttke who plays Hitler, in addition with a screen full of dramatic, sometimes brutal action, this movie proves both entertaining and with the 'Tiger tank theme' becomes morbidly exciting. The movie is not for the faint hearted, but will literally set the screen on fire. Great film. ****"
"mdenicola88","9","2","9","7 January 2010"," Masterpiece Carried By It's Non-Superstar Actors
","'Inglourious Basterds' like almost every Quentin Tarantino project was a masterful screenplay made into a cinematically appealing film. Tarantino's willingness to tell stories in an unconventional fashion allows him to stand out from other directors, and continually attract the interest of top-notch actors such as Brad Pitt in 'Inglourious Basterds.' However, in this film it wasn't the performance of Brad Pitt that stood-out -although he played his role wonderfully -it was instead two supporting actors who truly made this film remarkable. The first being Christoph Waltz who truly showed North American viewers how talented an actor he truly is. His ability to fluidly transition between English, German, French, and Italian was remarkable, and he also managed to capture the hearts and attention of viewers despite being thrust into the 'bad guy' role. The other memorable performance was that of Melanie Laurent, who in addition to being stunningly beautiful, was able to portray such real emotion in a character so many actresses would have difficulty portraying. I was simply amazed by the performance these two individuals gave, and would recommend any fan of film to see this film simply to see them, even if you are not typically a fan of Tarantino projects. The only possible miscue, was the casting of Mike Myers as 'General Ed Fenech,' as funny as Mike can be at times, his placement in this film was extremely questionable, they may as well have casted one of the Jonas brothers and it would have been equally inappropriate."
"adseccafico","10","2","9","21 December 2009"," Film-making is Tarantino
","As much as I enjoyed Avatar, I could only think (as I watched Avatar) that Tarantino was going to get snubbed again. Its 1994 all over again! This, by far, is my movie of the year. Written perfectly, acted perfectly, and had the violence and imagination that we have come to expect from Tarantino. Not to mention, the show stopping performance by Christoph Waltz. But you've probably heard enough about the soon to be Academy Award winner for best supporting actor. All in all, the best film of 2009. Academy of motion picture arts and sciences please make the right decision. Show that best picture isn't for films with the most eye-candy, but for films with depth, heart, and a s*** load of dead Nazis. Thank you for reading, and have a nice day."
"barrys82","10","2","9","23 November 2009"," Another masterpiece from Quentin Tarantino
","What can I say. Tarantino always finds new ways to amaze the viewer. This was the opportunity of Inglorious Basterds, a movie full of action, drama and a little bit of black humor that we're used to watch in all Tarantino's movies. It is perfectly narrated and with an excellent rhythm, yeah it maybe a little bloody but its never gross, its like I like say entertaining and justified violence. The story is excellent, set in WW II, a group of Jewish soldiers named ""the basterds"" travel throughout the Nazi occupied Europe killing German soldiers as an act of revenge, and the plot is perfectly written full of twists and with an unexpected ending. The cast is awesome, Brad Pitt, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, Christoph Waltz, Til Schweiger and even Mike Myers in a very short appearance were astonishing perfect. To conclude, Inglorious Basterds is the best movie from Quentin Tarantino maybe since Pulp Fiction, fully recommended and totally worthy."
"matheusmarchetti","10","2","9","28 October 2009"," A love letter for classic movie fans
","When I went to see Inglorious Basterds I had little expectations on what was I about to see, and much to my pleasant surprise, it turned out to be one of my favorite movies! This is without a doubt Tarantino at his best. He creates a film that feels so fresh and unique, that really needs to be seen to be believed. It is the kind of movie that will please different types of audience, for it's both entertaining and fun, never really gets boring, and has some great references to classic cinema, a definite European style and tone (mostly due to the amazing Ennio Morriconne score) but with a definite pinch of Tarantino, all which makes up for perfection. The film has chilling cinematography, an interesting and daring script, gory yet poetic death scenes, fantastic music as mentioned above, brilliant direction and great acting. Brad Pitt is probably in one of his finest roles, and Diane Krueger comes off as a pleasant surprise. However, it is Melanie Laurent that steals the scene as Shosanna, in such a way, we become more interested in her character and her story than the Basterds' story. She is probably the character that you sympathize the most in the film, and is the one that actually seems much more human than the others. Even though the final scene could've been better, it doesn't really matter, and the elements mentioned above more than make up to it. Overall, it is an amazing film - a true modern classic that is not to be missed, by movie fans and otherwise. 10/10."
"curious-kristy","10","2","9","11 October 2009"," Loved them or hated them - you won't soon forget the Basterds
","The funniest thing about this film is the strong reactions it gets out of viewers. Reading the comments on this site you can see – it really is either a 'love or hate' movie. I don't think anyone walked out of the cinema with nothing to say about it. Think about it, you may have hated the film, but you definitely talked about it afterward. Tarantino is interesting because his films have none of the blandness that often comes out of Hollywood lately.<br/><br/>As you can see, I was one of the people who loved the film. I gave it 10 stars because the first words I said leaving the cinema were 'I could not have enjoyed that movie more'. I liked it because of the structure – broken into individual chapters which, again and again, introduced fascinating characters and used interesting, smart dialog to build tension, until you are really on the edge of your seat. Then, violence is often used to end the scene and relieve the tension. It is so far from the normal narrative arch of most movies these days. It's like when a song differs from the 'verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus' structure – unexpected and refreshing.<br/><br/>Some say the film was dialog heavy and too long – but if you just get lost in the story, and enjoy the pace that Tarantino sets, it is hard to be bored. Again, Tarantino doesn't conform to the fast-paced, objective driven feel of the average Hollywood flick, and Basterds is all the better for it. The dialog is not a case of 'how can we get the point across in thirty seconds?', it is the point. It is as much 'part of the ride' as any of the action sequences. The melting pot of subtle and not-so-subtle film and cultural references in the film is another reason I want to watch it again, and I've already gone twice! My advice is to live in the moment, enjoy the stunning cinematography, vivid color and a cast of characters you can really sink your teeth into.<br/><br/>Speaking of characters, I find it hard to agree with anyone who calls the characters of this film one-dimensional or uninteresting. Just look at Christoph Waltz's Hans Landa, the next great villain of our generation, a deeply complex character who can be both charming and deeply disturbing. He can translate his threatening presence even in polite conversation over strudel and a glass of milk! It is a role which has projected Waltz into world fame, and with very good reason. Another great example of Tarantino's outstanding characters is Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine, whose over-the-top accent and larger-than-life presence were bold and risky choices. It could have gone horribly wrong, and yet this gamble paid off. I went along for the ride with that crazy Basterd, 100% of the way. The way Tarantino presents women in the film was another reason I loved it – this is not a male-dominated bloodbath as the trailer suggested – one of the main story lines follows a young Jewish woman's quest for revenge.<br/><br/>Like I said, Inglourious Basterds is often loved or hated. And, as the average rating reveals, thankfully the lovers have outweighed the haters, at least here on IMDb. While you may have despised the movie, you must agree that you thought about it and discussed it far beyond the cinema – which is more than you can say for the mediocre, contrived movies that often get as much popularity. Again, Tarantino refuses to conform to the expectations of modern cinema, and again he is rewarded for it."
"dfle3","9","2","9","10 October 2009"," Like a Jewish daydream...
","In some ways this seems a movie written by committee, hence the ending. As the Irish might say: ""To be sure, to be sure to be sure"". Even though Adolf Hitler died at his own hands over 60 years ago, Tarantino's movie is a testament to the feelings that he invokes, decades later. Yes, this movie is entertaining, but is it cathartic for Jews, this kind of fantasy? Or is the emptiness of the daydream something that might just make them more impotently angry and uncomfortable in their skin? For non-Jews, I think that Hitler may just be a fairytale like villain...interchangeable and have the appropriate, vague pop-cultural cache of a dark icon. Perhaps he no longer has the hold on the rest of the world as he will always have for Jews. Still, a movie with Hitler and a target on his back? Yeah, why not? Sounds like fun!<br/><br/>Brad Pitt plays Lt. Aldo Raine, a man who, like Indianna Jones might say, ""hates Nazis"". He leads a team of Jewish commando types who make it their mission to drop into Nazi occupied France and start huntin' Nazis, and instilling fear into them by how they kill them. So, you should be warned, there are a few scenes where Nazis meet their doom in brutal ways, and others have their skin violated in horrific ways. It's just a few scenes, and they don't dwell on the horror, but you should know that the camera doesn't blink when these horrors are perpetrated on the Nazis.<br/><br/>Raine, as played by Pitt, is a caricature, amusingly done. He's at his embarrassing and awkward best in a scene inside a cinema where he draws on his knowledge of the Italian language. Good stuff, that. Pitt was embarrassing in a bad way in the movie ""Troy"", specifically the scene where he meets Hector's father after a battle. It was meant to be drama but Pitt played that scene wrong, in my opinion. In a Tarantino movie, it's hard to imagine anybody being capable of playing a character or a scene ""wrong"". It's all good.<br/><br/>This movie is also quite postmodern...it's playful, with some scenes having something analagous to a hyperlink....so, if 'realism' is your thing, these intrusions into 'reality' may grate. But if you like realism, there are plenty of other aspects that will annoy you even more.<br/><br/>Another 'fun' character is Col. Hans Landa, played by Christoph Waltz. In a realistic drama he would come across the buffoon at times, but in Tarantino's world he is astute, menacing and...a lot of fun too. Landa is Raine's main nemesis. He is a senior Nazi who has the job of finding French Jewish citizens who are unaccounted for/missing. His performance has intensity, quiet menace and the odd comical touch.<br/><br/>There are other welcome spotlights on characters...like a Jewish girl who we seem running from Landa earl on in the movie.<br/><br/>Some scenes have a lot of dialogue and psychological hues to them. They create tension and fear underneath a veneer of civility.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that this is the type of movie that will reward repeated views in quick succession, but it's a good movie first time around and will be a good candidate for future views years between drinks, so to speak."

","Quentin Tarantino is according to me, the finest Filmmaker of this generation. and if there's any doubt in you about that fact, watch 'Inglourious Basterds' and you'll understand what I am talking about.<br/><br/>This film is a work of fiction, over here Hitler is brutally killed. The biggest plus point of this film is that 'The Basterds' win, 'The Audience' win. Over here, our revenge-full heroes bash up the baddies brutally, leaving us satisfied. Tarantino's finest work so far! The first 15 minutes, the entire sequence is masterful. It keeps you glued. There are many long, long sequences in this film,, but there's hardly a second you get bored. From each & every aspect 'Inglourious Basterds' is a big, big winner!! <br/><br/>Acting-wise: Christoph Waltz deserves an Oscar for his performance in the film. He evokes terror each time he appears and delivers an outstanding performance. Brad Pitt is excellent; his dialog delivery is astonishing. Eli Roth's intro is brilliant, man the way he whacks the bat on a Nazi is really brutal. Michael Fassbender is first-rate. Diane Kruger is classy in a brief role. Mike Myers is terrific in a that one scene he appears in.<br/><br/>on the whole 'Inglourious Basterds' is a true Masterpiece from Hollywood. A must watch! Two Big Thumbs Up!"
"Ben_Cheshire","10","2","9","26 September 2009"," I had no reason to be nervous...
","I was nervous seeing this. Death Proof was a major disappointment, it felt all talk and no fun compared to the joyful Planet Terror; and my first experience with Kill Bill had left me scarred and distrustful of Quentin. I guess I thought I knew who he was after P.Fiction, R.Dogs and J.Brown; and probably all I wanted from him was witty dialogue. I guess I hadn't really paid attention to the other aspects of those films which QT has chosen to indulge long-term 1) they're all genre-exploitation 2) they all feature Surprise Symphony pacing, with long stretches that lull you into a sense of comfort, then sudden climaxes, of which several of his finest to date are contained in Inglourious Basterds.<br/><br/>Even though I love Kill Bill now, and plan to never see Death Proof again, I decided to expect nothing from Inglourious Basterds. I decided that even if I didn't like it, I might grow to like it some day. Basically, all my fears were unnecessary. IB is an immediately satisfying and mature work of art, with incredible pacing and structure, and stories that pay off big time.<br/><br/>More than anything else, IB demonstrates, perhaps just how much restraint QT is capable of. The moments are wrought with such Also, QT has finally given us some real characters, who seem to think and feel things. (Though obviously with a Tarantino-style panache). And damn it we really care what happens to them; which is something I don't think I've ever felt during one of his movies. This is landmark maturity from a director who has usually sacrificed sentiment for style. Not that this is a sentimental movie; God no. But I'll leave all of that up to your experience. Save to say that unless you're a bit squeamish and don't like violence at all, you'll want to see what Quentin Taratino has made for you.<br/><br/>As someone who was a big fan of early Quentin; and hesitant follower of the Kill-Bill saga, IB finally makes Quentin into a fully-rounded and satisfying filmmaker; his most mature work to date, sacrificing none of his flair and style. Should go down in the books as his best film, if not as historically important as Pulp Fiction."

","I was never much of a Tarrantino fan but this film really rocks. When you don't notice the time in a film that's almost three hours long, you know it's a good film. First of all the parts come together beautifully: the mix of drama, action and humour makes a perfect dramaturgy. Secondly, Tarrantino really has a stellar cast, first and foremost Christoph Waltz who gives the performance of a lifetime and the female lead. But even right down to minor roles the acting is terrfifc. Even a non actor like Till Schweiger doesn't spoil the film since Tarrantino aware of his limitations as an actor didn't give him much dialogue. The soundtrack is absolutely terrific and putting a David Bowie song into a period piece is courageous but it works fine. Visually the film is very beautifully made quoting Hitchcock a lot. Sometimes it works fine, sometimes it doesn't. If you compare the scene with the red dress to Hitchcock's Topaz (a mediocre offering at best)you realize that Tarrantino is no visual genius but a good storyteller. In this film he finally masters the art of non-linear story telling which for me in his earlier films was always too self satisfied. All in all a very good film."
"pyrocitor","10","2","9","6 September 2009"," ""This may be my masterpiece""
","When asked about his reaction to looming viewer expectations regarding his new film in an interview with Empire movie magazine, director Quentin Tarantino was typically frank: ""I want high ideals, I want gigantic expectations, I want people to expect a masterpiece!"" And, while such monstrously high self-confidence might be considered an inevitable stumbling ground for any artist, Tarantino remains one of the perilously few contemporary filmmakers who can make good on his boasts. And his new film, Inglourious Basterds is no exception. Cocky, outlandish, self-indulgent and with ambitions the size of a small country, Tarantino's twisted sense of humour pervades the film even to the point of his gleeful misspelling of its title. And while the debate over which film is Tarantino's best remains an eternal one, it is difficult to dispute that his latest is, as the last line in the film itself cheekily suggests, somewhat of a ""masterpiece"". <br/><br/>Suffice to say, viewer enjoyment of Tarantino's latest will depend largely on their prior opinion of the director, as Inglourious Basterds only exemplifies the cinematic qualities which made him so infamous in the first place. Unashamedly in love with his characters' voices, Tarantino's script is a typically convoluted affair, devoting scene after scene to trickily worded verbal exchanges monologues in French and German as well as English, which, along with the overlapping strands of parallel narratives and multiple characters, makes the film somewhat cumbersome for viewers expecting two and a half hours of nonstop Nazi-scalping action. But, with an inversion of expectations also typical of its director, the real action lies in the dialogue, as Tarantino ramps up the claustrophobic tension to unbearable levels, loading each speech with layer upon layer of misleading meaning and thinly disguised threat. In the world of Inglourious Basterds, a simple conversation about milk becomes more painfully suspenseful than a holdup at gunpoint, making the film's two and a half hour running time fly by while remaining utterly engrossing. <br/><br/>Of course, it would be foolish to expect a credibly historic piece, and Tarantino, despite his keen attention to stylized period costuming, props and sets, is gleefully content to butcher any semblance to WW2 reality, re-writing the history books as glibly as he plunders influences from past films. While the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone are clearly on Tarantino's mind (complete with Ennio Morricone musical cues), he similarly borrows the aggressive, frontward propelling sense of purpose from military films such as The Dirty Dozen, giving his film a feeling of being simultaneously free-form and whimsical yet brutally pointed and focused. And, of course, it is impossible to ignore how sadistically funny the film is, all violence, mayhem and incomparable tension aside, as, in typical Tarantino fashion, the viewer is made to laugh both from sheer nerves and in reaction to the sheer audacious breadth of the spectacle on display, including a finale which twists expectations to the extent of truly needing to be seen to be believed. Also commendable is Tarantino's use of film itself, setting his climax in a movie theatre, and demonstrating the power of cinema to inspire, corrupt and destroy, both figuratively and literally, lending nuance upon nuance of self-reflexive themes to be unearthed. For all its sadistic relishing in Nazi-killing and gleeful dodging conventions, Tarantino's film is as hard thinking as it is hard hitting, enjoyable on so many levels simultaneously.<br/><br/>Of course, characterization in a Tarantino film is also approached from a direction unlike any other, as characters are introduced, given detailed backstories, then flippantly discarded, giving a larger than life, almost cartoonish feel to most of the acting (Hitler and Goebbels certainly emerge as more pantomime than anything else). Such an approach seems to be one relished by Brad Pitt, flat out hilarious as Ltd. Aldo Raine, the leader of the 'Basterds', skewering his star charisma with malicious delight and savouring every last accent-mutilated syllable of his dialogue. Yet, as public opinion has suggested, the true show stealer lies in its antagonist, Christoph Waltz's Nazi Col. Hanz Landa. Deviously charming and delightfully malicious, Waltz commands the screen with an eerie precision, making sense of every contradictory character trait and morphing them into a character so larger than life, so devastatingly memorable, impossible not to hate yet equally impossible not to secretly like, that Landa is unlikely to be forgotten for years to come. In contrast is similar breakout star Mélanie Laurent, continuing Tarantino's tradition of strong female protagonists, as vengeful Jewish cinema proprietor Shoshanna, bottling a quiet dignity and furious indignant rage into a character almost as memorable and impactful as Landa. <br/><br/>And no Tarantino film would be complete without an equally colourful supporting cast, as Eli Roth chomps scenes with brutal delight as the 'Basterd' known as 'The Bear Jew'. Michael Fassbender delivers the most realistic and ultimately sympathetic character as an undercover British officer, showing the charisma, charm and magnetic presence of a true star. Diane Kruger is similarly superb as a defecting German movie star, contrasting her character's flamboyant public persona with her gritty desperation and remaining consistently watchable throughout. Daniel Brühl does a careful job of rendering likable a spoiled Nazi propaganda hero without making him excessively sympathetic, delivering an equally masterful performance, and August Diehl is chillingly memorable as a suspicious Nazi in the fabled 'tavern scene'. Finally, watch for Mike Meyers as a British general, whose inclusion appears just one more gleefully irreverent poke at convention, and the tendency for the historical film genre to take itself too seriously. <br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds could be described in an exhausting abundance of ways: strange, daring, audacious, inventive, hilarious, terrifying, thought provoking, exhilarating, gleefully amoral and chock full of unexpected dodging or inversion of cliché. Yet, in the end, the most fitting way of describing the film is yet another of its director's staggeringly arrogant yet justifiable boasts: ""a big f*cking night at the movies"". And there is little more audiences could ask for. <br/><br/>-9.5/10"
"webmaster-3017","9","2","9","1 September 2009"," HK Neo Reviews: Inglourious Basterds
","Tagline: Christoph Waltz steals the show and Tarantino on the mark once again Review by Neo: It is no surprise that the talented Quentin Tarantino love movies and his ability is needless to be discussed. Tarantino have a unique knack of bringing the best out of actors, filming them more beautiful than they should be. For actresses, there is usually an element of classic beauty in his films and for actors; they will be transformed into ultra cool characters that are much larger than life. For me personally, I have basically grew up on Tarantino's films from Pulp Fiction to Kill Bill or the lesser lights in Death Proof, there is no denying that he is the man for films that gets better in repeated viewings. Here, he created and re-launched the career of little known, Christoph Waltz, who undoubtedly steals the spotlight from the likes of Brat Pitt and seamlessly overplayed his character by blowing out of proportion, in an immensely fun, engaging, interesting and exaggerated display of good overacting acting. As much as Waltz deserves his best actor at the recent Cannes Film Festival, much credit should be shared with the director Tarantino for creating such a wondrous movie.<br/><br/>Basically the movie goes like this: It's a Tarantino movie, so making sense is not the key issue and being historically correct is never a matter of concern. So it is the warring period of the Nazis and in the midst of their occupation of everyone else in Europe, there exists a cult from America namely the Bastards. Led by Brad Pitt, the Bastards aim to kill and slaughter as many Nazis as humanely possible. One of the Nazi's Jew detector played by Christoph Waltz, is both smart and cunning. Adding to the mix is a cinema owner who is a former Jew with a vengeance on the agenda. So don't storm in looking for coherence, but rather indulge in the cleverly written dialogue, interactive performances and some ingenious directing from Tarantino.<br/><br/>Mr. Christoph Waltz, what a wonderful and impeccable performance that was. For once, someone is able to play with his character in a manner that ends up overshadowing the likes of Brad Pitt. Waltz is cunning, smart, ingenious, serious, funny, selfish, undermining, understated, indiscernible and basically amazing character to watch and endure. The opening scene set up the tone, his hideous smile, gave his character the looks and the mannerism of both disband and likable villain at the same time. His faceoff with Pitt at the cinema and at the cocktail bar was simply joyous to watch. Waltz easily steals and chews every moment he is on screen and one of the main ingredients as to why this Tarantino's film will work and succeed in doing so.<br/><br/>Boy, personally I was quite unimpressed by Pitt's performance, as he is neither memorable nor important to the story. Perhaps, Tarantino was just using his character to draw everyone of those 70 million US Box Office sits, but in reality, Pitt is simply nothing more than a glorified cameo. Diane Kruger is beaut to inhale and her scenes were constantly coated with candies. However, I was more impressed by French actress Mélanie Laurent; she shines through her role in both acting wise and external wise. It is always a joy to watch a fresh new talent and in Laurent, Tarantino have uncovered a piece of cinematic gem. There is the sense of classic beauty in her performance that made her character all the more relatable and enjoyable.<br/><br/>All in all, Inglourious Basterds is one heck of a smart and good film. It is most certainly a film that I plan to indulge within a second or even a third time. Tarantino have always been a brilliant director and needless to say, he has once again created something for all movie lovers. The mannerism, the style, the pacing, the dialogue, the classic beauts, Inglourious Basterds have all the hallmarks of a good intelligent movie and in that Tarantino manages to hits all the right buttons. When the performance of Waltz alone is already worthy of the price of admission, it is needless to say that Inglourious Basterds comes highly recommended on my personal behalf  (Neo 2009) <br/><br/>I rate it 9/10<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thehkneo.com</li></ul>"
"bramb600","10","2","9","1 September 2009"," Tarantino finally topped Pulp!
","I've been anticipating this movie for a long time. Basically, the impression I had of this movie was that it was supposed to be a Dirty Dozen style action movie of Jews on a mission to kill Nazis. This sounded similar to Valkyrie which just came out at the end of 2008, but I would see it because I consider myself to be a Tarantino fan.<br/><br/>I've seen Pulp Fiction which is one of my favourite movies of all time because it's so awesome. I've seen Jackie Brown which was rather entertaining and a good movie, but it didn't live up to Pulp Fiction's standards. I've also seen Death Proof which was the second half of Grindhouse. I definitely preferred Planet Terror to Death Proof because I thought the dialogue in Death Proof was rather boring. Tarantino kills off every character after hearing them chat about pointless things. I did, however, enjoy the second half of Death Proof.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is the first time that I feel that Tarantino has come close to the quality of Pulp Fiction. I will even go as far as saying that Inglourious Basterds is my favourite Tarantino film.<br/><br/>The plot of Inglourious Basterds isn't as simply as you might have seen from the trailer. There is a subplot about a Jewish girl whose family is killed early into the movie by Nazis for hiding under the floorboards of their neighbours. She escapes from Col. Hans Landa (played by Christoph Waltz) and we see her four years later when she owns her own theater that is hosting a Nazi premiere. The main subplot involves a group of Jewish American soldiers called The Basterds who are just killing and scalping any Nazi they meet. When they find out that Hitler is attending the premiere, the subplots eventually meet which is closer to the end of the movie. When this happens, I can honestly say that it is the most entertaining scene in any movie I've ever scene.<br/><br/>Everyone assumes that the movie is all about The Basterds and Brad Pitt, but they don't even get a lot of screen time. I think the real star of the movie is Christoph Waltz who plays The Jew Hunter. He's such a great antagonist and is convincingly evil, even when he's just drinking a glass of milk. Everyone in the movie gave a great performance, and many were surprisingly comedic. But we've come to expect that from Tarantino movies.<br/><br/>The most important thing is not to expect an action film, or you'll be severely disappointing because it's a 2 ½ hour movie and 2 hours and 15 minutes of that is probably pure dialogue. Even the dialogue itself is mostly in subtitles translating German, French or Italian. It was my major complaint with Death Proof but for Inglourious Basterds it managed to improve the movie. Still, when there is an intense action scene it doesn't disappoint especially with the final 20 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>To conclude this review, I strongly believe that Tarantino made an exceptional World War II film, the best one I've ever seen, as well as for Tarantino and I think this will be known as one of the classic films of the decade.<br/><br/>It's hilarious when it needs to be, it's tense when characters are talking for 20 minutes at a time, and when it's gory it's exciting. Seriously, you can be on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie, if you're enjoying. I know this is sort of a love it/hate it type of movie and hopefully more people will love it and see the movie in the way I did. I saw it twice and this is actually one of the rare times where I feel that I enjoyed it even more the second time. The second time, you are aware that people are eventually going to stop talking and when. You know the purpose of it all and the main timeline of the movie. You may even be able to spot things that you never noticed before.<br/><br/>I won't hesitate in giving Inglourious Basterds a 10/10, it's a perfect movie and easily my favourite film of the year."

","Holy god, what a movie! I'm not even sure how I should describe such an experience. Even though this film is totally concerned with war, I have difficulty calling it a ""war movie,"" and I most certainly wouldn't call it an ""action movie"" either, as it doesn't really possess anything I would consider true ""action""--just brief, visceral outbursts of extreme violence that take place at very calculated, very deliberate times (all of which moments are pure awesome). It does, however, include a shitload of dialogue in the typical Tarantino fashion. But it is all so very good, and the story is brilliantly clever. To be completely honest, as I watched the film, the notion of possibly being utterly let down by the ending was constantly nagging at me; but I was not let down. Not even to the slightest degree.<br/><br/>To sum things up, this film is almost perfectly executed. This is without a doubt one of the best movies I've seen in a long time; 10 out of 10 easily. Go see it."
"rbferre","10","2","9","27 August 2009"," Tarantino's masterpiece
","As well said at the end of the movie, this is indeed Tarantino's masterpiece, together with ""Pulp Fiction"".<br/><br/>All the elements that made Tarantino's films enjoyable are there: the dialogs, the freaks, the subtle tension, the attention to details and the hidden sarcasm, the drama and the comedy leaving the audience on the edge of their seats, without feeling the 153 minutes of the movie pass by.<br/><br/>I loved how Tarantino left the message very clearly: ""Forget about the politically incorrect and the history books, I will make a film how I think it should be done and I will give the Nazis what they deserved. And in the process of doing so, I will make fun of some cultures too, including the American one"". And he does that playing with clichés in a way that only one of the best directors alive can do! In Tarantino's world, the characters all have flaws, villains and good guys have good and bad behaviors. Even the pretty French lady whose family was slaughtered had to pay with his life when she considered giving forgiveness to someone who did not deserve it.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Christopher Waltz both deserve Oscars for their performance, giving life to great dialogs. Waltz speak French, English, German, and Italian! Pitt is hilarious, especially when he struggles with foreign languages (""Buon giorrrno"" said during an evening event).<br/><br/>Certain scenes were made for perfection: The first scene of the movie has its tension built up in a way that make spectators enjoy every second of it - every sip of milk, every smoke of tobacco.<br/><br/>Best movie of the year, without a doubt! 10!"
"ClaytonDavis","9","2","9","23 August 2009"," The Tarantino-Waltz Show---Welcome
","Quentin Tarantino, one of the most iconic film directors of cinematic history, has created one of his best efforts yet in Inglourious Basterds. There's so much brilliance that Tarantino brings to the table in his newest film. Most notably, it's an unconventional World War II film that is not to be taken as a biopic or anything that resembles history. Tarantino tackles the tough subject matter with respect and diligence. He lives in a time of horror and torment and breathes new light into a repetitive subject (not that I have a problem with Holocaust films).<br/><br/>It's a good place to start with the marketing strategy of the Weinstein Company by advertising Brad Pitt as the star lead when its anything but. Did it get more people in the theaters? Probably. But Tarantino is such a cult phenomenon that his name alone could have filled some seats. But marketing aside, this is Tarantino's second best film of his career (can never top Pulp Fiction I guess) but his most original and clever work to date.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's performance is definitely the unsung hero of the picture. It seems as if all his really terrific performances go unnoticed and they make it up with rewarding mediocre performances like last year's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Pitt has showed such versatility late in his career such as his ""Jesse James"" or Chad in Burn After Reading or Richard in Babel. Pitt is showing his strings of acting. Now, he brings us Lt. Aldo Raine, the leader of the ""basterds"" and charismatic killer of the Nazis. Pitt is intelligent, hilarious and engulfed in a role that deserves praise. His role should not, however, be interpreted as a lead role for Pitt becomes a part of an ensemble piece with different integrated parts which makes for a terrific motion picture.<br/><br/>At this point, we've heard the praise for Christoph Waltz whose villainous turn as Col. Hans Landa is one of the most terrifying turns in our new century of cinema. Waltz is daring and frightening to the depth of quivers rushing down your spine as you watch his monologues or hyper-tension questioning. Waltz is something of a marvel and should be considered a threat for an Academy Award next season. Going back to great portrayals such as Anthony Perkins in Psycho or Louise Fletcher in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Waltz joins the elite list of screens greatest villainous turns.<br/><br/>Other supporting players put forth valiant efforts. Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger pull in strong performances in a very testosterone driven picture. Eli Roth, despite his brief screen time does the best especially with his introduction a.k.a. ""The Bear Jew"" monologue. The only flaw of the film is it suffers in a mid-film stalemate notably with the cameo by Mike Myers which feels forced and unnatural.<br/><br/>Oscar prospects? In a perfect world, it'd be in all categories. In serious light, Waltz is a definite contender in his respective category and Tarantino can find himself in the screenplay race once again if guilds take notice. Inglourious Basterds is one of the best films of the year, mark my words.<br/><br/>***½/****"
"rayesh_g","10","2","9","23 August 2009"," Tarantino does it again !!!!!
","Tarantino's war/comedy/western/action movie is quite simply one of the best movies of the year. Here he approaches the movie with the enthusiasm and energy that was shown in ""Pulp Fiction"". The screwy dialogues, beautiful cinematography, and wonderful performances which adds up to the definition of a trademark Tarantino movie are all evident here. It is so refreshing to know that there are directors with some juice in them who are capable of entertaining an audience in a unique and innovative fashion, during a time when movies have become merely another vehicle to make money. <br/><br/>""Inglourios Basterds"" stars Brad Pitt as a man named Aldo Raine with a heavy southern accent who gathers a bunch of men to go behind deep enemy lines and do one thing and one thing only; kill the Nazis. These men with various aliases kill Nazi soldiers in the most shocking ways that one could hardly absorb the shock that these scenes contain. I myself was shocked at a sudden scalping in an early scene of the movie that I was terrified I would throw up. These instances can easily make you fall into the trap of expressing distaste about the violence and coincidently hatred towards the director, but I myself found that the shock those images created filled me with anticipation it made me aware how anything could happen in this movie. That sense of surprise and suspense is what makes Basterds a great movie. The most effective way to not glorify violence is to make it so shocking and sudden. There is a key scene involving a German spy, some basterds and Nazi soldiers, and it is so well constructed that makes you want to applaud the writing and the directing. The cinematography and the use of music are very well done that it creates more vibrancy. <br/><br/>""Inglourious Basterds"" is not an easy movie to watch for everyone, it will definitely put people off for its use of sheer violence, but I urge you to watch this movie with open mind in order to be entertained and to be fascinated by a Wonderful director such as ""Quentine Tarantino""."
"Bloomy92","10","2","9","22 August 2009"," Wow!!! Quentins Best Since Pulp Fiction
","Quentin Tarantino Has Re-Written History and Does It In Stunning Fashion. Not With COnstant Fighting...At least, not with guns. Quentins Characters Use words As their weapons and they use them well. In The Opening scene for instance, the farmer suspected of hiding jews is confronted by our Villain Col. Hans landa( Played Terrifically by Cristoph Waltz). The Farmer At first is able to keep his cool as Landa interrogates him but just when we think that the farmers secret is kept and the Jewish family is safe Landa begins to slowly break the farmer with his words and his facial expressions and we see the farmer finally crumble and fall into tears as he confesses. This Scene among many others Including A Tension Filled Scene in A Tavern proves once again that Tarantinos Writing And DIrecting is in top form. Awards are sure to follow for Screenplay, Supporting Actor(waltz), as well as a few technical categories. This Is by Far The Most audacious, original, and unique War film ever made and Quentins best Movie Since The Groundbreaking Pulp Fiction. A Must-See"
"tom1111","7","2","9","22 August 2009"," Decent and fun movie
","I would rate this move 7.5 to 8. First of all, this is not very serious and historical movie in that it is intended to have some comedy and witty dialogue. I also liked how Tarantino's possible portrayal of SS/Gestapo officers that terrorized the people of the regions by being very slick and sly. This also taught me what it was like to get approached and subtly interrogated by one of these German agents.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was good. I also liked the supporting actors like the ""basterds."" On the other hand this was a very dialogue intensive movie, but on the other hand the dialogue of the German officer was very engaging and scary considering the power the system had over the regular people who can just ""take care"" of the people right then and there without any judicial policy.<br/><br/>Finally, this is not a very serious movie like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Thin Red Line,"" or ""Letters from Iwo Jima,"" ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" etc. This is more of a comedy movie with a little Tarantino quality in it. If you enjoy and seen Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, it is not hard to know where Tarantino wanted to take this film. Overall a decent movie, but not too great for me. Little long and dialogue intensive, but overall decent."
"Matt_Layden","8","2","9","21 August 2009"," These Basterds Are Worth Seeing
","Once Upon A Time....In Nazi Occupied France opens the film in the first chapter (a signature Tarantino style) of this WWII film in which Jewish American soldiers, who've deemed themselves ""The Basterds"", ambush and scalp Nazi's. Their story intertwines with another in which a Jewish girl survives an attack on her family and lives among the Germans as a French theatre owner. The theatre in which numerous high ranking German officials will be at, a theatre that ""The Basterds"" will be at.<br/><br/>Tarantino is a favourite director of mine, not the top, but he's up there. Many people complain he simply rips off older, better films. I say nay. He is inspired by them because he loves cinema so much. Any interview with the guy will prove his vast film knowledge, a knowledge that he has used in his film-making, giving us some of the best films of the 90's. He doesn't have many films under his belt, but the ones their are all highly praised and one even earned him an Oscar. He is able to mix different genres well and is competent in each one. His last 3 films were a throwback to grindhouse features, a two part revenge story that mixes the spaghetti western and the Asian martial arts and finally a novel adaptation. Yet his praise is mostly in his writing, which is why he has an Oscar in the first place.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds is yet another film from Tarantino in which he mixes violence with characters who seem too cool for school. Brad Pitt plays Aldo Raine, the leader of the Basterds and one who can speak almost fluent Italian. He has a scar around his neck, yet it is never answered as to why, and he seems to be having too good a time here, killing Nazi's. He enlists 8 men to be apart of his squad of Basterds, along with his 2nd in command (I'm assuming) Donny Donowitz, played by Eli Roth. Who for once does not annoy me. His best scene involves the most brutal part of the film, reminiscent of Pesci's scene in Casino. Two more men join the Basterds, one is Til Schweiger, who is famous for killing 13 Nazi's in cruel and inhuman ways. The second is Michael Fassbender, a Scottish soldier posing as a German to initiate Operation Kino. A secret mission that will involve explosions and death. Seems like a lot of ""Basterds"" to keep track of, and it was. Tarantino loses half of them half way through. Missing scenes from trailers would indicate there was more story for each of them, but for the film as it stands now, it's incomplete. These characters are forgettable faces, this film needed more time with it's title characters.<br/><br/>In a Tarantino flick you can guarantee a couple things and getting good performances from his actors is definitely one of them. Brad Pitt is hilarious as Aldo and Roth is menacing as Donowitz. The short scenes with the Basterds are good, good enough to want more and feel disappointed when you don't get it. Krueger, from National Treasure fame, plays a famous actress working for the English, posing as a German. She has a thick accent and pulls off her scenes quite well. I didn't find her annoying at all, and even though Mélanie Laurent does a decent job as the Jewish girl hiding out in France, her subplot with a German Private is boring and almost forgettable. It's not till the ending of this sub plot does it become remotely interesting, but it seems too late. The stand out is without a doubt is Christoph Waltz, playing a German who is nicknamed ""The Jew Hunter"". He plays the guy with enough kindness to make him creepy and enough crazy to make him fearful.<br/><br/>This film tells two different stories that meet up at the end. Each one has their own fair share of subplots, that seem to distract from more time with the Basterds. There are numerous scenes that are quite shocking and will leave you with a big smile, or a disgusted look of disdain. The violence here is more gritty and real, thus it feels more involving. Kill Bill has limbs flying and gallons of blood, but it was too over the top and comical to be taken seriously. Here it has that gritty feel to it that it just makes you wince when it happens.<br/><br/>Not Tarantino's best work, but then again will he ever top Pulp Fiction? Instead it's a welcome addition to his resume of films that I can say I enjoy. The length of this one is a little long and it may drag in some places, but the overall feel at the end is enjoyment. He takes his characters and lets them takeover the story, which is why the historical facts in this film are more interesting than others. There are countless war films that are plagued with people already knowing the outcome. Valkyrie is an example of a film that the audience knew how it was going to end. This one throws it all out the window.<br/><br/>A tighter running time and more time spent with the people who want to see would have made this film even more fun for me, but I'll take what I can get."

"davidmvining","8","1","3","25 November 2019"," The ending doesn't live up to the rest of the movie
","This movie is chock full of greatness, but it ends up being a bit less than the sum of its parts. I can easily see how someone would take those different great moments and get wrapped up in the whole movie while glossing over the fact that the ending doesn't tie up as well as it should, but that ending bugs me.<br/><br/>The film starts with what may be Tarantino's single best scene, the chapter titled ""Once upon a time ... in Nazi Occupied France."" Hans Landa, an SS officer, arrives at a small dairy farm and begins to interview the middle-aged French owner of the land. Landa is investigating a handful of Jewish dairy farmers who had lived in the area before the Germans arrived. There's one family unaccounted for, the Dreyfuses.<br/><br/>This scene is brilliant. From the moment it starts as the SS car drives up, we know that something's wrong. Christoph Waltz's performance as Landa is so ingratiating and the character written so intelligently that before the camera pans below the floorboards to reveal the Dreyfus children hiding, we know that there's more to the scene than we are seeing. Once that reveal happens, though, the tension simply ramps up steadily and almost unbearably. Landa starts talking about his admiration for the Jewish people's supposed similarity to the rat (as opposed to the German people's supposed similarity to the hawk). He says he knows how they hide, where they could go that other German soldiers wouldn't imagine. Before Landa tells the dairy farmer exactly where the Dreyfus children are hiding, we get the sense that he knows exactly what's going on.<br/><br/>Another brilliant aspect of it is the use of language. Landa is German. The dairy farmer is French. Landa walks up speaking French, but being German, it's not a huge surprise that he might find the language uncomfortable, so they switch to English. It seems like something both realistic within the context and a cop to the audience so they don't have to read subtitles for the rest of the scene, but it's also part of the ruse to keep the hiding Jews from understanding what's going on. They don't speak English, so as Landa outlines what he's going to do, they have no idea. One of the three children ends up escaping, Shoshanna, and Landa lets her go. You can tell through the whole scene that what he loves most is the chase, and letting her go is just continuing that chase.<br/><br/>After that, we have our introduction to the titular Basterds. A group of eight Jewish American soldiers, led by Aldo the Apache, they go into France before D-Day and wreck as much carnage as they can, claiming scalps of Nazi soldiers as they go. Their introduction is the genre meat of the film, the revenge porn aspect. It's an amusing way to introduce them, watching the Bear Jew beat an unrepentant Nazi to death with a baseball bat. Thankfully, there's more to the movie.<br/><br/>Three years after Shoshanna escaped the Jew Hunter, she has become the proprietor of a movie theater in Paris. She inherited it from her aunt and uncle (assumedly, those non-Jewish French who took her in to help save her) and runs it with her African-French boyfriend. A young German officer, a war hero who killed dozens of Americans in Italy, tries to strike up a friendship, but Shoshanna has an understandable aversion to Nazis and resists. He insists to the point that he convinces Goebbels to hold the premiere for the soldier's movie at Shoshanna's theater. Shoshanna is passive through the whole experience, knowing that to fight back would be borderline suicide.<br/><br/>It is at the lunch where Goebbels decides that Shoshanna comes face to face with Hans Landa again. We know how smart Landa is, based on his previous scene. He looks Shoshanna directly in the eye and seems to be hiding something. I think Landa's supposed to know exactly who Shoshanna actually is from this first interaction. It's the detail that he buys her a glass of milk. Why would the Jew Hunter do this, though? Well, three years have passed and the German situation has declined since. He's planning, but so is Shoshanna. She wants to embrace having Nazis in her theater in order to burn it to the ground and hurt those who hurt her and killed her family.<br/><br/>It's about the fifty minute point in the movie when this plot actually begins to develop, which is fascinating on its own. That's a long time dedicated to simply developing characters. I love it!<br/><br/>We next get Tarantino's second best scene where the Basterds have to meet with the German film star Bridget Von Hammersmark in a tavern in a basement. ""Well, you don't gotta be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't wanna fight in a basement."" The two German speaking Basterds and a British operative who also speaks German, descend and find that the movie star is not alone. She's entertaining five soldiers who are celebrating the birth of a son back home. The Basterds and actress try to disengage without arousing suspicion, but it's a tricky business. Eventually, the British officer speaks, telling off a soldier, but his accent isn't right. That accent attracts the attention of an unseen SS officer hiding in a corner. He injects himself into the conversation, forcing the group to tolerate his hostile questions and pseudo-friendly presence. We know that the group is just one wrong move away from giving themselves away, and when it does happen it takes a second to develop. The explosion of violence that follows is very bloody and very quick.<br/><br/>The final chapter is where the movie comes together in part but never quite enough to satisfy me. Shoshanna preps for her revenge and the Basterds make it into the premiere. So, we end up with all of our characters in the same place doing the same thing, but it still feels like they are in separate movies. Shoshanna is in her mode of personal revenge that ends with her dying at the hands of the German soldier while the Basterds are simply there to wreck carnage. There's a similarity in motive, revenge, but it never really develops into anything more than that. It feels more coincidental that the two storylines end up in the same place rather than intentional.<br/><br/>Still, everything up to that ending is great, and some of it is some of Tarantino's best work. Christoph Waltz plays a difficult role pitch perfectly. Brad Pitt is really good. Diana Kruger is very good. It's tense, funny, and great to look at. It feels like everything is going to wrap up really well in the end, but it fails at that insisting on little more than revenge porn. I think Inglourious Basterds could have been Tarantino's best movie if he had just found a better way to bring everything together."

A vindictive theater owner in Nazi occupied France and a bunch of Jewish American soldiers called 'Inglourious Basterds', separately plan to destroy the 'Third Reich' on a movie screening night at that theater. Executing the death of them all at one place hosting the Fuhrer too, isn't much plainly easy as the previous line reads.<br/><br/>The movie has all my favorites from Tarantino's filmography - the long opening scene feat. the Oscar winning act by the master Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa, justifying his title of 'The Jew Hunter'. That opening scene is my favorite Tarantino scene, Christoph Waltz's act here makes him my all - time favorite actor from a Tarantino movie, and Col. Hans Landa being my forever favorite Tarantino character. Another unforgettable sequence features him against the Basterds (Brad Pitt, Eli Roth, Enzo Castellari) faking as Italians - that conversation is impeccable. The movie throughout has the mingling of the languages of several countries of West and Central Europe, primarily pampering the Francophile in me with its setting in France : that charm of old France, with those cobbled streets and lovely cafes."
"lacatusalexandru","10","1","3","20 August 2019"," Best Quentin Tarantino's movie ever
","Quentin Tarantion is,in my opinion,one of the best directors ever among Martin Scorsese,Ridley Scott,Guillermo del Toro,George Lucas,etc and like most talented directors he has an unique way/method of doing films.
A lot of Quentin Tarantino's fans will say that Pulp Fiction was and it still is the best movie he ever created and I'm fine with that opinion and I understand why they think this way,because ""Pulp Fiction"" is his first movie which won the Oscar for Best Picture but I think that his career improved a lot when he released ""Inglourious Basterds"".
This movie had everything great any movie needs to have and those are :a great story,astonishing cast,a great balance between drama,comedy and suspense and the amazing way of shooting the scenes like no other director.
Both the main character,Lt. Aldo Raine(played by Brad Pitt) and the main villain,Hans Landa(played by Christoph Waltz) are beyond great and both of the actors deserved to win an award for their performance as well as Michael Fassbender and August Diehl.
As favorite scenes I would say that I really loved: ""The Stuntman and the Italian Cameramen"" scene,the ""Go Out Speaking the King's"" scene, ""I Must Be King Kong"" scene,""That's a Bingo ! "" scene as well as the finale scene where Lt. Aldo Raine marks Hans Landa with the nazi symbol on the forehead and after he's done he says ""this must be my msterpiece"" as in Quentin Tarantino refers to his movie ""Inglourious Basterds"".
Overall,the movie was and it will still be Quentin Tarantino's best work ever as well his masterpiece but that may be just my opinion,who know !?"
"stevenrotherforth","8","1","3","12 August 2019"," The sumptuous dialogue is like pouring treacle in the ear
","Inglourious Basterds<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Tarantino then this film will completely satisfy you.
The most fascinating thing about this directors work is how he presents dialogue.
The opening scene of this movie is completely captivating.
A simple scene of two men sat at a table talking.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds opens in Nazi-occupied France during World War II, a plan to assassinate Nazi leaders by a group of Jewish U.S. soldiers coincides with a theatre owner's vengeful plans for the same.
The aforementioned opening scene sees Colonel Hans Landa played fantastically by Christoph Waltz slaughter a Jewish family.
One of the daughters survives becoming the said theatre owner.<br/><br/>Waltz is near on perfect in this movie as the evil Colonel but the rest of the cast are not too far behind.
Brad Pitt is genuinely a very good comedic actor and it proves that a fine script and masterful direction will always bring out the best from a talented cast.
Inglourious Basterds is dialogue driven and this is the films greatest asset.
I watched this movie wearing a good pair of headphones.
The dialogue scenes were like pouring treacle
into my ears.
Voices are creamy smooth and because of this the audience will hang on to every word.
The majority of the conversations are either in French or German so subtitles are presented quickly to accompany the buttery dialogue.
It's a sublime thing to experience. I hardly speak a word of French or German but absorbing the subtitles whilst listening to the poetic language was enthralling.
The scene in the basement bar is yet another testament to this.
At 2 hrs 33 mins this film saunters by at an enjoyable pace.
Is it one of Tarantino's best?
I'd definitely say it is a contender!"

","What would you expect when you hear the name of Tarantino? Exciting story, amazing story telling and unique features in cinematography. Mixed with a lot of blood and humor to make fun of violence. Of course, this movie would have been completed without the masterful acting of one Mr. Christoph Waltz. Playing a highly intelligent detective, ambitious, and very polite. Sort of simultaneously the protagonist and the antagonist. You're supposed to hate him but he's kind of lovely.<br/><br/>I have a few problems with the movie. Strange accents of the actors when imitating southern American accent, and British. What is the point of an American actor doing a British accent in a multi-language film?
There's a set of unnecessary dialogues in the cinema, many shorter versions could have been shown.
The dynamic of the movie is about trust. Clearly shown that humans are not kind to each other when the shoes are on the other foot. Ironically, shoe fitting is a particularity in this movie.
As much as makeups and costumes, set decoration, and design, I have to raise my hat."
"Tweetienator","6","1","3","25 February 2019"," The Mix Is a Miss
","Inglourious Basterds is a patchwork - some scenes are outstanding (Mr. Waltz of course) others just feel out of place and not that funny (the comedy quality is rather not too high).<br/><br/>In my opinion if the movie would have hold the level and the tone of the scene with Christoph Waltz as a SD-officer hunting Jews, Inglourious Basterds would have been an intense and new classic. But the path Mr. Tarantino took make this one an ambivalent experience to me - the mix just does not work too well for me. Sometimes it feels like watching two different movies."
"jmateog","10","1","3","23 February 2019"," World War II has never been so exciting!
","The Pianist, The Schlinder List or Saving the Private Ryan are one of the best WW2 movies ever made. But for me which one is the number one? Of course Inglorious Basterds. History movies always give us serious messages such as the meaning of life or human cruelty, and usually filmmakers told their stories in a very slow, serious and politically correct way. Honestly I am so done with those kind of films. I mean, we can learn that on school. If I want to see a history movie I don't want to be told the story as if I was reading a book or watching a documentary, films should be interesting, emotional and clever and if to achieve that is necessary to add fiction, welcome that! In that sense, Quentin Tarantino didn't want to make ANOTHER WW2 movie, he didn't want to give us a history class, HE WANTED TO ENTERTAIN US, and I love him for that. However, If I still don't convince you to see Inglorious Basterds here are some facts about the movie that justify spending you time on Tarantino.<br/><br/>1: Has one of the most scary villains of all time, the one and only Hans Landa. He won an Oscar for his role.<br/><br/>2: English is not the only language, the film tries to be accurate with the context, you can find entire scenes with German, French or Italian.<br/><br/>3: Is a combination of history and fiction. So you the story IS NOT TOLD. Tarantino specifically didn't want to be a teacher of the most known history event. Instead, he gave us a finale very VERY satisfying.<br/><br/>4: The dialogues are exquisite as it is usual on Tarantino. However, the contructions of scenes are set with more mistery and tension tone than in Pulp Fiction. We are talking about Nazis and the MOST VIOLENT context in human history here, so obviously Tarantino took advanatage of that.

"smithpaulusmc","8","1","3","5 February 2019"," Rewriting History
","Movies should be fun. They should excite you and usher you away into a new reality. Without hesitation, I believe that Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is the greatest dark comedy and period piece of the late 2000's. Its star studded cast includes Brad Pitt, Michael Fassbender, Diane Kruger, Eli Roth, and the exceptional Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz. The tale unfolds in Nazi Germany as an underground Jewish-American unit seek to assassinate Hitler. Meanwhile, SS Colonel Hans Landa hunts Jews and runs security at a prestigious film showcasing housed in a small French cinema.<br/><br/>Tarantino continues to push the envelope by opening with an over 15 minute scene. It is not a montage or a backstory, but a powerfully funny, eery, and necessary scene. But enough about Tarantino's thinly veiled genius. Waltz and Pitts performances are perfectly crafted and their characters' idiosyncrasies and lines live on 10 years later. The film delights the audience by taking a sensitive topic and somehow tastefully parodying it. The story is presented using a fractured narrative, cutting between multiple main story lines at once. This recalls Tarantino's style which he best showcased in Pulp Fiction. Again, keeping true to his format, Tarantino brings the separate character groups to singular finale and intertwines their fates.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds could survive on its character depth alone, but it is dually strengthened by its sharp color palette ranging from bursting rose reds and forest greens to drab concrete and SS uniform grey. Tarantino's unique humor has once again proven it has not grown old."
"davedflores","8","1","3","2 February 2019"," Tarantino, altering history, for the purpose of an amazing story
","Quentin Tarantino's 2009 film, Inglorious Basterds, takes what the average person knows about World War II's history and turns it on its head. In this alternate reality, things are happening a little differently, most won't even recognize it, but educated viewers can. Tarantino builds a new story, around a group of heroes that no one expects. I enjoyed the film because of it interesting and high octane take at the story. It gives this group of ragtag fighters a high action story, one that makes the audience believe that our current timeline depends on.
The film makes me feel like I am one of the crew members and that I feel the same way about Col. Hans Landa and the German SS troops.
The way the film is edited, especially the aspect of perspective, where the shots that Tarantino has on each of the characters for a longer period of time than normal shows the true human emotion that comes from uncomfortableness.
Another one of the Ps that is important in this film is the payoff because the audience feels a sense of accomplishment with the group of soldiers and the theater owner, the killing of the leaders shows that progress was made in this timeline. It makes all of the pain and suffering experienced by both parties a purpose.
In the film, Inglorious Basterds, a range of emotions are felt, for the most part every one except true happiness. In the end of the film there isn't happiness, but accomplishment. Tarantino yet again does an amazing job at storytelling and his editing helps build the story."
"nilsbrandstaedter","10","1","3","18 January 2019"," It might just as well be his masterpiece
","Quentin Tarantino delivers in this more than adventurous war flick everything he set out to deliver. More than ten years in the making and it shows. Especially in the dialogue, which is more refined than ever.
Christoph Waltz in a stellar performance too, of course. This is the essence of QT mixed with enough references and excellent pacing to make it indefinitely rewatchable, without feeling stretched out or too long.
The irony this movie and its events are laced with is nearly iron-clad. I don't know if this makes it hard to understand, but more layered than every other movie Tarantino has done before, that's for sure.
Absolutely recommended. One of the best movies of the last decade."

","I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino's films and this one Inglorious Basterds is not an exception. As it contains and is a good mix of war (World War II), jokes, good quotes, drama, adventure and excellent acting. <br/><br/>The movie has 2 parallel stories. One with Shosanna (Mélanie Laurent) and her life and the second one with a commando unit of 8 Jewish-Americans fighting against Nazis. These 2 ""sides"" never meet each other face to face, but both have the same goal, killing Nazis and ending the war. <br/><br/>I had quite a long though about aspects I didn't like in this film and I couldn't come up with a single one. I like the Tarantino's style, how he divides his movies into chapters. The actors like Brad Pitt (Lt. Aldo Raine) and Christoph Waltz (Col. Hans Landa), were in my opinion the best, just great performance. The story as a whole is pretty violent, but at the same time it is quite convincing and funny. The film contains some important German and french phrases, in terms of understanding the plot, it is beneficial to know a bit of both languages. <br/><br/>Tarantino proves that film industry doesn't need to use as much Computer-generated imagery (CGI) as it currently does to make a good movie, just a good script, good actors and a bit of Tarantino-magic. This film is just outstanding and I can't recommend it enough."
"CinematicInceptions","8","1","3","22 November 2017"," His Best.
","This is definitely my favorite Tarantino movie, easily the most impressive showcase of his writing ability. It's flashy writing, which maybe indicates that it isn't as good as it seems. Nonetheless, it was a lot of fun to watch and provided some great lessons in writing well- structured scenes. I was surprised to find less violence and blood here than in most other Tarantino movies , especially because it is his only war movie. <br/><br/>Like the other Tarantino movies, this is full of memorable characters with inventive introductions, an inventively structured plot, unique dialogue, dark comedy at every turn, long yet engaging conversations, and some over-the-top violence. I felt that his abilities as a writer are employed better in this movie than any others, but we also get treated to some good characters played by excellent actors. Brad Pitt was fun to watch as Aldo. Christoph Waltz gives a good performance here for a decently interesting character. Shoshanna is, in my opinion, probably the best female character that Tarantino has written, and I was very much rooting for her in her inventive scheme of taking revenge on the Nazi's. My favorite character was Lt. Hicox played by Michael Fassbender, and I wished we got a little more time to see him in action.<br/><br/>The story is not one that is great as a unified piece of work, but it is fun and interesting to watch as it is playing out. My favorite scene was the one in the bar, because it had the best set-ups and payoffs. By that point in the movie I knew that the world of the movie was one in which every fact or twist that was introduced within a scene would pay off by the end of the scene no matter how long that might take. The opening scene is important for keeping the audience's interest throughout, because it teaches us to suspend our impatience for the rest of the film. If it weren't for the nature of the opening, we would likely get bored at the lack of cohesive plot and drawn out scenes. The ending did not have the same sort of buildup structure of the rest of the movie, but it was still interesting to watch because it brought all of the remaining characters together to meet their fate, so to speak.<br/><br/>Even though this was a very entertaining movie to see, I can't help feeling a little disappointed looking at it in retrospect. It just seems like a shame that such talented filmmaking and writing was used to make a movie with no real theme or substance to it. I wasn't expecting there to be anything deep here, but it still saddens me that a writer- director as brilliant as Tarantino never makes anything that has any kind of meaning to it. Overall Rating: 8.5/10."
"MovieSoup","8","1","3","1 September 2017"," One of Tarantinos best
","Inglourious Basterds is a great film and well worth the 2 and a half hours that it takes to watch this film. This film is competently edited, shot and directed with nice cinematography and the sets looking very authentic and a decent soundtrack (mostly popular songs with some score music) The real gem is the plot and characters though. <br/><br/>Honestly some of the best scenes in the movie are just people talking especially the scenes involving Christoph Waltz as Hans Landa. This is Hands down the best performance he has given. I don't know if that is because Tarantino wrote the part with Waltz in mind or just because Waltz is a great actor (when he is given something to do with a character).<br/><br/>Other actors too give colourful performances such as Brad Pitt who plays the brash douche bag LT Raine and Michael Fassbender who plays LT Hicox. They are not as prevalent as Waltz but make for interesting characters none the less. Fassbender brings a great performance to the bar scene effortlessly building suspense and having a great back and forth with the Nazi officer who is trying to reveal that Hicox is a British spy. Fassbender switches between German and English very smoothly which does not take away from the film, in fact it adds an air of authenticity to the scene. It actually is a plot point in that scene as well with the Nazis asking why Hicox has a strange German accent that is not known to them. <br/><br/>Something that struck me in this movie is that all the scenes of people talking at a table have a strong overtone of malice about them. For instance the first chapter with Landa and the farmer where Landa sits down drinks a glass of milk and quietly tells the farmer that he will spare his life and the life of his daughters if the farmer tells him where the Jews are hiding. That scene starts off the movie expertly and gives the audience the feel of what it would be like to be in that situation and time. <br/><br/>However great this film is though there are always some downsides. These downsides for me does not make this film a 10/10 for me. I think the film itself is a bit too long in my opinion. 2 and a half hours is longer than most films and there are some scenes that really are not integral to the story and serve no purpose being there. <br/><br/>For instance the bit where Zoller, Goebbels and his translater are having dinner and it just cuts to a scene where Goebbels is banging the translator. That scene did not need to be in there! We, the audience, do not care that he is screwing his translator as she does not appear in the rest of the film anyway and has no bearing on the plot at all.<br/><br/>Daniel Bruhl I really did not like in this film, He was playing Zoller and for me did not gel well with most of the scenes he was in. He came across as childish in some scenes and other scenes he was not believable as a celebrated war hero for the Nazis. Luckily the worst actors in this film, like Bruhl and Mike Myres who plays a British colonel (honestly I'm not joking, shrek plays a colonel!), are only play small parts and do not distract from the movie too much. <br/><br/>Overall Inglourious Basterds is a great film, not Tarantino's best but certainly one of his best. If you are thinking of watching it I urge you to do so as Hans Landa's scenes alone are worth seeing. just be in for a long film, poor secondary actors (Bruhl & Myres) and pointless cut scenes involving a translator being screwed by a Nazi film director."

","Is Inglorious Basterds on the same level of greatness as Saving Private Ryan? No. Will Inglorious Basterds be remembered as a classic in the way we remember Full Metal Jacket? No. Is it a great way to spend 2 and a half hours? Absolutely.<br/><br/>Probably the best part of this movie is Christoph Waltz as the villain. He comes off as very intimidating and cold, it's no wonder he won an Oscar for his performance. Brad Pitt is also much different in this role than in his previous works, but he pulls off his character very well. <br/><br/>There are some genuinely heart stopping scenes, like the pipe scene and the bar scene. There are also some hilarious scenes, like the climax and Brad Pitt's Italian accent. Under another director I could see how they would mix the two types of scene in a way that made an inconsistent tone, but Tarantino knows how to make a movie amazing and funny at the same time. If you're looking for a realistic war movie with deep characters and gritty war scenes, I'd suggest you keep looking. If you're looking for a fun time, you've found it."

","I was really excited to watch this movie because of all the praises I heard, the rating it got here and standing in the Academy Awards. But this movie is just overrated!<br/><br/>Tarantino is known for the great dialogues, violence and black comedy in his movies. My personal favorite is Pulp Fiction. But I failed to take this movie seriously felt too much like a parody! Brad Pitt's performance of a hill billy Jew was average, Christoph Waltz speaks 3 languages in this movie, and it is impressive that he speaks many languages, and acts brilliantly I can't deny that. But speaking many languages in a single dialogue honestly disturbed me. The ending and how Waltz surrendered and these ""basterds"" won was just silly. Less than a dozen man, with a Nazi who captured their leader than for a stupid reason surrendered for them, defeated great Germany.<br/><br/>It is not an awful movie but it can get very boring and too much of a parody. Sure the directing was good but the screenplay meh!"
"masonmorgan-92917","8","1","3","15 December 2016"," Not QT's best, but far from his worst
","Quentin Tarantino is easily my favorite director of all time and I love every single one of his films. That's not because I'm some blind fanboy who would love anything he puts his name on, it's simply because every single one of his films are so expertly crafted and written that it's really hard to say that anything he has done is ""bad"". Inglorious Basterds has received many mixed reviews and can easily be described as a ""love it or hate it"" type film. While it is quite flawed in some areas, I enjoy Inglorious Basterds for what it is, which is a fun, Nazi- killing fest oozing with Tarantino's signature style and trademarks. And before you even read the rest it's quicker to say, if you don't like Tarantino, you won't like Inglorious. <br/><br/>Now when I say Inglorious Basterds starts out strong, it starts out STRONG. The opening scene of Inglorious Basterds is easily one of the best opening scenes of all time and is certainly one of Tarantino's best scenes ever. In the first 10 minutes alone, Christoph Waltz managed to create an immensely daunting character with the help of impeccable acting and an excellent script, which is what we have come to expect from Tarantino. Christoph Waltz's performance as Col. Hans Landa is easily the best part of the entire film. He manages to be such an intimating and despicable man while still remaining completely likable. Sadly, the rest of the cast's performances couldn't quite keep up as the roles from talented and experienced actors, such as Brad Pitt and Michael Fassbender, fall short to the quality of acting we would expect from a Tarantino film. Bradd Pitt seems almost purposely wooden and lifeless. The same can be said for Fassbender's character as well. These mediocre performances don't bring down Waltz's Oscar worthy portrayal, but they are especially heartless in comparison. <br/><br/>The thing that many people disliked about Inglorious Basterds is the lack of suspense and thrilling sequences. While I can admit that it certainly isn't as action packed as some of QT's other works, there is no shortage of tension within the long sequences of dialogue-driven narration. These sequences take up the majority of screen time, and a lot of it isn't even in English, but it still manages to build tension through expertly crafted dialogue and a meticulous attention to detail. Excellent dialogue is yet another thing we have come to expect from Tarantino, but here it is showcased more than ever as some of these conversations between characters can last up to 20 minutes for one scene. While this seems like it would be ridiculously boring and tedious, I was quite surprised at how fast and fluid these scenes felt despite the length. The script and screenplay here is incredible.<br/><br/>One of the problems I had with Inglorious Basterds is how it's sometimes offensively stupid and treats the audience like we don't know better. My love for Tarantino aside, I couldn't help but feel that I was being pandered to as the story was sometimes so ludicrously stupid and nonsensical, to a point where it is almost insulting. We are exposed to incredibly graphic violence, yet we are being spoon-fed nonsense that is borderline ignorant.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds is definitely not QT's best but it is still far from his worst. While it certainly would've benefited from a smarter story and better performances from some of the cast, the fun nature and over- the-top extreme violence made Inglorious Basterds a blast to watch. It doesn't have nearly as much soul as Django Unchained, but it still holds up as a solid Tarantino film. It's ultra-violence and long dialogue- driven sequences make Inglorious Basterds an unfriendly introduction to Tarantino's world for newcomers. Instead, we fans are given a raunchy love letter from Tarantino himself as he delivers exactly what we should expect from this inspirational and endlessly talented figure of modern cinema."

","Unlike most movies about World War 2, Inglourious Basterds shows an alternate version of what went down in history. That's right, Quentin Tarantino made a film that says, ""Imagine this happened instead"". Split into 5 different chapters that perfectly divide each section of the film, Inglourious Basterds introduces the major and important characters of the story, as well as why and how they have to do with the movie's plot until the climax hits in the final chapter. Though the cast members did a great job, the one person that stole the show was actor Christoph Waltz. His portrayal as Colonel Hans Landa was superb making the character one of the most memorable movie villains in recent film. But Waltz's character wasn't the only memorable thing. The film's scenes that are both funny and tense is what also makes Inglourious Basterds stand out from other war movies."

Brad Pitt also delivers a great performance, his character was absolutely hilarious and honestly Pitt should of been nominated for an Oscar. Not only does this movie have plenty of gore and violence, but the dialogue is also amazing. The Bear Jew is also a great character, Tarantino knows how to give no name actors big roles and they deliver. Eli Roth as the Bear Jew was a great choice.

","Inglourious Basterds is a 2009 German-American war film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and starring Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent. The film tells the fictional alternate history story of two plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's political leadership, one planned by Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent), a young French Jewish cinema proprietor, and the other by a team of Jewish-American soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Pitt). Christoph Waltz co-stars as Hans Landa, an SS colonel tracking down Raine's group who has a connection to Shosanna's past. The film's title was inspired by Italian director Enzo G. Castellari's macaroni combat film, The Inglorious Bastards (1978)."
"Rickting","6","1","3","24 February 2016"," Another self-indulgent dialogue showcase from Quentin Tarantino
","Oh for crying out loud. When will Quentin Tarantino realize that he can't have a 2 and a half hour movie consisting entirely of people sitting around tables and talking with occasional flashes of excessive yet simultaneously tedious violence? More importantly, why do people love him so much? A group of Jewish soldiers, led by Brad Pitt, become Nazi hunters in Nazi-occupied France, with the villainous Hans Landa as their nemesis. Well, that's what I thought I was getting. Brad Pitt and co disappear for long stretches of time while characters sit down and talk about strudels, cinemas, King Kong and a lot of the time nothing whatsoever. Don't get me wrong, this is a good film in many ways so I can't completely write it off. Christoph Waltz has done the performance he does here several times now, but here he is at his best and he's brilliant. Michael Fassbender is good and the rest of the acting is fine. There are good bits (Especially the marvellous opening scene) and the cinema shootout finale is quite effective. Also, you can sense Tarantino's love for cinema running through the film which makes it more interesting to watch. Unfortunately, while the writing is often good, a lot of the time nothing is happening, the film is completely incoherent and messy (Here's proof that Tarantino's movies being non-linear don't add anything to the films!) and it goes on and on and on. This isn't a bad film, but it's a very self-indulgent one which is basically lots of scenes, some good, some bad, put together in a stunted non-linear narrative which doesn't even manage to sustain the paper-thin revenge plot. As for the violence? Bland. After a strong introduction to the film's heroes and villains, soon it just becomes a lot of sitting around and talking. All in all, an arrogant, poorly constructed war movie which shows Tarantino re-affirming his status as the most overrated filmmaker working today.

"christophershobris","9","1","3","4 November 2015"," Roller-coaster Ride
","Quentin Tarantino rarely disappoints if ever. And gives us yet another mind-blowing masterpiece that is very brave, interesting, smart, brutal, and well made all around. First it is brave, why, because it takes on a very controversial subject, even though it is a fantasy, some people may get offended, especially Germans. But Tarantino bravely dives head first into a pool of fire-ants and finds a way to make a cohesive film despite being covered with biting ants. He's one tough and brave dude, and I respect him for that. The film is also interesting with some clever dialog and goes places you don't expect it to go. Including the violence, but that's Tarantino's style, he is known for his violent scenes but he handles them with class and purpose. He doesn't make a violent scene for the sake of just doing it for pleasure. He makes sense out of it. It's smart because of the reasons I said before, and it's brutal like I said before. Oh yeah, for sure don't let kids watch this, they will be scarred. Plus this isn't a film for them, its for the hardcore movie fan who doesn't mind blood, violence and killings. But see this as an art and you will see it is a work of art. Because this film is outstanding. Now to grade it. P.S. I didn't even touch on the acting, but Waltz, Pitt, and a slew of other actors do wonders for this film.

"david-kirovski","9","1","3","4 October 2015"," Personal Thoughts
","Great movie. Great story and screenplay. One of Quentin Tarantino's best films. Christoph Waltz kills it as a Nazi Colonel. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Lt. Aldo Raine as a sensational, appealing and amazing character is remarkable. It takes time in the first year of Germany's occupation of France. Emmanuelle Mimieux identity of Shosanna is very winsome and lasting. The story contains five chapters each distinctive in it's own way. The chapters story follows and it's not like Pulp Fiction. It's not only a memorable Tarantino motion picture but a World War 2 flick as well. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes Tarantino and World War 2 films."
"framptonhollis","9","1","3","29 September 2015"," Amazing!
","This is one of my new favorite films! It proves itself to be incredible in every possible way! The acting (especially that of Christoph Waltz) is great, the filmmaking, by the always masterful Quentin Tarantino, is extremely well done (the stylistic choices really enhance the film), and the film just has the right amount of everything! It has comedy, drama, revenge, action, style, Nazis! It is entertaining, and rather fun for an over 2 and a half hour long film!<br/><br/>The historical inaccuracy is probably what will bug most WWII fanatics. You don't even have to be into history to know that a whole bunch of the history in this film is painfully inaccurate-but it isn't really history. Tarantino's film is not a historical war piece, it is a tribute to past nazisploitation films, while still being its own work.<br/><br/>Also, the climax of this film is one of the greatest moments in cinema history!"
"Screen_Blitz","9","1","3","28 August 2015"," Quentin Tarantino's audacious revenge fantasy deliver a sucker punch of darkly funny entertainment
","Quentin Tarantino brings his snappy filmmaking methodology and signature dark humor in the European front of World War II in this black comedy. The story on board here is a revenge fantasy against the sadistic dictator Adolf Hitler, leader of the Third Reich who threatened to dominate the eastern hemisphere during the early years of World War II. As opposed to be the typical Hollywood formula which often offers a more somber take on the grim subject matter, Tarantino defies against the usual standards, placing his tongue in his cheek with snappy, yet darkly funny dialogue and wildly colorful characters that suitably match up with his bold artistic style. The film is very talky with sudden bursts of graphic violence punctuating each sequence, but one thing that is for sure is that Tarantino is always consistent with keeping things bold and satirically funny while staying true its subversive nature. Set in the early 1940s, this film follows Lieutenant Aldo Raine (played by Brad Pitt), a bold-spirited American soldier who rallies up a team of young Jewish soldiers on a mission to murder Nazis in attempt to pursue after Third Reich leader Adolf Hitler. And he has a baseball- wielding Donny Donowitz (played by Eli Roth) at his assistance. This plan unexpectedly coincides with a similar plot hosted by German actress Bridget Von Hammersmark (played by Diane Kruger) and Shosanna Dreyfus (played by Melanie Laurent), an owner of a French movie theater, who has plans hosting a Nazi propaganda movie for the Nazi Party; which will allow her to burn down the theater to kill the party in revenge for the murder of her family at the hands of one of Hitler's sinister accomplices SS Colonel Hans Landa (played by Christoph Waltz) <br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino is not a director who typically exercises realism, as demonstrated in his previous works. In the case of this audacious black comedy, realism is not something you should come to expect as Tarantino pursues for a more satirical rendition on a war story that is never found in the history books but instead takes liberties from World War II's long and unsettling history. It is bold, yet engaging method that allows the director to establish an anarchic spirit into the plot while injecting a slew of devilishly striking dialogue and humor that pushes the boundaries of comedic edginess. From the opening scene introducing Christoph's Waltz's Hans Landa in a long conversation followed by a jarring massacre that sets one of the story lines in motion, this film journeys through a steady pace of interconnecting characters coming together to face down against the tyrannical ruler Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich, and is all exhibited a series of long stretches of conversations constructed with snappy Tarantino-style dialogue (most of which is spoken in German and French with English subtitles) punctuated with an unexpected burst o violence that leads to plenty of bloodletting and death. And it is all done with satisfying results, which is significantly impressive consider the prolonged 153-minute runtime. While those unfamiliar with Tarantino's style are likely to find themselves bored to death and disgusted the gruesome acts of violence committed sporadically throughout the proceeding, others will be wildly engaged in the director's outstanding method of writing and sketching out the characters. With each scene effectively building up to the ultra-violent, yet sucker punch of a climax, there is almost never a moment that feels squandered.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt, making his inauguration into the Tarantino universe, plays Lieutenant Aldo Raine, delivering each line of dialogue of bold spirit and enthusiasm to make his character stand out a pot of gold. Eli Roth also gets his time to shine in one scene where he delivers his revenge on an unapologetic Nazi. It is an aggressively brutal, but without a touch of humor, and Roth plays it out with great versatility. Melanie Laurent is great as Shosanna, nothing that will blow anyone else of the cast out of the water however. Daniel Bruhl, playing a small role as a French sniper with a fascination for Shosanna, is good. But again, nothing special. Without the doubt the big star in the crowd is Christoph Waltz who plays Colonel Hans Landa, the dubious German accomplice of the Third Reich with a sinister agenda. Portraying the character with unexpected charisma and humanity, Waltz goes against the grimness of a mindless Jew Hunter in favor of a more satirical portrayal of a morally despicable, and his performance shines like gold. Then there are few widely recognizable actors like Mike Myers and Michael Fassbender popping in small roles with sweet performances, but not enough to make them too memorable. And in like most of his works, Tarantino also leaves plenty of room for some less-known actors playing in minor roles. Too many to name, but the best I can say it that they are all mostly solid. <br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is an audacious, yet devilishly entertaining take on World War II, and a solid demonstration on why Quentin Tarantino is such a respected Hollywood tycoon. It is violent, it is talky, but not without the clever methodology of Tarantino to keep things engaging and shockingly funny. This film is a shark that demands that is hungry for your attention, if you handle the ballsy nature of Tarantino's direction."
"estreet-eva","4","1","3","9 July 2015"," Good for your romance language class, not so much for history class
","What to do when you find that the dialog you wrote for your historically inaccurate revenge fantasy doesn't quite live up to ""Royale with Cheese"" standards of your earlier work? Translate it into 3 romance languages. The French (29%) in particular lends an air of sophistication but don't use to much Italian (1%) as it can feel a little cheap unless it is in the context of an opera (see the much better film ""Amadeus""). To further extend the faux sophistication extend our your scenes to a wildly unnecessary length. Some of these scenes, particularly the opening interrogation of a French farm family harboring Jewish refugees in Nazi-occupied France and a tense bar scene later in the movie while the murderers who are the good guys (as opposed to the murderers who are the bad guys) try to avoid blowing their cover as Nazi soldiers, draw out so to an interminable length. We all know all Tarantino scenes end with everyone in the scene save one getting shot - can't he just get to the point more expeditiously? <br/><br/>To be fair the costumes and set decoration are excellent. Christop Waltz's performance is stellar particularly in contrast to some overdoing it from Brad Pitt whose accent somehow sounds like he is an European doing an American accent despite being from Pittsburgh. <br/><br/>In short, while self-indulgent and in need of an editor, the film nevertheless will entertain Tarantino's core fan base."

","Well, I can't write the review without repeating some of the reviews most negative reviews which I found only honest reviews. All other Reviews are either from Studio people and friends of Director. Beside that the most amazing and annoyed thing is how come a respectable site like IMDb gave this worthless crap, well, not totally, with all due respect to Christoph Waltz 10 minutes, gave this movie a 8.3 stars seriously which would cast the doubt on very credibility I have on IMDb reviews. Though I understand that sites need money to run and every now and then they compromise some ethics and take money to give high rating, it's all business at the end of the day. These days nothing is reliable let alone reviews on IMDb. This movie is nothing but bad and worst kind of propaganda movie I have seen on WWII. Kind of boring showing the same crap again and again, Jews Victims, the brutality of the Nazis and all. Well, it seems that the Oscar jury mostly consists of aging Jews because every crap movie based on WWII brutality, brutality against Jews only, no movie that shows how much Russians/Germans/Japanese or Non-Jewish people killed which account for more than Jewish ever gets an Oscar. So Quentin Tarantino thought that in his long career, he doesn't have much chance of getting an Oscar so he studied and found out that the easiest way to get Oscar is to make a movie about WWII, showed the same crap of brutality of Nazis against Jews as subject matter get an Oscar which of course boost the career of any director in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Watched over 100 movies on WWII subject and every movie whether or not based on fact shows same dumb things, how come Germans get themselves killed like a bunch of fools, in this movie they just have two guards to protect hundreds of top notch German officers including Hitler?<br/><br/>Anyway, bottom line so much has been written negative about this movie still wondering when 3 out of 5 reviews are negative never seen in history that the movie still gets 8 stars. Doesn't its shame that when a movie given a 8.3 star ratings count with some of the greatest movies? How come such a crass and worthless movie like this count with those movies, isn't that an insult to all the great actors and directors and people behind those great movies? Next time IMDb should be carful before jack up the rating, not only they are losing credibility, but they are insulting the great legacy of Hollywood."
"BigMacker","3","1","3","26 December 2014"," A film lacking substance and research.
","Inglourious Basterds is an incredibly overrated and dismal film. The movie is an absolute joke, as the protagonists are depicted as war criminals while the supposed antagonists are displayed as heroes. <br/><br/>The film starts off with SS colonel Hans Landa (Christopher Waltz) interrogating a French dairy farmer. This scene was great, as it conveys how effective the main antagonist is with his eventual undoing of the farmer. To the audience, Landa lived up to his name of ""Jew Hunter"".<br/><br/>Despite that, this is the only scene that I actually enjoyed from this film<br/><br/>1. The capture of the ""Nazis"" by the eight Jewish-American paratroopers was the first mistake on Tarantino's behalf. I place ""Nazis"" in quotation marks as these were not Nazis, but Wehrmacht soldiers. They are just common soldiers, not part of the S.S. Aldo Raine allows for a soldier to be brutally beaten by a Basterd, and then tortures another soldier by carving a swastika on his head. Remind me why I should side with the ""protagonists"" again?<br/><br/>2. The tavern standoff was another disastrous scene. Wilhelm and Aldo negotiate, and come to a compromise in the end. After explaining that Wilhelm wants to go back to his family, he courageously agrees to Aldo's compromise. This scene is excellent, until Hammersmark just gets up and shoots him dead. Absolutely disgusting. These are the people I should be rooting for? I wished the German soldier had shot Hammersmark dead after that dreadful turn of events. <br/><br/>3. The end is also just a cesspool of bullshit. Things blow up and thousands of people get either shot or burned alive. I understand the Tarantino style, and I appreciate it, but this is just the stupidest scene ever. The whole scene looks comical and idiotic, a neat little tie up to this awful film. If this were role reversal, and the Germans trapped the higher Allied authority in a theatre and massacred them, the audience would have been horrified. <br/><br/>There were also other inconsistencies that Tarantino failed to address, such as; Why is there a black person helping in a theatre? They do address this in the film, but it was a wonder he wasn't immediately sent to a concentration camp, or at least barred from working with Dreyfus.<br/><br/>But I digress. The acting was on par, but the story was horrendous and an insult to the World War II legacy. It must be understood that if your allegiance stood with Germany throughout the War, it does not mean that you are instantly classified as a Nazi. The Wehrmacht were merely soldiers that fought for Germany, the same as the Allied forces. It is unbelievably inaccurate to suggest that most of the soldiers were war criminals or ""Nazi Sympathisers"".<br/><br/>Ultimately Inglourious Basterds displayed its true colours through the lack of research on Tarantino's behalf, and failure to identify the protagonists from antagonists. The Germans were depicted as heroes who fought for their country, while the Allies conveyed as ruthless murderers. <br/><br/>3/10"

","This movie is the wet dream of a certain class of people who might have heard about the horrors of WWII from relatives. This is surely the wet dreams of brainwashed people who think they know what happened during WWII. Without even going too much about the clichés that all Germans or almost all are brutal convicts, with cold faces, this movie is trying to induce into us the meaning of revenge. Firstly because they could not revenge during the war and secondly because it might help to bring forward more actual events and points of tensions in the World today. Like all Tarantino's productions this movie is violent and in fact does not show the Jews under such a nice aspect as they are in fact just applying the Talon's law: one eye for an eye. I have news for you, 1 bln catholics disagree with this law and forgiveness is something that should be in fact more promoted as it is a gift (read: love) and this should help all the people with a good nature which is I believe the case for most of us ... and certainly not Hollywood producers. If you like just violent movies, you should watch it it is great. If you have a critical mind and do not want to give money to producers doing propaganda, do not watch this movie."

","An a amazing depiction of fiction, totally focusing on WW2 in Nazi occupied France, shows that the master Quentin Tarantino, has no lengths when it comes stretching the history of violence. This amazing portrait shows great performances all round, especially from Brad Pitt and the superior multi-lingual Christoph Waltz. A great cameo from Michael Fassbender and super performances from other unknown actors that Tarantino has picked individually that makes this movie a must see. Christoph Waltz performance is one you can clearly throw an Oscar at and not expect it back. His performance as the 'Jew hunter' is chilling and also intriguing to a point that you can't stop watching. Brad Pitt disbelievers will have to swallow their hatred towards some of his previous performances and will have to eat their pride. A sublime and quite lovable portrayal will have you splitting your sides. A movie that focuses on bad against badder.

You start to thing of it more philosophically, like what's in the mind of that character and you see more who he/she is. Also you can feel a bit of who he/she is.

","Not only did none of the events in this film ever happen, they never would or could.

"TheFamilyBerzurcher","4","1","3","10 March 2012"," Tarantino Continues To Disappoint
","It is high time to evaluate Tarantino's progress as a filmmaker. RESERVOIR DOGS had a Hawksian vagary among violent showmanship. PULP FICTION had panache, form, and wit. JACKIE BROWN took fans by surprise, but stands as conversational gold. KILL BILL was an embarrassing collection of references, far worse than their originators. <br/><br/>And now, BASTERDS. If film schools had a worst nightmare, it should be Quentin Tarantino. This picture represents the hallmark of a filmmaker incapable of understanding the world around him unless it is a movie. How do I make a World War II film? he said. How do I rewrite history? he said? A movie. <br/><br/>BASTERDS shows no comprehension of evil. Even Tarantino's usual comic inversion has become stale. Waltz does not fail to deliver yet another enchanting performance, but amongst what? Does the audience walk away with anything here? By hammering Tarantino's personal belief in the strength of movies, powerful enough to alter history, he insults the intelligence of the audience - preaching a theme that has been handled with grace and subtlety by is own heroes, Godard - Lang - Hitchcock - Hawks - etc. <br/><br/>Tarantino might have seen every B-film ever made. He has probably seen more movies than I have. But at what cost? Is there any real danger in his scenarios? I challenge you to think of a scene where a character seemed to be threatened by any palpable source. Even the torture sequence of RESERVOIR DOGS carries such distance from feeling. It does nothing but inspire cringing. <br/><br/>The only reality we see in BASTERDS is one that we have already seen on the screen. Noting his rich knowledge of film history, I am ashamed of Tarantino for placing the members of the Third Reich in a theater, themselves watching a war film. He should have known that Hitler would have never seen a film of that quality, nor would any German. They would be watching something like DER BLAUE ENGEL. If Tarantino is going to lean his work against the history of film with such gravity, it requires a reverence that was only present in JACKIE and perhaps PULP. <br/><br/>I do not mean to dismiss the film entirely. There is the usual degree of comedic panache and photographic shimmer. But it is discouraging to see legions of viewers responding so mindlessly to the work of a director who still has much to prove. <br/><br/>We need to encourage Tarantino to go out -- get hooked on opium, get shot, feel hate. Until he sees emotion through something other than a screen or a viewfinder, he will always be jogging around the edges of any Pantheon.<br/><br/>44.7"

","I am not a fan of Tarantino's (I got a third of the way into Kill Bill before I decided it was trash) nor of extreme violence or shlock, so I approached this film with some trepidation. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there were only a couple of scenes with the actual ""Basterds"" themselves being ""ruthless"", indeed, they could almost have been omitted from the film without affecting it. The show was stolen by Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa, with excellent performances by Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus and Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark. Landa's mixture of creepy humour and immense intelligence has all the attractiveness of a hypnotic cobra, and the scenes in the small-holding, in the party where he comes face to face with Shoshanna for the second time, and in the cinema with von Hammersmark are sufficient reason to give the film a decent rating, together with the cliff-hanger basement scene. Brad Pitt is absolutely hopeless, his characterisation makes no sense and his acting is bizarre. Apart from the scenes mentioned above, the film varies around the mediocre, but was always watchable, except for the mutilation and baseball-bat scenes, which were entirely prurient, unnecessary, and should disgust any right- thinking person. If your side in a war sinks to that kind of level, well, you've lost."

While I understand that this may have been portrayed in irony (which would bring us to political debate), the violence was out of place, which, again, if it was irony... well, I suppose that ""would"" be the point.

For example, when the ""war hero"" (Daniel Brühl) intrudes upon ""Emmanuelle Mimieux"" and she asks him to lock the door, etc., etc., (I shall not spoil it completely) well, that scene was marvelously comical just at that moment, just after the ""war hero"" did a switch on us from squeamish (in watching his heroics in the movie within the movie) to brutal vs Emmanuel. There are 100% marvelous scenes like that dotted, and some prolonged, throughout the movie. The ""card game"" in the tavern comes to mind.<br/><br/>What was done with Mélanie Laurent (Emmanuelle) and Christoph Waltz (The Jew Hunter) was marvelous. I very much liked their acting. I liked the British character too (Michael Fassbender), who posed as a Nazi. The acting by all, overall, I would say was quite good. As for Brad Pitt, well, his character was Tarantino's ""fool"" and I have yet to decipher the director's exact intentions regarding Pitt's character, but I felt Pitt acted as he was supposed to act. There was nothing wrong with Pitt, perhaps his character, but not Pitt.<br/><br/>There are marvelous scenes, and there are scenes which portray horror, some scenes successfully, some perhaps not well at all, and I will have to watch this movie again to see if my initial interpretation was correct.<br/><br/>I would recommend the movie for the ""frequent enough"" marvelous scenes, and for the controversial ones as well."

The first scene was great, I mean, there was a great atmosphere, great color selection, great script, great performances, you all know who I'm talking about, if not, Chrostoph Waltz. After the first scene, the film takes a very bad turn and goes downhill from then on.<br/><br/>What happens in the early-mid part of the film?. Nothing..., just an attempt to replicate some of the things he (Tarantino) did in the past, he failed terribly at all of these. Just an example: <br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT**** <br/><br/>The last bit of the film where the girl gets killed is basically what he did in Kill Bill when O-Ren Ishii's parents were killed. The only difference is that in Kill Bill he succeeded remarkably well. You may or may not like Kill Bill but that scene was beautiful, the colors, angles, animation and MUSIC were all dancing together for the same purpose.<br/><br/>The scene where the guy comes out with the baseball bat is an attempt to replicate the entrance of the Crazy 88 in Kill Bill. Failed at that as well, too long, too boring, turned out to be quite annoying.<br/><br/>******************** <br/><br/>The mid-last part of the film was boring as well. Long conversation and very pointless ones. You know Tarantino, scripts tend to have random conversations but this was just too random for my taste.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go against the historical inaccuracies like some people who wrote reviews because it's fiction, you need to understand that.<br/><br/>The other performances were dull to me. Brad Pitt did a good job, I think the best he could've done. Why?, because he is a fantastic actor. But the part was not very well written, so there's limits to a performance.<br/><br/>Maybe if the film had been an hour shorter I would've reacted differently.<br/><br/>In conclusion, try to be objective please. Last but not least, because it's a film by Quentin Tarantino doesn't mean it's going to be good, great, or bad. If you are curious, go and watch it."

As disturbing as this may be, Quentin takes it even further.<br/><br/>This film treats Nazi's like inhuman, evil and retarded... 60 years ago, that is what the Nazi's would call Jews.<br/><br/>We see a scene where a German soldier surrenders, and then being beaten to death with a baseball bat.<br/><br/>Furthermore, we see a slaughter of German officers in the theater scene. Surprisingly enough the Nazi's were watching a slaughter of Americans.<br/><br/>Furthermore the Basters create scars on their prisoners foreheads with the swastika, much alike the Nazi's did with the Jews with the yellow David star.<br/><br/>These are just the main coincidences in between actual events from WWII and Inglourious Basterds.<br/><br/>Now I wonder, did Quentin put this into his movie deliberately? If so, he should be very ashamed. Because basically he is asking us, while watching his movie, to sympathize with the equivalent of the Nazi's, the Basterds.<br/><br/>Maybe I am reading to much into this, and it really is a coincidence.<br/><br/>The movie itself then? We'll it isn't worthless but it is too long, some scenes serve no purpose and are utterly boring.<br/><br/>However, this movie might be saved from totally crapdom by one of the GREATEST acting performances of the last decade. Christoph Waltz preforms the great, intellectual cunning, ruthless, and viciously charming Hans Landa. What an act. I think Quentin should have only kept in the scenes in which Christoph Waltz starred, and this movie would have been an actual classic.<br/><br/>The other actors gave away a very mediocre and non-rememberative performance. Shining at the bottom of this list is Brad Pitt. Wow. I've never seen Pitt portray such a one-dimensional character.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie i started to sympathize for the Nazi Hans Landa, and started to hate Aldo, portrayed by Pitt. Come on, Quentin, this can't be right? Summary: a so-so movie, not worth watching again."
"zofos","6","1","3","30 December 2009"," The Ego Has Landed
","Quentin Tarantino has been on a downward spiral recently and ""Death Proof"" seemed to signal that he had run out of ideas and was now imitating himself. ""Inglorious Basterds"" got generally good reviews from the critics, but I stayed away from the cinema release (that would have been unthinkable back in Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" heyday, oh how the mighty have fallen!) The film is a Jewish World War II revenge fantasy about a team of Jewish G.I.s lead by Brad Pitt who launch an ""Apache resistance"" against the Nazis behind enemy lines, scalping their victims to spread terror in the German ranks.<br/><br/>The film seems to be a love letter to Tarantino's Jewish financier Harvey Weinstein who has bankrolled every one of his movies for the last 15 years. It's also a tip of the hat to the movie-obsessed French for honouring him with the Palme D'Or for ""Pulp Fiction."" As Tarantino knows more about movies than probably any human being alive, he makes ""Inglorious Basterds"" a movie about a Nazi movie premiere which gives him the opportunity to get his fan-boy rocks off as his characters discuss obscure European films and filmmakers.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt recently said that he's lost interest in acting and it shows as he way overdoes his performance here as Lieutenant Aldo Raine. He speaks in an overly-loud redneck accent and reduces his character to a walking comic book of tough-guy clichés. Tarantino, once the master of dialogue, doesn't help him much with the lines he gives him to speak (just look at the scene where Pitt complains over and over and about being in a basement. Okay, Quentin, we get it!).<br/><br/>Christoph Waltz received universal praise for his performance as SS Colonel Hans Landa and it is impressive to see him act in three different languages (English, French and German) and he is playing something different than the usual sadistic Nazi monster (e.g. Ralph Fiennes in ""Schindler's List""). Waltz's Landa is quite a charming SS man and, at first, it did seem ridiculous that he would let Jewish girl Shoshanna escape the massacre of her family. However, the plot that Landa hatches to save his own neck and prosper in the United States makes his leniency seem believable later.<br/><br/>Diane Kruger plays the German actress Bridget von Hammersmark and it's interesting to see her acting in her native German language for once instead of the American-English she affects in the ""National Treasure"" movies.<br/><br/>Mike Myers has a pointless, one-scene cameo as a British officer. He's heavily-disguised with make-up and filmed in long-shot (was the make-up not good enough for close-ups, Quentin?).<br/><br/>Eli Roth, Tarantino acolyte and director of the ""Hostel"" movies, appears as ""The Bear Jew"" Donnie Donowitz and he's bulked up alarmingly for the part. Elliott Gould probably would have played this part if the movie had been made in the 70s.<br/><br/>There are nods to other movies. The deal Pitt strikes with Landa is reminiscent of the bargain Clint Eastwood struck with a German Panzer commander to share the gold in ""Kelly's Heroes"" (Tarantino even uses a piece of original music from that film in ""Inglorious Basterds."") The fiery massacre of the Nazis in the locked cinema recalls the finale of ""The Dirty Dozen"" and the ""all the rotten eggs in one basket"" line is from ""The Great Escape."" Any historically-accurate movie about an assassination attempt on Hitler would end in failure. We know Hitler survived every attempt on his life and committed suicide in his bunker in May 1945. But this is Tarantinoland and thank God it is. Here we see the Fuhrer get his comeuppance from the machine-gun of a Jew (Eli Roth) and his body seems to get riddled with bullets for about three hours (who could accuse Quentin of overkill?!). It's followed by a suicide bombing of the whole place (nice topical touch, Quentin). It's an audacious move on Tarantino's part to rewrite history the way he saw fit and it's this mental ending that makes the film stand out from others of its kind.<br/><br/>I had to watch ""Inglorious Basterds"" in several sittings on DVD as I kept falling asleep during the first half (not a good sign). The early scenes are endlessly talky (an old Tarantino problem that he refuses to address) and could have been trimmed to get to the point a lot quicker.<br/><br/>""Pulp Fiction"" is stuffed with classic moments from start to finish and there is nothing of that level in this movie. It has many typical Tarantino moments (a Mexican stand-off, close-ups of women's feet) but it takes a long, long, long time to get going. The ending is so out there and different that you just about forgive Tarantino for his extravagances. Just about."

","yesterday i watched inglorious bastards, this is one of the master piece from torrentino especially the actor who did as a German colonel done a great and excellent job. He has awesome acting skill.Excellent actor. I like all the chapters of the movie. i was sitting at the corner of the seat and biting my nails while i watching the movie. I was really bit nervous and continuously thinking what is going to happen and what will happen. I can assure it is the One of the best fiction ever. I like his way of making movies. Either its a pulp fiction, reservoir dogs or kill bill, something will be there to differentiate his movies from others. There he is and his skills. I was really amazed after watching kill bill volumes and became his fan. I can say loudly he is the of the most adorable director in this century. Brad pitt done a great job and other crew of this movie also done a good job. I can give 8 out of 10 for this movie."
"daren_dressler2008","9","2","10","5 July 2010"," Well Made Film
","I very rarely give a movie such a high review, but all I can say is ""WELL DONE QUENTIN Tarantino!"" This script was very well written and the dialogue was amazing. A lot of the movie is subtitled because German and French are used frequently. The foreign language takes nothing away from the film, even if you only speak English. The foreign language adds to the creativity and artistic value of the film and makes it much more realistic. The movie is classic Tarantino. The angles are very interesting and the labels appear over the characters' heads throughout the movie quite often.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie was surprisingly good as well. Brad Pitt did a pretty good job. Pitt is a good actor, but I was a little nervous to see him try to pull off this film, but he did it. Nothing need be said about Christoph Waltz's performance. His performance was absolutely perfect! I would recommend this film to anyone who appreciates good artistic integrity."
"Lukewhystalker","9","2","10","6 January 2010"," Awesome, witty, violent, romantic visually evocative, a masterpiece.
","I didn't want to watch this but someone in my family got it. Scene one was slow way to slow for me with this German officer, smooth as silk and sinister as well as charm personified. The actor, and find of the new decade, Christopher Waltz gives a remarkable performance and for me steals the accolades by a whisker. A star is born!(well hes been well known in Europe for years but now Hollywood will show him to all the world) Brad Pitts bunch of basterds are not all the film is about but the story is both graphic and beautiful with many tarantinoesque moments. For me his best work to date. If you hate Tarantino's work please watch this, its a stellar piece from him, stellar.<br/><br/>Pitts uncompromising ruthless and yet comical character is played brilliantly, the boy ain't just a pretty face.<br/><br/>Melanie Laurent features heavily and plays Shosanna Dreyfus, she is both beautiful and acts the part wonderfully.<br/><br/>The spin is that unlike most WW2 films this gives a different spin being a fictional piece of work, it leaves you with a sense of satisfaction at the ultimate outcome and is a film that for me registers right up there and believe me I seen them all.<br/><br/>WATCH IT!"

","Yeah, WWII was a big, knee-slapping joke.<br/><br/>Lots to be made fun of...<br/><br/>Oh wait, this film isn't about WWII. It's about, you guess it!, Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>The fact there isn't a ""Big Kahuna burger"" reference was shocking and shows QT's maturity. Just like Pitt's silly, drawling hick caricature.<br/><br/>Other caricature's besides Silly Hitler and Hick Pitt? Not really many worth mentioning...<br/><br/>There really isn't much of a plot to be concerned with. A generic French caricature wants to murder a theater filled with Nazi caricatures. Some of the American/Jew soldier caricatures are kind of involved but not really integral to what there is of a story. They're more like one of the comic-relief elements.<br/><br/>Like Hitler. Because we know what great comic relief Adolph Hitler is. He did so much funny stuff, nothing better than to make a self-referential, totally fictional comedy about him.<br/><br/>I think this joke of a film is one of the most offensive wastes of time I've ever seen committed to film. Got rid of my QT DVDs and I will never sit through another Quentin Tarantino film under any circumstance. Never seen such an example of an arrogant, immature and self-absorbed ""director"". <br/><br/>I hope he retires."

"Dreadius","10","2","10","15 October 2009"," The best movie I've seen since The Return of the King
","I've always been a Tarantino fan and I love all of his movies, Pulp Fiction is easily his best film, until I watched Inglorius Basterds yesterday. Oh boy, I don't even know where to start. All actors did an amazing job and I usually don't like Brad Pitt (I've never really liked him, except for his role in 12 Monkeys), but in this movie I really saw what an amazing actor he is and he was fitted for this role perfectly. He played Lt. Aldo Reine, a very funny character. I don't think he'll win an Oscar, but I know one who will, or even maybe two. Christoph Waltz, love you man! I've never heard of him before, but already in the beginning when he sat there and smoked his pipe and drank his glass of milk, I knew this man is going to win an Oscar. His acting was probably one of the best I've seen in years. He played a kinda creepy character who was also, like Aldo, kinda funny. The other one who I think will win an Oscar is Melanie Laurent, she was so good and played here role perfectly.<br/><br/>What I liked so much about this movie was the dialogs. I usually never like long dialogs in movies, especially not in war movies when it's supposed to be a lot of action, which I love. But when it comes to Tarantinos films they tend to get very interesting and captivating, and Inglorious Basterds is just what a Tarantino film is all about. The way this movie was shot was just beautiful and the sound was amazing, it'll surely win an Oscar for that too, and I sure hope Tarantino will win an Oscar for best director.<br/><br/>This was the best movie I've seen since Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and after I left the cinema (gotta add that the audience applauded like never before when the Inglorious was over) I was really moved. This is Tarantinos masterpiece and I'm definitely going to buy this on DVD (alternatively Blu-Ray) when it comes out.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I have been a Q.T. fan since the age of thirteen when my father took me to go see Pulp Fiction in Theaters. I remember coming home and heading directly to my room to look up Ezekial 25:17 in my bible. I could hear my mother giving my dad a hard time for taking me to see that ""violent trash"" and him responding with ""It couldn't have been that bad, look he's reading the bible."" And truly deep down we all know that Q.T. doesn't make violent trash. Admit or live in denial. It doesn't matter. What does matter is that ""Inglourious Basterds"" is the greatest film I have seen in my twenty-nine years of living. The tension and anxiety you feel from the first scene to the last keeps you trapped in another world. Some people may find this wordy world boring and uninteresting. I feel sorry for these people, for the pleasure I get watching this film makes me feel selfish that they don't. It's a happiness that only movies can give. The only way I can feel alright with people not having this experience with this movie is that a movie will come along for them that does the same. Thank you Quentin Tarantino. Thank you so much.<br/><br/>P.S.- I took my mom to see this movie and she loved it as she loves Pulp Fiction after giving it a chance."
"meeza","10","2","10","13 September 2009"," The inglorious glory of Tarantino reigns!
","Ingloury, Ingloury alleluyah, Tarantino has laid it down! The Q is back in Director monarchy status with his rocking orchestration of ""Inglourious Basterds"". The I.B.'s (see film title) are a renegade squad of Jewish-Americans with a German Nazi killer who go on a mission in Nazi occupied France to hunt down and dismember the Nazialites during World War II. The Basterds are led by redneck Lt. Aldo Raine, a scowl-gestured feisty leader who is one damn funny basterd, and has a zero-tolerance sympathy for the germy Nazi Germans. Brad Pitt's brilliant performance as Raine was a shower of comic delight. The rest of the Basterds include: Sgt. Donny Donowitz, a baseball bat basher who hits Nazi brains out of the war park; Pfc. Omar Ulmer, a Nazi brain dismembering specialist who definitely makes the Basterd cut right; Private Smithson Utivich, the quiet Basterd who Nazis nickname ""The Little Man"" without him knowing; Lt. Archie Hicox, the undercover Basterd who needed to take some foreign accentuation classes before his spy gigs; and last but not least, the German beast Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz, a bulky German who is famed for brutally murdering Nazis and therefore ends up a Basterd. The beastly basterd supporting thespian work of Eli Roth as Donowitz, Omar Doom as Ulmer, B.J. Novak as Utivich, Michael Fassbender as Hicox, and Til Schweiger as Stiglitz was Basterd grunt euphoria! Not since the ""Saving Private Ryan"" grunts have I witnessed some fine acting in a movie war squad! OK Meeza, at ease! Now let's move to the dark side, the Nazis. Christoph Waltz plays the verbally manipulative Nazi Colonel Hans Landa, his specialty is to find hiding Jews in all of France at all costs. Hans is the premier villain of the film, yes even above Der Fuehrer himself. I have not witnessed such a despicable, but yet quite charming, villain in a film since I witnessed another Hans twenty years ago that being Hans Gruber in ""Die Hard"". Waltz' virtuoso performance will waltz him into the Oscar dance with a Best Supporting Actor nomination, and even a win. Some commanding Nazi supporting acting turns were also executed by Daniel Bruhl as Private Fredrick Zoller, a Nazi war hero who stars in a movie based on his sniper work in killing thousands of Jews; and August Diehl who plays Dieter Hellstrom, a supercilious German Major who grows suspicious of Hicox's fake German accent and partakes with some of the Basterd undercovers in a drunken game at a basement tavern. Hell, even Martin Wuttke was not bad playing Hitler himself; that is the only time you will see ""not bad"" and ""Hitler"" in the same sentence. And what about the chicks? Shosanna Dreyfus might be just considered the central character of the film. Dreyfus is a France theatre owner who lost her entire family during one of Landa's Jew seeking expeditions a few years ago. With inglorious intervention a few years later, she is confronted with devilish Hans again when he is self-assigned the role of Security Head for the premiere of Zoller's sniper film at Dreyfus' theatre. Consequently, Shosanna comes up with a fiery plan to eradicate all Nazi officers attending the premiere in her theatre. Melanie Laurent's work as Dreyfus was of Best Saint Laurent scent. Another delightful fem performance was delivered by Diane Kruger playing famed German actress Bridget Von Hammersmark, who is also set her mark in rightfully betraying her country by hammering some Nazis, and even congregates with the heroic I.B.'s to eradicate the Nazis at the film premiere in Shosanna's theatre. Yes, there is a myriad of plot developments within the movie, but Quentin would not have it any other way. Tarantino's screenplay was masterful as the dialogue itself within the characters symbolized the red flags of bloody red violence lurking thereafter. No one develops this form of verbal antecedent better than Tarantino, as he has also formulated it proficiently in his past films. It has become the Q's original writer-director niche. Quentin most certainly deserves Best Director & Best Screenplay Oscar nominations for his stellar film-making of ""Inglourious Basterds"". The Academy would be the new Inglorious Bastards if they fire him with snubs. Tarantino's glorious film-making team also made their mark! Robert Richardson's cinematography & Sebastian Krawinkel's art direction were cine veritas on the authenticity of Nazi-occupied France. As in most of Quentin's films, the music & the score played integral parts in ""Inglourious Basterds"" developments, and the hip glorious tunes tuned us all attentively. OK, I know I have been a critical basterd by elongating this film review! But I just wanted to provide you a cut-by-cut analysis on the masterpiece entitled ""Inglourious Basterds"". ***** Excellent"
"King4taday","10","2","10","11 September 2009"," Thrilling, Tense, Revengeful....JUST PLAIN Tarantino
","Tarantino's best yet, as mentioned in the last line of the movie. As in all his movies, Tarantino bases the plot on one main human emotion: Revenge. From the very first scene when first introduced to the evil yet eerily charming Hans Landa, I was hooked. This movie has every aspect of Tarantino you loved in his other films. The long, tense conversations, the blood lust, the diverse culture influence, the weird and random music clips and introductions, and the multiple plots coming together in the end. If you do not like his work, then you will probably not appreciate the movie. But it is a masterpiece. I love how the actors were of the same nationality as the characters they were portraying, and how 75% of the movie was subtitled. Makes the movie that much more realistic and the characters that more interesting. If the movie had any negative draws it would be Brad Pitt portraying a southern smart-ass. He definitely adds humor to a serious plot, but having his character not show any emotion other than sarcasm and wit is a little too unrealistic to me. Christoph Waltz should win an Oscar hands down for best actor. The rest of the cast also brilliant. GREAT MOVIE!! Can't wait for the DVD."
"tmricks","3","2","10","7 September 2009"," A Mixed Bag
","This movie starts out with a set of scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat...just stunning, terrifying, and tense. There are many scenes that are like that when Christoph Waltz, Melanie Laurent, Daniel Bruhl, and Diane Kruger are in front of the camera, but Brad Pitt was just awful...over-the-top posing, hammy acting. Pitt ruined Terry Gilliam's ""Twelve Monkeys"" for me in the same way - the man is a terrible actor.<br/><br/>What also marred the movie for me is Quentin Tarantino's penchant to offset his use of gratuitous violence with slap-stick humor and sophomoric dialogues. For some insane reason, he also breaks the mood of the movie with chapter titles and cartoony identifying balloons as if the audience was too stupid to know who Joseph Goebbels or Martin Borman might be. Finally, the ending is so improbable and weak, that if you are not conflicted about what this movie was to be by then, you will be when the credits roll.<br/><br/>So, despite the impressive acting by Waltz, Laurent, Bruhl, and Kruger, both Brad Pitt, with his acting, and Quentin Tarantino, with his script and cartoony intrusions conspired to make this a ""mixed bag"". Too bad that Quentin couldn't have stayed with those wonderful actors from the start, kept out of the way, and found a better lead than Brad Pitt. There are a half-dozen actors who could have matched Waltz etal in Hollywood from Sean Penn, Johnny Depp, Matt Damon, to Denzel Washington."
"ozzyrocks86","10","2","10","31 August 2009"," Amazing!
","The great Quentin Tarantino has done it again! Just when there was a general feeling he wouldn't be able to top the brilliant Pulp Fiction and has exhausted his creative capabilities the man comes up with this resounding, resonating masterpiece. I'm trying to think of the number of times I've walked out of a movie theater wanting to watch the movie all over again. Not many times. This movie was an exception to the rule.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into the ins-and-outs of this movie as some of the esteemed and not-so-esteemed reviewers have already done so in this wide technological expanse known as the internet but I would like to point out a few things that stood out: The acting of Christoph Waltz. Do us a favor Academy, drop all the talk of best actor in a supporting role for next years Awards, drop all the potential nominations and give this man the award. Now. To say that his acting was the highlight of the movie would be a sacrilegious understatement. His acting MADE this movie. Watch the movie to believe it.<br/><br/>The look and feel. In order to properly portray a bygone era the look and feel is very important. Somehow I couldn't help but wonder how Michael Mann got it wrong with Public Enemies. QT though, does it right. This movie has that stylish, noir-like feel to it that is reminiscent of movies of that era.<br/><br/>The dialogue. This one is probably a no-brainer to most people given that this is a QT film but the dialogue in this movie is just incredible. The interaction between the characters is excellent and the actors deliver their lines very well.<br/><br/>Brilliant in its exposition, taut in its build up to the denouement, and a rousing, thrilling and thoroughly inventive climax make this movie a passionate movie-lover's joy. A must-see. 10/10."
"Alexmiles","9","2","10","28 August 2009"," One of Tarantino's best
","I'm a fan of Tarantino. I think Pulp Fiction is one of the best movies ever made and I've seen both of the Kill Bill movies more than just a couple of times. So when I went to the cinema to watch Inglorious Basterds, my expectations were high. Very high, to be exact, as I've read reviews in Empire and Inside Film (not to mention all over the web) that said: this movie's great. And it is. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves film because this is a rare treat. The first chapter is the most 'serious' and I was very much appalled while watching. It was, for me, a bit too real and too cruel. But then again, it's set during World War II - which was both real and cruel itself. The next chapters, though still a tad cruel, are less realistic and thus much more movie-like. You find yourself laughing all the time, sometimes questioning yourself whether this is something you SHOULD laugh at. The acting's amazing. I'm not a Brad Pitt fan but it's movies like this one (and, let's say, Fight Club) that make it difficult for me not to be one. And if I see Christoph Waltz when walking down the street one day, I may just run away screaming. Besides the directing and the acting, the reason I liked this movie so much is the fact that English is not the only language used. And when it is used, it's with a reason other than ""well, it's an American movie"". There's English, yes, but there's also French and German. And a little bit of Italian.<br/><br/>So let me just conclude with telling you to go see this movie. It's shocking and it has you on the edge of your seat all the way through."
"pbajt","5","2","10","27 August 2009"," Mildly amusing but doesn't compare to other QT masterpieces.
","I'm finding it difficult to understand the ""WOW"" reviews and high ratings for this movie. I have seen every other Quentin Tarantino movie and I like his work, especially ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservior Dogs"", but I don't think ""Inglourious Basterds"" is half as good as any of his previous works. The plot is half-baked and was only saved by the excellent acting of most of the cast. The way the Basterds ended up in the theater at the end was over the top and made no sense at all. QT stretches the limits of believability in most of his movies but this was simply ridiculous. The ending took it even further with all the top Nazis including Hitler dying in the fire amidst a hailstorm of machine gun fire?! I wasn't sure what to think. Is this the way QT wished they had met their end? I know he's not stupid enough to believe that's the way they died! It seemed as if he couldn't conjure up a satisfying ending so he just came up with the dumbest blood filled ending he could dream up out of desperation.<br/><br/>On a brighter note, Christolph Waltz and Melanie Laurent were excellent in their roles and the remainder of the cast performed admirably. Although I like Brad Pitt, I think he was terribly mis-cast in this role. He did, however, turn in probably as good a good performance as he could have under these circumstances. All in all, I wouldn't rate this movie much above mediocre. Five out of ten stars."
"bobsgrock","10","2","10","27 August 2009"," A fake war, a real director.
","As if we needed any reminding, Quentin Tarantino remains as one of the five best directors working in movies today. His previous film, Death Proof, billed together with a gory zombie movie was more than just an entertaining 70's schlock movie. It was a tribute to all the films of that time as well to show that Tarantino could direct a new kind of action movie.<br/><br/>Here, he shows he can direct a new kind of movie altogether: the war fantasy. There is as much historical accuracy here as there is in Hogan's Heroes. Yet, that is the point and anyone who would dislike the movies simply because of that is missing it altogether. Tarantino is doing what Steven Spielberg did with Raiders of the Lost Ark, rewriting history as more entertaining and more to his liking. Here, history occurs as Tarantino (and possibly many of us) would like to see it, which makes it more fun to take in and all the more beautiful.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is astonishing: long, tense and utterly engrossing. We know there is going to be a wild climax, we just don't know what or when. Tarantino feeds off our anticipation and goes all the way with it. Indeed, nearly every sequence feels like that. This being Tarantino, it will be very violent and shocking, but it is in a whole new way. I cannot think of one moment when it is boring or uninteresting. There is a lot of French and German, but even that dialog is entertaining to listen to. It seems that QT has evolved tremendously in his writing, going from tons of pop-culture references to more mature and deep talking; these people have something to say. As for his love of the cinema, it is never more apparent than here, as we get an enormous, over-the-top climax in a movie theater that I know Tarantino was enjoying in his head as he wrote it down. References to German cinema abound and he treats it with respect despite what it looks like.<br/><br/>All in all, this is QT's best work since Pulp Fiction; dazzling, amazing and utterly mind-blowing. His cast rises to the occasion with Brad Pitt and Eli Roth hamming it up as the leaders of the Basterds. Of course, I must point out Christoph Waltz as the Nazi Col. Landa, so ferocious and frightening he deserves an Oscar nod. Just as good is the stunning Melanie Laurent, a Jewish girl who runs the theater the Nazis intend to celebrate in. QT films her with all the affection and love a director can and it all the more increases her performance to new heights. A fake war, but a real director. And one I hope to watch for years to come, no matter how inaccurate it may be."
"freemantle_uk","10","2","10","26 August 2009"," Once Upon A Time In Nazi Occupated France
","This film has a simply premise; a group of Jewish Soldiers are sent behind German lands during World War 2 to kill as many Nazis as possible. It may sound like the plot of an exploitation film or a war film from the 60s or 70s, but Tarantino makes it work as a homage to those films.<br/><br/>Set during 1944, Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) leads a team of Jewish Soldiers, the Basterds behind enemies lines. Within this group includes 'the Bear Jew' (Eli Roth) and psychopath Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger). They mission, killing Nazis! They cause fear in the German ranks and are very successful at their mission. British Intelligence discover that the Nazis are planing to have a premier to the film Nation's Pride, and that the whole Nazi leadership is going to attend. British Intelligence sent Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) and plan with the Basterds and spy Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) to bomb the event. But hot on their trial is Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), the Jew Hunter. He is the head of the SS in France and an expert investigator. He is also a very sadistic man and great villain for any film.<br/><br/>Also in the mix is Emanuelle (Mélanie Laurent), a French Jew whom family had been killed by Landa. She ends up owning a cinema in Paris and the object of war hero and Nation's Pride star Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl). He is able to convince Joseph Goebbels to host the premier in her cinema. She plans to get her revenge on the Nazis.<br/><br/>Tarantino has shown in the past that he can turn B-movie material into excellent films and Inglourious Basterds is a excellent film to add to his filmography. He shows once again that he just does do action, but focuses on character, has great dialogue and builds up tension in a scene. He is not afraid to use violence to great affect. Some critics say Tarantino is self-indulgent, but he is an great filmmaker. In this film he is able to mix dark seriousness and comedy in one. Within this film Tarantino sticks to a linger narrative, unless most of his previous efforts. There are only a few flash backs in this film. They are great characters, especially Aldo Raine and Hans Landa, both perfectly played by their actors. Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz are wonderful actors on top form in this film. You care about what happens to them. There are fine supporting characters like Hicox and Emmanuelle, but the biggest surprise is Eli Roth showing he is a decent actor, much better then his efforts as a director.<br/><br/>There is a lovely cinematography within Inglourious Basterds, giving it the look of a 60s/70s war films. There are references to old war-films and Serigo Lorre's westerns (which Tarantino loves). But there are also homages to old Nazi propaganda films and there is a film-within-a-film.<br/><br/>Tarantino also shows his love for music with this film, picking some excellent classical and western style songs for his score. However, this is one of his weaker films for music.<br/><br/>The only one think that felt out of place, the narration by Samuel L. Jackson. But it is only for a few brief moments in this film.<br/><br/>Finally, if you think this film is a history lesson then you really are a gullible fool.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is the best film in 2009, so far."
"xaddisonx","10","2","10","25 August 2009"," Tarantino's work is never done, but he came close.
","What we were given with Inglourious Basterds was an artistic flourish from Tarantino's mind that nearly rivals, if not surpasses-yes I'll be brave enough to say it-Pulp Fiction. The characters, the plot, the setting, the soundtrack, camera angles, lighting are all enticing and meant to be. Tarantino's intentions are not only to direct a movie but give it life, which he has succeeded in with this vibrant and darkly funny take on a World War II revenge dream come true. The chapter division of the film is brilliant and provides fluidity and focus, so this is also how I shall analyze this film.<br/><br/>Once Upon a Time In Nazi-Occupied France: Lacking the brutish violence so many popular opinions will adore, I find this to be the scene which I admire most. We are introduced to the gem of this film, Chistoph Waltz, and are astonished by his delightfully dreadful detective persona. The dialogue is gripping, and the switch from French to English it seems was even designed, not as Waltz inadequacy with the language (which he was lying) but for the viewers wavering trust in the film at that point. Then, we are thrust into the dialogue with careful inspection and analyzing ears and eyes to make sure this is Tarantino's work. And we are rewarded with the end of the scene displaying the calm madness of a Tarantino film.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds: Comical characters, brutal violence against a common enemy. This chapter simply works.<br/><br/>A German Night In Paris: Here in the film we learn that this isn't just a ""Nazi killin time!!!! movie"" but an operatic masterpiece. The most boring of all the chapters, but perhaps the most important (it being the set up to the final chapter).<br/><br/>Operation Kino: Tarantino gives us what seems to be a short film in itself with this scene that contains so much tension the rubber band nearly snaps. The bar scene is played perfectly by all the pieces, important to the story and simple observers caught in the chaos. <br/><br/>Revenge of the Giant Face: In my opinion, one of the greatest endings to a film in history. Retribution, comedy, human nature are all revealed with blood soaked Nazis and evil usurpers. Brad Pitt's best scene in the movie. The beginning of this chapter though, until the giant face in plumes of smoke is pure art. From then on its giddy excitement from the vanquish of evil. With the final line by Aldo Raine ending in, ""this might just be my masterpiece."" Tarantino is clearly referencing his own film.<br/><br/>Brilliant from beginning to end, watch this movie multiple times."
"cinematic_aficionado","10","2","10","24 August 2009"," Nothing inglorious
","Perhaps their mission was inglorious but there is nothing inglorious about this movie. What a spectacular film. Great cinematography, sparkling dialogue, lots of violence, foulmouthed interactions and brilliant performances can only mean one thing: Quentin Tarantino did it again. Disregarding history altogether but still coming up with a strong storyline, filled with plenty of twists and reversals of fortune where, especially in the end the viewer had lost any sense of control and sequence. Without a second thought, this is my favourite film for this summer, if not for the year. In my opinion and adding to the above, Melanie Laurent made it even more worthwhile : )"
"Karlatta","10","2","10","24 August 2009"," Absolute Masterpiece!!!
","Let me start by saying I am a HUGE fan of Tarantino's work, I haven't yet seen a movie of his that I did not like, and this film did not fall short of my expectations in any way. I was amazed that a director could take a theme that is so commonly used and turn it around into something so original. I am always astounded at Tarantino's ability to make me cringe, laugh and cheer all in the same film. Film-making aside, another thing that impressed me with this particular movie is the integrity of it. Tarantino didn't have his characters speak English the entire movie simply because it would have been easier for the audience, as has been my complain with movies of a similar setting. Everything from the choice of cast members, to the witty lines that appear continuously throughout the film was terrific. In fact, the only aspect of the film more impressive than what I listed was the fascinating storyline."
"cultfilmfan","10","2","10","23 August 2009"," Inglourious Basterds
","For those seeking a realistic and accurate World War 2 film based on real facts and history and much in the style of classic films from the late 40's onwards, then you will be disappointed with Inglourious Basterds. For those who want something completely original and different from any war film you have probably ever seen and one of the most stylish and at times wonderfully weird, then this film is for you. For 2009, Inglorious Basterds is the first film of the year that comes close and pretty much succeeds as sheer perfection and a masterpiece of the ages. While, I choose not to give anything away about the story the film has a feel of films from the 60's and 70's (even though it does take place in the mid to late 1940's) and it borrows a lot from the Italian westerns of the 60's as well as some revenge and pulp/cult films of those eras. Some may feel that this may make the film a bit campy, or unrealistic. Yes and no. Some of the scenes and especially some of the violence is very over the top and for me at least it was so much that way that it didn't bother me as I have known it to bother some other people who saw it. The film is definitely not campy though. Weird, different, unusual and unique? Yes, but campy no. We have one of the year's best scripts and direction on display here with top notch dialogue and a stylish and very interesting style of direction that I really felt made the film the director's own without being a copycat of other war films. Yes, he is paying tribute to the 60's and 70's films I have mentioned with the style of it, but realistically, how many war films have you seen played out like that? The acting is also at it's best here with a very strong cast. There is not one weak performance out of all of them, but the absolute best goes to the scene stealing Christoph Waltz who plays Colonel Hans Landa. This is a character that can frighten, amuse and completely fascinate you and just the range Waltz has with this character is brilliant and I think is one of the first performances of the year that I definitely think will be up for an acting Oscar at next year's awards. Like I said everyone else did a great job as well. There are some fairly lengthy scenes in the film that just consist of character's talking, but the dialogue is so great here that instead of being boring it is fascinating and a complete joy to see these characters get into it, so to say, with their words. The film also has an artistic quality that often feels more like a European film and not that of a traditional Hollywood one and I really appreciated that. There are also some scenes in the movie that because of the acting, dialogue, music, script and direction are moments of sheer brilliance and there are a handful of scenes in this film that I will probably never forget because of how effective they were and how beautifully shot and delivered they came across. I will not give away any of these scenes, but those who have seen, or will see it will know what I am talking about. The film is also tremendously entertaining and what I wasn't expecting was actually how funny some of it was with some of the wise cracks of the characters, or just some of the more awkward, or over the top scenes in there. The audience I was with laughed a lot as well, so I must not have been the only one who found them funny. This film just oozes with brilliance and a unique touch sorely lacking in today's Hollywood films. This is a great piece of film-making on pretty much all levels. Again, I must add that you should read a little bit about the film in order to know what you are in for, because I can see a lot of people loving this film and admiring it as I have and I can also see people hating it. As for being controversial, it didn't offend me, but it wouldn't surprise me if some people were offended by it. A truly original and mesmerizing work that is so far the year's best film and one that will become a classic whether with a mainstream, or cult audience and will find greatness with such audience. One of the best films of the year."
"zimpiko28","9","2","10","22 August 2009"," Oh my god, Tarentino, you've done it again.
","This movie is awesome. Enough said. At first when I saw the trailer I was a bit disappointed considering it was a WWII film and starring Brad Pitt, which to me, just don't seem to mix. The action packed realism of this film actually convinced me that this actually might have happened. Why else wouldn't you want to see a bunch of Jewish American guys kick the sh** out of the Krauts? It looks like a drama based on the previews and the beginning but actually is quite a comedy to those who want to see the blood and gore that came out of this movie.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have with this movie is that you don't ever see some of the stuff you do in the trailer in the movie. Like the guy running down the hall with an MG-42 never happened and ""Lt."" Brad Pitt 'replying' ""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"" to Hitler. If you are squeamish then this film is not for you (of course). There are scenes of The Basterds scalping Nazi's and carving swastikas into German's heads. If I could give it a score it gets a solid A. There are a couple of mistakes but a great film nonetheless. It's so worth the money and time, so go watch it, or I'll call the Basterds on your ass."

","Quentin Tarantino's impact on 90ties Hollywood has been praised up and down since his first feature-length debut in 1992 with 'Reservoir Dogs'. Now, seventeen years and five movies later, he's released his war-film 'Inglorious Basterds' - a completely outrageous tale about a Nazi-killing crew of American-Jewish soldiers who scalpels their victims and beats them to death with a baseball bat. Lead on by Brad Pitt as the Tennessee-hillbilly Aldo ""The Apache"" Raine, the group of soldiers is a motley crew, including a stylish British lieutenant (the very good Michael Fassbender), a German-born psychopath (Til Schweiger), ""The Little Man"" (American Office's B.J. Novak) and the ""Bear-Jew"" (Eli Roth) to mention the more important. And with his titled crew Tarantino makes for great entertainment and characteristics, but - the biggest revelation comes from the other side; Christoph Waltz won the Best Actor award in Cannes for his performance as Standartenführer Hans Landa aka ""The Jew Hunter"", a creation so fabulous that he steals every scene he's in, and is quite possibly the finest single character Tarantino's ever created. His romantic swagger, his confidence and cruelty, and his odd inconsistency is riveting. As for the two female performances, we're given two shallow, but breezily enjoyable performances by Melanie Laurent as cinema-owner Shosanna, and Diane Kruger as German actress Bridget von Hammersmark.<br/><br/>The dialogs snap in 'Inglorious Basterds', and they often tend to act out full of thrill as the film is paced and behaves often like a espionage thriller - after all, we are behind enemy lines all the way throughout Tarantino's neat five chapters (remember Kill Bill?), and he's doing a interesting thing in messing with the usual, conventional narrative storytelling there. Running for 148 minutes the film never seizes to entertain, and Tarantino uses his usual homages (Sergio Leone, Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Aldrich) in elegant ways that makes that pure cinema loving heart pump. But I am glad to say that Tarantino doesn't rely enterily on his influences as he did in his Grindhouse-feature 'Death Proof', he directs finely operatic at times and relies solely on performance and dialog (which is brilliantly very often spoken in German, French and even Italian) - and it's delight! I found myself grown sick of Tarantino's often overrated talent as it seemed like this guy was simply growing younger instead of older, so it was with a pleased feeling that I left the cinema yesterday having seen his seventh film."
"arvindrockz","9","2","10","22 August 2009"," A truly Unique Roller Coaster Ride
","Quentin Tarantino's new brain child, Inglourious Basterds, touted to be a revenge fantasy drama, is set in an imaginary alternate universe, where Hitler and his Third Reich are being targeted upon for a massacre by different groups of like minded people, when the Fuhrer & Co. gather for a movie premiere in Paris.<br/><br/>She is true to her genes and we get to see Tarantino written all over her. Every frame in the movie worked for me. He promised us a chance for vengeance and he stayed true to his word. To appreciate this movie better, we need to step into this fantasy world of Tarantino. In this world, films are events and these events are inter related. Often, one film will inspire a bunch. Tarantino goes one level above and 'responds' through Inglourious Basterds to various events that happened over time in this world - Schindler's List, The Pianist, Life is Beautiful and the likes. The world would have seen 100s of such events which talk about the Holocaust. Apart from acknowledgement, honor and pity, these events deserve Vengeance in this world, in terms of a stylish response as in giving them a taste of their own medicine and they have been crying out loud for that. QT heard them. The point is, to appreciate the movie better, we've got to leave our judgmental hats on the Nazi/Jew issue at home and step into the vengeance bandwagon in this fantasy world. If you keep your real world hats on, you will either fall in love or despise her depending on your prejudice. Either way, you'd be too biased and bias affects judgement Tarantino takes us back to the good old days right from the opening credits card. The title card and the cast list roll without much drama and the color tones used are reminiscent of the 'Gone with the Wind' days. How's that for a first impression? The opening frame reads 'Once upon a time in Nazi occupied France' and we get to see the shot of a dairy farm, a pretty unexcited and frustrated average WW II times Frenchman, his not so happy looking daughters. Great color tones back to back and you get to see them aplenty. The Nazis are given one last screen space chance for their exploits and Tarantino decides that they've had enough. The tale is about how the plans of various vested vengeance seeking groups' plans unfold in this fantasy world.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt, Waltz and the rest of the cast have done an excellent job with Waltz being the pick of the lot and rightly honored by Cannes. As one can expect from a QT film, the dialogs are a big asset and keeps you all the more interested. He sets the ball rolling right from the opening interaction between Waltz and the Frenchman. But, more than dialogs, Tarantino has relied heavily on his fantasy script and screenplay in Inglourious Basterds, which has redefined gripping. There are no distractions, no 'could have been better/avoided' moments - absolutely. And yet again, QT excels in the depiction of violence and action sequences.<br/><br/>Taraantino has carried this movie on his shoulders all along and this movie is another milestone in mainstream commercial cinema. The announcement to his fellow makers is 'Guys, be it art house or commercial - Innovation is the Key'. The man has delivered, yet again. The Verdict has success written all over it. Hats off!"
"dking1583","10","2","10","21 August 2009"," Movie Review: Inglourious Basterds (2009)
","A Tarantino world is graphic, disturbing, and drawn-out. It's also fascinating, original, and just plain fun. His latest film, Inglourious Basterds, is no different. I believe it is on the same level as his masterpiece, Pulp Fiction, and, although it might be affected from the high of the experience, right now, I am saying it is the best film I have seen all year. The movie is broken up into five chapters, and for the whole two and a half hour running time, I never took my eyes off the screen. Not during the brutal violence, the loud and bloody climax, or the scenes of teeth-cringing suspense. This is a filmmaker that knows how to get an audience's attention and keep it for the entire film.<br/><br/>The movie's brilliant opening scene introduces the memorable character Hans ""The Jew Hunter"" Landa, played with so many emotions by the relatively unknown Austrian actor Christoph Waltz. In this first chapter, Landa enters the home of a dairy farmer named Perrier LaPadite and conducts a subtle interrogation that eventually gets the job done. He finds the Jews and takes them outbut one, named Shosanna (Mélanie Laurent), escapes.<br/><br/>In the second chapter, we are greeted with a long, expertly-written harangue delivered by the audacious and hysterical Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). Pitt is assembling a team of Jewish American soldiers whose mission is to scalp as many Nazis as possible. In fact, Raine actually demands 100 Nazi scalps from each member of the squad. Needless to say, they pass the test with flying colors. Arguably the most outrageous member of the crew, besides Raine, is Sgt. Donny Donowitz (Eli Roth), better known as ""The Bear Jew"". He spends his days beating Nazi soldiers to death with a bat. And they all love it.<br/><br/>After we meet the Basterds, we find Shosanna a couple years later, now living under the name of Emmanuelle Mimieux, as the owner and operator of a cinema which has been chosen by her somewhat stalker friend Frederick Zoller (Daniel Brühl) to premiere a feature film titled A Nation's Pride, which chronicles Zoller's unbelievable experience of killing 300 enemy soldiers by himself over the course of three days.<br/><br/>There are many more characters to meet in this film, such as the German actress, double agent named Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger), Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender), and Hugo Stiglitz, played by Til Schweiger. It would take too much to explain all of these stories in this short review, and you might seem lost already, but in this film Tarantino weaves this story as good as any story he's written before. Everything comes together beautifully and it is perfectly entertaining throughout.<br/><br/>Tarantino writes this film in an alternate history of World War II, which gives him complete freedom, and it certainly pays off. He doesn't want this to be ""just another WWII film."" He is creating a clever and completely original experience of a topic that has been filmed what seems like over a million times.<br/><br/>The performances that Tarantino gets in this film are all stunning. Even the actors that are in the movie for only one or two scenes create characters that are fully memorable, which is also credit to the script. Waltz's performance is undoubtedly the stand-out, not only because Waltz is terrific, but also because he is the most fascinating character on the page as well. The writer-director created a character that needed a big-time performer, and Waltz delivers. He turns in a performance that is hilarious, frightening, devilishly cunning, and it will certainly not be forgotten come Award season. Brad Pitt's performance is also very well done. Even though his character basically only hits one note the entire film, he manages to make every note funny and entertaining.<br/><br/>This is a film that has Tarantino written all over it. In some parts, you will be repulsed by the graphic violence, and in others, entranced in the dialogue that is absolute genius. From top to bottom, it is the best experience I've had at the theater the whole year. Sure, it's a little too long and a little too violent in places. But, who really cares? I am judging the movie as a whole, and it is undoubtedly four- star experience. And sometimes a four-star experience is better and more refreshing than a four-star film."
"willie_j_rudd","10","2","10","21 August 2009"," Tarantino wows audiences once again
","Being a huge Tarantino fan, I was incredibly excited, and had been since I heard of the film, to see how Tarantino planned to entertain me. He far exceeded my expectations, as well as others I'm sure, with Inglourious Basterds. The film is told through a chapter format, as Tarantino did in Kill Bill, switching between Shosanna Dreyfus' plot to extract revenge on Col. Hans Landa as well as other high ranking German Officers and the plots of the infamous ""Bastards"" led by Aldo ""The Apache"" Raine who spread fear throughout the German Army through their brutality, as well as the much feared Donnie ""The Bear Jew"" Donowitz. Brad Pitt as Raine makes the movie through his memorable lines he delivers as the films comic relief.<br/><br/>I must warn, if you plan on seeing a film with non-stop violence, this is not it. There are scenes with immense violence, but a majority of the film is filled with dialogue, as are most Tarantino films. In all, the film may not be Pulp Fiction, but it deserves, and will receive, much praise."

","Quentin Tarantino is an old friend. I can relate a lot to him, in the way that so much is expected from me that I find that people, when they are in my company, tend to enjoy more the prospect of being in my company than the actual experience. I always make good first impressions and I give people the illusion that I am a fun loving friendly, intelligent, articulate guy. It is my own fault, I am very stylistic, I watch a lot of movies, I like a lot of style, I like to impress myself on people as opposed to expressing myself to people. On first meetings I leave quite a good impression. The second time is when people begin to realize there's not much more than that stylistic facade I seem to veil over my soul. Some people are so smitten by their first impressions of me that they come to me, time and time again, hoping to catch a glimpse or be reminded of that initial meeting, hoping to be in the presence of some transcendent metaphysical spiritual resurrection of my old self, or, the old self that they once knew. But they always leave disappointed. Sometimes they are almost satisfied- but never truly satisfied. They expect certain things, and I never come through. I absolutely loved this movie. Everything about it. I'm only seventeen and therefore not too much in control of my own emotions or myself, so I found myself at times expecting too much, and, consequently, not allowing myself to enjoy the movie to it's fullest capacity. I want to watch it again. I want to watch it in peace with my mind and the world around me."

At the start it felt very like 'Once upon a time in the west' and in quality terms it was mighty close. <br/><br/>Stand out in the movie was the Jew Hunter whose performance was immense (up there with the Heath Ledgers portrayal of the Joker!!), Brad Pitts portrayal of Aldo Rain and also Rains attempt at an Italian accent (classic!!!!) <br/><br/>To sum it up i'd say that it could be tarantinos best yet and that it could be compared to once upon a time in the west without the long drawn bits.

"RickBrands","9","2","10","19 August 2009"," QT's glourious return to form
","This is truly a great movie, celebrating everything that's wonderful about cinema. Granted, although it isn't anywhere near as brilliant as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, Inglourious Basterds hits Tarantino's recent full-blown or half misfires like Death Proof (boring dialogue, uninteresting characters) and Kill Bill (fun, but annoyingly superficial) right out of the park, and rejuvenates this once-great director's career.<br/><br/>No need for nitpicking about the blatant historic inaccuracies, since this is just sheer good fun - made abundantly clear by the first chapter's title, 'Once Upon a Time... in Nazi-occupied France' -, with Christoph Waltz as an inspired nazi villain, Brad Pitt's laughable Tennessee accent providing comic relief, and great, highly convincing female performances by Mélanie Laurent and Diane Kruger, rekindling memories of the leading ladies of cinema's golden age.<br/><br/>Furthermore, making the characters speak in their native tongues was a bold - Americans are known for disliking subtitles, especially in a 'talky' movie like this one - , but refreshing move, certainly after having to sit through 'Shakespeare-English' abominations like, for example, Valkyrie.<br/><br/>Combine all of this with an exciting, exceptionally smart storyline and a fantastic, at times anachronistic soundtrack (especially Bowie's 'Cat People' is put to good use), and what you've got is a highly entertaining two-and-a-half hour thrill ride.<br/><br/>So, in short: welcome back, QT!"
"bharatmisr","9","3","20","5 October 2009"," Tarantino's best EVER...
","As the credits of the film started to appear, I sat on my seat, spell-bound. And then, the applaud. The premiere of Inglourious Basterds ended with a standing ovation. A bubble of anticipation that had been building up inside me for the past four months, suddenly eased and snapped.<br/><br/>I had been through a top-class cinematic experience. After watching the film, I am compelled to proclaim that Quentin Tarantino still is the most innovative and entertaining director that Hollywood has to offer. Tarantino plays out his cards with sheer brilliance, and lo, we have a masterpiece on our hands! The ingenuity and passion with which the maestro delivers the film is truly remarkable. This time around, he has nailed it. The film is rock-steady enough to shut out the mouths of even the harshest of the critics. In each and every aspect of film-making, Inglourious... is the best QT movie ever. It has enough potential to be his career-defining film.<br/><br/>The film opens with the young Jewish girl Shoshanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), narrowly evading massacre by German high command Hans Landa (Chris Waltz), who is know as the 'Jew Hunter' for his notorious inflictions on the Jews residing in France. In the meanwhile, a group of American-Jewish soldiers, led by the heavily accented Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), plans to drop into hostile Nazi territory and give them a taste of their own medicine by executing them on a massive scale.<br/><br/>Calling themselves the 'Inglourious Basterds', the group come across a plan to eliminate all the top personnel of the Nazi regime (including Hitler), all of whom would be attending a movie premiere in a Parisian theater. Coincidentally, the theater owner is none other than Shoshanna, who lives in Paris under a false identity, an has her own plans to extricate revenge for the slaughter of her family by the Nazis.<br/><br/>The majority of the German characters are stereotyped as bumbling idiots throughout the film, something I thoroughly enjoyed watching. However, the characterization of the sadistic 'Jew Hunter' Hans Landa has been cleverly carved out by Tarantino, and the execution by the actor Christopher Waltz is even better. This truly is one of the greatest character to come out of Tarantino's exquisitely imaginative mind.<br/><br/>The movie is an assortments of film styles, genres and sub-genres that Quentin pays homage to. Its not just a full-blown, mindless war flick. It has elements of a spaghetti-western too, something which Tarantino now specializes in. It also features a very spell-binding Mexican standoff, which is one of the highlights of the film. Though it is just pure entertainment, the dialog is very rich and deeply drawn out. Its not just a screenplay: its a meticulous and detailed character thesis.<br/><br/>The director comes up with various interesting scenarios and puts the completely made-up characters into those settings. From then on, the characters act on their own, and QT just nudges them by suddenly changing the serene setting to a violent one, or vice-versa. Then we get to see a completely new dimension of the character, and this why Inglourious Basterds works. In short, this guy is a mobile warehouse of wildly imaginative ideas stashed together.<br/><br/>All the actors have done a fairly good job, Waltz being an exception. That is because his portrayal of the ruthless Hans Landa is out of this world. Brad Pitt and Eli Roth as the basterds are equally entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>Though some critics would be jumping to point out that the German characters, as shown in the film, are one-dimensional and are shown in a very misleading light, my answer to them would be that that's how its meant to be. The story is not shown from the Nazi view-point, it simply isn't their story. The story is about the Basterds. Had the characters of 'ze Germans' been detailed, then the story would have been completely different. All the German notoriety and cleverness has been compressed on the character of Hans Landa, who acts as a sort of representative of the whole German regime.<br/><br/>On the whole, this is audacious film-making at its best. Inglourious Basterds is a no-holds barred film which does not repent its on-screen cruelty. It is a gore-fest with a pinch of Black comedy to help keep tension at bay. It hits you smack on your face, and if you are not prepared, you might find yourself gaping at the sudden shift of mood. Watch it without further ado!"

","I was looking forward to see what film-wizard Quentin Tarantino had done after fantastic ""Death Proof"".<br/><br/>At first it was hard to get along with ""Inglorious Basterds"" because it seemed to lack the signature of Tarantino. It was almost like you had come to watch a movie that someone else had directed. There was a long dialog but the humor wasn't there. And bow! Suddenly you were completely hooked. That's the brilliance of Tarantino. He always manages to catch a fly to his web with intriguing things in his movies. I noticed that even though his action is pretty nasty, harsh and cruel he has somewhat soften over the years, in the good way. As always Tarantino's great sense of music is present also in ""Inglorious Basterds"". Other fact that is brilliant with Tarantino that he always stays true to his idols. The original ""Inglorious Basterds"" (1977) is one of his favorite films.<br/><br/>The cast is also very good. At first Brad Pitt, with his southern accent, is annoying but you kind of grow on his character. Melanie Laurent (plays Shosanna Dreyfus) is a new talent. Diane Krueger was also good playing Bridget Von Hammersmark. Usually she is a bit woody. But the man who steals the show is Christoph Waltz who plays wonderfully twisted SS colonel Hans Landa. I can see him even winning an academy award with his performance. You can't help admire his language skills! ""Inglorious Basterds"" isn't the best of Tarantino but it has some of that extra special glamor."
"brownah18","8","2","11","15 October 2009"," Quentin Tarantino, your thinking there is going to be to much blood in this, actually not really.
","Brad Pitt, what more could you want in this movie? In Inglorious Basterds Pitt plays Lt. Aldo Raine who has assembled a group of Jews to disguise themselves at Nazi's and kill them. Your thinking what the heck that is stupid well there is more to it than that. Mélanie Laurent (Shosanna Dreyfus) is under disguise from the Nazi's so she wont be killed and says she owns a theater from her Aunt and Uncle who had passed away. Christoph Waltz (Col. Hans Landa) plays a German who is mostly in charge of finding all the Jews who are still in hiding. Raine along with others attempt to kill as many Germans and make a plan to eliminate Hilter with some new acquaintances. This movie has comedy, some drama, action, and romance all tied into one. One of Tarantino's best i would have to say, it is sure to be one of my favorite's. The movie also stars Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender, Diane Kruger, Daniel Brühl, Til Schweiger, Gedeon Burkhard, B.J. Novak, and the list keeps going of coarse but those are some of the major characters in this movie. Probably not one to bring the kids to, but if you like Tarantino's style this might be a good one to check out. See my Reviews on getthenew.com, thanks ahb."
"Robert_duder","8","2","11","8 October 2009"," Not his best but still a Tarantino twist on the world war genre
","There are a few genres that are very hard to create anything new from and I think the war genre is definitely one of them and yet if anybody could conquer a new spin it would Quentin Tarantino. Inglourious Basterds is not what I thought it was. That's not a bad thing, or a good thing really just an observation. I took the film at face value which appeared to be about a group of misfits put together by a rough talking military man who goes about torturing and putting vengeance on Nazis. Some of that does happen but as it turns out the film is more about the final battle of this group of misfits after they have already made a name for themselves. It also follows another storyline extensively as much as the Inglourious Basterds if not more so. One of the more impressive features of this film is that the Nazi's are consistently on the run in this film. This is like the Return of The Jedi for Jews in World War 2 which I can't say I have ever seen. With the help of the brutal basterds as well as some smart and savvy war victims the Nazi's get a Taratino dose of vengeance, something he does with bloody, gore soaked style.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure about Brad Pitt and his performance. In trailers it almost looked cheesy the way that he tried to pull off the roll but once you see the film in context his role is actually very well done. You know there is so much more to his character although you don't get much of a history making him more mysterious. He is a strong leader and fulfilled the big name quota for the film. He isn't the star of the film but rather one piece in a large cast. French actress Mélanie Laurent is terrific as strong willed, tough female Shosanna Dreyfus. Her character is more the lead in this film than anyone else and she is terrific. Tarantino seems to have a way with strong females and Shosanna is no exception and Laurent is great in the role! The complete and utter showstopper is the award worthy performance of Christoph Waltz as the brutal Col. Hans Landa, a true wolf in sheep's clothing. Waltz gives a breath taking performance sometimes funny in a dark and disturbing manner and always brutal. He should not go unnoticed in any way because he steals the scenes. The supporting cast are all great in their smaller roles especially the cast of the Basterds but they don't get a lot of character development and are simply there to further the story and the lead characters.<br/><br/>So how does Basterds fall short from Tarantino's other films? I usually find with Tarantino that his films jump around like a blood soaked bunny and keep you constantly on your toes and I found the story dragged perhaps more than it needed to in certain areas. The opening scene in the french countryside is the perfect example because the tension and nail biting action is brilliant. When Tarantino turns up the gore it is shocking and bloody as ever but the action scenes are rather few and far between. Still this takes a world war two film to new heights and would love to see Tarantino tackle this again in a sequel or something different altogether. The gritty setting and the fascinating characters right up to Hitler himself (or the double of Hitler.) While many reviewers say that Basterds takes place in an ""alternate universe"" where Hitler is killed, it makes far more sense to look at history and realize Hitler had many, many 'look alikes' to prevent assassination attempts like this one. Regardless this is absolutely worth seeing for Tarantino fans or war genre fans because it is unique and well done. 8/10"

","I went to the cinema with high hopes, this time I went with my father.<br/><br/>I have not seen much of Tarantinos work, what I know, so i thought maybe I will watch this movie without any thoughts about what movies Tarantino usually makes, of course I have seen Kill bill and pulp fiction, anyhow I watched this movie with an open mind in my opinion.<br/><br/>The movie start out quite soft, and the magic starts right here. This film have its deeper moments in the progression into conflict and when you see this progression, you will be caught. Because you know the persons background, without any big flashback moments, you get a sense of hostility and get excited about the situations as they progress into bloodbaths.<br/><br/>This progression is the most rewarding in this film.<br/><br/>I have a personal rule for these long films, and that is that if it was good you won't notice how long it took to watch it.<br/><br/>Blood in blood out is one of my personal favourites and this movie has that same ability of getting you hooked into it."

","Inglorious Basterds is yet another brilliant film by the master himself ... Quentin Tarantino. Christoph Waltz in his role as Colonel Hans Landa was amazing. He deserves every acting award possible for his portrayal in this film. I feel his character completely out-shined that of Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine.<br/><br/>Keep in mind this is a fictional story and should be viewed as such with no expectations of true accounts of WWII. This was the most entertaining, darkly humorous film regarding a war genre story I have ever seen! Though the first moments seemed to start at a slow pace, this is not indicative of the remainder of the movie. As with all Tarantino films, it was the small nuances of the character's behaviors and story itself that separate this movie from others making it a step above all others in this genre. I was pleasantly surprised that Quentin made this more of a mind bender than relying on violence and the brutality of war to keep the audience entertained. I can honestly say this is the most entertaining film I have seen in recent years since The Departed, it's that good! I apologize for the vagueness of this review, but did not want to spoil it for those who have not yet watched it. Bravo Mr. Tarantino for yet another masterpiece I will soon be adding to my collection once released on DVD. I recommend this to all movie fans as I stated before, there is far less violence than one would expect if you have been put off by this in some of his previous movies. Inglorious Basterds is film-making at it's best; a truly thought provoking work of fiction that will have you standing and cheering during the closing credits."
"gavin6942","9","2","11","6 September 2009"," Tarantino Has Finally Made His Masterpiece
","In Nazi-occupied France, the Jews are being exterminated like rats. One escapes... only to later find herself mixed up with a German hero and Joseph Goebbels. At the same time, Lieutenant Aldo Rayne (Brad Pitt) leads a band of Jewish soldiers, not unlike the Dirty Dozen, who roam the European continent and slaughter, torture and disfigure Nazis at every stop. How do these two stories intertwine? Very well, if you ask me.<br/><br/>This film seems to be very controversial, which comes as some surprise to me. On one hand, my friend Matt disliked it with a passion, saying it had too much of Tarantino's silliness imposed. On the other, certain people including myself have declared this Tarantino's masterpiece, outshining ""Pulp Fiction"" and being one of the best films of 2009, if not the best. Strong direction, and easily Tarantino's best writing, moving away from his pop culture references to more serious fare.<br/><br/>The acting is wonderful, setting aside Brad Pitt and Eli Roth (who were great comic relief but not fantastic actors). I didn't even recognize Mike Myers, which is a good thing or I would have been appalled. The lead female Jew (Mélanie Laurent) and the Jew Hunter (Christoph Waltz) were perfectly balanced as strong characters. But the real strength of this film is in the writing, and subtle parallels between different segments of the film.<br/><br/>The opening scene features Colonel Hans Landa the Jew Hunter comparing Nazis to hawks and Jews to rats. For me, this screamed of a comparison to Art Spiegelman's ""Maus"" where Nazis were cats and the Jews mice. And these connections ran through the length of the film, up until the David Bowie song ""Cat People"" played in the third act. While the song did not originally refer to Nazis (I assume), it now fits perfectly with the Spiegelman reference and the inclusion of the line about ""1000 years"", shortly after the movie has a toast to the 1000-year Reich.<br/><br/>This all comes together in the theater scene, when the female lead is looking down from the projectionist booth at 350 Nazis she is about to kill. This is a reversal of the 350 killed from the ""bird's nest"" by her Nazi suitor, Private Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl). So, the tables have turned, and the ""rat"" becomes the ""hawk"". Though, perhaps ironically, the one Nazi she doesn't kill is the very man who massacred her family: he lives to escape to America.<br/><br/>There is another parallel between this film and GW Pabst's ""White Hell"". The film figures prominently on a billboard, but is also used by the British film historian to explain his accent. Later on, another character claims she broke her leg while mountain climbing. For those who haven't seen the Pabst film, this is the very plot: a mountain climber with a broken leg. <br/><br/>Another friend and I have debated over whether Landa recognizes Shoshanna at their meeting in the French restaurant. He claims yes, as Landa orders her milk and then puts his cigarette out in his cream, a reference to her earlier life on a dairy farm. I feel this is meant to cause tension, but there is no reason to believe Landa would recognize a woman he has never seen face to face and goes by a new name.<br/><br/>Tarantino is finally maturing as a director, moving away from his sophomoric days and pop culture fascination. Sure, he still has his moments -- the introduction of Sergeant Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), for example, or using Sam Jackson for a voice-over, or the Bear Jew -- but all in all this looks like a new direction that shows great promise and I expect Oscar nominations to be in the near future."

","In case you weren't already sure, no, if you insist on historical accuracy in all films that deal with actual events, this is not for you. Same if you want an action flick, in spite of the fact that the trailers do sort of make it look like one. What we have here is Tarantino(who's *probably* pretty much completely out of his mind), one of the world's biggest movie buffs, doing his thing, an homage to a sub-genre apparently called ""macaroni combat""(like ""spaghetti Western""), flicks that deal with the cathartic fantasy of the Third Reich's ""finest"" getting a big ol' spoonful of their own medicine shoved directly into their mouths. He yet again takes something he loves, a certain type of cinema, and makes something new and different out of it, without distorting it to the point where it is unclear what the root is. This is pure Quentin... full of unexpected twists, it'll make you laugh, squirm in your seat, enjoy the tunes and plain and simple, get you involved and engaged for two and a half hours where, while you can never know quite where the ride that he designed will take you, you're assured it'll be interesting and unforgettable. There are images that will stay in your mind, ideas you can't help but admire, and lines you'll find yourself quoting for a long time. The dialog... it's absolutely incredible, always well-delivered, and the use of properly spoken German, French and Italian, having subtitles and really doing something with that was fantastic. Story and plot are great and well-told, the non-linear time-line that our writer/director masters is used marvelously as usual. This is epic and amazing. Cinematography and editing are spot-on. The acting... Waltz is beyond reproach. He deserved the Cannes win. Pitt is impeccable. Roth, Fassbender, Schweiger... I could keep going. Groth and Wuttke *demand* mention as well. Myers, I realized what he played a mere second before he left the screen. Every performance is so powerful and genuine. Over the top when they need to be(there are a lot of caricatures herein), underplayed when that's the proper choice. The suspense and intensity this accomplishes is magnificent. I urge you to avoid spoilers as best as you can before watching this, and try to forget or avoid what the advertisements show you. When this goes for it, it is nasty, violent, bloody, gruesome, disturbing, has strong language and there's also brief sexuality. If you don't think you have the stomach for this, well, you may be right. I recommend this to everyone who does think that they do, and is into what QT does with the medium. As long as you don't think that this is a realistic portrayal of World War 2. 10/10"

","Yesterday, right before I went to see this movie, I've read about the ""first 100% failure by Tarantino""... Now when it's over, I totally agree.<br/><br/>There's my few notes: Pitt plays middle-American cowboy and does it in exceeding stupidity. He doesn't fit there anyhow.<br/><br/>Tarantino knows nothing about the Jew hatred to the Nazis. It looks absolutely artificial and in the same time exaggerated. I'm sure that Jews themselves are ashamed of the way they were shown in there.<br/><br/>Two gags isn't enough for such a movie.<br/><br/>Those on screen signs and fonts used were good for Bill and for Bill only.<br/><br/>This movie isn't about anything: not war nor Nazi, not death nor beauty...<br/><br/>I'm sure Tarantino himself knows it better than we do... <br/><br/>Things I liked: First scene is almost good.

","Up until this point, it's worth mentioning that in amongst the select few war movies that aren't steeped in sober reflection and grim in their honest portrayals of The Brutality of War, very few are high profile, widely known or least of all critically esteemed. Cue Quentin Tarantino, lover of the Spaghetti Western, A, B, C, D movies infused with absurdity and exploitative traits and even those sombre, epic war movies so adamant in their seriousness. So what then happens then when you combine a love for cinema in its many forms with an even bigger love for tearing it up there on the big screen yourself? Simple; you get a Tarantino film, and this time around it just happens to be Hitler up there on high court in place of The Bride, Vince Vega or Mr. White. It's honest, but plays loose with facts when something more exciting can occur; entertaining and appealing to a wide range of adult audiences, but reverent to cinema as art-form as well as fun entertainment; and perhaps most importantly is that it feels new and cutting edge yet strangely classically informed at the same time—sound familiar? Well like I said; you get a Tarantino film.<br/><br/>Told in traditional Tarantino narrative which unfolds under many roofs simultaneously and eventually colliding in a stream of pathos and catharsis, Inglourious Basterds is certainly a long one but whether it's an epic of sorts remains to be seen. This, however, doesn't seem to be on the mind of the director. You see, here Quentin trades in the grime and horror of war for something a little more casual. As is also commonplace in his movies, the violence is still on full throttle here yet isn't overly stylised as has been the case previously and maintains a firm grasp on realism throughout. Yet such instances do not dominate the focus of Inglourious Basterds; this feature which clocks in at just over two and a half hours showcases perhaps just ten minutes of graphic violence cumulatively over its entire duration. For some bizarre reason, Tarantino has been—perhaps a little unfairly—ostracised in Hollywood because of an exaggerated image of being someone who loves to glorify violence in his features. Yet as is the case in most of his films, it just happens to be that the 5% of his features which do revel in blood, pain and torture often make a large impression because of the contrast they so solemnly make against the other, more visceral points of his work.<br/><br/>These ostensibly calm and slow moments during the film work on a level a lot more subtle and poignant than the larger, more bombastic sequences. And while there are moments here that echo the long, unwinding dialogue scenes present in Death Proof or Pulp Fiction, like those features there are always cogs turning the background—Tarantino loves to explore characters with these scenes which build and build around the conversations and interchanges between his characters, and here with some instances where his script runs pages and pages with little to no plot development at all, here this directorial staple if you will works to a fine point. Contrasting, but not to the point where the viewer becomes weary or agitated, Inglourious Basterds works at building up moments of violence before they occur. Somewhere in the back of your mind, you expect something bloody to happen—sometimes it happens, most of the time it doesn't, but it's this subtle manipulation that keeps the feature from crumbling under the weight of its many characters, timelines, narratives and least of all plot developments.<br/><br/>All across the board, the performers do a stellar job of nailing that Tarantino vibe; the back and forths are spot on, the characters alive and vibrant and thanks to the many arcs that are given to each of them, very few become fodder for the scenery. Instead, Inglourious Basterds utilises its robust runtime efficiently, building characters, their interpersonal quips, what gets them ticking and of course, resolving the conflicts that inevitably arise when a bunch of misfit Yanks in the German-nicknamed Basterds company go head-hunting in France for any Nazi uniforms they can see. Such instances arise in a manner which can be both disturbing and comical at the same time with both Brad Pitt and Christopher Waltz stealing every scene they're in whether Pitt's laughing in the face of danger or Waltz is slithering across the set to poke his nose into someone else's pie.<br/><br/>It's absurd and gauche by all means, but never succumbs to facile factitiousness or asinine kitsch, and such is where the movie becomes something entirely different from what you may expect. The result is a war movie that doesn't feel like one, and for all the right reasons. Make no mistake, this isn't Saving Private Ryan or Shindler's List—instead it plays more like Cowboys and Nazis, with an effervescent French femme-fatal Jew stuck in the middle playing (unbeknownst to anyone else) catalyst harbinger of doom reminiscent of the vengeful Bride of yesteryear. Through this somewhat surreal mix of world history with the history of film, Tarantino crafts a feature which is just as exciting as it is eloquently designed—informed, uniquely artistic and downright entertaining in every regard, you get the sense once more right from the movie's opening credits that Quentin is only here to show us all exactly why he loves and what he loves about cinema. Inglourious Basterds not only serves as another chapter in that ode, but also reaffirms the director as one of the most inventive, exciting, artistic and intelligent film-makers out there today.<br/><br/>""Y'know This might just be my masterpiece"" reflects a satisfied Lt. Aldo Raine at the movie's closing point and, well yeah; he might just be right.<br/><br/><ul><li>Written by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"
"PoisonKeyblade","10","2","11","23 August 2009"," Film-making Perfection
","A film brimming with creativity, perfect direction, and an incredibly enthralling storyline, one of 2009's best movies? Quentin Tarantino's appropriately named Inglourious Basterds fits quite snugly into this description. It's almost as if Tarantino has risen to such cinematic high standards that to see one of his films in a theater is simply mind-blowing. Basterds features the acting talents of Brad Pitt, Melanie Laurent, Christoph Waltz, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, and many, many others.<br/><br/>In Nazi-occupied France, a young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa. Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller quickly takes an interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theater she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the ""Basterds"", a group of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history. (From IMDb) <br/><br/>Just as I have expressed countless times, I really love films that take on a life of their own and maintain a certain personality through their music. It's a thing where you hear a song and you instantly know it's from that film. And this movie is another perfect example of this phenomena. It's just perfect. The dramatic music is one of things that makes the movie so very magnificent. My favorite song in the movie was probably the usage of David Bowie's ""Cat People (Putting Out the Fire)"", which was just so very perfect in the context of the film.<br/><br/>Pinpointing the movie's finest performance is a much more difficult feat than simply giving kudos to the entire cast. Laurent's soft-spoken Shosanna? Waltz's delightfully evil Hans Landa? Pitt's off-the-wall Aldo Raine? Bruhl's kind but complicated Frederick Zoller? It's most accurately a combination of all the movie's performances. After all, where would it be without each of these core characters? All play a central role in the finale and all are played with care for detail. An ensemble piece has never fit together so perfectly before.<br/><br/>It's actually pretty interesting to hear about some of Tarantino's original casting choices, several of which could not be in the film due to scheduling conflicts. He was on a very strict schedule because he wanted the movie all ready in time for the Cannes film festival. Adam Sandler was attached as Donowitz ""the Bear Jew"" at one point. Had he not been filming Bedtime Stories and Funny People back-to-back, he would appeared in the film, and I don't think it would have been for the better. David Krumholtz was originally cast as Hirschberg (Samm Levine's character), and apparently in the script he had a much bigger role. Even Simon Pegg was set to play the British Hicox, but he was forced to pull out due to scheduling conflicts and abruptly replaced by Michael Fassbender.<br/><br/>The directing is absolutely phenomenal, I might even go so far as to say it's Tarantino's most structurally sound and well-flowing film. It just all comes together so perfectly well with so many different characters and acting talents filled with so many interesting camera angles. It's clearly a work by Tarantino, and it's fantastic to see another film of his because he has become such a modern staple of cinema. After this movie, Tarantino has officially and quite firmly stationed himself as one of this generation's finest directors/writers; Grindhouse, Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs all received phenomenal reviews, as did this one.<br/><br/>And of course, there's the dialogue. Quentin Tarantino is perhaps most known for his long stretches of dialogue in his films that make or break his audience. For once, though, I don't really think there's any arguing: there's not a single line of dialogue in this taut drama that feels unnecessary or out of place. It all seems to flow and greatly add to the characters so that the film's final hour is all the more effective.<br/><br/>I can't say much about the film's final half hour without spoiling too much, but it surely is really strong stuff. It's beautifully crafted, somewhat poetic, and altogether perfect. All of the movie's many elements all come together at once for an absolutely insane climax. Perfectly orchestrated and perfectly paced, the final 30 minutes just might be some of the finest to have ever graced the history of cinema. And that's a big, bold statement.<br/><br/>In simple terms, Inglourious Basterds is a masterpiece of modern film-making, a tour-de-force that leads up to a shocking and powerful final act that throws convention out the window. What more could one ask for?"
"wams_army_of_none","Null","3","21","4 August 2009"," Inspiration For Film
","It was said by Quentin Tarantino in an interview that he got his inspiration for this film from playing the Castle Wolfenstein games, the whole idea of a covert-op Nazi killing mission was intriguing to him for a movie plot. It obviously shows in this film as they go into Nazi occupied France dressed up as civilians in order to infiltrate the Nazi high command, some what similar to the story of Castle Wolfenstein. For those who don't know Castle Wolfenstein is a first person shooter in which you play a American sent in to kill Nazis, made by the same people who made doom. It's an older game but they do have newer version out for some of the consoles."
"hendrikbruwer","10","2","12","1 November 2009"," Finally, Tarantino creates his own masterpiece
","Most of us would consider Pulp Fiction as Tarantino's greatest film, with Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown (his most mature film) coming in second and third. However, considering Tarantino's latest installment of Inglourious Basterds, I am firmly of the opinion that Tarantino believes that it is his best film, and I would have to agree.<br/><br/>Apart from being historically inaccurate, hopelessly immoral, and quite pointless in its substance... Inglourious Basterds is one of the most beautiful things I have ever watched. Distinctly Tarantino, the film moves back and forth between characters and various story lines, and ultimately blends them together in the film's climatic ending. The film's writing is superb, and the dialogue between the characters are torturous and hilariously funny at the same time. The film's wonderful script is supported by a unique cast of French, German and English actors, each fulfilling their roles perfectly, keeping in mind that the film is at best a satirical representation of a WWII scenario. Thus, in taking themselves not too seriously, actors like Brad Pitt and Cristoph Waltz flourish in their opposing roles, recognizing the self-parody and humor their roles require.<br/><br/>Well... I could go on and on. Just a great film. Best I've seen in a long time. Well done master Tarantino."
"Monotreme02","9","2","12","15 October 2009"," Tarantino remains a force to be reckoned with
","Inglourious Basterds still features that unique Tarantino voice that rings out from the dialogue, the non-linear storyline (in this case division into chapters, much like Kill Bill), the virtuoso camera work and, of course, the prominent soundtrack. And yet, it is a film that also incorporates a lot of firsts for the director. First and most prominently, it is Tarantino's first period-set film. Which is surprising, considering how his movies all feature throwbacks to genres and styles associated with past decades. Despite this, Tarantino's scripts are always very heavy on pop culture references, and so it was definitely interesting to see him take his exceedingly modern and contemporary writing style and apply it to a period film. The results are a fantastic and fascinating mix of old and new; there are no direct anachronisms per se, but the characters in the film do speak in a very ""hip"" and modern style that nobody in the 40's would possibly speak in. In fact, the dialogue is great and unique because nobody would speak it today either – it carries that certain Tarantino quality to it that's hard to put a finger on but that provides his greatest and most unique stamp. And yet, despite its utter disconnection from anything remotely realistic, Tarantino does make one conscious decision that lends the film more realism than most others in its genre: he chooses to have foreign characters speak their dialogue in their native language, which results in a vast majority of it spoken in French or German with subtitles. It's actually quite reassuring to see a mostly-subtitled film such as this one still be very successful at the box office, since many pundits (and Hollywood producers for that matter) seem to think that subtitled films don't sell.<br/><br/>It's not just the dialogues that are succulent and well-written in the film, but it's the scenes themselves. The film is actually very uniquely structured, featuring very few scenes overall, but long ones that take their time building up. The scene in the basement pub stands out in particular as a simply brilliantly constructed scene lasting over 20 minutes, starting out slow and establishing the dialogue and characters, and slowly building up to a brilliant climax which I will not go into detail about here, but suffice it to say that it ends in a set-up that Tarantino has used before. Without going into too much detail, the set-up is tied in with the style of the film in general. Despite it being a WWII-set war film, the film is constructed and stylized much more like a Western, from the parallel plot lines building up to a single climax to the soundtrack composed almost entirely by Ennio Morricone arrangements (another potential first for Tarantino – Morricone was originally supposed to provide Tarantino with his first original score, but eventually he ended up using old cues from past scores by the legendary composer). This all serves to create a fascinating, genre-bending script that straddles Nazisploitation, Spaghetti Western and Tarantino's own unique style.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the most fascinating aspect about this film is just how audacious it turns out to be. Without going into too much detail, by the end of the film Tarantino completely changes and disregards history as we know it, to a point that the film itself becomes this big, epic fantasy. Its reception in Israeli was consequently uneven. Many critics derided it for taking an insensitive attitude towards what is probably the most serious and atrocious event in modern history, the Holocaust, and for reducing it to a schlocky Jewish revenge fantasy. Despite the critics, the film has gone on to become one of the most popular and successful films currently playing in Israeli cinemas, and the public reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. I think that stylistically and story-wise, the film isn't quite up there with Pulp Fiction and perhaps not even with Kill Bill, but in terms of Tarantino's ambition and where he ends up taking it, the film becomes one of his most fascinating ventures. It's thrilling, well-made, impeccably shot (by Robert Richardson, a Tarantino veteran and one of the best cinematographers working today), fantastically acted, irresistibly entertaining, absolutely hilarious, and in all it's just a big, epic, audacious and unique piece of entertainment that reminds us, in case we have forgotten, that Tarantino is a force to be reckoned with."

However the whole thing grows on you after a bit and if you can overcome your annoyance with the broad brush strokes, you can enjoy the whole canvas."

","""Inglourious Basterds"" ain't your grandfather's WWII picture. And Quentin Tarantino would most definitely take that as a compliment.<br/><br/>Tarantino has made a career out of making art out of trash, and he does so again with his latest combustible and outrageously entertaining movie. He throws a bunch of B-movie tropes, some anachronistic music and his own version of historical events into a blender to make a WWII movie for a new generation.<br/><br/>Tarantino gives us several narrative threads to follow, and then, in a wink to his love of movies and to the delight of us cinephiles, has them converge in a Parisian movie theater during the debut of an epic Nazi propaganda film, where two separate groups have planned a mass assassination of the Third Reich's major leaders (yes, Hitler included).<br/><br/>One of these groups is the owner of the cinema, a Jew in hiding named Shosanna (Melanie Laurent), and her lover, who plan to use heaps of nitrate film stock to burn the theater down as payback for the murder of her family by the Nazis. The other group consists of the basterds of the film's title, a dirty dozen style tribe of Nazi haters who scalp most of the Nazis they come across and whose leader is a redneck American called the Apache and played by Brad Pitt. Bridging these two narrative threads is the character of Hans Landa, played ferociously by Christoph Waltz in an Award-worthy performance, a detective working for the Reich who was responsible for the murder of Shosanna's family and wants nothing more than to wipe out the basterds.<br/><br/>As usual, Tarantino's love of movies is apparent in every frame, but I think ""Inglourious Basterds,"" to the extent that it's about anything, is about not just the adoration of an art form but also respect for its power. The use of film as propaganda is a recurring motif throughout the movie, and the climax is nothing but one sustained image of the film's power made literal.<br/><br/>People who want to dislike this movie will have no problem doing so, as Tarantino certainly does not make movies that set out to please the masses. Groups will undoubtedly bristle at the disrespect with which Tarantino treats history, and I suppose they're entitled to do so, but I also think they'll be missing the point. Tarantino isn't out to make a historical document; he's out to make a movie and he asks us to have fun with it. I for one found it easy to oblige.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","A Mediocre Period Drama That is Inglourious Basterds , lets not look at the movie as a critics\reviewers point of view and look at it as the audience , you get to know the story from a friend , you check out the trailer on youtube and are all exited for the movie because what you are sold from the trailer is that it is a quentin Tarantino action flick or worse come it is a thriller movie which has brad pitt on it and that fact is highly marketed , when you see the movie you realize that this is just a drama flick with a poor script , now I saw poor script because there is just loads of dialogue for expressing a simple emotion or situation which is not needed to build the tension because it already is built from the premise of the movie , now that is something not expected from an action flick or even to say a thriller , brad pitt is only in the 20% of the movie so howcome is he marketed as the main character , look at the posters , now when any movie is made it will by default fall under a specific category or many categories but this movie only falls into the drama category and there have been better drama movies than this , if you say its about the nazi's and that makes it different then tom cruise's Valkyrie was way better than this , just the crux of the story cannot make the whole movie appealing because it takes a strong script and great direction or shall I say directors vision for what he wants his baby to be where quentin Tarantino fails or it might all be a product of false marketing trying to sell the movie on the base of brad pitt and action where neither of the two are visible , not at all a masterpiece , I wonder what were all the critics thinking when they reviewed the movie giving it good ratings"

"gary-444","8","2","12","19 August 2009"," Bloody Brilliant
","A glorious return to form for maverick Director Qunetin Tarantino. It's not perfect, but firmly puts him back in the A list of hot cinematic property.His vision for the whole film teeters on the preposterous occasionally, but always steps back from the brink. But the real strength of this film is what QT does best, brilliantly envisioned scenes, with superb dialogue. And that is what the film opens with. A scene as good, if not better, than anything he has ever realised before. The war time set piece of an SS Officer visiting a Partisan hiding Jews has been done many times before, with bear traps of cliché waiting to spring at any moment. But in the hands of Tarantino's marvellous, quirky script, strong Direction, and superb acting from Christophe Waltz as SS Colonel Hans Landa, we are treated to a cinematic tour de force.<br/><br/>Indeed Landa is the pivotal figure throughout.Measured, urbane and systematic, the exact opposite of Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine and his renegade crew of Nazi exterminators. A feature of the film is a core of actors giving fine, straight performances whilst the periphery deliver cameo and pastiche.<br/><br/>Although the trademark violence is gruesomely dished out another trademark is in evidence. Tarantino loves women. Check out the vertical ,moving overhead shot of Melanie Laurent as she strides along with her beautiful red dress flaring out as she walks as Jewess Shusanna, or Julie Dreyfus as Goebbels translator / Courtesan with killer clothes and heels, or the gorgeous Diane Kruger as German film star and double agent Bridget Von Hammersmark, the epitome of 40's Movie Star chic. He has this gift for allowing women and scenes to exude sex, without being explicit. Think Thurman / Travolta in the ""dancing competition"" scene in Pulp Fiction, or Jackie Brown as Pam Grier sashays along in her smart, skirted Air Hostess uniform.<br/><br/>At two hours twenty minutes ,the action skips along with surprisingly little violence, but when it does feature, it is gruesome. The action sequences are as effective as those in Paul Verhoeven's, ""Black Book"", THE finest modern WW2 film to date. And although about killing Nazis, the most compelling character is SS officer Landa. Laurent and Kruger make the most of meaty roles which transcend the ""Love interest"" parts so typical of contemporary work.<br/><br/>Faults? The final knife wounding scene and explicit baseball bat murder were too extreme for my tastes. His decision to include caricatures of the German Top Brass, including Hitler,came close to verging on comedy sometimes. This quasi-comic quality was also present in the pompous puffed up English Officers but was also dished out to the ""Inglorious Basterds"" as a whole.<br/><br/>This is no ""Americans as Heroes"" picture. Subversively, Daniel Bruhl as enlisted marksman and Celebrated War Hero Frederick Zoller is given a far more rounded and sympathetic treatment.The judicious use of sub-titles gives proceedings a credibility so absent from,genre stablemate , ""Valkyrie"" with Brad Pitt easily trumping Tom Cruise in choice of roles, and film.<br/><br/>Easily one of the best releases of 2009, and worth seeing for the first 15 minutes alone."

I mean the characters were deep in a different way. I have so much faith for Quentin at storytelling. There's an x-factor in every of his movies, and in Inglourious Basterds the x-factor works very well. That factor reach a different kind of audiences, my kind. It gave a grandiose different perspective. Very intense, an it's a ticking bomb. Every part is a Calm Before The Storm."

","I just watched Inglorious Basterds<br/><br/>I think this movie is fantastic. After two love letters to genre's he loves, Tarantino is back in the real world!! Sort of. And for me, this is his best movie since Pulp Fiction, it could possibly be considered the most audacious World War II movie of all-time<br/><br/>I do not really consider this a war movie though, despite being set in World War II and the main plot, I can certainly see why the end annoyed some moviegoers, but I thing it is compelling from beginning to end.<br/><br/>As for the cast, Brad Pitt is the best he had been in years, whilst Christoph Waltz deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor. He was superb. The first scene, and one at the cinema later on, are simply superb. Michael Fassbender is excellent<br/><br/>That Tarantino is able to successfully pull off some of what he does in this movie is a testimony to his skill at both writing and directing. Yes, he borrows heavily and shamelessly from other movies, but he has never been shy about saying where his inspiration comes from.<br/><br/>The movie has a long running time (2 hours 32 minutes) yet it moves so smoothly and everything comes together so well, that the time passes easily. It's one hell of an enjoyable ride.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds grossed $120 million dollars (against a $70 million dollar budget) at the domestic box office."

","Let's start with 
<ul><li>the good: Tarantino every once in a while is going to get into a zone and produce a superb concept, style and atmosphere and this time he made Inglorious Basterds. The concept was really good here as far as a purely cinematic experience. It's realistic and enticing from that very first scene, arguably one of the best intros ever. The rest of the film is a succession of equally powerful scenes, intense/suspenseful or flat out explosive, sometimes graphic.</li></ul><br/><br/>The characters are lots of fun, almost comic book like for some (well for most, really). The subplots and independent little stories each bring lots of positives and an ongoing dynamism to the film which never lets down pace wise. We're fed a ton of entertainment, but not in a linear or repetitive way (as with all action films), and with each progression there's new suspense or climaxes to be met.<br/><br/>Some characters have remained classics among the young mainstream, as well as certain quotes.<br/><br/>Technically, there's a great melding of all traditional cinematographic genres: romance, comedy, action, historic, drama... and the film is consistent at being just as good when it starts as when it finishes, without any drop in intensity, or quality, all the way til the end.<br/><br/>It's just got that contagious and exciting aura and movie magic that only very few pictures manage to generate. It's special, and if you're intrigued by the start, you'll not want to look away for all 2h33 of it.<br/><br/>-The bad: the film carries a strongly partisan view and hijacks over-the-top tongue in cheek comedy as a pretext to push its own agenda. This isn't a film that you could call politically neutral, at all. Too bad as the rest was so good as contemporary cinema, but the non-cinematic commentary and motive of the film taint it quite badly. Easily could've done without the politicizing, and just focused on the fun and strong cinema it is otherwise."

"nmholland","10","1","4","26 June 2016"," A Fantastic World War II Film With Two Excellent Leads
","Inglourious Basterds is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and stars Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassbender, Eli Roth, Daniel Brühl, and Mélanie Laurent. It tells many stories throughout its World War II French setting, all of them leading into one, spectacular climax. Brad Pitt plays Lieutenant Aldo Raine, an American soldier with a furious hatred of Nazis, who leads a group of men looking for a Nazi officer named Hans Landa, played by Christoph Waltz. This quest leads these characters, as well as much more, on an epic quest for redemption and blood lust.<br/><br/>Two years after his 2007 film, Death Proof, Quentin Tarantino released to the public Inglourious Basterds, a film in which he subliminally claims to be his masterpiece. Is it his best film? That's a matter of opinion, but whether or not it is a great film isn't a matter of question. Inglourious Basterds is the best World War II film since Saving Private Ryan (1998), without a doubt. The excellent script, compelling characters, and amazing direction create a fantastic film, one could call a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The astounding characters are really what push this film to the next level. The two leads, Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine and Christoph Waltz's Hans Landa, set up Inglourious Basterds as a cat and mouse story of sorts. Lt. Aldo Raine chases after Col. Hans Landa, and vice versa. When the film eventually comes to a confrontation between the two, the dialogue is nothing short of genius. Both Pitt and Waltz do superb in their roles, bringing to life two stereotypical, yet seemingly fresh, characters that are more than compelling.<br/><br/>Every other actor in Inglourious Basterds holds their own as well, and aren't outshadowed by the two leads. Michael Fassbender portrays an American soldier under the command of Lt. Aldo Raine, and does so very well. His character is very refreshing, and seems grounded compared to the other, more ""over-the-top"" characters. Diane Kruger plays a famous actress named Bridget von Hammersmark, who is loved by both the Americans and the Germans. Her character is very likable, and grows on the audience very quickly. All other actors, such as Mélanie Laurent and Daniel Brühl, do great as well, just don't hold down as large of roles as the ones mentioned.<br/><br/>The script in this movie in brilliant. Specifically during the interrogation scenes, the suspense that is built up through flawless dialogue is simply incredible. Each character says exactly what their character needs to say exactly when they need to say it. The actors also aid the tension through their incredible acting abilities. In fact, the most interesting scenes in this film are the ones in which the characters just sit down and talk. Just through the dialogue, Quentin Tarantino, who also wrote the script, can get an entire audience on the edge of their seats, and that's a rare thing for a writer to be able to do.<br/><br/>The direction, by Tarantino, is, as always, great. There's one specific shot in which the camera follows a character as she walks through a few different rooms, all while the camera is tracking from a ceiling view. This shot goes on for more than a few seconds, and my jaw dropped while watching it. This specific shot, and many more like it, add so much to the already magnificent film that Inglourious Basterds is.<br/><br/>Overall, Inglourious Basterds is a fantastic film. I wouldn't necessarily label it as a ""masterpiece,"" but it still is a great movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who can handle the violence (which isn't too much, should I add), and some bad language."

"angelanicole-68272","1","1","4","18 February 2016"," Disappointing at best
","I do not consider myself a fan of Quentin Tarantino, namely because I find the constant overworked theme of revenge pointless and classless, not to mention the overkill of gore mundane. But I do tend to watch his movies because, I guess, the subject matter of them always appears to be interesting and possibly different, almost as if I'm trying to like him as hard as I can.<br/><br/>I loved Django, and it got me thinking I could like another. I turned to this movie and I feel compelled to record my confused reaction. <br/><br/>Character depth and development is almost totally nonexistent in this film. The viewer is left feeling inclined to side with the basterds only because of the overwhelming bias the film shoves at you. You kind of feel like you're not sure, though. The characters, even (especially?) the main ones do things for seemingly no reason (Why did Hans violently attack Bridget at the cinema but spare the fleeing Jew at the beginning of the movie, or imply that he knew who Soshanna was when they saw one another again but apparently didn't?) or they don't do things at all. I challenge anyone to name one character with depth. Reading other reviews, it seems most pick Hans, but I'd have to disagree. Him wittingly questioning people for an unnecessary amount of time is the basic extent of his role. The closest thing we have is Soshanna, because we feel sympathy for her as we saw her family murdered during the first scene. Aside from that, not one character holds any significance. Not Soshanna's lover, not Raine, not Hans, not Bridget. As a fan of Brad Pitt, I really wanted to like his character and cheer him on but I again found myself confused. He was so stiff and anticlimactic as a leader. I liked the line about how it isn't okay with him that Nazis get to take their uniform off at the end of the day so he has to permanently mark them as evil, but that's probably the only positive thing I can say in regards to character or meaning. I was very offput when suddenly Bridget became a main character because I and the rest of the audience didn't know her, was wondering where the hell she came from, and felt like I was being flung around the room with each unfolding event.<br/><br/>The plot needed a basis. Nobody's motivation was ever clear, no part of the story really made any sense. Unnecessary emphasis and focus was put on details that ended up amounting to nothing (the Jew bear, a black man working as the projectionist, 100 scalps of Nazis we never heard about again, why the hell Bridget was involved and why she was risking her life to help the anti-Nazi group??) Hitler and most of Germany's government and soldiers going out for a movie at some no name cinema about a German man shooting 300 people? These are just examples but there are countless more....<br/><br/>I can't help but feel like this movie would be hugely insulting to a person who served in this war, to history itself, to anyone who stands for a cause. <br/><br/>This only goes to prove that QT isn't all he's hyped up to be at all. Django is still the only likable movie under his belt, especially if you think about the Kill Bill series (shudders.)"
"robsta23","10","1","4","11 December 2015"," Favorite Movie Which I Saw in the Theater the First Time
","I remember that this was my second Tarantino film. A few days before, I watched Reservoir Dogs with my brother, introducing me to Tarantino movies, and I was ecstatic that my Dad agreed to take me to Inglourious Basterds since the trailers made it look like a good revenge film. I was surprised that the film went beyond this notion and was simply fantastic overall, leaving me smiling as I left the theater.<br/><br/>Let me just say, the early trailers for this film are deceiving. They make it appear that the premise is simply Brad Pitt and his men killing Nazis in a brutal manner throughout. This is definitely not the case, and actually touches on subjects I never would have imagined. Tarantino shows his knowledge for German cinema throughout as the main character of the B plot - Shoshanna - comes to own a cinema, and the Nazis are dealing with where they should hold the premiere for the new film by Joseph Goebbels - Nation's Pride.<br/><br/>The villain, played by Christoph Waltz, is such an amazing character to watch. At certain points, he exhibits intellect and detective skills near Sherlock Holmes levels, and at other times he makes us laugh with how out of touch he is with certain customs. The first twenty minutes of the film is almost fully dedicated to this Hans Landa, and it proves to be among the best sequences Tarantino has ever written.<br/><br/>I fully believe this film had a better screenplay than Django Unchained, but to me, it makes sense that the academy went with The Hurt Locker for best original screenplay. It makes sense not because The Hurt Locker fully deserved it, but because The Hurt Locker was a film that this country needed in 2009 to shape our perspective on the war being fought over seas.<br/><br/>While Inglourious Basterds is not an accurate depiction of World War II or one of the most important World War II films, it is certainly one of the most fun to watch. It is tense, funny, crowd-pleasing, and at the same time it is a very smart movie with well-developed characters, an intricate plot, meta characteristics, and above all, extremely well-written. This now holds the spot of my 2nd favorite film by Quentin Tarantino, behind Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>4.0/4.0"

It is not that the history is simply bad- it is deplorable, but there is more. The acting is deplorable. The situations are improbable- no, cancel that, impossible.

","Despite the name for this review expecting the contrary, this is a fair explanation regarding the quality of Q's twisted look on WWII. Like all of his films in the past, he has a great script paying homage to the films that inspired him to move into Hollywood instead of becoming a serial killer (Thank the good Lord above). He also help bring performances from people who never would've been noticed otherwise (Christoph Waltz is the main benefactor). Not to mention he had enough action to not only keep the people who enjoy the Michael Bay IQ droppers entertained, but he had a screenplay that keep you on the edge of their seats. Something that is very simple yet very rare in film. Not to mention it can only be done by the best ( I don't count Spielberg because he over does these things one way or another.) Q not only keeps you entertained with simple American pleasures (booms and bangs) he entertains you mentally with a screenplay. Q did it again and it's a shame because this film, like Pulp Fiction, got caught in a weird Oscar year and if it came out either the year or two after it originally did, it not only would've swept all the categories, it wouldn't have been close."

The ending where Hitler and Goebbels are machine-gunned by the Bastards may not be historically accurate but this is obvious and it is an awesome scene of an alternate history. It may seem a villain has got away at the end but the Bastards are still able to inflict punishment on him, though he survives.

"djudge47","8","1","4","23 April 2012"," Inglorious Basterds Short Review
","Quentin Tarantino's release of Inglorious Basterds has been hailed as his best movie since Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The fantasy WWII film is one in which Tarantino spent nearly 10 years writing, in between producing, screen writing and acting. The theme of the movie is to eliminate the German High command. The setting of the movie takes place in Nazis occupied France during WWII. Chapter 1 The story begins with Perrier Lapadite (Denis Menochet), a French dairy farmer chopping wood, when his daughter spots the Nazi Schutzstaffel (SS) approaching. He is suspected of harboring Jews in his home. When the car stops there are four Germans, one being Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) also known as the ""Jew Hunter"". After integrating Perrier for about 10 minutes, Landa knowing that he is hiding Jews in his floorboard give him an ultimatum: point out where the Jews are hidden and no harm will ever come to his family. Perrier points out were they are hiding and Landa signals for his men to come in and they begin shooting the floor, killing all but one, Shosanna (Melanie Laurent), who manages to escape. Landa has her in his gun site as she runs across the open range, but for some reason elects to put his pistol back in his holster. Chapter 2 Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) leads a squad of eight Jewish-American G.I.s, into occupied France with on simple mission: find Nazi soldiers, kill Nazi soldiers, and then scalp Nazi soldiers, an exploit that spreads terror throughout the ranks of the Nazi army each time the brutalized, mutilated bodies of their comrades are discovered. However the Basterds are not just guerrillas, but more of terrorist. Part of their mission is to help an allied group wipe out the higher command of the Nazi army. Many would believe this movie is about the Basterds, but it is much more than that. In fact the bastards play a limited role in the movie. Lt. Aldo Raine is cast in only a little more than half of the scenes. Further in the movie, we pick up Shosanna as a Cinema theater owner in Paris, who is befriended by a Nazi officer, Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) who has an interest in Cinema productions and in Shosanna. Zoller, a Nazi hero and a movie star in the movie ""Nation Pride"", a movie about his heroics in battle, arranges for the premier of the movie to be shown in Shosannas' cinema. Shosanna, seeking justice and revenge on the Germans who killed her family, plots to burn down the theater, killing all of the high command officers that attend. Lt. Raines finds out that Adolph Hitler will be attending the premier and a plot is developed to kill Hitler and his high command, thus ending the war. The climax of the movie is the death of all the German in the theater and the death of Shosanna seeking her revenge."

"CagedinSanity","8","1","4","21 March 2012"," Not bad, had some pointless filler-time.
","Say what you want about Tarantino, but he's one of the only Director's where I can tell, without knowing firsthand, that he directed a certain movie. For better or for worse, he has style.<br/><br/>For the better, the movie fascinated me. There's very little to say to compliment than the usual stock of ""great"" things. Acting was fine. Brad Pitt was a bit of an exaggerated caricature, but it served well enough.<br/><br/>I will mention Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa, as he bears mentioning. He was a FASCINATING character. He felt like a genuine threat in every scene that he was in, and it was very unique to see a skilled detective play in a Villainous role, as ""Detectives"" are usually reserved for heroes. He definitely stole every scene he was in and like I mentioned before, every line of dialog seemed relevant because he was investigating everyone he came across. I loved watching every scene he was in.<br/><br/>Now, my 8 out of 10 may come as to a shock as I go into more detail about what I didn't like about the movie. But as a rule of thumb, anything I don't mentioned I consider fine. Make no mistake, it IS a fine movie. As always, everyone has more to say about the bad parts.<br/><br/>First the minor complaint. I expected more Nazi killing. We get all of two good, solid, Nazi-bashing scenes and the rest are quick 4-second snippets for comedic effect. Which kind of leads into my major complaint...<br/><br/>The ""for worse"" part of Tarantino's style is there's a whole load of talking. A lot of filler time. I had this same exact issue with his two Grindhouse movies. Specifically ""Death Proof"" with the second set of potential girl victims just... talking. I fast forwarded for a few seconds and they were talking about nothing. I did this a second time, and nothing. I did it a third time to where the next scene began, re- winded a little bit, and started again, and missed NOTHING.<br/><br/>*Spoilers Ahead*<br/><br/>It was the same problem here. Every ""chapter"" only has a few minutes of relevant conversation, the rest padded pointlessly. Specifically, the bar-basement scene where three of the Basterds and the actress were plotting, and the REAL German officer walks in and hounds them. While it was fascinating in itself, they could have removed perhaps the short ""game"" they played, and a few minutes of pointless banter. To it's credit, it was very intense. But they could have done it better by doing the same thing they did in the beginning with Col. Hans Landa, whose every single line of dialog felt relevant.<br/><br/>I mean, Tarantino did this same thing in Reservoir Dogs, near the beginning. THAT conversation, too, was fairly relevant throughout. Every now and then he just misses that particular charm.<br/><br/>That's all I didn't like. I enjoyed the movie all the same, even though you could cut thirty minutes out of it without harming the film, I would think."
"tutikushi","3","1","4","21 December 2011"," good movie.
","Hmm... Well, this movies gives different feelings to different sort of people. None of the people I asked said the same thing about it. However, in my opinion Tarantino wouldn't just make this film out of nothing. I believe he went over the fact files of the WW2 and found out that Jews weren't particularly busy fighting against Nazis. Thus he decided to imagine the situation where the Jews are brave enough to make this sort of fighting group and not only that but to also have a brave Jewish woman in the film who eventually ends up killing Hitler. <br/><br/>This obviously is a very high pathetic situation, but it is fun to watch. Besides, it is perfectly aimed at Jewish audience who'd love to be as brave, as 'cool' as coldblooded as the inglorious bastards are. <br/><br/>It also involves many different places and languages which makes every big nation in Europe (Except for Spanish) feel important. <br/><br/>The negatives I can say about the film aren't a lot. I could still mention the Hitler character who is rather weak. He is also very nervous all the time and is not at all like the real Hitler shown to us by various historic sources. It is also one of the worst performances by Brad Pitt who did not sound anything like Italian in one of the punchlines of the movie. <br/><br/>Overall it is a good movie and I'd recommend it to everyone over 15 to watch it. I believe, however, that unless you are a Jew, you wouldn't watch it more than once."
"Wuchakk","8","1","4","2 December 2011"," Refreshingly different alternative WW2 drama/adventure
","RELEASED IN 2009 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Inglourious Basterds"" takes place during the German occupation of France in WW2 and revolves around a ruthless ""Jew Hunter"" Nazi (Christoph Waltz), a beautiful young theater owner dripping with vengeance, a German war hero who pesters her and a brutal team of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine.<br/><br/>This was my first taste of the popular director's eccentric repertoire, although I've since seen all of his movies except ""Death Proof"" (2007). The first time I tried to watch ""Basterds"" I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue-driven opening sequence is great but the film seemed to bog down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation and the accompanying interminable dialogue (mostly in subtitles). I just wasn't ready for this because I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WW2 film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of generally subtitled dialogue.<br/><br/>I eventually gave it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn't some typical war flick. Strangely, the ""interminable dialogue"" pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn't hard to follow. The drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.<br/><br/>There ARE elements that bring to mind ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967), including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn't kick-in until the final act, but ""Basterds"" is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.<br/><br/>All effective films have quality characters and ""Basterds"" has several: The stunning Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna, the cinema proprietor who quietly seethes with retribution; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Hans Landa, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain who mercilessly hunts down Jews; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but no-nonsense leader of the brutal Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy; and Daniel Brühl as a genial German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna.<br/><br/>Like Tarantino's other great movies (""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Django Unchained"" and ""Jackie Brown""), ""Basterds"" pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the idiotic ""blockbuster"" syndrome that plagues modern cinema with its predictability and overKILL action & CGI, etc. Most movies seem like they're in a rush and shy away from extended dialogues because they fear losing the viewer's limited attention whereas Tarantino makes them a highlight because it's an area where he excels. Instead of pedestrian verbiage that merely advances the plot or conveys the obvious, his interchanges are rich with amusement and mindfood.<br/><br/>THE FILM RUNS 153 minutes and was shot in France and Germany.<br/><br/>GRADE: A-"

","A Glorious flick - from the editing, to the sound, to the stage production, to the acting, to the costumes to everything else, this film is simply marvellous. It's got heaps more tension than any other suspense driven thriller on the market and it also entails some brilliant dark comedy in the form of Christopher Waltz' character Col. Hans Lander and also the brilliant Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine. How Tarrintino comes up with this stuff is just beyond my comprehension completely as his writing (like all of his other films), is ingenious and the way he then directs that writing is simply incredible. <br/><br/>I have given this film 8/10 (4*) and not 10/10 (5*) as I wanted a better ending than the one we got. However, in saying that, the ending is good and is also in keeping with the rest of the film i.e it all ties in.<br/><br/>All in all, like I said before, this film is marvellous - it's funny, brutal, charming and malicious, whilst at the same time it produces some rather poignant and beautifully shot sequences that can only be described as nothing less than breathtaking and will, in no doubt, bring a tear to the eye of those inclined to be moved by vivid and enigmatic film making at its very best. <br/><br/>So, to conclude, watch this film - it's Tarrintino's best effort since Pulp Fiction and that's saying a lot."

","...if only for Christoph ""You never heard of me before this film"" Waltz's highly engaging performance as the lead antagonist. ""Inglorious Basterds"" is nowhere near Tarantino's best film, but it's not his worst (I nominate his contribution to ""Four Rooms"" for that award, although I've never seen the reportedly awful ""My Best Friend's Birthday""), and say what you will, much of it is pure pulp cinema entertainment. Only Tarantino could deliver a WWII Jewish revenge fantasy patterned after spaghetti Westerns that taps into 21st century sublimated fears and self-righteousness like a drill.<br/><br/>""Inglorious Basterds"" makes itself clear from the start, ""Once upon a time...,"" and then wallows in its reference-strewn, cartoonish, fairy tale universe like a junkyard dog rolling in the dirt. The dialogue is pure Tarantino throughout, with almost all the prime monologues going to Waltz's charming sociopath. What's most striking about all this is that the bulk of the conversations are in anything but English, thus forcing the reading of subtitles, which is typically anathema to American audiences. That ""Inglorious Basterds"" still managed to pack $120+ mil worth of butts into seats is testament to Tarantino's drawing power and storytelling abilities.<br/><br/>All of Tarantino's trademarks are in evidence, most especially his ability to ratchet up the tension in a scene and then release it in a paroxysm of brutal violence. This is not a film for the faint-of-heart (as if the title isn't already a dead giveaway); there are shootings, stabbings, beatings, scalpings, and chokings galore. Tarantino's predominantly young audience was surely well-sated, given the film's inordinately high rating here on the IMDb. Older viewers were obviously not quite so impressed with the Grand Guignol.<br/><br/>The cast is mostly superb, with the possible exceptions of the stunt-cast Eli ""Hostel"" Roth (who really has little to do anyway), the equally (and inexplicably) stunt-cast Mike ""Austin Powers"" Myers, and the guy playing Hitler, whose ridiculous antics I pin squarely on Tarantino's direction. The DP work by Oliver Stone stalwart Robert ""Natural Born Killers"" Richardson is assuredly top rank, the editing by Tarantino regular, Sally ""did 'em all"" Menke, equally so, and all the production elements are seamlessly satisfying, as expected.<br/><br/>After one big screen viewing and a pair of DVD watchings, I doubt I'll be returning to ""Inglorious Basterds"" any time soon. It's fine film entertainment, yes, so long as one bears in mind its utter lack of grounding in reality, but in the final analysis it has little to recommend it beyond cinematic flourishes, brute catharsis, and Waltz' deliciously amoral villain. Ultimately, it's pretty self-indulgent, adolescent nonsense that fails to illuminate the human condition (not that Tarantino's known for that anyway), and is unlikely to be regarded as anything more than that in the future."

If you can't win the war, just make a movie in which you won. So much easier! This piece is of the same genre. The actual history of Americans and American Jews WWII is somewhat spotty. The Americans turned away the MS St Louis in 1939, sending its cargo of desperate Jewish refugees back on their voyage of the damned, to be returned to Nazi dominated Germany.The Americans inexplicably failed to bomb the rail line to Auschwitz when they had complete control of the skies. When the Jews of Warsaw finally mounted a spirited resistance, the Americans and Brits refused to come to their aid. As for the Jews, they are still embarrassed by how docile they were in the face of Nazi aggression. The were led like sheep to the slaughter, and at the final execution they were executed by their own, Jewish capos who turned traitor to live a few more weeks. Much to be ashamed of, on both sides.<br/><br/>Far better to make a movie in which we all behaved differently. In this one heroic Jewish commandos operate with impunity behind German lines, terrorizing the Wehmacht with American Indian tactics, then finally assassinating the entire German high command in a stroke of bold genius. If only that had happened. In fact the only serious attempt on Hitler's life came at the hands of Col von Stauffenburg, a German officer. Had he had the courage of a modern Arab suicide bomber, to stay with his bomb until it detonated, the war would have come to a much earlier and less bloody conclusion. <br/><br/>There is a scene in the movie where the German high command is watching a propaganda movie and enjoying it thoroughly. The movie spoofs them, because it is not a very good movie. How many of the audience realized, that we were doing the same thing?<br/><br/>The danger of this kind of movie, is that young viewers, unfamiliar with history, might mistake this fantasy for reality. Would that it were so, kids. Real history is a lot more messy."

He made excellent movies in the 90's, masterpieces like Reservoir Dogs or Jackie Brown and with Pulp Fiction leading in the way. But that is over now. Death Proof wasn't already as good as his older films, and the first twenty minutes, the scene that plays in the farmers shack, is the best thing throughout the whole movie.

Brad Pitt is very good as Aldo ""The Apache"" Raine. I thought he'd be in it a lot more than he was considering he's the lead but Pitt is still effective in the role. The same can go for the rest of the cast including Melanie Laurent, Christoph Waltz, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassenbender, and Michael Myers in a brief extended appearance. The brutal violence is well executed and there were some funny moments. The biggest flaw I thought this film had was a lack of character development because besides Pitt, Laurent, and Waltz no one else is in it for all that much. Some make cameos while others show up for a few extended appearances. For the most part however all the actors are believable as their characters. I actually preferred Kill Bill Volume 2, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs over this one but it isn't that bad. I just thought it could've been better. The pacing was slow in some areas which made the 153 minutes drag from time to time. If you're a big fan of Tarantino's you may enjoy it more than I did.

","Entering this film I was expecting a gore-fest similar to that of Kill Bill. Happily, my expectations weren't fulfilled this time. I thought the film decent overall with some good sections of witty dialogue and prose. There were some funny instances with the Basterd team as well which I enjoyed watching but I still found that the last third of the film dragged on and wasn't as good as the first two-thirds. The ending to me was also a letdown since there was so much build up for it and then in a minor instant it was all over.<br/><br/>I was surprised at how few scenes Brad Pitt actually had - since he was billed as the starring actor. The actor whom played the German Colonel I thought did a fantastic job overall and would be happy in seeing him in more films.<br/><br/>Perhaps multiple watchings of this film would be required to get a better appreciation but for now I would only cautiously recommend the film to most others."
"romantic_hitchcockian","7","1","4","29 December 2009"," It's good..with brilliant moments...but something's off
","Been a fan of Tarantino for half of my life. Reservoir Dogs thrilled me, Pulp Fiction made my jaw drop, Jackie Brown was not as good but still amazing compare to other Hollywood 'movies'. Kill Bill 1/2..well..it may be self-indulgent but it was stylish and fun. So, what about Inglourious Basterds? Lets just say the first scene itself is worth the movie ticket or even the price of your Blu-ray CD. As I watch the whole film, which it claims to be 153 minutes, it feels as if the whole 153 minute flew by. Christoph Waltz was charismatic and unique in his evil way. Melanie Laurent definitely carry her character well(which has the most depth) and the supporting cast was great. The visual/cineto was filled with colours pleasing to the eye(even in the jungle scenes). The writing was unpredictable yet entertaining enough to add to Tarantino's filmography.<br/><br/>So why only 7? Is there lack of action/violence(Not that it's necessary)? No. Is there lack of the typical yet welcoming Tarantino-esquire dialogue? No. So, why 7? First of all are the characters. When the movie introduce to its characters, I began to fear that it's a flashback to Ocean's Twelve/Spiderman 3. But the characters are interesting and well developed throughout the movie. Not all. I had a problem with most of the characters - The Basterds - Brad Pitt(Aldo Raine) and Co. While they are supposed to be the good guys/heroes in this movie where we root for them, they don't seem to be human. Okay let's compare, Reservoir Dog's most evil character Mr Blonde(Michael Madsen) is portrayed as a psychopath throughout the movie. Yet, there are scenes where we see the 'human' sides of him. When he is jerking around with Nice Guy Eddie or when he tells us his opinion about the hostages not following instructions. Those scenes make Mr Blonde a more believable/true character.<br/><br/>Let's go to Pulp Fiction, Jules Winfield(Samuel L Jackson). He's a badass throughout the movie killing people but scenes such as 'divine intervention' and his respect to Winston Wolfe(Harvey Keitel) tells us he can be a hit-man and yet we can relate to him.<br/><br/>I won't go to Jackie Brown not because I can't but I'm reaching the maximum quota of 1000 words for a review.<br/><br/>In Inglourious Basterds, Brad Pitt and Co are given the most unique and entertaining characters only in terms of their personality. Scalping heads and devil may care ambush is fun for the audience. But we do not know what's inside the head of Aldo Raine(Brad Pitt) except for killing as many Nazis as possible and scalping their heads.Even his past, he is from Tennessee, a descendant of the native Americans, hence scalping,and when he talks, he looks like reminiscent of Marlon Brando. That pretty much it. And lets just say his recruits(Eli Roth and Co) has a more vague character than he is.<br/><br/>Let's just hope that Tarantino's next project will be a fun, exciting, thrilling, clever...oh...and filled with well defined characters."

","I regret to say this but this is the most overrated movie of 2009. Such a waste of talent, money and time. I am pretty sure a lot of the people vote here did not even watch the movie. I have no doubt about the talent of Quentin Tarantino as a director and the directing of the movie was great, but as a writer, he does not have the same qualifications I am afraid and this was his weakest movie. Brad Pitt is normally a great actor but the role he was playing in this movie did not demand any talent. Christoph Waltz, on the other hand had a great performance. Now, let me share my humble opinion on the story. The movie is so long and it is full of never ending conversations. From the trailer, it looks like a war movie but it is not. Very little action and so much dialogs. I am not against this kind of movie making but there was just nothing special. I don't know why so many people find the story so genius. I didn't see anything that was not done before. Besides, even the idea of creating a special brigade to kill your enemies violently is as cruel as burning them in concentration camps and I found making a movie on such an issue quite disrespectful to the memories of those we lost during the war."

Although everyone should be pretty familiar with what was happening in WWII, I still thought the Jews did not receive a thorough enough justification for their savagely violent retributions (lord knows that time period could have provided plenty). <br/><br/>Action scenes were excellent.

Pitt, on the other hand, portrays a perfect blend of Semi-Dumb Southerner stereotype, hilariously awkward, and quietly menacing. The opening scene is one of the best opening scenes of all time, and the standoff in the basement bar is pure cinematic gold.

","I am big fan of Tarantino's early work. Since his movies became easier and more friendly to the wide audience, they also became way watered down for me. Much like Django, I enjoyed Inglourious Basterds but the movie lacks the chills, the overly-violent bits and the dark-meets- blood-meets-sarcasm aspect of the good Tarantino movies. The plot twists are there but instead of serving the movie, they mostly ruin it. Too bad, considering the great and promising start, but it just goes downwards after the first 30-40 minutes. Trying to think of a bright spot, I'd probably say Brad Pitt's character and acting. Inglourious Basterds could be get an 8 for me, but the drop-off is so steep it ends up closer to 6 than 7."
"socialnetworkman","10","1","5","1 June 2016"," The Pinnacle of Tarantino's Career
","Personally one of my most revered Tarantino movies, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is another showcase of Quentin's ambitions and devotion to cinema. Similar to Pulp Fiction, Basterds is told in a way much like a novel. It is essentially Tarantino's fictitious alternative ending to WWII, told in two different P.O.V's who are both, unknowingly, working towards the same goal, and ultimately doing it in the same fashion-- ""killing all the eggs in one basket"" by burning a cinema down which is home to the gathering of Hitler's Third Reich for a propaganda film ""Nation's Pride"". Knowing that Tarantino spent a little over a decade writing the script, from scene one you feel the rigorousness and preciseness in the script with every line of dialogue, every plot development, every character action, and so on. ""Inglourious Basterds"" blends in with Tarantino's filmography--it's got all the Tarantino tropes--yet sticks out from all the others with it's superior artistic value."
"SquigglyCrunch","9","1","5","8 February 2016"," Historically Inaccurate, but Who Cares? That's Obviously the Intention, and it Works Super Well
","I had some expectations for this movie, but not a whole lot. Despite it's good ratings, it's metascore was lower than that of most of Tarantino's movies and I'd been told that the movie kind of sucked anyways. Nevertheless, I still was looking forward to it. I'd say that it was quite well done in the end. <br/><br/>The plot of Inglourious Basterds is a simple one for that of a World War II movie: a group of people want to kill Hitler and end the war. There a large focus on cinema however, which I think was kind of interesting. And there were two plots to kill Hitler going at once, which was cool to see too. I was surprised though, because the movie is super historically inaccurate. But it's obvious that that was supposed to be the case, so it's not important to me. <br/><br/>The characters are pretty good. For most of them you care enough to feel tension when bad things happen/have the potential to happen, and you know that you would care if any of them died. And despite how brutal some of them are, they can be pretty funny too. One thing that I did like was that both of the main characters received a relatively equal amount of screen time, so while I still think it's obvious who the main character is, it's still nice that no plot or character is made out to be more important than the other. <br/><br/>The acting is quite good too. Most of the actors portray their characters super well and it makes for some incredibly tense and funny situations. If the characters had been played by anyone else I think that the movie would have been much less effective. Christoph Waltz was especially good. He was easily the most effective character in the entire movie. Eli Roth and Brad Pitt are very good as well, and of course MÃ©lanie Laurent was great. <br/><br/>Overall Inglourious Basterds is very good. The plots are great, the characters are good, and the acting is great. There wasn't really anything that I'd say was wrong about this movie, it's just an 8/10 movie. In the end I'd certainly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an awesome, funny, violent war movie, so long as you don't worry about intentional historical inaccuracies."

","I watched 'Inglorious Basterds' on T.V and quickly discovered it is a very segmented movie hastily put together with tasteless, sick stories with the theme of hatred written all over them. The polarized 'hate' is compounded with extreme violence cries out of Brad Pitt's severe 'hatred' of the Nazi's because of a world war two genocide of the Jewish people. Brad Pitts message of his hatred of the Nazi's in 'Inglorious Basterds is emphasized through his P.T.S.D or post traumatic stress disorder and it is very personal and extremely violent and seventy years late, long after 1945. 2010 or 2014, we are now in an era when most young people prefer to play Ubisoft PC games on X Box and handle their Samsung mobile phones or tablets instead of watching hate films. The timeliness of Brad Pitt's very segmented P.T.S.D 'I hate the Nazis' film 'Inglorious Basterds seems out of touch with movie audiences but it is from any angle a very sick, tasteless and reckless perspective of history devoid of any value."

Overlong (aren't they all) with noxious characters, episodes both unbelievable and boring, right from the start. Tarantino tries without success to summon the spirit of Harold Pinter in his supposedly tense and unnerving conversation scenes, but it ain't happening (The Happening, now there's a film to bracket I.G. with in your cinematic hierarchy). Tarantino hasn't the command of language and his screen writing peak (Pulp Fiction) now a distant memory blighted by later excesses of trashy violence and an all pervasive feeling of emptiness devoid of the gangster cool that once was his forte. <br/><br/>Repugnant and beneath the remains of Quentin's legendary A & B-movie influences.

Well guess what. This film is full of morals. The Basterds take on the immoral choice to retaliate against the Tyranny Of The Third Reich, by reacting in the same ways the Nazis tortured and systematically killed Jews. <br/><br/>People say that what the film shows is people actually being worse than Nazis. Well they're wrong. We all ways read about brave survivors of Concentration Camps, and how their experiences haven't shaken their belief, nor made them vengeful. But we never read about the darker survivors. Well this film shows them. The people that wanted to get back at the Nazis at any cost. That is what this film is about. A lot of stupid, brutish Americans going to France to just roam around on a killing spree, killing absolutely every German whether it's logical or morally right to. It's about stone cold vengeance.

","I don't think this can be properly appreciated without knowing how it ends. Personally, I left the theater disappointed after my first viewing - like I'd been the butt of an enormous joke, with QuentinTarantino taking full advantage of the kind of notoriety and clout he'd accumulated over the years to cash in on an intentional stink bomb. Now, a few years removed from the experience, I've given it another shot and left with an entirely different look on my face. It's a magnificent film, dedicated to building up one impossible situation after the next; two full hours dedicated to stacking the dynamite. The implication, of course, is that he'll find a way to write himself out of it - and I suppose he does, just not in a way that anyone could have expected. It's an impervious blend of Tarantino's notoriously sharp-witted dialog, his ADD-influenced lack of focus on any particular storyline for more than twenty minutes, and a deep yearning to lead his audience into a false sense of security before dumping cold water over their heads. Brad Pitt has the time of his life as the braggish, stereotypical war movie lead with an awful accent, but Christoph Waltz steals the show as a giddy turncoat Nazi sleuth. Basterds is a stroke of brilliance, weaving three distinctly different movies into one spectacular cinematic quilt. Where my initial impressions of the ""did they just do that"" climax were of shock and disdain, time and honest thought have transformed it into one of my favorite scenes. Ballsy, bright and bombastic, it deserves a spot alongside the director's classics."

After the double whammy of disappointments, Kill Bill Vol.2 and Death Proof, the director returns with this blistering, uber-violent, very funny 'masterpiece (his words!) The cast handle the script brilliantly with standouts being Pitt and Waltz. Pitt's accent and jutting jaw are hilariously OTT and Waltz's 'Jew Hunter' is another deliciously watch-able villainous and charismatic bastard that makes the audience wait in suspense for the bouts of (often) vicious violence.<br/><br/>Tarantino unfolds the story with trademark chapter headings and makes it plain from the opening title that this is a fairytale fantasy (though set in a very real, very sad time of world history). The script crackles with dark humour and cool characters, flying high above the (frequently) boring dialogue of Tarantino's last couple of efforts. Building to a bloodthirsty climax in a cinema, the setting is fitting for a film that is all about film; filmy film where cinematic references are plentiful and the film-lovers in the audience are in on the jokes.<br/><br/>The opening scene is classic Tarantino and sets the tone for the rest of the movie with its promise of violence, a cracking villain and another Tarantino heroine out for revenge. If you were losing patience with the masterful cinematic magpie, give Inglorious Basterds a spin and then settle in for the long wait till 'Django Unchained'."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","5","25 December 2010"," Gloriously entertaining
","Quentin Tarantino is a director whose films always have a unique stamp. With his gift for dialogue, fondness for cinematic & pop culture references and slick visuals, his films can easily be recognized. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is another signature effort and, in my opinion, his best in years.<br/><br/>The film presents a fictionalized view of World War II. Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) leads a group of Jewish-American soldiers known for brutally killing (and scalping) Nazis. The premiere of Goebbels' latest propaganda piece in Nazi-occupied Paris presents them with an opportunity of taking out the Nazi high command and crippling the German war effort.<br/><br/>Besides Pitt, the cast isn't exactly star-studded but there are nevertheless several fine performances. Christoph Waltz won an Oscar for his spirited, charismatic portrayal of the film's main villain, Nazi colonel Hans Landa, nicknamed ""The Jew Hunter"". Other standouts include Michael Fassbender & Daniel Brühl. However, even the small roles are populated by interesting actors, though I could have done without Eli Roth.<br/><br/>Tarantino's direction is as energetic as always and resulted in one of his two Oscar nominations. He was also nominated for his unconventional but entertaining script. The score is also unconventional, since it borrows liberally from other film scores. The results are generally pleasing though I didn't really care for the scene-setting Bowie tune. Meanwhile, the film's Oscar nominations for cinematography, editing, sound & sound editing demonstrate the general level of technical expertise employed here.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a unique piece of entertainment but it's certainly no history lesson. While Tarantino's trademarks may be (slightly) overly apparent the film's sheer entertainment value overshadows any faults. For a 153 minute movie the time just flies by. All in all, I'd have to say that this is Tarantino's best since ""Pulp Fiction""; much more rewarding than ""Death Proof"" and the ""Kill Bill"" movies."

"andreas-thinsz","7","1","5","25 May 2010"," I hate Tarantino - but this movie you have to see!
","As the summary states, Tarantino is one of the directors/writers I try to avoid when deciding what movies to watch. In my opinion his movies are nothing more than senseless splatter flicks with little more substance than most B-movies (or so much substance the story doesn't make sense - Pulp Fiction).<br/><br/>This is what I expected when I sat down to watch Inglorious Basterds, boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>French characters speaking French?! Oh wait they swapped to English with some bad excuse... no wait it was part of the plot and it made sense! Not only do they speak their native languages fluently, these are good actors.<br/><br/>Suddenly you forget you are watching a movie and you get wrapped up in the dialogue driven story and the intrigue just dying to know what will happen next.<br/><br/>There are a few moments you get pulled back to reality (the odd camera work which I consider a plus since it comes with the feeling - wow that was different), the unlikeliness of the Aldo Raine character ever becoming an officer and his Indian heritage being the reason of his treatment of the German soldiers (this is a big part of the plot and so incredible it ruins an otherwise believable story) and last but not least the shoot-out between two of the main characters toward the end of the movie that feels a tad over the top, very à la Tarantino.<br/><br/>The only other downside is that you never get a chance to really start caring about the characters. There's a depth there that Tarantino just scratches the surface of and just when you're about to start feeling something, cut and new scene.<br/><br/>As far as the very odd plot twist in the end of the movie goes, I'm willing to oversee it as artistic freedom.<br/><br/>All in all a great movie that will keep you on your toes, great acting (I'm very happy to see that Christoph Waltz won an Oscar for his role) and believable (with a few exceptions).<br/><br/>If you shun Tarantino like the plague like I do, still make sure you see this movie."
"hall895","8","1","5","14 May 2010"," That's a bingo!
","Brad Pitt stars in Quentin Tarantino's big, audacious World War II movie. And Pitt, through no fault of his own, has the movie stolen right out from under him by Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent. Which begs the question, who the heck are Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent? You may not have known who they were before Inglourious Basterds but everyone will know them now. Especially Waltz who, in creating one of the most memorable movie villains of all time, deservedly won pretty much every acting award worth winning. His performance is the best thing in what turns out to be the best film Tarantino has made in quite some time.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning you get the sense Inglourious Basterds is going to be unlike most anything you've seen before. The very first scene is filled with almost unbearable tension. And what does that scene consist of? Essentially it's just two guys sitting at a table talking. And talking, and talking, and talking some more. OK, so maybe this is like some Tarantino movies you've seen before. Played incorrectly this scene could have been interminable. But Waltz is not going to let that happen. He portrays SS Colonel Hans Landa and he owns this scene. Actually he owns pretty much every scene in which he appears. His Hans Landa is absolutely chilling. Beneath the calm veneer you know there lurks so much evil waiting to explode. Not for nothing is Hans Landa nicknamed Jew Hunter. The palpable sense of menace whenever Landa is on the screen is unmistakable. The performance from Waltz is the stuff of legend. This is one of the most memorable acting performances ever seen.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Mélanie Laurent makes quite an impression of her own portraying Shosanna Dreyfus, a young Jewish woman who with a new identity has built a new life for herself after escaping the Jew Hunter's clutches. Now known as Emmanuelle Mimieux she owns a cinema in Paris. Nazi-occupied Paris that is. Surrounded by the enemy Shosanna is a woman who longs for revenge. And an unbelievable opportunity for vengeance will be dropped right into her lap. Cool and detached as Shoshanna may seem to be you never doubt that in the critical moment she will be as strong and determined as she needs to be to get the job done. Playing Shoshanna with that almost impossible coolness in the face of unthinkable circumstance Laurent is pretty much perfect. Full credit to her for creating a tremendous movie heroine.<br/><br/>So we've got a couple of unknowns brilliantly bringing to life a memorable heroine and an all-time movie villain. What then of Pitt, the nominal star of the movie? In his portrayal of Lt. Aldo Raine, leader of the Nazi-killing Basterds of the movie's title, Pitt is fine. His exaggerated Southern drawl does wear a bit thin after a while but that's a minor quibble. The real issue is that the film may be titled Inglourious Basterds but those Basterds are really the least interesting part of the movie. They're good for a few moments of ultra-violence but story-wise this movie really belongs to Hans Landa and Shosanna Dreyfus. But that's OK because we've already established how great those characters are. Eventually all the disparate strands of the story, Basterds included, will come together and then you can see that Tarantino has pulled off something rather special here. Maybe there are a few places where the story lags but that is more than offset by scenes of unbearable tension. Ironically most of those scenes, like the opening one, seem to be nothing more than people sitting around a table talking. That's our Quentin alright. Another unmistakable Tarantino touch is the film's music. Most notable is the use in one critical scene of a David Bowie song, written nearly three decades earlier for another movie, which is so perfect you would swear it had been written just now for this scene in this movie. Tarantino's encyclopedic knowledge of film history pays off again. And while Pitt is the big name and Waltz and Laurent make the big impressions Tarantino makes use of a wide and varied supporting cast, all of whom are absolutely spot-on. Not a casting misstep to be found. This is a great story and one that is performed brilliantly. Nobody else would have ever made this movie, it's a Tarantino movie through and through. And it's one of Quentin's best."

","I'm starting this review with a lot having already been said about it, so the natural response is to review, in sorts, what has been said.<br/><br/>The overwhelming criticism in those reviews which give this film less than 50% ratings seems to be based in the fact that suspension of disbelief is not so much demanded as shoved down your throat. To this I would simply say this: this an uber-revisionist film, which might, with the addition of a couple of capes, have made a decent pass as a superhero film. To say ""but shouldn't there have been more guards? Why were all the Nazis assembled together?"" without first demanding why Hitler was killed by vigilante Jews is to miss the point completely.<br/><br/>This is fantasy. It is comic. It is over the top. Quite frankly, for the most part, it is brilliant.<br/><br/>Much has been made of Waltz's sensational multi-lingual performance, and this is never more evident than in the breathtaking opening scene. suspenseful, with great dialogue, this is film-making at it's highest peak. The tone continues throughout, with some great set-pieces (most notably the basement scene).<br/><br/>The one criticism that I would entertain is that of the relative blandness of ""The Basterds"". But even in this sense, I feel criticism is overly harsh: that the poster makers would put Brad Pitt at the centre is inevitable, whilst criticism of Eli Roth, who plays an almost mute character whose only trait IS his brute strength, is frankly baffling.<br/><br/>Overall, however, I think that people may well have missed the point. It isn't realistic. It is totally devoid of morality. But it is tremendous fun to watch. The acting is good, the set pieces are of the highest dramatic standards, and I did laugh. A lot."
"jimjo1216","Null","1","5","8 May 2010"," Operation Kino: A WWII movie that revolves around the world of cinema
","Quentin Tarantino puts his spin on WWII escapism. Some of the violence may shock and disturb you, but the movie isn't the Nazi-killing shoot-'em-up some viewers may expect. In fact, Brad Pitt's guerrilla squad of Nazi-killers is only one ingredient in the wartime narrative tapestry, and only has a couple good scenes. This film is dialogue-driven and spoken in several natural languages, with English subtitles as needed. (In a movie where French people don't speak German and Germans don't know Italian, it wouldn't do to have every character speak English for the audience's convenience.)<br/><br/>The movie is broken up into five chapters, each dealing with a specific aspect of the larger plot. One part is about a French girl meeting with Nazis interested in her cinema. Another part is about Brad Pitt's guys and their secret mission. In the final chapter, all of the stories meet at a movie premiere attended by high-ranking Nazi officials.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino is, above all, a cinephile. His movies reflect his wide knowledge of and respect for films and filmmakers. INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS may be Tarantino's biggest tribute to all things cinema. It's filled with references to foreign films and film history. (e.g., Goebbels is compared to David O. Selznick.) The plot even leans heavily on the motion picture industry. The main character owns a theatre. A key character is a German movie star. The climax is set at a movie premiere. The Nazis' big ""scheme"" in this film is to show their propaganda movie. The theatre, the projection room, and even the film reels themselves play big roles in the story.<br/><br/>Tarantino gives WWII a spaghetti western feel, complete with epic Ennio Morricone music. He sprinkles in his signature cultural references to film and literature (dating far enough back for the 1940s setting). And although this is undoubtedly a period piece, Tarantino spices up the storytelling with stylish flashback inserts (narrated, randomly, by Samuel L. Jackson) and some super-imposed labeling. The inconsistent use of such novelty devices, however, comes across as messy in my mind.<br/><br/>Still, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is a decent film that, if you pay attention, will make you think. Nazis are always thought of as the ""bad guys"", but this film shows the enemy soldiers as real people, doing their job and fighting for their country. Sure Hitler is shown as a maniacal caricature and the Nazi officers are casual racists, but the movie gives the ""bad guys"" (the German soldiers) a human face. Some brutal and inhumane things are done to the Germans by the ""good guys"", and the viewer can't cheer these actions on. Does each individual soldier deserve to be held accountable for the evils of his regime?<br/><br/>The main players in this revenge-against-the-Nazis yarn are Christoph Waltz as the shrewd and well-mannered S.S. detective, Melanie Laurent as the surviving daughter of a massacred Jewish family, and Brad Pitt as the leader of the Basterds. Diane Kruger plays a German actress/spy, Michael Fassbender plays a British soldier chosen for a secret mission, and Daniel Bruhl plays a humble German war hero. As you can see, it's an ensemble piece, with several characters' destinies intertwined. (But, like other Tarantino films, don't expect many characters to survive to the end.)<br/><br/>Again, I warn that this is not an action movie and that the Basterds don't really take center stage. Tarantino tackles period films and foreign languages for this effort, but there are hints of his signature style throughout.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"Lifexinxrewind","7","1","5","8 April 2010"," Inglorious Basterds is an enjoyable if inconsistent ride
","Inglorious Basterds is a tough film for me to review. Tarantino's latest certainly has moments of greatness. There are many scenes that were expertly done, the overall story of the movie is great and as you'd expect the look of the film is fantastic. That being said, there are many flaws that hampered my enjoyment. There are definitely points in the movie where the signature never ending scenes of dialog dragged, and I'm still not convinced this needed to be almost three hours in length to get its message across.<br/><br/>The actual ending was downright nonsensical in my opinion, and without going into spoilers, I cannot fathom what one of the characters was thinking. It somewhat ruined the well done climax of the film for me, as the main story lines had converged into a splendid resolution only moments before. <br/><br/>Another serious problem I had with the film is the fact that so many scenes and bits were completely similar to things I had seen in Tarantino's other films. How many movies of his am I destined to sit through that feature 10 minutes of tension building dialog just to have every person in the room kill each other in a glorious bloodbath (Reservoir Dogs, anyone)? This would have worked fine if I wasn't feeling so much deja vu. Even the speech that ends the movie was pretty much just this film's version of Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>I did enjoy Jackson's narration in this film, and the supporting cast was mostly phenomenal. The multiple languages didn't detract from my enjoyment and I enjoyed a lot of the trademark witty banter. In the end though, as good as the movie was in spots, it left a sour taste in my mouth. The more creative portions only served to highlight that too often I was watching Tarantino do the same things he's been doing in all of his films. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm in the minority here, but the music and scoring was surprisingly very hit or miss. Sometimes effective and appropriate, sometimes dreadfully distracting. There were a fair share of moments where I was very bothered by how out of place the soundtrack felt.<br/><br/>Speaking of hit or miss, I still haven't made up my mind about Brad Pitt's performance. As mentioned, all the other actors did a fantastic job, but as much as I enjoy Pitt, his accent and mannerisms were great at times and obnoxious at others. I never really fully bought into his character without seeing it as Pitt playing him, and that's not the sign of a truly great performance.<br/><br/>With the exception of the overall effectively complex story, Inglorious Basterds is a sometimes uneven effort in a lot of ways. I love the attitude Tarantino brings to his films, as he is obviously passionate about his work and I have to respect what he does. That being said, sometimes he can get a bit self-indulgent, and that becomes clear during sequences of this film. While there's no question its worth a viewing, it's not up the same level as Tarantino's best work."
"ajs-10","8","1","5","29 March 2010"," Engrossing from start to finish...
","I'll admit I'm not the greatest fan of Mr Tarantino's work, for me he can blow hot and cold. He sometimes seems to be more interested in putting in subtle little twists and nods to obscure films that will only be admired by a certain few, rather than making a coherent movie. In this film, however, the twists and nods either too subtle for me, which I suspect, or he's actually attempted to make a movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not perfect and it's very, very long, but it does all tie together quite neatly in the end.<br/><br/>When Shosanna Dreyfus escapes from the Nazis having seen her family shot, she thought she'd never see the man responsible for it, Col. Hans Landa, again. However, fate has a nasty way of playing evil tricks on people like Shosanna. Four years later she owns and runs a cinema in Paris, where, thanks to the attentions of a young German war hero, Pvt. Fredrick Zoller, she is to stage a German film premiere. All the German High Command, including Hitler himself, is to attend. News of this event comes through to Lt. Aldo Raine and his band of Inglorious Basterds, who are behind enemy lines causing havoc and fear in the German ranks. They are to destroy the cinema with the help of a spy, Bridget von Hammersmark, but the newly appointed head of security, Col. Hans Landa has other plans. I think that's a pretty good summary, without giving too much away (I hope).<br/><br/>Let me first say that as a whole, I really enjoyed watching this film. It's not Tarantino's best, that's still a tie between Pulp Fiction (1994) and Jackie Brown (1997) in my book. The performances are all outshone by Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa; he quite deservedly won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar and BAFTA awards (plus quite a few others I see). Honourable mentions go to Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine (loved the accent), Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus, Eli Roth as Sgt. Donny Donowitz, Michael Fassbender as Lt. Archie Hicox, Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark and Daniel Brühl as Pvt. Fredrick Zoller.<br/><br/>Although I'm quite used to watching foreign language films, I found the switching between scenes in English, to scenes in German or French with subtitles quite distracting. Don't get me wrong, many of the scenes were very well done and quite absorbing to watch, but they didn't always fit together as well as they might. The music was pretty good too, although I did feel I was watching a Spaghetti Western at a couple of points near the beginning. So, over all it's quite an engrossing film, if a little difficult to watch in one sitting at nearly two and a half hours in duration. But having said that, I do recommend it, it's worth seeing if only for the performance of Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt's Tennessee accent.<br/><br/>My score: 8.4/10"
"delibebek","Null","1","5","8 March 2010"," Boy was this different
","This movie was so unlike the original, and I don't mean just the extra 'u' and 'e' in the title words. For one thing, there was no black guy on the team. He was one of the best characters in the original, but I guess it would have been confusing for one of the Jewish-Americans to be black. Something like that would require a lot of explaining and would strain credibility.<br/><br/>I don't remember so much of the girl and the war hero from the original. As I recall, it followed the team and that's it, but the movie was great, although being a relatively low budget production, it suffered during some of the action sequences. This new movie by Quentin Tarrantino had plenty of budget, but chose a different direction for the story, springing from some of the basic story elements and making something more ambitious from it.<br/><br/>The introductory scenes for Landa and Emmanuelle were a bit long, longer than they really had to be, but thankfully, this was as indulgent as Tarrantino got in this movie. The rest of the movie began to weave together in crisper scenes, with dialogue that captured interest rather than leading the viewer into little eddies of vacant thought that would only get away from the main thread of the movie. Quentin steered us pretty well past lots of bits that might have been going on beside the main story.<br/><br/>However, while the director reined himself in a bit, Mr. Pitt overplayed far too much. I'm not sure why he wants so much to be a character actor, but from this outing he just doesn't have a feel for it. I could find better work in a workshop, but I guess there's a machinery behind the presence of stars in movies.<br/><br/>Overall, I got more excited about the direction of the movie as it went on, and I was very entertained by the climactic scene. It is definitely a movie I will want to watch again. Like much of Tarrantino's work, it has the semblance of layers in the dialogue and enough peculiarity to the perspectives in the scenes to make one enjoy watching it again as well. First, though, I'll have to go back and watch ""The Inglorious Bastards"" just to remind myself why I enjoyed that one too."

","As with any Quentin Tarantino film, it is either you like it or you don't. This guy really goes to extremes with his films, so audience reactions are also in extremes. When I first saw the trailer, with its references to ""100 Nazi scalps,"" I didn't think I would watch it. However, with all of these accolades coming in from various critics groups in the past weeks, I felt I had to watch this looming awards front-runner.<br/><br/>The very first scene in the dairy farm of Perrier LaPadite (Denis was so tense. We get a first glimpse of the brilliant and much lauded performance of Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Hans Landa. His presence in subsequent scenes would then always strike a fearful chord. Waltz seems to be a lock for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar as early as now.<br/><br/>The scene in the tavern with German actress Brigid von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger), Lt. Archie Hicox (Michael Fassbender) and SS Maj. Dieter Hellstrom (August Diehl) was another highlight of tension and mayhem.<br/><br/>And of course that last slam-bang scene set in La Gamaar, the movie house of Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent). I concede that it was too impossible (like, how could there be no security in the theater lobby???) but the indulgent wish-fulfillment is too irresistible to deny.<br/><br/>Every scene Lt. Aldo Raine was in was darkly hilarious, even in the most gory ones. Brad Pitt plays the character tongue-in-cheek, seemingly always sticking out, out of place in the gravity of the wartime situation. But I was thoroughly entertained by this guy, as his presence lightens and loosens things up a bit, and that is good in a film like this.<br/><br/>QT's love for movies is obvious here. As I wrote earlier, the climactic scene happens in a movie house. There are bits and pieces of movie discussions in various scenes involving Pvt. Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) who was a German soldier who became a war hero, and later starred in a film about his military exploits made by no less than Joseph Goebbels. There are typical QT trademarks like gaudy character intros and rough annotations. Your guess is as good as mine why his title is spelled that way, another QT quirk and conceit, most probably.<br/><br/>So, as with all QT films, watch ""Inglourious Basterds"" at your own risk. Ignoring all the ultra-violence (what QT film doesn't have these scenes?), I think it is a pretty good film. But this is definitely not for all tastes, but it is one hell of a ride -- a shoot-em-up spaghetti western set in World War 2."
"Samiam3","7","1","5","23 December 2009"," A very special war film
","Without doubt, Inglourious Basterds is the most inventive of WWII movies, taking many artistic liberties and subsequent risks. Most of it works quite nicely, but not all of it. Quentin Tarantino, is a director who always puts style over story. In this film there is a bit too much of the former and not enough of the latter. Several scenes are far too long and the ending is somewhat anticlimactic, so I wouldn't call Inglourious Basterds terrific, but it's reasonably close. It is definitely Oscar worthy material.<br/><br/>In five chapters, Tarantino tells two stories about people out to kill Nazis. First, there is Brad Pitt and his goons going around France scalping Germans. Then there is a young girl who runs a theatre, and plans to kill the Nazi party on the night of some propaganda screening. Her family was killed by Colonel Hans Landa, played by Christoph Waltz whose performance just about makes the movie. Waltz in his first English role is so good that I would have liked to see more of him on screen. <br/><br/>Inglorious Bastards may just be the most clever film of the year, even if it is not the best. It is occasionally flawed but overall interesting, thought provoking, creative and equally wacky."

There's no mercy, no happy end and damn sure there are no heroes left, when the lights come back on.<br/><br/>The thought of the assassination working out is quite sweet - followed by the bitterness of reality - and that's what this movie's about: empathy, emotion and dealing the deck of cliché-cards.

"mark-whait","8","1","5","20 December 2009"," Flashes of brilliance, but no Pulp Fiction
","Quentin Tarantino remains a compelling, if slightly unfulfilled film maker, and I was very interested in this latest offering. The premise sounded like typical Tarantino comic book escapism. Set a film in Nazi-occupied France and have Brad Pitt lead a group of Jewish-American soldiers intent on collecting - literally - the prized scalps of the enemy and it seemed to provide the perfect platform for another trademark Tarantino blood and gore fest. But the film never quite delivers on its initial promise, and although there are flashes of brilliance, this is no Pulp Fiction. But it is essential viewing and whatever one thinks of Tarantino's subsequent career moves since the highs of the 1990s, there is little doubt that the man still possesses an abundance of talent and knows how to deliver popcorn cinema out of the mainstream. Christoph Waltz is excellent, none more so than in the opening scene where QT teases us with a scene choking with tension. And Brad Pitt is wonderful as the colourful Aldo Raine. Pitt hams it up with effortless skill, and despite his obvious play acting in the role, we still engage with his character. One wonders if his portrayal was almost an in-joke from Tarantino as a metaphorical take on the American military view towards conflict and wars in general. And with no pop culture discussions to engulf the characters given the time and place of the story, QT instead uses this film as a platform to show off his huge knowledge of world cinema, and barely a scene goes by without the director trying to dazzle us with his encyclopedic references. There is even a snippet of Ennio Morricone on the soundtrack. In some ways, this is less comic book than, say, Kill Bill, and Tarantino as usual sets up long scenes that double up as set pieces - not necessarily in action but dialogue. The film does veer off in unnecessary directions at times, and does not entirely convince - it sags badly in places in the second half - but this is still required viewing and Tarantino's unique view of the world remains watchable with interest."
"debjyoti1981","8","1","5","12 December 2009"," Definitely needs to be seen.
","Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglorious Basterds"" is a tour de force in its own way. <br/><br/>Like his other works ""The Pulp Fiction"" this movie has a strong narrative and is performance driven, which is seen from the very beginning.<br/><br/>Though the story is based on fiction, the backdrop is taken from the time of Nazi Occupied France during 1941.<br/><br/>We are presented with two distinctive stories running in parallel. A girl with a fake identity seeking to avenge her family's murder by Nazi; the other one emphasis on a group of American Jew soldiers led by perky Lt. Aldo Raine called as the ""Basterds"" for creating havoc within the German Army stationed in France, by brutally killing them and leaving behind their smudge of terror.<br/><br/>As usual Tarantino has achieved to render the violence on screen but restraining from calling this movie too gory. The style is unique and of course praiseworthy. The cast is well chosen, though we have lots of characters to deal with, the one which will linger in the viewers' mind will be 'Colonel Hans Landa' brilliantly enacted by Christoph Waltz. We also have Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine; it would have been pleasant if his screen timing was little bit more, not to forget Mélanie Laurent, whose beauty was equally balanced by her shining act.<br/><br/>After seeing 'Downfall' or 'Der Untergang' I could not imagine anyone could play the role of Hitler other than Bruno Ganz. If you have not seen that movie you need to see to understand my implication, if you have seen then you probably know what I mean. I think this is the only reason why I would down slide the rating to some extent.<br/><br/>This movie is presented in chapters and is well tuned with background score. I think the originality was also achieved for keeping the language not restricted to English but also keeping German, French and Italian giving us a real feel of European atmosphere. Cinematography has also had been one of its strong points which surly will lure the eyes of the Academy Awards Committee. Note this is not a typical World War movie where it's more action driven; here the drama element also takes a major role.<br/><br/>Overall if you like Tarantino's movies, then there is a great chance that you may adore this flick."

","Not a secret to anyone, Inglorious Basterds sure is full of references to the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

All you are missing are the faces of Clint Eastwood of the 60's & Gian Maria Volonte as the ultimate bad guy.<br/><br/>Very nice overall, although the (English) dialogue is a bit modern for the WWII.

","Revenge is something that would define Quentin Tarantino. You only have to look to Kill Bill 1+2 to see how Tarantino dances outside the boundaries of morality and humanity and appeals to ugly, violent human urges of blood lust and revenge.<br/><br/>What is different in this film is that we see Tarantino appealing to a greater, social hostility to Third Reich and the Nazi Reigeme. We've all sat through history classes, seen the pictures of mutilated, malnourished corpses..maybe read books such as ""Night"", or seen films such as ""Schindlers list"". Needless to say, the Nazi reigeme has come to represent the dark depths of humanity.<br/><br/>What Inglorious basterds may do (for some) is to satisfy an urge, an ugly urge to get even with Nazi's. It's Tarantino's version of history, the awesome version where Brad Pitt and his Jewish, Nazi-hunting crew collect Nazi scalps as accolades.<br/><br/>Some viewers may be shocked. They may argue ""an eye for an eye makes the world go blind"". I have to admit, I wasn't sympathetic with the Basterds cause after ""the bear jew"" beat a helpless Nazi officer to death with a baseball bat. Or when the cinema burned down with helpless patrons running towards locked doors as 2 of the basterds unloaded rounds of lead into the fleeing crowds. But yet, this movie was not meant to be morally profound, this movie is, of course, Tarantino."

I'm not a Jew, I'm not a Jew lover, I'm not a Nazi, I'm not a aryan sympathiser. I like my truth, but Tarantino makes bull(expletive)it! look, taste, feel and sound so good, why even bother with the truth. Take a point of view from the infamous Schrödinger's cat paradox, either living or dead, even the cat wouldn't want the truth to get in the way of a good ball of yarn. That's why Hollywood will always kick the art-house guru's out of the water with it's global appeal. Yes i'd much rather see more care taken over some of the Padang Hollywood manages to produce, but the Europeans and the rest of the world produce just as much badly drawn scuzz-dribble as the big Hollywood studios. I rated about 5 movies that I've seen at the cinema so far this year above an IMDb 6 and two of those were kids movies. State of Play was decent and Frost/Nixon was too, and those movies were good practice for holding my bladder before Basterds.<br/><br/>I was about 8 or 9 when i saw my first R rated movie - Robocop. After that experience i was corrupt and hooked on violence and abusive language, mainly because the other kids at school thought it was cool too. It's not the most original metaphor for my admiration of a director and his movies but it suits my affirmation that Inglourious Basterds is too cool for school. I can only hope that someone with Tarantino's deft eye for detail, visually analytical parody and descriptive passion for storytelling will re-imagine the Anime classic - UROTSUKIDOJI!!! When they do, i will be in the cinema with all the other cine-files holding hands in solidarity and singing ""thank god we're not in jail"" ""they will never catch us"" and the classic polka ""please don't tell my mom"".<br/><br/>Power to the Projectionist!"

I watched it right before I went to bed and I was so thrilled that I even dreamed about stabbing people in the faces and shooting them in the testicles... But then the next morning when I woke up, as a long time movie fan I started to think that this movie actually has a lot of flaws. That's what a sensible movie fan would think about ain't that? For instance when we see the character intro of the Hugo guy, we are so excited and wanna see him do some stuff with the IB who he has ""gone pro"" with, but the crazy guy just dies before he does any fun stuff. That is disappointing ain't that? And as for the vengeance of the jew girl, it just could have been A LOT MORE powerful if only QT had wished to. And the bear jew guy and other IB members, they could have been more like characters that we won't forget in a long time if only QT had wished to! To do those is really easy for him, just think about pulp fiction and reservoir dogs, we do remember every character in them don't we? But in IB, I guess 20 years later from now(it has been almost 20 years since reservoir dogs), we will only remember brad pitt and the jew hunter.<br/><br/>Those are some of the flaws I caught, but I can sort of imagine why QT didn't care about those flaws, they are pretty big ones though... JUST SEE AND FEEL THE CINEMATOGRAPH!!! And I am talking about the camera movement language, it's just so good!! Literally every message the director wants to convey, the camera can do the work! In the first chapter, the movement between french guy's face, jew hunter's smile, and the floor board, and the people underneath it, well buddy, movies just don't get too much better than this do they? Not to mention the cigarette thrown in the air to burn down the films and every ""branding scene""... Apart from the camera, the acting is nearly as great! Brad Pitt and jew hunter, I'd vote for them for Academy Award this year.<br/><br/>Again, QT hasn't yet got off his track of making funny and technically-textbook movies, IB is so great. But wanna say this is his most perfect one? oh you ain't gonna say that... Or, this guy just doesn't wanna make movies that are perfect, cuz it ain't fun."

Inglorious Bastards are finally here (on DVD) and my impressions are mixed.<br/><br/>The plot is a typical Tarantinian affair - it's laboriously long, filled with all kinds of wacky comic-book characters and seemingly so complicated that it had to be separated into 'acts'. Yet, in its core, the story behind it is surprisingly simple and one-linear.<br/><br/>Here it is: the entire Nazi high command will gather in a Parisian cinema to watch the premiere of Goering's new propaganda movie. Two factions are planning to blow up the cinema and all the big shots in it - a group of allied commandos (the Bastards) with the help of a German movie star turned traitor and a secretly Jewish girl who owns the cinema.<br/><br/>Thus, in the course of this movie, we are introduced with the characters, we are shown the circumstances under which the girl gets to host the event, then we see a failed attempt of the Bastards to meet their contact and finally, the big night, where both plot threads converge. That's pretty much it for the plot. Not exactly mind-blowing stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, most Tarantino's films have generally simplistic plots, it's the details where they shine. And this is IMO, where the biggest downfall of this movie lies.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the problem is that the film takes place in Europe. During the forties.<br/><br/>Remember all those super-interesting slang-filled conversations and pop culture references? You know, the ones that made even the non-driving parts of Death Proof kinda sorta fun? Well, imagine all the conversations being about silent films and pop stars that had died decades before you were born. And spoken mostly in German and French. Unless you're a European retro-art fan, you'll spend about 2 hours out of 2:30 squinting at subtitles and sighing under your breath.<br/><br/>Even worse is how thematically dull all these speech scenes are. More than 90% of them involve the good guys forced into an interaction with the bad guys (usually this one creepy SS officer nicknamed 'the Jew Hunter'), where they desperately struggle to keep the charade going. What does the German know? Is he on to us? Uhh, the tension! Whew, he's leaving. No wait, he's back. etc... rinse and repeat 5 or 6 times, over about 70% of the movie time.<br/><br/>Neither of these two problems would be much of an issue on their own. It's Tarantino, for gods sake, great convos is what he does the best. However, combined, they do tend to dull the interest, especially during the second part of the movie.<br/><br/>The action and gore scenes are excellently produced (easily on level with Kill Bill), but they do little to shake things up as there's so little of them. Actually, now that I think about it, the film doesn't have even ONE REAL HONEST ACTION SCENE. All the shooting is either mutually destructive or one-sided, while the gore is inflicted mostly on helpless victims. A real shame, considering how good those few bits we've seen are.<br/><br/>That said, the characters, the back-stories and all the little touches and details are pure Tarantino, which is to say, they're excellent! Brad Pitt did kind of crappy job, but everyone else were very good, especially the aforementioned creepy nazi.<br/><br/>The best thing is the ending (and here we go neck deep into the SPOILER territory). Remember all those WWII movies where the good guys make all these plans to kill Hitler and stop the war, but you sort of know they'll somehow screw up in the end? Well forget about that crap here. Inglorious Bastards ends up wading heavily into the alternate universe territory, with a cathartic release of lead, fire and all sorts of other deadly things into Hitler and his pals. Pretty sweet ending and something we've seen too rarely (or never?) in WWII movies.<br/><br/>Overall, not the worst Tarantino's effort, but nowhere near the best."
"mrbrock01","7","1","5","16 November 2009"," Tarantino stylized, unique storytelling
","No doubt this was an entertaining film to watch, if for no other reason than the quality of acting from the cast. Certainly a unique story and characters which has become a painfully absent commodity in Hollywood for quite a few years now. Only problem i had with the film is it seems to have lost some steam or creative energy in the story development in the second half. Maybe thats just QT bucking the traditional expected story arch, or perhaps he had more in mind for the film originally and had to settle for less and compress for time, i dunno. Either way he is exceptionally skilled at bringing whats in his head to life on film, almost to the point where it feels as though im not really watching actors in a movie, but being invited into a vivid daydream. Once again i just felt the last third of the film felt a little flat, could have used some more powerful twists than the ones he tossed in seemingly as an afterthought. QT does tend to come off as a bit of a rambler when hes speaking, to say the least, and i think he has all these grand ideas and just has a hard time fitting them all into a 2 hour flick. Im in no way criticizing the guys ability to make some of the best films ever, or even this movie which was awesome, just rambling a bit myself i guess. I gave it a 7 cause it could have been so much more, and i think that the 9's and 10's are waaaay overused and should be reserved for flicks closer to the masterpieces such as his own Pulp Fiction or Francis Ford's Apocalypse Now, which strangely has the same 8.6 rating, which tells me a lot about how people vote."
"hemant_balz","8","1","5","11 November 2009"," Tarantino proves he's a master at changing history
","This is the best movie i have seen in a long time. The plot is based on world war-2 scenario where Hitler Nazis get a taste of there own music thats brutality.The brutality they show towards Jews eventually comes to haunt them through the basterds(they call them-self)-a small army of American Jews who spread fear among Nazis by killing them mercilessly. The screenplay is awesome.Even the casting is quite superb. The performances by Brad Pitt,Melane Laurent & Eli Roth is commendable. But what takes the limelight is the performance by Christopher Waltz. I have never seen him before.But his acting that of the German Colonel is totally laudable.He deserves a lot of credit for the success of the film. The dialogs are just appropriate & the soundtrack is also very good.Tarantino's portrayal of that of a Jew girl who wants to take revenge on Nazis by burning down the theater in Paris that she owns is just too mouth watering.She(Melani Laurent)looks so pretty in the film I cant tell you how much. The movie finale is just too good to resist.Last 1/2 hour of the movie is a must watch for any cinema lover. This movie has the right blend of comedy,action & thrill. The best part is that Hitler & his men got what they deserve & that has been shown in this movie. Truly Tarantino has made a classic.Changing History so everyone can see the Hitler & his Nazis getting what they deserve in retribution to all the Jews they have killed. This movie was a thrilling experience.Must watch!!"
"Qanqor","8","1","5","7 September 2009"," Some missteps, but mainly enjoyable
","Awful. Terrible. Really bad.<br/><br/>That's my rating of the *comments* on this movie, not the movie itself. It seems like *every single comment* is by someone who either loves Tarantino or hates Tarantino or used to love but now hates Tarantino, and is in any case determined to judge this movie solely on how it compares to other Tarantino movies that they either love or hate. Seriously, go try to find some review that *just* review *this film* without reference to Tarantino or his other films. Nobody seems the tiniest bit interested in just judging this movie by itself, for what it is; everyone seems stubbornly determined to start from what they *expected* it to be. I found this very annoying, because I have no particular opinion of Tarantino, and I'm not at all sure I've ever seen any of his other films. So I'm judging this film purely by *this film*.<br/><br/>And I liked it. A lot. Not perfect, I definitely have some nits to pick. But on the whole, the story engrossed me, the suspense was totally suspenseful, some of the characters were memorable, and at least some of the humor quite funny. I very much liked the way language was used in the film.<br/><br/>Was it profound or thought-provoking? No. Was it art? No. But it was entertaining and well made, and that's fine with me.<br/><br/>Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't pick at the nits. The film vacillated clumsily in tone, between serious, intense drama, and a vastly more frivolous tone. For instance, the use in some cases of hand-written labels for characters drawn onto the screen, or rock-and-roll music at inappropriate times. I really felt the frivolousness didn't work at all and was distracting.<br/><br/>And then there was the graphic violence. I'm not big on gore, not at all. For the most port, I thought the overt gore was reasonably appropriate to the story and characters. But the final scene was *well* over the line. I couldn't watch it, I eventually had to turn away. It didn't need to be that long and explicit, period. I don't pay good money to come to the theater to have to squirm and wince like that, that's not an enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>But on the whole I thought it was very good. The proof of the pudding: I was very surprised after the film when I looked at the theater lobby clock and realized how long the movie had been; it definitely did not seem that long while I was watching it, and that's generally the mark of a good film."
"cegg","8","1","5","6 September 2009"," Mixed feelings watching a good movie
","If Inglourious Basterds wasn't set during WWII, I guess everyone would love this movie. Tarantino didn't feel the need of distancing from Nazis and their inhumanity? and that is what makes me sad after watching this. It's Jews' revenge on Nazis, and Art's revenge on War; so you start to feel as if you should like Nazis and War.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are above average conversations and very good acting throughout the movie, so you'll love it if you don't care much about history. Everyone says Christoph Waltz is a good actor -- I have to mention that all the German actors were great including August Diehl and Daniel Brühl.<br/><br/>You have to watch this one, but you'll have to have mixed feelings after watching it."
"petit76","8","1","5","3 September 2009"," howling success from Quentine
","Inglorious Basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy, gloriously so. Built on the framework of The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds ditches the elongated training sequences of The Dirty Dozen to plunge into the action right away. In the process, Tarantino fixes one of The Dirty Dozen's major flaws by giving the bad guys screen time to remind us just how bad the Nazis were. The Nazis with the most screen time end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film, which ironically makes them even worse monsters.<br/><br/>Bu ditching the training sequences, Tarantino is also able to give us a picture of the entire war, showing us not only British, American and German soldiers, but also giving us glimpses into the world of French and German civilians, both collaborators and Resistance.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that any Tarantino film is going to have fantastic dialogue, but when Tarantino made the decision to have the French characters speak French and the Germans speak German, beyond adding a level of authenticity, Tarantino also somehow ensured that his dialogue in French was as sharp and funny and clever as his English dialogue.<br/><br/>Case in point, during the opening sequence the Nazi ""Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christian Waltz) is interrogating French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Landa suspects that LaPadite is hiding a family of Jews. While subtly pressuring LaPadite, Landa asks for a glass of milk. After greedily gulping it down, Landa compliments LaPadite on his daughters and his cows, ""à votre famille et à vos vaches, je dis bravo."" The thing of it is, in French ""vache"" means cow, but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina. If reprimanded for this vulgar pun, Landa could quite convincingly claim not to understand French well enough to have meant it that way, but Landa does mean it that way and he means it as a threat. And LaPadite understands his meaning all too well.<br/><br/>That is a really subtle piece of acting and word-play that many audiences would never catch, or at least they might understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat. The film is rich with that kind of detail. All of the French and English dialogue is chosen with that same attention to detail and while I can't swear to the German, I would suspect that it shows a similar level of craft.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds opens with the phrase, ""Once Upon a Time... in Nazi-Occupied France."" Personally, this reminds me of the opening of every Asterix book and movie, another comic fantasy in a war-torn occupied France. Like Asterix, Inglorious Basterds is howlingly funny in places, although the film also turns darkly serious.<br/><br/>In its more serious moments, Inglorious Basterds reminds us that the first casualties of war are compassion and the ability to relax, as in almost every elongated sequence of the film, Tarantino finds a new way to build cruel tension to almost unbearable levels.<br/><br/>Tarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous, even inflammable and that its power deserves respect.<br/><br/>If you can see this film as I did in a packed theatre filled with knowledgeable fans who get every joke, that you will see this masterful film the way that it was meant to be seen. If you are not that lucky, all that you will see is a great, great film that delivers a darkly funny punch.Evren Buyruk"
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","7","1","5","1 September 2009"," World War II, Tarantino style!
","Inglorious Bastards is being marketed incorrectly. Commercials, trailers, etc. make this seem like it is primarily a Brad Pitt vehicle, featuring a team of eight soldiers hunting Nazis in a two hour action packed film. But Brad Bitt and the Basterds is only what half the film is about, if even that much, and the teammates are the least interesting characters in the film, with the exception of Sgt. Stiglitz. The movie does not even feature that much action, yet Inglorious Basterds is one of the most entertaining and suspenseful movies I've seen all summer. The conversations in this movie generate more suspense than all of the action scenes in Transformers 2 or Terminator Salvation combined. <br/><br/>The opening scene is one of the best Tarantino has ever done; we are introduced to the film's main antagonist, Col. Hans Landa, played brilliantly by Christoph Waltz. Nicknamed ""The Jew Hunter,"" Landa is on a mission to locate Jews that are in hiding throughout France. He is very polite to the owner of a Milk Farm, but from the moment he starts talking, we know something is not quite right. His politeness makes our hearts race, to the point where we are almost relieved when he finally cuts to the chase! Waltz plays one of the most memorable and unique villains in recent years and deserves a place near the top of Tarantino's bad guys, right up there with David Carradine. He can be a gentleman, or the most impolite man you have ever met. He can be serious or hilarious. Intelligent, or insane. There is a lot of talk about an Oscar nomination, and he deserves it. <br/><br/>The other half of Basterds revolves around a Jewish girl who escaped Col. Landa, Shosanna Dreyfuss, and opened a small movie theater. Shosanna, played by Melanie Laurent, is another intriguing character. She is given the opportunity to eliminate the leadership of the Third Reich when a German war hero convinces Joseph Goebbels to show his latest propaganda film in her theater. She concocts a scheme to burn down the theater with highly flammable nitrate film in the middle of the movie, just before showing her own personal message to the Nazis. The Bastards just happen to get the same idea, only they want to use dynamite, and that is how the two stories coincide in the third act. With the help of German Actress and spy Diane Kruger, they learn that Hitler himself will be attending the premiere. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt is hilarious as Aldo Rayne, and the majority of the cast is top notch, particularly the European cast members. The dialog is the most entertaining part of the film, not unusual for Tarantino. If I had to pick another star in this film besides Waltz, Melanie Laurent would be it. She is the character we really root for the most, given her personal history with the Nazis. Tarantino had many influences besides the 1978 original Italian film with the same name. It is sort of a mix between a World War II film and a Spaghetti Western, featuring great Ennio Morricone music, which naturally invites comparisons to Kill Bill. The violence is not as severe as I thought it would be, but the acts of violence committed by the Basterds are undoubtedly war crimes, from the scalping of German soldiers to the killing of civilians. I am not sure if Tarantino intended this, but it raises the question of whether war crimes can be justified even if they are used to defeat an ""evil empire."" This question does not damper the fun, however. Basterds is one fun ride, through and through."
"movieguysla","9","2","17","5 October 2009"," Triumph of the Will
","Quentin Tarantino DARES you to like his new movie, to the point where he'll trash any conventions he sets up, kill off any characters he wants, stray from a storyline for an eternity, cross-pollinate genres and styles and basically give the audience the 'ol ""Fuck you, I'm making MY movie, come along if you want, but I don't need you."" Such searing macho bravado is annoying in the hands of other directors (this was pretty much Michael Bay's stance making ""Transformers 2"" – ""If I want a hot chick Transformer, I'm gonna do it, sensibility be damned!""). With Tarantino, I was IN early on, and stayed hooked for 153 minutes.<br/><br/>Tarantino mastered a dialogue style in ""Pulp Fiction"" that I find brilliant – the anticipation of violence. When Jules and Vincent start talking about European food, the dialogue is fun and engaging. When they stop and get guns out of the trunk, there's obviously something more at work here then guys driving, talking about Le Big Mac. What they're doing is, however, delayed and delayed for more banter. They talk about T.V. pilots, they talk about foot massages, they even get to the door where SOMETHING is going to go down, and they pause even further to ""get into character"". The scene is fascinating, with whip-smart, funny dialogue, and it all feeds into the violent payoff like a symphony reaching its grand chorale. I say this is a Tarantino style, 'cause he's certainly employed it again (""Kill Bill, Vol. 2"" – The Bride meets Bill and they talk and talk before ever getting down to business, but the talk is electric and soaked in history).<br/><br/>""Death Proof"" had A LOT of talk, and, to me, wasn't as effective because there was nothing underneath the chatter. It was just that, a lot of chatter for the sake of being hip. In ""Inglourious Basterds"", Tarantino's new World War II epic, the film opens with a ""Once Upon a Time in the West""-style meeting between a Nazi officer known as The Jew Hunter and a French man accused of hiding Jews in his home. Right away, the gamesmanship displayed was masterful, both actors steadily at odds, and the sociable dialogue masking the tension and intention of its characters. To see Tarantino deliver an opening scene so solid, controlled and authoritative meant the ""glourious"" return of a director who I thought was delving into the excess pool a bit too often in his last few projects.<br/><br/>But then, just when you get a handle on the movie, he'll do whatever he feels like doing again. ""How's about DIRK DIGGLER-esquire on-screen text to introduce one of the characters? You like Sam Jackson? I got him, for no reason other than we're friends. Has Mike Myers been in too many lousy movies lately? I'LL CHANGE THAT."" The balls on this guy! And yet, it's conveyed with such audacity, it ends up wildly entertaining.<br/><br/>Think about the title of the movie: ""Inglourious Basterds"", a group of Nazi-hunters in WWII. But we don't meet them until after that brilliant opening scene. Then we get a taste of the Basterds, but QT has other stories to tell. We meet an escapee from the opening scene who now owns a movie theater, and the Nazi soldier who is smitten with her. We meet a British soldier who gets new orders to be part of Operation Kino, and we get to see the operation in full effect (and ANOTHER scene where we wait and wait for the violence as layer after layer of the tavern-goers gets peeled away in deliberate conversation). So, if we're going to be sidetracked from Nazi scalp-hunting, Tarantino better bring the goods. This is where the film keeps our attention because the stories intertwine, and a true, can-they-pull-it-off narrative kicks in with an infusion of patented Tarantino energy.<br/><br/>Universally thought to steal the show in this movie is Christoph Waltz as Colonel Landa, The Jew Hunter. He does a great job of playing Nazi soldier as charmer, counterpunching with smarts. He is the real bastard. Tarantino gives him an interesting shift in paradigm near the end of the film that is bold and intriguing, but not wholly satisfying. Brad Pitt is good as Aldo Raine, leader of the Basterds, often eliciting laughs from his no-nonsense approach to killing NAH-ZIS. Diane Kruger is good in the complicated role of actress Bridget von Hammersmark, an otherwise high-class citizen who finds herself ingrained in dangerous war scenarios. She also has the line of the movie: ""Do you Americans speak any other language than English?"" Much has been made of the end of ""Inglourious Basterds"", and I have to admit it was a little surprising, but not entirely out of the realm of possibility, given the way the film built to the end. Stops were pulled out, extremes were explored, so why not just GO FOR IT? But even in a pulse-pounding finale, there's pause to be had watching Jews enact revenge on Nazis in a blood-soaked fashion similar to that employed by the Reich itself. The climax is a blazing, cinematic extravaganza, and when layered with thought-provoking imagery and haunting ghosts dancing in the smoky light of a movie projector, the result stays with you longer than a baseball bat to the head."

Hans Landa who his character is very intelligent and has a ""personal connection"" with one of our heroes(do not worry this is not a spoiler it shows it in the very first minutes of the film).The film also has great dialogue(a Tarantino trademark) which is important to the movie because there are long scenes with people sitting and talking,something that could be boring but because of the amazing dialogue and Tarantino's masterful directing those scenes are full of suspense.<br/><br/>Some people complain that the film's ending is not historically accurate but this is not a problem because this film is not suppose to be historically accurate and it takes place in Tarantino's fantasy version of history.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, this film is very fun,well acted,has a few great,lovable and complex characters,amazing dialogue and an intriguing story full of twists.You really have to see it(but you probably have seen a hundred times)"

"tareknabulsi","1","1","6","15 April 2013"," What did I just watch?
","This movie makes a complete joke out of the second world war as Tarantino insults all of those involved in or affected by it. The witty acting and historical inaccuracy serve as a mockery to this important piece of history. On another note, it creates major stigma towards German soldiers and civilians during the war, as the main characters express their hatred through mass killings and unjust punishment. Of course Hitler was an evil man, but the movie forgets about the internal conflicts within Germany, labeling every Nazi soldier as an evil devil-like animal. The film also puts too much sympathy on the Jews. Obviously what the Germans in the war did was wrong, but Tarantino has the Jews do the same things back to German prisoners of war in the film to send the message that it is okay for Jews to unleash this exact form of anger previously seen in Nazis. This over exemplified sympathy and endorsement of Jews really gives this film a questionable meaning and is certainly not healthy in light of religious and cultural conflict as seen in other parts of the world such as the Middle East."

","There are many many arguments to criticize a Tantantino film. First of all he uses unnecessary violent, his stories are poor, he doesn't concern about morality and his films never teach anything and many other things to count.However there is a great many people who believe QT is one of the best movie makers of all times. This cannot be explained with logical arguments, it's pure art, it's love and love is beyond logic.When i saw this film i said ""this is cinema"". seventh art that means all arts in one. Acting, painting, music, dancing. You can never read Inglorious basterd or kill bill in a book or watch in theater. You will never learn something about morality or ethics in it. The script is never protagonist in a QT film. The majority of movies is based on ""what happens"". Here you see ""how something is looking"" when it happens. Cinema its purest form.

"gigan-92","8","1","6","3 January 2011"," Enjoyable Tarantino Production
","B- <br/><br/>A lot of reviews have stated to hate this movie, a lot calling it Tarantino's worst film ever made. However, there are still more than enough positive reviews coming in to put this film surprisingly high on the top 250 list of ALL TIME LIST. Does it deserve such recognition? No, not really. This doesn't even come close to the greatness of some of his classic movies; I personally found ""Jackie Brown"", often considered the weakest installment in Tarantino's line of films, to be much better handled. Why so? Let me say that for starters this story had no real point. I thought it started off okay, I myself particularity enjoying the Bastards and their Nazi-killing sessions. However, it delved into the dream like fantasy of a ten year old boy who'd fantasized far too much about WWII films by the climax. Hitler, all the top Nazi brass, in one room? It just seemed too over-the-top, to the point of ridiculousness. The story has its saving graces though, such as the exhilarating opening scene. It is here we meet Christopher Waltz's character, who is one of Tarantino's most sadistic yet cunning antagonists yet. I enjoyed him throughout the movie. And Dennis Menochet as the farmer was one of the best, if not short-lived, performances in the whole film. Brad Pitt was pretty damn enjoyable as Lt. Aldo Raine. Who didn't enjoy watching him carve swastikas into Nazis' foreheads? Also pretty enjoyable was Melanie Laurnet as Shosanna, and I loved Michael Fassbender in the film.<br/><br/>Two characters I was disappointed with were Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger) and Sgt. Donny Donowitz, a.k.a. the ""Bear Jew"" (Eli Roth). They were the most underdeveloped characters in the movie, the only real notion you get from their on-screen presence being that they apparently hate Nazis. AS for the treatment of the Nazis in the film, people have been particular about the assumption that the Jews in the film appear without any humanity while the Nazis appear as honorable men. I wouldn't call the Jewish characters inhuman, just horrendously bland, and as for the Nazis I rather like that scene with the bat. It's rather obvious that'd you'd almost feel pity for the Nazi officer as he's honorably clubbed to death, and simply typecasting them as mindless maniacs would be, how to say, cliché? <br/><br/>One other thing that irked me was the climax of the relationship between Shosanna and Fredrick Zoller. After all her hatred of the Nazis which was perfectly justified, it seems highly unlikely that'd she suddenly feel pity for one of them.<br/><br/>However, Tarnantino still manages to deliver some very thrilling and tension filled scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat. So over all I enjoyed this film, but this is definitely not the best story he's written and therefore not his best film yet as many have called it."

The Germans in general and the German SS in particular killed millions of Jews, one by one, one after another, or massively in their camps. And when the Jewish local band at Auschwitz was playing some music for some inner celebration of some kind, thousands were arriving on the trains and were disembarked on the platform, sorted out for shower and then cremated. The crematorium never stopped burning.<br/><br/>That in France, in the Resistance or dropped into the country with parachutes generally, there were units, some made up of Jews from all nations around the world, is no surprise, is no invention. That these units were vengeful and tried to make some Germans they could catch, SS or not, pay for their evil actions in suffering and torturing and all kinds of other immoral, unwarlike and despicable actions is no invention. There were at least some and maybe many.<br/><br/>To make a film on that very subject is not uninteresting. But does it have any interest for the knowledge of history, for the education of the younger generations, for the moral and ethical good of everyone? Certainly not. It is a film about war seen as an act of vengeance, and the film itself is an act of vengeance against people who are not there to say a word about it. Vengeance is not a good attitude. Try to imagine what the Vietnamese should say, show and even do against the French or the Americans because of the Indochina or Vietnam wars if they were vengeful.<br/><br/>But then why did Tarantino, a good film maker, and Brad Pitt, a good actor, decided to do that film? To follow Tom Cruise in that territory, but Tom Cruise was at least dealing with a real episode of the war. Maybe to deal with some ""respectable"" horror, horror that can be said ethical or ethically motivated? As for that the film is dealing with so many clichés about the sexual and brutal phantasms of standard human beings that it becomes a parade of events about which we seem to think, one after the other, how gory is it going to be? Gory, exciting, gross, disgusting? We seem to be appealed by the entry ""horror"" of a thesaurus. I find this film regrettable and very badly inspired.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the film is well done, contains a good dose of suspense or thrilling expectations, and the editing as much as the shooting (what a word in this context) are realistic enough to make us believe we are in Paris or we are in history. But it takes more than good technique to make a good film. Since the dominant point of view in the film is Jewish, I consider that this vengeful attitude in Jews is absolutely unacceptable, and I can tell you those I know and who have done something during the war, did not do that kind of horror which was more on the side of the SS for one and some resistance groups that were not exactly controlled by presentable networks: there were some freelance groups that only took advantage of the situation to loot, raid and just satisfy their death instinct on anyone who could be in their way, far from it only the Germans.<br/><br/>Now we are 65 years after the end of this butchery we could start in the film industry to get to a more historical perspective and not to some crazy idea that Hitler could have been burnt up with all its accomplices in a Paris local cinema by a Jewish female survivor, a black man, and the non-coordinated help of two American Jews. Or maybe it is just plain Jewish black humor. But the subject is badly chosen and that kind of humor has to be self-deprecating. It is not. Those Jewish barbarians want to appear as war heroes not as pathetic puppets in the hands of some illuminated blood-crazed scalp-obsessed guru.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"
"jwchoo1","9","1","6","28 December 2010"," Inglorious Basterds : Beat Down Reviews
","I was extremely excited about watching this film as it was by Quentin Tarantino . And everyone knows that you cannot go wrong with a Tarantino flick. So without further ado let's get on with the review.<br/><br/>Firstly the main story is about a group of Jewish American Nazi hunters, known as the Basterds . Led by Lieutenant Aldo Rein(Brad Pitt) along with his band of ruthless men played by (Eli Roth) and (Til Schweiger) just to name a few. But the story expands far beyond that. There are quite a few subplots to the movie just take the opening sequence for example. <br/><br/>The writing is one of the many things in this movie that keeps it both fun and suspenseful . The German and French dialogue makes this film a must watch. Added with it the superb directing of Quentin Tarantino . His choice of not using music at some of the scenes was a wise choice. It just adds to the atmosphere. Let's face it . Quentin's vision of the war is the best we have seen yet.<br/><br/>Acting wise, it is brilliant especially Christoph Waltz's as he manages to speak German French and English all while managing to act casual and keeping cool as an evil Nazi. And Brad Pitt's acting is also good but sometimes over the top, but in a good way. Although I must say that Eli Roth was a bit under used. I mean we get to see him for quite a while but he does not have much to say<br/><br/>So all I can say is that Quentin's vision is both daring and terrific at the same time. It's sad that he did not win any awards . Although kudos to Christoph Waltz for excellent performance . His golden globe and academy awards were undoubtebly just and deserving . As his character manages to amaze us and anger us at the same time.<br/><br/>All in all I have to admit that this film is Quentin's best yet. Come to think of it Quentin Tarantino does not make any bad movies at all."
"Gin-ster","9","1","6","12 December 2010"," Strange and unusual, very ""non-Hollywood""
","I approached this movie with some anxiety; I am not receptive to ""making light"" of the Nazis and, being Jewish, was concerned about comments I'd heard that the ""revenge"" angle is offensive to Jews. To make a very long story short, it is so beyond the realm of ""realism"" that it is hard to take offense. Initially, when the Jewish brigade was carrying out acts of sadism, my thought wasn't so much ""Jews didn't do that"" as ""Americans didn't do that"" because the troop in question was ultimately representing America. <br/><br/>But as time went on, I realized, the whole story is so outlandish that there is no point in picking out inconsistencies with reality. I admit that *****SPOILER HERE**********I started to wonder how it would have a major climax, as it seemed headed in that direction, that seemed to rest on major German leadership, including Hitler all being killed at the same time, as I figured it would not go against reality to that extreme. I made a mental comparison with HBO's Boardwalk Empire, where you know that the real life figures (Al Capone, Meyer Lansky, etc.) won't be killed along the way but the fictional ones are ""fair game."") But, noooooo ....(SPOILER) .... the theater fire did take place as planned and Nazi leadership, including Hitler, was immolated. Now, having said that the whole story is fabricated and clearly preposterous, I have to add that it was riveting, highly creative, had carefully written and performed dialogue, and was deadly serious where it needed to be (SPOILER: the French milkman's shedding a tear when he was forced to give up Jewish people hiding under his floor boards to save his own family brought in the right amount of poignancy) and Mel Brooks-like in other spots. Somehow or other, it all ""works"" despite being bizarre and preposterous. I highly recommend it."

","""Sounds Good ?"" You bet ! Great performances by Brad, Waltz, Diane and others.<br/><br/>This movie qualifies as an art masterpiece in so many ways.<br/><br/>See how Tarantino weaves the American Indian sub text thru out the movie. (For those who do not know it the American Indian saved hundreds of thousands of Allied lives during WII. See for example Wind Talkers). Anyway, Alpo Raine ( as in rain dance) is part American Indian, the card game in the bar scene references a great Apache chief, again when Shosanna dons make up like war paint. Even the premise of the Basterds is about guerrilla warfare practiced by some American Indian tribes against the ""Americans"" stealing their land. Finally, Hans complains at the end of the movie but we had deal, we had a deal. A reference to virtually every treaty the American government broke with the Indians. Lets not forget the genocide of the American Indian perpetuated by the Americans.<br/><br/>The Jewish revenge scene in the theater echos the gas ovens of the concentration camps. Also, recall the beginning of the movie begins with the Nazis machine gunning DOWN at the Jewish girls. The movie ends with the Jewish basterds machine gunning DOWN at the Nazis. The Nazis tattooed jews in the concentration camps, so the basterds brand the Nazis.<br/><br/>A case may be made that this is an antiwar movie. For example - the war hero leaves the theater in disgust at the premier of ""Nations Pride"" ! Tarantino masterly crafts the opening scene - the tension is palpable. Similarly the basement bar scene and others.<br/><br/>There is also humor, especially revolving around the Italian language imitations. Alpo alleges his Italian is the best of the bunch. Cee, Cee, Bonjorno, Bonjorno with a hillbilly/NY accent..<br/><br/>It's a movie you can watch and rewatch."

","Quinten Tarantino has made one of his best. Inglorious Basterds is movie that has it all.Where to start?

In the meantime, a Jewish survivor Shosana Dreyfus is planning her revenge on the Nazis that killed her family. While the Basterds and Dreyfus plan to kill the nazi elite, S.S. colonel Hans Landa trys to unfold their plans before they go in motion.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic! Christolph Waltz portrays Hans Landa and won an Oscar for his amazing performance. Other great acting performances include Brad Pitt, Diane Kruger, and even Hostel director Eli Roth.

","It's a totally unhinged fantasy on the events of World War II, a provocative film that uses the serious theme of war to tell the story by means of exploitation cinema to the point that I can imagine some people really insulted by it. ""Inglorious Basterds"" isn't a one-sided affair though as it can't be classified as a pure action B-movie. It's a more complicated flick than that blending ideological cinema with a suspenseful thriller mostly relying on the clever dialogue. There are moments in the movie when these overall three different aspects don't gel together very well. Largely inconsistent tone of the movie is more than redeemed by gripping, cringe-inducing sequences often involving Christoph Waltz in a star-making turn as contradiction-driven Col. Hans Landa. He even steals the show from supremely over-the-top Brad Pitt. It's a shame that masterly executed single scenes don't result in an equally superb movie. ""Inglorious Basterds"" is a bit unsure of what it wants to be, but in the end you can't help enjoying this ridiculous hybrid of a movie."

","All I can say is that Tarentino clearly has such fun making movies that it's hard not to love his wit, passion and love for movie history. While the film drags just a bit toward the end in its pulse, there is great film-making, film homages and great performances to make this one of the great movies of 2009.<br/><br/>Christoph Waltz is justifiably awarded for his supporting role here, but there is another astonishing supporting performance by Melanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus, a teenager left orphaned by the Nazis. Her performance is both courageous and at times, heartbreaking. There was one moment of her's where my heart leaped up to my throat. I am an actor, myself, and know how skillful and honest that moment was to conjure. <br/><br/>I'm glad to see the great response from reviewers here.

","Writer/director Quentin Tarantino re-imagines history by matching against each other two amiable psychopaths--one an American Army officer and the other an Austrian Nazi--in a customary Tarantino bloodbath, with nothing less than the outcome of World War II at stake.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt, as the American, ironically has never been quite so appealing, endearing, charismatic, loose, or just plain funny. And character actor Christoph Waltz, as the Nazi, is a real revelation: His performance received not only the Oscar but also most of 2009's other supporting actor awards.<br/><br/>Filled with stylish anachronisms, references to other films, and arch homages to period propaganda, 'Inglourious Basterds,' like the other films in the Tarantino lexicon, is not for all tastes, and most definitely is not recommended for the timid or the squeamish. Additionally, the middle expository interlude bogs down the remarkable momentum of the opening segments but in comparison adds the necessary zing to the climactic hour.<br/><br/>All-in-all, 'Inglourious Basterds' is much, much better than pulp fiction has any right to be. By the end of the picture the knowing viewer might very well be not only laughing at the ultra-violence, but also ravening for more.<br/><br/>Which is probably the point."
"fwomp","9","1","6","19 January 2010"," ""Gnat-see"" Hunters Versus Jew Hunter
","INGLORIOUS BASTERDS is brilliantly scripted, has two of the best acting jobs all year, and is purely Tarantino. If you've seen any of the KILL BILL series or THE GRINDHOUSE films, you'll know to expect a bit of blood and brutality. This is, however, Tarantino's first dip into alternate history, and he does a great job at it. However I do think he toned down the bloodshed a tad. Perhaps he's becoming more aware of it, or perhaps he just didn't feel the film warranted it. Whatever the reason, it balanced out nicely ...compared to his other films which tended to go overboard on the crimson.<br/><br/>The alternate history involves three unique perspectives: Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) aka The Jew Hunter. Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt, BURN AFTER READING). And Shosanna (Melanie Laurent). All three of these perspectives are taken to extremes (no surprise, again, considering we're talking about a Tarantino movie) during WW II in which we see a persecuted Jew get her just dessert by killing Hitler in her own version of ""The Final Solution."" We get to see Lt. Aldo Raine (Pitt) gather a group of ruthless ""Gnat-see"" killers and carve swastikas into their foreheads. And finally we get the cream of the crop, Jew Hunter Colonel Hans Landa (Waltz) who's ability to sniff out hiding Jews have given him his title.<br/><br/>Without Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt in their respective roles, I feel this film wouldn't have been a fraction as good as it was; probably a testament to the casting heads. But specifically to Waltz as Landa, who played the slimy Nazi brutalist only interested in saving his own skin by the end of the war. I think he deserved top billing, not Pitt (although Pitt did his usual extraordinarily great job). Waltz was so key to the entire film that he really held the reins of the story throughout its length. And his range of emotions, from anger to giddiness, was astoundingly disturbing. I loved every second he was on-screen. The fact that the Hollywood Foreign Press gave him a Golden Globe for his supporting role was most appropriate (and I noticed he's garnered praise from many other award ceremonies and, I'm hoping, the Academy Award roster will list him this year).<br/><br/>Brad Pitt as the countryfied, American Nazi-hunter was great. But most of his notable lines are delivered whenever he's on-screen with Waltz. The ending sequence in the woods with Lt. Raines' knife and Col. Landa's ...umm ...life, are wonderfully vicious.<br/><br/>Of course, we cannot leave out French actress Melanie Laurent as the persecuted Shosanna who is forced to watch her family slaughtered by Landa then flee to Paris and blend in with society. Only later does she learn that her new life and career sets her up perfectly to exact revenge on the Nazi party ...and its top leaders; the very top, in fact. She also is forced to fight off the advances of a German soldier whom she finds both endearing and loathsome.<br/><br/>By the end of Inglorious Basterds, you feel like you've been on a wild ride at a theme park, until you realize you've never left your seat. It's a remarkable film that is cast exceptionally well. This one's worth owning for sure."

But I largely refer this to Christophe Woltz. His performance equals what we can see from Javier Bardem in ""No Country for Old Men""-creepy, cold-blooded, cultured killers...Other supporting roles were also wonderful. Brad Pitt made some progress in this film, but still lacked something that a top actor would master...something like the gentleman-ship of Humphrey Bogart, the rebelliousness of James Dean, the versatility of Al Pacino, or the leadership in Marlon Brando...He just lacked something that can differentiate him from the rest of the world, not only the rest of the actors...<br/><br/>The music is outstanding...The original score helped to build the atmosphere and added in a somewhat humorous tone in everything...<br/><br/>The screenplay, the editing and the direction are outstanding...Suspense, love, black humor, thrill, even comic...all of the factors were put in the place where they should be...So, bravo Quentin!

","My fellow peers at work told me and warned me about all the disadvantages in regards to this newest Tarantino flick. I was actually hesitant about purchasing this movie from iTunes. But for the love of Tarantino, I decided to purchase it rather than pay 4 dollars for the rental.<br/><br/>I feel Inglorious Basterds is a little bit overrated, but I still liked it anyway. There are many characters that bounce off each other in each drawn out scenario that there is much to like and dislike about this partially true world war 2 story. The Basterds, which in my opinion were the best part of the movie, don't have enough screen time to the point where I found myself shallow in feelings towards them. I really wanted to root for them the whole way through. Tarantino is a genius when it comes to dialog and script to the point where he can have the actors talk about anything on screen.<br/><br/>The trilingual scenarios were interesting but quickly dragged. There was long drawn out sequences spoken in French, German, and even Italian. When there was anticipation of a violent or climactic episode, there was much hesitance in each chapter. I found myself getting a little too anxious when some key circumstances needed to ""happen"" and Tarantino decides to delay the inevitable over and over again. Each scene seemed about five minutes too long.<br/><br/>Overall, it is an above average movie at best for me. Some may see it otherwise but I still recommend it."

Why? For some reason most Americans, but also youngsters all over the world, are incapable of reading subtitles and still feel the emotion of a scene. That's very sad. In this movie acting, in three different languages, is at it's absolute best and at the end of the film I didn't even notice when they went from French to English to German.<br/><br/>Quentin has, as usual, started a new era of film making.

"zoltangyalog","7","1","6","18 December 2009"," Situation Normal: All Things Reek THC
","Inglourious Basterds is not a World War II movie made by Quentin Tarantino, it rather is a Quentin Tarantino movie taking place in a World War II era that has all the comic book charms in the galaxy to it. Quentin has a masterful understanding of comic book character handling and related dialog development, but, to be honest, he usually has little more than that to offer which is the most fruitful trait of this delivery, yet ends up as its necessary constraint as well, since Quentin satisfies with delivering Ultimate Badassness, failing to notice the moment by which he already told everything worth to be told about it.<br/><br/>Other than that, the movie really has no actual shortcomings. It is crystal-solid, crystal-clear comic book cinema that Quentin made for himself to entertain himself, primarily. I find nothing wrong with that. A beautiful cinematic accomplishment with a narrative language which, as hinted, gives you all worth to be given on the semi-superhero comic book register, almost inviting you, mocking you to realize that there is one and only ONE character in the entire film and that is: The Badass.<br/><br/>Not just a random Badass. The Ultimate Badass. In Quentin Tarantino's mind, dialog has no other narrative channel to flow through than fluffing a character's ego twice as big as her/his verbal challenger succeeded doing that one sentence earlier. Everyone has a set of carefully researched, total brutal oneliners begging to be delivered, in fact, one has the impression that Quentin makes his movies in order to be able to deliver his most recent-, total brutal oneliners.<br/><br/>But, at the end of the day, - and during all that, mind you - you see the exact same character in every one of them, in case you were wondering, it is: The Badass. Tarantino's Badass archetype puts on precisely drawn cartoon masks you call mannerisms, expressing their harshly limited, though entertaining dimensions from the exact same-, yet sadly separate THC private-Universe as the others inhabit. Connections in these separate private Universes are happening through carefully staged acts of fragile causality. In other words: if you are Tarantino and you are about to deliver a five minute ""dialogmonologue"", first you showcase how Badass your character is - because this is the only character you have a concept of, remember? - then, when you managed to draw your Badass character, you will be busy returning to the plot by finally putting two sentences into her/his mouth that has relevance to the plot.<br/><br/>These weed-driven self-declarations of individual awesomeness are of focal importance in this movie, which, ultimately, is a firm Tarantino delivery with elegant plot twists and purified WW2 novelty vibes to it. The movie has no particular, rigorous seriousness, yet, fortunately recognizes that it does not even have any need for those to be a film worth scrutinizing.<br/><br/>http://opiniononion.blogspot.com/"

Through out the movie there are scenes where Blood Gushes out , a typical Tarantino types. There are two best parts of the movie which I like from my side 1. Tarantino's Direction as ever.. 2. Brad Pitt's Dub in the movie which is a very typical heavy accent perfect for a ambush army man.<br/><br/>Christoph Waltz has done a marvelous piece of work throughout the movie seeming a perfect Nazi. Movie heads towards a typical and perfect Assassination of Hitler thus might have been viewed by the Americans and the British. However fiction always plays a little bit part in Tarantino's movies. There are a few flaws I can say but obviously the movie has to bend towards the Hero so as to give it a proper climax. As said there is a scene at the building climax of the movie where Col. Hans Landa (Christopher Waltz) makes a agreement with Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) which utterly sounds something like impossible to do for a officer with such a high rank in the SS, utter stupidity to be perfect. Another one is where a personality like Hitler himself comes up to a Local theatre for a premier which hardly has any security and thus gets Killed in the same, I guess Germans might have had that much of brains to keep the at least Hitler's perimeter secure enough.<br/><br/>In the end I can say movie is a brilliant piece of work overall, lots of scenarios with a excellent piece of direction success to the movie could be handed over to 3 people.Tarantino himself, Christopher waltz & Brad Pitt.

","Written and directed in his usual excellent style, this is Quentin Tarantino back to his best. You get the same dry humour, the clever direction and arty feel, and the typical soundtrack, in that you can tell from the first few bars of every song that this is a Tarantino film. Set in 1944, in Nazi-occupied France, a group of Jewish soldiers with the aim of killing as many Nazis as possible, and in the most gruesome ways, scalping them all, travel around France, creating a disturbing reputation so the Germans come to fear them. The Allies hear of Lt Aldo Raine and the Basterds and recruit them to help in the assassination of high-ranking German officials, including Hitler, at a movie premiere in Paris. Performances are fantastic all round, in particular from Christophe Waltz, playing ""The Jew Hunter,"" Col. Hans Landa. He is extremely menacing and charming all at once. Pitt, Kruger and Laurent also play their parts with gusto. The unusual casting of Mike Myers as General Ed Fenech left me a little flummoxed. It was difficult to detach him from his comedy roles and see him playing a serious, if somewhat camp, role. It had a silly feel to it – is that what Tarantino intended? I expect so! This is a must-see and it is great to see Tarantino producing another piece of cinema history."

I partly blame this on the lengthiness of some parts .. you need to pay close attention to certain scenes or they won't be entertaining; this movie is not for the impatient.... and on the fact that Tarantino chose a grossly distorted way of revealing his plot and his setting. While i agree that some of the scenes are unnecessarily cruel and others appear outright illogical i can still relate to Tarantino's special way of telling this story as has always been the way he's been writing and directing movies. If you go into a Tarantino movie you expect to see lots of black humor and cruelty and quite a few scenes which don't appear to serve any function at first sight.<br/><br/>This movie particularly shows that both sides during the Second World War (and in any other war) were susceptible to evil deeds. And while the Basterds are the only US Americans to be seen in the movie (unless i'm omitting someone here) Tarantino is careful to point out this unit is not directly bound by orders and is a single case arrangement working on its own, which i think is Tarantino's way of trying not to further upset his fellow countrymen by not leaving the decision making in the hands of the higher ups of the US military but rather the hands of a low ranking but nonetheless dangerous US officer; probably equally as dangerous as the worst Nazi war criminals.<br/><br/>Of course we could have had a watered down version of ""The Unpopular Basterds"" but honestly.. who would want that?<br/><br/>Therefore a score of 9/10 <br/><br/>9 out of 10 because of some minor flaws, the biggest of which was putting Volker Michalowski onto the cast list.. Til Schweiger wasn't the best move either but since he doesn't have many lines his appearance didn't really derange the movie"
"matt_wilco","9","1","6","22 October 2009"," Ultra-violent version of 'Allo 'Allo.
","I, like many others, had been waiting in feverish anticipation for Inglourious Basterds ever since I heard the words ""Tarantino"" and ""WW2″ in the same sentence. It's like two foods that really shouldn't go together but you know will be a taste sensation when they are combined. I also had a sneaking suspicion that, being penned by Tarantino, it wasn't quite going to be the Dirty Dozen/men on a mission WW2 films that you'd watch on a Sunday afternoon with your dad.<br/><br/>I also had to temper my excitement once I cast my mind back to Tarantino's most recent efforts. Kill Bill was enjoyable but disappointing and Death Proof, despite having a rollicking car chase to close the film, was as messy as the car crashes it depicts. What would Inglourious Basterds be then, given this recent form? Well, it's his best film since Pulp Fiction for one and two, it's an incredibly original take on what is a heavily overused period setting. It's not without flaws however, so I'll get them out of the way before carrying on.<br/><br/>It's still self indulgent and character development is at a low (except for the hilarious, if a little Rob Brydonesque, Colonel ""Jew Hunter"" Landa played by the outstanding Christoph Waltz), which is surprising given that the entire film plays out as a series of dialogue driven vignettes.<br/><br/>Minor quibbles aside however, this film is fantastic fun. Yes, it's heavy on the talking but who cares when the words being spoken are so brilliant? And the way Tarantino cleverly uses dialogue to build up an agonising sense of tension before erupting into scenes of ultra-violence is more of a roller-coaster than any action piece. Throughout the opening scene you can feel the sense of dread slowly building and it's a theme present throughout. But at no times does the slow-drip of suspense ever get boring or, for that matter, slow. On the contrary, the story, and its numerous strands, speeds along nicely to its explosive culmination.<br/><br/>The usual Tarantino signatures are there: chaptered story telling, anachronistic music and voice overs, his movie universe and film references every five minutes. But it's all welcome.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the actors do they're jobs very well. Brad Pitt is predominantly all funny accents and strained expressions but it works (Italian in a thick Tennessee accent? brilliant), Michael Fassbender has an upper lip stiffer than a corpse that delivers one of the film's best lines and even Diane Kruger is good.<br/><br/>In the final line of the film it is quite clear that Tarantino is speaking through his characters denouncing Inglourious Basterds as his magnum opus. Not quite but it's great to see him back on form."
"Kinetek","8","1","6","25 September 2009"," Tarantino's Finest Hour... So Far
","Finally, after weeks of wanting to see Inglorious Basterds, I finally got to watch it. Firstly, let me say that this is no Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction - it's far too mature a film for that. What you have here is a raw, unadulterated two hour and something cinematic experience that will have you on the edge of your seat for the best part.<br/><br/>Fans of war movies will adore it, fans of Quentin Tarantino's work will revere it. Those who have worked tirelessly over the years to remove this sort of film from cinemas will be despairing - for if it were the 1980's, this would have been cut to ribbons, or perhaps even banned.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it's compelling stuff. The characters have been so well developed and spliced together that suspension of disbelief is almost instant. The first ten, nail biting minutes in which Colonel Hans Landa (aptly nick-named 'The Jew Hunter') carefully interrogates a French dairy farmer, are perhaps among the finest suspenseful cinematic moments I've ever watched - and it's this feeling that something awful is about to happen that permeated the whole film, with no real let up save for the occasional break for some humorous banter - which only serves to lull the viewer into a false sense of security.<br/><br/>The film as a whole has pretty much everything going for it - a great cast, a fantastic soundtrack, an awesome script and direction to die for. The running time literally flies by, and before you know it, you've been thrust out onto the cinema lobby wondering why it didn't last just another hour longer. As mentioned before, this film strikes me as a real coming-of-age for Tarantino, who has often been accused of being something of a two-hit wonder in the past, with the likes of Jackie Brown and Death Proof being disregarded by many critics.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds is not only Tarantino's finest hour to date, it may yet prove to be his masterpiece. It's a much more mature effort from QT than has been seen before - even though there is plenty of darkly humour to be found - and the characters really are so set in stone that it's impossible to get them confused, perfectly played and carved with such finesse that the viewer immediately identifies with at least one from the word go.<br/><br/>A word of warning, however. Basterds is not for the faint of heart - there are scenes of scalping and mutilation that may make some a little queasy - but none of it appears to be gratuitous, in fact on the contrary. Sgt. Donny Donowitz (a.k.a. The Bear Jew) has returned to Germany to wreak revenge on Nazi platoons who happen to cross his path - and revenge happens to manifest itself in the form of a baseball bat. The scenes involving the 'Bear Jew' administering his own special brand of punishment are extremely graphic as is much of the film. But don't let this put you off.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds is a superb cinematic effort, and no expense has been spared. For purists, it may be a little too 'fairytale like' - but for the laymen, it will provide you with more than enough bang for your buck. Make sure you buy enough popcorn - if you can stomach it, that is.<br/><br/>I'm giving this 8.4 out of 10, rounded down (please IMDb, install a more sophisticated scoring system). Go see IB today - fantastic stuff!"
"diac228","8","1","6","22 September 2009"," I do not remember this event happening that way in the history books...
","In all of Hollywood, there is no other man that enjoys cinema as much as Quentin Tarantino. With much subtle glee he writes and directs films that defy any genre that exists, defy any unwritten rules that are made about film-making, and ultimately gives hopes to your typical film geeks that despite your ability to quote and reference obscure movies that nobody else has watched, you too can become a major success story. He is a film dork's hero, and he is most likely well aware of this. With his latest film, Inglorious Basterds (Title loosely taken from an obscure 1978 flick you most likely have not seen), he takes the warfare/Nazism genre and injects it with a major dose of spaghetti western flavor and a stronger dosage of inaccuracy.<br/><br/>The movie itself has been a pet project of Tarantino's for quite some time. The end result is a crazy flick that mixes war drama with heavy western tension, dark comedy, and the same hyper violence that you've come to expect with Tarantino fare. It's a take it or leave it kind of deal; if you could barely tolerate Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, or Death Proof, then Inglorious Basterds will indeed frustrate and perhaps even confuse you. Otherwise, if you are a fan of his work, then you'll appreciate it much more. While Basterds lacks the pop culture fun of Pulp Fiction, the intense action of Kill Bill, or an eternally memorable character (like Bill, Stuntman Mike, Jules, Pai Mei), the film is full of tension, entertaining drama, rich surprises, and an ability to keep you entertained.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds follows a group of Jewish-American soldiers (led by Brad Pitt) hell-bent on annihilating any Nazi they cross paths with, and find themselves with a golden opportunity to end the war once and for all. This opportunity comes with a screening of a German film in a small movie theater led by a Jewish woman (Mélanie Laurent) whom saw her family mercilessly murdered upon the direction of a cruel detective (Christoph Waltz). Several characters and plot twists later, the film ends on a crazy finale that will whether frustrate you or satisfy you to the maximum. Let's just say World War II is not a dramatic event here, it's just a setting.<br/><br/>Tarantino's best strength lies in his writing, not his directing. In his films, he creates many absurd characters that are larger-than-life, and also fills them up with crazy actions, crazier dialogue, and insane conclusions. Almost all his movies have that one epically-written scene (Reservoir: the introduction, Pulp Fiction: final Mexican standoff, Kill Bill: the Superman monologue). In here, the opening sequence sets the mood of the movie right away: tense, crazy, over-the-top, and quite emotionally-driven. The opening scene nearly mirrors that of the first time you see Angel Eyes in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Another fun thing about Tarantino's writing is the amount of film references you see sprinkled throughout the 150-plus minutes. Few writers implement more details than this man. Seeing every movie at a video store definitely has its rewards.<br/><br/>Another amazing thing about Quentin is how he can manage to pull off incredible performances from the most random of people. Mike Myers is one grand example, and the underrated Diane Kruger (National Treasure) is another. Then there's the always-reliable Brad Pitt, and the scene-stealing performance of Christoph Waltz as the unpredictably smart Nazi detective. I hope there's at least one Oscar nomination in acting from this movie otherwise the snub card can be used.<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is, Inglorious Baterds is a violent film that breaks all kinds of rules (film-making and historical). Those that are looking for a historical war film should search elsewhere. Those with weak constitutions and those with a little more sensitivity in their blood should avoid this. The morality of this movie was heavily questioned. But it's a film called Inglorious Basterds, what else did you expect? The line between hero and villain is obscure, heroes are seen without mercy, and even the victims get their chance at revenge. Its a dog-eat-dog movie in which karma doesn't hit all the players in the field. The in-your-face attitude of Tarantino is all-to-present here, as we have over-the-top characters in over-the-top situations for two and a half hours. The movie plays like a roller coaster ride with a very intense yet abrupt ending.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: There isn't as much action here as there was in Kill Bill. There wasn't as much comedy as you would find in Pulp Fiction. And the grittiness of Reservoir Dogs isn't here too. This isn't his best movie, but darn it even a mediocre movie from Tarantino is about the same value as a good summer flick. While the movie may warrant a second viewing to truly capture the madness, Inglorious Basterds is a crazy time in an alternate universe where World War II is hosting a different set of rules, events, and conclusions. By the end of it all, you'll prefer this version over the version the history books have. There is nobody that loves film-making and genre-bending more than Tarantino, and this movie is just the latest example in an interesting career.<br/><br/>Its fun, exciting, very tense (In a Leone kind of way), and has plenty of good music, good surprises, good performances, and plenty of well-directed scenes. In the heap of disappointing 2009 summer movies, we finally have one that rise above mediocrity because of the effort, attention, and care given to the production. Good work Tarantino, you've mind warped another group of moviegoers with your forever-bending genres and forever-mad stories."
"itaste","8","1","6","13 September 2009"," excellent screenplay, acting and direction
","Tarantino watched a lot of movies before becoming a movie maker, this is why he's so capable in writing them. Of course if you expect another Kill Bill this is not you movie, indeed Inglorious Basterds is a great movie, well written, well acted and well directed. It takes his strenght from the dialogs, probably after kill Bill lots of people were expecting for more action but ""action"" it's not so difficult to make in present time, what is really rare to find in a movie is a good screenplay with good dialogs and Inglorious basterds is a little jewel for this. Only the final is too fanciful and out of the history lines but it is a forgivable ""poetic license"". Christoph waltz is superb, in my opinion he deserve the accademy as best actor."
"Special-K88","Null","1","6","13 September 2009"," a wild ride; film shows just how much fun a director can have
","That wacky Tarantino is at it again, this time making his mark in the historical genre by putting a campy spin on the events escalating behind the lines of WWII. Set in 1940s, Nazi-occupied France, the film spotlights a group of rugged, rebellious Jewish-American militia whose mission is to use anarchy to turn the tide of the war by killing and scalping as many Nazis as they can. Their efforts eventually lead to a golden opportunity to end the war once and for all...but that's only the beginning. Director Tarantino's thumbprint is all over this film and he's in fine form using a historical backdrop to create his own warped, hysterically over-the-top universe that's full of screwy dialogue, zany, larger-than-life characters, and audacious subject matter that can make you laugh and squirm in equal doses. Pitt is in rare form as the brash leader, intentionally bordering on caricature, and French actress Laurent is an alluring femme fatale, meanwhile Austrian actor Waltz is nothing short of spectacular as a wily, hawkeyed Nazi colonel. It goes on much longer than it needs to, and it's clearly not an accurate representation of history, but boy is it entertaining. ***½"
"machngunjoe","7","1","6","14 September 2009"," Classic QT - what did you expect?
","Certainly, this was no Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>But this was classic QT.<br/><br/>What do I mean? Very long drawn out dialog usually about a movie, with a mild climax filled with dark humor.<br/><br/>Not historically accurate, which I like.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was extremely funny as were many of the characters. Also the movie, about 50-60% was subtitled, which I also liked. People in the theater were falling asleep left and right, so its not filled with action as one might think.<br/><br/>Think Deathproof, with all the talking leading up to some huge climax, weather you thought the climax was worth all the wait is up to you. If you're a QT fan, then it probably was worth the wait, but after reading the negative comments, I can understand why people thought this was overrated.<br/><br/>Anyway I liked it, but not for 10$ at the theater, more for rent or for a cheaper ticket price. Certainly not QT's best work, I would say I would rank it behind Kill Bill with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs being number one and two."
"TheXeroXone","8","1","6","4 September 2009"," Interesting Nazi Exploitation
","The plot of the film is basically summed up by its premise. A bunch of Jews go and kill a bunch of Nazis set to Tarantino's unique style. There is lots of action, a little sex, decent conversation and interaction, interesting choices for music... and in this case.. history is thrown right out the window for the sake of telling a more interesting story.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there were some noticeable flaws in the film that make it less memorable than other Tarantno films. For one, the characters aren't nearly as memorable, nor are they near as quotable. Second, the typography seemed a little disjointed and could have been planned a little better. Third, and only in one scene, the music was a little off for the scene. The lyrics made sense, but something about the music was not nearly as appropriate and it lacked a certain cohesion that we have come to expect from Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>Ultimately this film appears to be yet another attempt by Tarantino to recapture and make mainstream the grindhouse epic and I must admit that a true return to this kind of cinema with modern resources appeals to me and despite the aforementioned flaws, this film is really enjoyable.<br/><br/>8/10"
"claudemercure","8","1","6","1 September 2009"," lesser QT is still great entertainment
","In Nazi-occupied France, a group of soldiers make it their mission to kill Nazis. Meanwhile, a Jewish-French cinema owner concocts a plan of revenge.<br/><br/>Writer-director Quentin Tarantino sticks to his usual combo of gore, humour, clever dialogue, and grace notes of actual human emotion. But he departs from it by employing a linear narrative structure. Also, for the first time, he doesn't seem to be paying homage to a particular film genre. And though the dialogue stands out, it's considerably less showy than it's been in his previous films. The speeches don't sound so much like speeches.<br/><br/>There are many scenes of expertly orchestrated tension, and the movie is juicy entertainment (thanks in part to Christoph Waltz's nuanced, committed performance as the main villain). But in the end, there is a sense that this was much ado about very little, which means the movie will probably have low repeatability value. All of Tarantino's movies are cartoonish on some level, but in this case his touch may have been too light to give Basterds longevity."
"jjwhit","Null","1","6","31 August 2009"," Unmissable but not unblemished
","The film machine-guns at you scenes of unbearable tension, cruelty, hilarity, warmth and surrealism in a way only a Tarantino film truly can. It is an unadulterated QT experience and a step into the surreal comic book mind of a film maker who has always been the most original and yet derivative. He remains important.<br/><br/>Like the film, some of the performances are wildly inconsistent. The epitome of this is Brad Pitt- a shaky, incomprehensibly dodgy start (including an erratic accent), followed by some memorably delivered blackly comic moments later when he seems to have got into character. The characters Col. Landa and Hiccox are the most watchable, a testament to the actors, and they are assisted by the writing. The scene where Hiccox is meeting von Hammersmark in a bar is beaten only by Landa's strudel, pipe and milk moments.<br/><br/>The flaws are not insignificant (Pitt, fetishised scalping), but the impressive moments are too many. The soundtrack's impeccable, and the sound effects are typically the perfect accompaniment to Tarantino's delicious close-ups. Never before has a strudel been so scrutinised."
"sandeepamar","8","1","6","29 August 2009"," Brilliance, pace and style
","Entertaining feature films is sign of Tarantino, and this is it. But the brilliance comes from christoph waltz, what amazing actor, the De Nero looks, and equal to the task, deserves the best actor at Cannes, and I guess should get an Oscar nomination. <br/><br/>The movie's pace, cinematography, sets, different languages in different scenes and overall screenplay is very good. To start off, I felt the movie had a bit of drag with Jew and German hatred for each other gets cruel and the part with ""bear jew"" and ""jew hunter"". But Tarantino was fast to bring changes as chapters went along, and was able to close the loop well in the end. Again the vindication part in question, is settled by different objectives to kill Hitler in the movie, which made it brilliant in my opinion. <br/><br/>My favorite scene is where I guess Tarantino is a magician, when the British officer gets caught with a ""not so great"" German accent, and then he starts speaking English, super stylish, hats off to Tarantino, style is his middle name.<br/><br/>The only little not so favorable thing about the movie was German hair getting scalped and carving the swastika sign, and all. I somehow feel Hate begets hate, what Hitler did was atrocious, that doesn't mean he should be followed back."
"troylcook-1","6","1","6","28 August 2009"," Wasn't that great...
","I've been looking forward to this flick for awhile, as I'm a pretty big Tarantino fan. It was a little boring, a little too long, a little too much dialogue, and a little too slow. The action scenes were pretty cool and intense, and well praised after the 30 minutes of slow and rather elementary dialogue. Quentin's good, but he's never going to beat Pulp Fiction. Bottom line. I rated this a 6 out of 10. I would say to just wait for it to come out on DVD and save your money. My critique could be a bit bias because I am definitely not a Brad Pitt fan. I think he's annoying as all hell and I really don't think he's that great of an actor. I really feel he was mis-casted for this role. Better luck next time QT!"

","With Inglourious Basterds Quentin Tarantino gives us a very different movie from what we normally expect. Mainly cuz it's not a crime movie. This isn't a non linear plot or collection of short stories and it's not a hodge podge of pop culture references among gangsters and assassins. All that being said though it is very much a Tarantino movie.<br/><br/>I won't get into a long drawn out explanation of that...you'll know what I mean when you see it...in spite of the subject matter and lack of some of his trademarks his stamp is all over WWII and you gotta wonder what took him so long to climb into that time machine. For any naysayers out there who have grown tired of his regular convictions this flick should prove you wrong.<br/><br/>In truth I don't have a lot to say about the movie because it was quite different from what I was expecting I don't wanna give anything away. It's more of a war thriller than an action yarn as the ads would suggest with a clever interwoven plot that includes several international characters all masterfully portrayed by their actors. It also a has a tremendous sense of fun and humor so even the most graphic or disturbing themes of the material won't dampen your mood. Good movie...I liked it."
"jaredmobarak","9","1","6","26 August 2009"," F*ck a duck!  Inglourious Basterds
","Beautifully shot, meticulously orchestrated, and lyrically scripted, it is Tarantino's answer to friend Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood; a statement that says ""anything you can do, I can do better"". Is it better? Now that is a tough question, one that numbers cannot truly define. Is it QT's self-proclaimed masterpiece as he so shamelessly alludes to with the last line of dialogue? I still say Pulp Fiction can't be beat, but this one definitely makes me take pause.<br/><br/>What I love about Tarantino is his fresh, smart, and generally amusing as hell dialogue. Each film he has written bears his voice and excels as a result. However, as each entry to his oeuvre is made, the sequences seem to go longer and longer. It started with Kill Bill and continued to the extreme in Death Proof with overlong passages that, while not petering out towards the end, definitely contain some dead spaces. The 153-minute runtime here doesn't necessarily feel long, yet also doesn't hide itself. Rather than a feeling of boredom, I was anxious to get to the next scene, to see what would result from the previous instance of gravitas. Because this movie is chock full of tense plot points of huge importance. Not one second is wasted, (well, maybe the unnecessarily hokey titlecard to usher a quick film reel history of Hugo Stiglitz and the other Sam Jackson narrated vignette about nitrate film), and the weight of every word and pause is felt. Were scenes drawn out, needing a trim here or there? No. If anything they were just so tightly wound that I couldn't breathe or wait from the anticipation of what was to come. I'm not quite sure if that is praise or criticism because, while taking me out of the film, I don't think I'd have wanted it any other way.<br/><br/>Oddities aside, (the Stiglitz freeze-frame wasn't the only instance of font overkill—did we really need to know the names of the men in the theatre suites?), this is vintage Tarantino pastiche. Right from the start, you aren't quite sure what is going on. Denis Menochet's Perrier LaPadite is shot with stoic strength, deliberately moving as he watches Nazi soldiers approach his house. Reminiscent of a Western standoff, the scene is accompanied by a reworked classical music piece I couldn't quite put my finger on, and the close-ups and camera angles made me look to see when Menochet and Christoph Waltz's Col. Hans Landa would inch their hands close to their gun holsters for a quick draw. Instead, we get a pipe juxtaposition showing the dearth of proximity their two classes are in—French milk farmer and German SS Colonel. The scene sets the stage for what is to come, showing the incident that ultimately leads to the revenge bent at the film's core while also showing us the cucumber cool and sarcastic wit of Waltz's Landa, by far the most interesting creature playing amongst the hyper-reality at hand.<br/><br/>The trailers harp on the Basterds themselves far too much because they are, to me, the least interesting plot thread. Yes, Brad Pitt is fantastic—the coarse Southern accent, the ruggedness complete with horrific neck scar, and the blank-faced comedic timing with his atrocious Italian and matter-of-fact dialogue delivery; and yes, Eli Roth is so over-the-top you can't help but love ""The Bear Jew"" without remorse. His lack of acting skill is quite obvious, but his exuberance and intensity more than make up for it. I also really enjoyed Til Schweiger's Stiglitz, the consummate badass out to kill the bad guys, no matter what side he is on. But, once the initial joy of their brutality and humor dissipates, you realize how thin their role really is. Bounty hunters sent on behalf of the American army, they are out to kill Nazis by maiming, branding, and butchering—mindless fun for sure; intelligent storytelling, not so much. No, that aspect is brought to form by Mélanie Laurent's Shosanna Dreyfus, once a Jewish girl in hiding, now a woman hiding in plain sight with fake name and papers and a movie theatre to run. By sheer coincidence, (dumb luck?), or divine intervention, the people responsible for her family's massacre not only come to her door, but the man who ordered the killing arrives himself, making it all too easy a decision on whether to host a propaganda premiere for ""Nation's Pride"", a filmed reenactment of German hero Fredrick Zoller and the one against three hundred odds he overcame.<br/><br/>The conspiracies that form around this premiere, whether between Shosanna and Daniel Brühl's smitten Zoller or with Diane Kruger's German actress traitor Bridget von Hammersmark and the Basterds, by way of British infiltrator Archie Hicox, a fun turn by Michael Fassbender, are what resonate. Remembering the scene at a French restaurant between Waltz and Laurent still gives me chills as this woman must control her emotions while sitting across from the man that killed her brother, (what a release at its conclusion), as does the tense basement bar rendezvous between Kruger, Fassbender, and a bunch of Germans on leave to celebrate one's newborn son. It all culminates with Chapter Five, an exercise in sheer cinematic brilliance, from its wondrous opening with Laurent set to David Bowie's ""Cat People"", to its mix of drama and laughs from Waltz, to its intensity in Roth's malice, to the massacre of guns, fire, and bodies that ensues. It is poetry in blood and never ceases to amaze, right down to its blatant disregard for historical accuracy. Much like Tarantino's earlier work that took existing films and appropriated that which he needed to tell the messed up stories in his head, Inglourious Basterds starts with the French occupation background of WWII and springboards out to carnage, espionage, and fiction. The man has style and it is all his own. Welcome back QT and hopefully we can expect a new singular vision sooner rather than later."

Evil with death imminent but so polite and courteous.<br/><br/>Like Kill Bill I found myself laughing in places my mind was telling me I shouldn't be laughing. But I wasn't alone with most of the audience laughing.<br/><br/>I felt the middle the movie was a bit slow - but don't wish to give examples and spoilers so you be the judge - but all in all a thoroughly enjoyable movie and one whose ending was an alternative history and given the pure evil of Nazi ideology one could only say ""if only""...<br/><br/>I can also say that this is the first Brad Pitt movie that I have enjoyed.<br/><br/>Because of all the graphic violence, it's not a movie I would take small children to, though."
"LadyLiberty","8","1","6","23 August 2009"," Glorious Inglourious Basterds
","I'm not sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if a love affair with everything Quentin Tarantino isn't something that's obligatory for all movie lovers. Much like David Lynch in decades past though with a style uniquely his own, Tarantino uses extremes, foibles, twisted techniques, and editorial surprises throughout his films. This not only brings his cinematic brilliance to the fore, but takes each film and stamps it both as thoroughly unique and entirely his. That he also writes some of the most interesting and entertaining scripts in the business doesn't hurt his end product, either. Inglourious Basterds is no exception to the Tarantino legacy. In fact, I think it's one of his best.<br/><br/>""Once upon a time in Nazi-occupied France,"" the film opens on the unlikely pastoral scene of a rural dairy farm. The farmer (Denis Menochet) is paid an unwelcome visit by Nazi Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) who is acting in his capacity as the infamous ""Jew hunter."" Landa, who never even momentarily raises his voice or behaves with less than the utmost civility, never-the-less gets his message across.<br/><br/>Not too many years later, the Inglourious Basterds are dropped behind enemy lines. The allied soldiers have an assigned mission that goes well beyond merely killing the enemy. They're charged with instilling fear into the hearts of those who are masters of terror propaganda themselves. That they succeed as well as they do is in no small part thanks to their commanding officer, Lieutenant Aldo Raines (Brad Pitt). Under Raines' orders, his men scalp, scar, and scare Nazis everywhere they go, and word of the Basterds reaches as far as the ear of Hitler himself.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a French cinema owner named Emmanuel (Mélanie Laurent) has in reasons of her own to hate the Nazis. She and her partner Marcel (Jacky Ido), concoct a devious plan of their own to terrorize a few Nazis.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a famous German actress named Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) is involved intrigue up to her pretty neck as she travels to Paris for a movie premiere.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, German war hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl) blithely enjoys the adulation of his peers and those in command alike, not realizing for a moment that his very fame will end up landing him in the midst of a plot that will likely result in infamy as well.<br/><br/>Meanwhile...<br/><br/>There's more. A lot more. As you may recall from Tarantino's stunning Pulp Fiction, he's a master of the simultaneous telling of multiple stories that somehow all resolve into a whole in the end. While Inglourious Basterds doesn't offer quite the disparity between scenes you'll recall from Pulp Fiction, it does have any number of plot twists and turns involving any number of different people and locales. But it's a tribute both to Tarantino's brilliant screenplay and the editing of the film that it's far more confusing to write about than it is to watch.<br/><br/>Although it wouldn't seem so at first blush, Brad Pitt is perfectly cast as Aldo Raine. Another surprise? He's very funny. The rest of the cast is also more than up to its task. There's truly not a bad or even a mediocre performance in the bunch. But the standout here has got to be Christoph Waltz. His Colonel Landa is a horror, and yet he manages it all with an urbane, almost sympathetic mien. He's impossible not to fear and loathe, but his performance is nothing short of stellar.<br/><br/>While I could go into depth praising Tarantino's direction as well, suffice it to say he's up to his usual extraordinarily high standards. His creativity and genius for film is evident in virtually every frame. One Tarantino hallmark, of course, is his bent for violence, and Inglourious Basterds doesn't disappoint. There's more than a little graphically shed blood in more than a few graphically depicted ways. But somehow he has the gift of displaying such things in full and gut-wrenching color even as he does so in a cinematically beautiful way. I'm not sure how he does it, but I know it when I see it and it's spectacular. Spice that up still more with some totally inappropriate (but very funny) humor, and you've got Tarantino at the top of his game.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Only Quentin Tarantino would have the nerve to use World War II as a backdrop, but then change such well known history to suit his story. And frankly, only Quentin Tarantino could get away with it. His Inglourious Basterds won't be for everybody. But for everyone who appreciates movies for what they can be at their best, Inglourious Basterds is at the top of the heap of those that should not be missed.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: Inglourious Basterds is rated R for ""strong graphic violence, language and brief sexuality."" I cannot stress enough that the rating board isn't kidding where the first three words are concerned. This is not a family film, nor is it remotely suitable for those younger than 16 or 17. In fact, those of any age who are sensitive to lots of blood on screen should go see something else instead.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL NOTES: There are some truly fascinating stories behind the writing and filming of Inglourious Basterds not least of which are those involving the ""movie within the movie.""

","Inglourious Basterds (R, 2:33) — Other: Miscellaneous, biggie, original<br/><br/>If you've seen the trailers for this movie, you probably already know it stars Brad Pitt as WW2 US Army Lt. Aldo Raine and is about ""killin' Nattsies"". So why is it showing up in a review of SF&F flix? Because it's a member of that odd tribe, the alternative history, which has one foot in sci-fi, another foot in fantasy, and a 3rd foot trying to shake free of the ball-and-chain of mimetic fiction. Such critters are often like a puzzle, where the trick is to figure out where and why the fictional version diverged from real life. (See, for example, pretty much anything by Harry Turtledove.) Basterds, however, is from Quentin Tarantino, so the word ""often"" (and also ""usual"", ""ordinary"", ""conventional"", ""humdrum"", ""expected"", etc.) can be dispensed with before you ever set foot in the theater.<br/><br/>To cut straight to the bottom line, it's another frakkin' masterpiece written and directed by the most original and audacious filmmaker working today.<br/><br/>Does it follow a conventional structure? What did I just say about ""conventional"" ANYTHING? No, of course it doesn't. For starters, nominal hero Pitt appears in less than half the movie. Most of the other actors in what is very much an ensemble performance you probably haven't heard of at all. They are all uniformly excellent.<br/><br/>You might be expecting (""expecting""? ah ah ah!) a violent action movie, and there are indeed some graphically grisly bits, not for the squeamish, but much of the film's generous 2:33 running time is devoted to verbal cat-and-mouse games between really intelligent, articulate, resourceful, insightful, amoral, and deadly serious adversaries.<br/><br/>To vastly oversimplify the plot, the 3rd Reich's #2 guy, Dr. Josef Goebbels, fancies himself not only a patron of all the arts but also an artist in his own right, and he has written, produced, and directed a film called Nation's Pride, which stars Wehrmacht war hero Pvt. Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl) as himself, depicting his solo sniper defense of a lone bell tower against an attacking force of a thousand Yankees. Since it's shortly after D-Day, Goebbels thinks it would buck up morale and be a smashing propaganda coup if the film were premiered in occupied Paris, in a gala attended by many members of the German high command.<br/><br/>Raine's ""inglourious basterds"", a behind-enemy-lines guerrilla band composed almost entirely of Allied Jews with a taste for exemplary (and hopefully demoralizing) cruelty, determine to take advantage of this concentration of enemy brass to do some serious killin'. The same thot occurs to cinema owner ""Emmanuelle Mimeux"" (Melanie Laurent), who is secretly Shoshanna Dreyfus, sole survivor of the massacre of her Jewish family. That massacre was conducted by Col. Hans Landa (a brilliant performance by Cristoph Waltz), who never really got a good look at Shoshanna and so doesn't recognize her when he shows up to scope out her theater for security purposes. You can bet she knows who HE is, tho.<br/><br/>The 2 separate anti-Nazi plots run afoul of each other. Nothing works out as planned. For anybody. More than that I will not say. You must see it for yourself. No, really, you must."

","Like most people, if I am still thinking a lot about a movie I saw the day before, it was well worth the money to see it. This is the case with Inglourious Basterds. If I had seen the Chicago Tribune review beforehand (The Dirty Dozen meets The Good The Bad and The Ugly) I may have been over-amped to see this film, because those are two of my favorites. This movie draws from both of those films, but is hard to compare with them. QT is not for everyone; especially if you like to get comfortable with pace or story line or have most of the story loops closed. But despite the fact that his story telling is non-traditional, nobody stages a scene or writes dialogue quite like him. I liked this film."

"p-m-boyer","Null","1","6","22 August 2009"," Exceeds Expectations and Gives a New Light
","For years upon years, Quentin Tarintino has mentioned Inglorious Basterds in dozens of interviews while promoting/filming other films. By Quentin, the film was hyped to be the greatest thing ever to be made, and that eventually, after he'd improved in writing and directing, he'd put I.B. in the 'main priority' section of his schedule. However, after mixed reviews for the Kill Bill films, combine with disappointment by nearly EVERYONE for Death Proof, fans of Quentin began to doubt if I.B. would ever be made, and if so - would it ever be able to resurrect the Tarintino feel that so many fans had began to accept as dead? Michael Madsen, Simon Pegg, Eddie Murphy, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Adam Sandler as well as many others, had each been casted at one point in time during pre-production. However, quite randomly, Quentin cleared the entire cast list and sent precise offers to specific people, resulting in the final cast (with a few exceptions). When news broke that Brad Pitt and Eli Roth (a man who is notoriously hated by film fans for his awful job as director for films like Hostel) would play the two leading Basterds, uproar shot through the internet like thunder through the fog.<br/><br/>The thing which even the most optimistic fans couldn't see, is exactly what Quentin could. The feel of the film, the style, the formula, each character's unique style/development and even the methods used by Quentin to ""change"" the viewer are all executed in Basterd-like fashion. Meaning, it's paced well, it's bad ass, applied well to the content, more than entertaining but more importantly, the climax/end of the film makes viewers THINK. In their lies the reason as to why Inglorious Basterds is such an extraordinary film that even the skeptics need to get out and see - Maybe it's because the film industry has become more intelligent and arrogant in the past two decades, but for whatever reason(s), realism is an element that is unspoken listed as a necessary thing. Sometimes though, like in I.B; a film can prove that, if executed WELL, taking a handful of American-Bad-Boys and putting them in a situation where they can kill Hitler, well, it's not a bad idea at all. Oddly enough, I actually found myself to be clapping as Eli Roth's character Donnie 'The Jew Bear' commit heinous crimes against history, and I could help but feel a bit like when I was a kid, watching John Wayne for the first time - The Duke sure was great, but the edited version where he DOESN'T die? I still like it more than the original.<br/><br/>In short, I.B. is a film so unique in style, feel and content that attempting to compare it to any other film would be a crime so bad that punishment by the Basterds themselves might be the only justified answer. Tarintino can rest happily knowing that nearly his entire fan base, plus millions of Q-Virgins across the globe, have fallen in love with I.B. along with each of it's great characters.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, I believe that this film is by far the best film released in 2009. I'd go as far as to actually say, I enjoyed it more than any of Tarintino's other films - which says a lot on it's own considering I own everything released.<br/><br/>10 out of 10, two thumbs up, a giant smile on my face, recommendation to the Academy Awards, crossed fingers for a prequel!"

"cinemaniac_x","10","1","7","28 December 2010"," Tarantino is an expert at balancing humor and violence
","Inglourious Basterds begins with the words ""Once upon a time,"" and, like any classic fairy tale, it features a daring quest (assassinate Adolf Hitler and other Nazis), brave heroes (the eponymous Basterds), lovely dames (a German actress and a Jewish cinema proprietress who help with the quest), and a scheming villain (the deliciously evil SS officer Hans Landa). Unlike most fairy tales, though, the film has buckets of blood and very explicit violence, it changes World War II history completely, and it does not have a happy ending for all its characters—in fact, the ending is rather muddled and rushed. If you can abide these aspects of Inglourious Basterds, then you are in for a very entertaining two and a half hours.<br/><br/>The film is divided into five chapters and consists of two separate story lines, making for a jumpy narrative that is at times hard to follow. One storyline is about the Inglourious Basterds, a group of Jewish and other anti-Nazi soldiers led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). Their goal is to avenge themselves against the Nazis because ""Nazi ain't got no humanity,"" though they themselves are also performing unspeakable acts of violence, such as scalping one hundred Nazis each and carving swastikas into the foreheads of the Nazis they allow to escape. Though the film is named for them, the Basterds serve mainly to unnecessarily complicate the plot and provide shock value and comic relief.<br/><br/>The second, more developed, and more serious storyline follows Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), a young Jewish woman who, years before, had escaped the murder of her family at the hands of Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). She has changed her name and is now living in Paris as the proprietress of a movie theater. Like the Basterds, she also wants revenge against the Nazis, and she sees an opportunity when her movie theater is chosen to be the venue of the premiere of a Nazi propaganda film.<br/><br/>Both Shosanna and the Basterds plot to assassinate Hitler and many high-ranking Nazis who will be in attendance at the premiere. Neither party knows about the other, which really defeats the purpose of having two story lines. The suspense builds up to the extreme but never quite amounts to anything.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, though, Inglourious Basterds stands out as a very unique and enjoyable film, with doses of great comedy and action and a screenplay that took over a decade for director Quentin Tarantino to write. One of the film's strongest points is the acting, especially that of Christoph Waltz, who plays the villain with so much natural talent and ease that it is hard not to like him (is an Oscar nomination for Waltz on the way?). Most of the dialogue is not in English, so viewers must read captions when characters speak French, German, or Italian (the Italian sequence is, by the way, perhaps the most hilarious scene in the entire movie). The use of multiple languages, the large cast of characters, the complexity of the plot, and the quick pace warrant a second viewing of the film. Watch it once, or watch it twice, but this deranged fairy tale is worth your time."
"sullivkeith","8","1","7","24 October 2010"," Enjoyed it, Bradd pit was a bit of a put off.
","This movie was fantastic. Christoph Waltz was the real treat here, he made me want to keep watching and it was just mind blowing how awesome he was (and is). Brad Pitt on the other hand, well lets just say I was not impressed. He had a few 'awesome moments' but I found his overall performance to be very poor. The accent, the freaking mustache. The opening scene with Waltz in the house with the milk was absolutely amazing and I found myself watching just that scene a few more times because I liked it so much.<br/><br/>Overall I don't think this film deserves the semblance it got.

"VivaDeadPonies","9","1","7","25 July 2010"," About time
","It's taken me a while to get around to watching this movie - even though I have owned to on DVD for many months. Partly because a lot of bad reviews left me thinking it would be a so-so movie (I try not to get influenced by reviews - usually looking at them after I've seen the thing)despite liking his earlier films.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did. It was the most entertaining film I have seen for years and certainly his best since Pulp Fiction - and possible his best. A lot of reviews criticise this for being derivative. Well, have you been watching cinema lately - there's hardly a scrap of originality anywhere. I cannot understand how anyone who loves cinema cannot be entertained by QT's clearly self-conscious but hugely affectionate plundering. All directors do it - but few with such transparent pleasure.<br/><br/>The tension in some of the conversational scenes was masterful and every word counted - those that think every single word in film should be a 'plot mover' should keep their crappy expositional dialogue firmly in the knuckle-headed one-dimensional blockbusters. Even the enjoyable but forgettable Dark Knight was just a kids films masquerading as an adult film - whereas this is entirely and refreshingly adult.<br/><br/>Yes - the film is full of absurd conceits - but again brilliantly interwoven ones, drenched with pathos and irony, as well as sheer for-the-hell-of-it fun. Those who say the Nazi's come out well in this movie are barking mad. They come across - as they should - as generally dull but psychopathic administrators. The banality and horror of their occupation comes across well - and the ending is the most gratuitously uplifting ending I have seen for some time (like Deathproof was - which I also enjoyed). You can't find more deserving bad guys in movies - and rightly so.<br/><br/>Love life. Love the brutal absurdity of it all. A great, brilliantly constructed, written, acted, filmed movie."
"jkysharma","8","1","7","4 July 2010"," Once Upon A Time ...
","There is homage and there is indulgence. With Pulp Fiction, Tarantino probably ran out of material that stands on its own. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction share this quality (How much of what I've to call restraint, in hindsight, owes its existence to Roger Avary?). From Jackie Brown onwards, the 'did you get that? that's supposed to be his tribute to ...' aspect of his films have been given a free reign. From the amount of polarization that's evident in what movie-goers have to say on the web, it's possible to discern a kind of weariness in the writings of both parties - the ones that do 'get' it and the others who don't. A begrudging acknowledgment of the divide. Personally speaking, no matter what the levels of indulgence, Tarantino makes movies that entertain, eventually. There are long scenes of seemingly rambling dialogue (dotingly dubbed verbal diarrhoea by some) but their denouement, I nearly always find satisfying. The kind of satisfaction it gives can border upon the crass more often than not but it works. That brings me to something along the lines of the suspension-of-disbelief concept. How much indulgence would I permit Tarantino in return for the kind of entertainment he offers? This is the question that ranks above all else when it comes to his films since Jackie Brown. In this regard, Jackie Brown paid homage to a kind of cinema almost totally unfamiliar to me and I found the entertaining parts - Robert De Niro in a unique performance (even by his standards) and the mall sequence - not sufficient in exchange for the indulgence. Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 had tributes that I'm not readily familiar with but enjoyable in their exposition. It had enough of his brilliance with dialogue and action to keep me glued and coming back for repeat views of segments. Death Proof proved to be another unfair exchange - two riveting sequences amidst endlessly droll dialogue and B-movie homage. Inglourious Basterds is just the right mix of campy dialogue, intrigue, character elements, action and homage, tribute, indulgence.<br/><br/>There's a difference here. Unlike other Tarantino films where every pillar is integral but dispensable, Inglourious Basterds owes a lot to Christoph Waltz's Hans Landa. It wouldn't be the same without his prying, inquisitive manner with a prim and proper veneer to mask a deep- rooted sense of inferiority. In other words, Tarantino films don't have one performance that hogs the limelight but this one does. Akin to David Carradine in Kill Bill, you're left wondering why such actors haven't been in the spotlight. It's only the chapter technique that prevents Waltz from completely stealing the show from the rest of the cast which is just as competent as he is - Mélanie Laurent, Til Schweiger (what he achieves with the most minimal of screen time!), Diane Kruger (whose German roots help), Eli Roth, Daniel Brühl and Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>By choosing the setting and the narrative that he has, Tarantino has allowed himself maximum leeway in terms of the homage quotient. World War II saw propagandist cinema sore to great heights with Dr Goebbels (unique among the sycophants in history) and Leni Reifenstahl (Berlin Olympics). And since the setting involves France (""we respect our directors""), it isn't outrageous to have a plot revolve around cinema itself. This has a cheesy yet old worldly heroic appeal to it - if you want a testament to the power of cinema, this would be it.<br/><br/>Lastly, the subtitles (large parts of the film are in German and French with a smattering of the Italian) suggest inventiveness. Deliberate insertions like 'somebody over there's wife' and 'impertinentness' hint at the possibility of greater enjoyment if one is familiar with these three languages."
"wwefreakjon","10","1","7","23 May 2010"," It's Killin' Nazis Time
","Remember those Old Italian spaghetti westerns. You have your villain causing some problems and then you have your anti-hero come in and clean things up. Well, try picturing that in a World War 2 setting where your baddie is an officer in the SS nicknamed the Jew Hunter and your hero is a Jewish American soldier who has dropped into Nazi Occupied France with a band of other Jewish American soldiers on a mission to kill every Nazi he can find before the invasion of Normandy Begins.<br/><br/>Now to be honest, this sounds like one of two things. Either some small European director wants to create a 'nazisploitation' film or Quentin Tarantino is back with him most absurd idea yet. If you guessed the second you were right. QT is back with a spaghetti western set in Nazi Occupied France. <br/><br/>Our villain the Jew Hunter is played with skill by Christoph Waltz. He opens the film by going to a small dairy farming family living in south France. He begins interviewing the father of the family about the Jewish dairy farmers who lived in the area before the occupation. Through witty and intimidating conversation he gets the father to give up the location (under the floorboards) of the family Dreyfus who he has been protecting.<br/><br/>Next we meet our heroes. The Basterds, as they're known, are led by Brad Pit as Lt. Aldo 'the Apache' Raines into France dressed as civilians. With the gang we have: Sgt Donny Donowitz (Eli Roth), known by German soldiers as the 'Bear Jew' and is famous for beating Nazi soldiers heads in with a baseball bat; Sgt Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), famous for killing 13 SS officers before being captured; Cpl. Wilhelm Wicki (Gedeon Burkhard), an Austrian who escaped after his family was killed and joined the Basterds to get some good old fashioned revenge. When we first see them in France they have just ambushed a German platoon and have begun scalping the dead (each Basterd owes Raines 100 Nazi scalps) when the survivors are brought out. The German sergeant is brought forward and is offered survival by Raines for the position of another platoon. After refusing, Donny comes out and beats his head in (on screen) with a baseball bat. Then the youngest, and now only, survivor is brought forward and gives the location up. Right when he thinks he'll be allowed to escape unscathed he is asked what he will do with his uniform after the war. He says that he'll burn it. Wrong answer kid. The Basterds like their Nazi's in uniform. So to make sure that he will always be recognized as a Nazi, Aldo paints a little picture on his head with his knife.<br/><br/>As you can guess because it is a Tarantino film there has to be at least one other plot line involved. The third in Inglourious is about the left over member of the Dreyfus family, Shoshanna, and what she does after her family is massacred by Landa. Two years after the massacre, Shoshanna is operating a cinema in Paris under the name Emmanuelle Mimieux. One day, a hero German sniper walks by the cinema and feels an attraction for her. He attempts to ask her out but is stopped at every step. Eventually he talks to the Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbles and asks him to change the premier of his new film to Shoshanna's cinema. Those are the three stories and with typical Tarantino style, he intertwines them beautifully. It all comes to a close at the movie premier. <br/><br/>The greatest thing about this film is the dialogue. First off, it is in most of the languages spoken at the time (French, German, Italian) not just English. This does mean that a lot of the dialogue is seen in subtitles. Despite this, the actors say their lines with conviction and the dialogue keeps you enticed with its playfulness. It is filled with a lot of the beautiful pointless dialogue that Tarantino films are famous for. <br/><br/>The thing that I have avoided mentioning until this point is the violence of the film. This film is very very violent. Violent and graphic. It is not for children (well no QT film is). The scalping I mentioned before is shown right on screen and when Donny beats the Nazi sergeant's head in, it is very graphic and there are no camera tricks used to make it less shocking.<br/><br/>Without a doubt this is one of the best films of 2009. It is funny and suspenseful, charming and insane. It has all the elements that you'd expect from a QT film and easily the greatest villain in the history of his movies. It is no surprise that Waltz won every acting award he was nominated for. He was everything I mentioned above and more. He was ruthless and he made the film the best it could be."
"noriu-balandeliu","10","1","7","15 March 2010"," Must be in my top 5 movies ever
","The first time I went to the cinema to watch it with my friends, I was not a huge Tarantino fan. I have seen Pulp Fiction and kinda liked it, but that's it - it was a good film for me, but not at all the best I have seen. I also liked the World War 2 topic - all the books, films, games etc. have always interested me. To be honest, I did not know what to expect.<br/><br/>What I saw just blew my mind. This film gripped me from the first seconds and never let go. The scenes, the characters, the dialogues just changed each other and each one of them seemed even better than the last. I have no words to describe the spectrum and intensity of emotions that overwhelmed me - fear, tension, laughter, and joy mixed into a strange feeling of awe and bittersweet joy, which haunted me for days afterwards and which still haunts me whenever I watch clips from the film, listen to its soundtrack or read about it. <br/><br/>Personally, I have always thought that a good plot and a message (or a moral) is needed for the film to really be good. Don't get me wrong, the plot is good and unpredictable, but it is very simple and could be told in about an hour, to be honest. The message? Well, there is none, at least I did not get it. But the other things in the film make up for that, and give you the best cinema experience ever. <br/><br/>The filming. As usual for Tarantino, the film is stunningly aesthetic and beautiful. The colours, the faces, expressions get stuck in your brain. The characters. Should the film have been called as it is? I don't know. The basterds themselves only play a secondary part in the film. However, everyone does. It is a wonder how there is no main character in this film. Quite possibly, the man who is the main character is Nazi colonel Hans Landa, whose presence is always felt even if he is not here. The characters are interesting, lovable, and developed to the extent that one feels to know them personally, especially when you understand the context which determines their actions. The jokes are fresh and funny - the guys speaking Italian is just wonderful, as is Landa's reaction to Ms. von Hammersmark's explanation how she hurt her leg. The music is brilliant. I adore when the music fits with what you see, and the most powerful scenes with that is the one with David Bowie's ""Cat People"" and the one with Ennio Morricone's ""Un'amico"". The romance and love stories are in the background, but their power is still very much felt. The farewell kiss of Marcel and Shosanna, sacrificing their love and lives for the good of humanity, is just heart-tearing. The romantic interest of Fredrick Zoller towards Shosanna is fun to watch. When you see Fredrick trying to reach Shosanna, you still don't know she is with Marcel. And you start wondering to yourself, would he succeed if the circumstances were different? <br/><br/>The film lasts for 2 and a half hours. It felt like 15 minutes. I have never felt time fly by so easily as when I was watching this. Sometimes when you watch a good film, you have to put effort into watching it, and only later you get your reward. Here, you are just immersed."

","Is Inglourious Basterds Tarantino's masterpiece? I believe that will always be Pulp Fiction, but this film storms powerfully into second place. There are so many things which make this film simply perfect. Tarantino's script is yet again another masterpiece; witty, complexly structured and made up of a glorious blend of very long scenes and snappy one-liners. The opening 20 minute sequence is not only the finest thing Tarantino has ever written, but possibly one of the best movie openers ever. The appearance of the film is one aspect which seems to have been slightly overlooked. Visually, this film is definitely Tarantino's finest work. Beautiful set and costume design combine with stunning cinematography and art direction to create a film of dazzling colour and spectacle. Finally, the performances in the film are fabulous. Diane Kruger and Melanie Laurent give understated and well timed performances whilst Brad Pitt shines in his role as head of the basterds. However good an actor Brad Pitt is, he is simply acted off the screen by the truly astonishing brilliant of Christoph Waltz. The character of Hans Landa is possibly Tarantino's finest creation and Waltz is receiving hugely deserved acclaim for his tremendous turn. Waltz literally steals every scene and effortless owns the entire film, to the point when the audience is waiting to see him again. Waltz performs with beautiful charm and dashing elegance, camping the action up very subtly to give a hilariously flamboyant edge to his Nazi colonel. However, constantly beneath the charming smile and whimsical movements and body language lies a coldness and evil which never allows us to forget that Landa is a cold blooded and chilling man. His mental torturing of his victims is simply agonising, most notably his jovial 'chat' with a French farmer and his cross examination of Melanie Laurent over a plate of strudel. Overall, Inglourious Basterds is an audacious, ambitious and often hilarious film, certainly Tarantino's visual masterpiece and only barely not matching the standards he set with Pulp Fiction. It is Christoph Waltz who steals the show from everyone - his camply delivered 'bingo!' line will certainly ensure this character is never forgotten."

","Never have I seen a film as exciting and daring like Inglourious Basterds. It's definitely a charming and bitingly funny film. Quentin Tarentino made us a ""spaghetti"" that consists of five chapters and leads us to endless aftertastes. Because this film is historically ridiculous, it can easily impress its audience. Well, just like what Quentin has said, if he had written a script which fits the historical affairs, the film would surely become a ""textbook"" of history. As is known to all, art is out of life but stands higher than the life. What's more, different people have different understandings of history. Through a partly made-up story(or fairy tale), Quentin has something to tell us, maybe his common-sense view of history. Also, what is more impressive in this film or in other Q-films is that Quentin endowed the film with his own characteristics. We can say that he shot the film for himself. The film is a huge production involving advanced shooting skills and so many film stars, and all these serve for Quentin's ""psycholagny"". One of the characters well worth mentioning is Hans Landa, the German SS officer, which is brilliantly portrayed by Christopher Waltz. After watching this film, you may not be able to resist the temptation of kicking him, embracing him and kissing him. Another character I adore is Shoshanna, which is wonderfully cast by Melanie Laurent. She is pure, kind and a little elegant. Her tragic life struck my heart with lingering sound. In a word, this is a must-see.BRAVO!!"
"raphmetz","9","1","7","28 January 2010"," unofficial REVIEW complete analysis
","In 1944 Nazi-occupied France, the story of young Jewish woman Shosanna (Laurent), whose family has been slaughtered by SS colonel Hans Landa (Waltz), crosses over the story of the ""Basterds"", a squad of American Jewish soldiers led by lieutenant Aldo Raine (Pitt) who are dispatched into France for a ""killing Nazis"" business.<br/><br/>It has to be said, the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds is one of the single greatest cinematic achievements of recent times. The evil Hans Landa interrogates a French farmer, and we witness him toying with his prey in a tense twenty minute segment. It is a masterclass in how to build up off-screen tension through the use of on-screen dialogue, and the culmination of everything Tarantino has ever brought to the screen. Not only is he such a great writer, he is also bold enough to rewrite the history of the Second World War in his own way and make the audience rejoice at the sight of Nazis being slaughtered. At the heart of Inglourious Basterds is some heavy violence and morally ambiguous humour, for Tarantino has twisted history and morality in the name of art and entertainment. On the basis of the latter, the movie is a full-on success. All who love it will be left wondering in the end how they can possibly have enjoyed a movie that plays on the violence and murders of World War II. Some will hate it because it's wrong and disturbing, but there is no denying Quentin Tarantino's talent for entertainment. If you can watch it as nothing else than a piece of artistic fiction, then you will laugh, you'll be thrilled and you will want to see it again as soon as it's over. Inglourious Basterds is reminiscent of Pulp Fiction in that the more you see it the more you are able to appreciate the quality of the writing and performances. It is also to the director's credit that despite constantly switching languages between English, French and German, the story unfolds smoothly and never loses its momentum.<br/><br/>The obvious highlight of the film is Christoph Waltz's performance as the delightfully evil Nazi colonel, this brilliant turn very likely to make him Oscar front runner in the best supporting actor category. Brad Pitt is also a great piece of casting, his hilarious accent making the character of Aldo Raine all the more enjoyable. Melanie Laurent, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassbender and Daniel Bruhl mainly make up what is surely one of the strongest ensemble casts of the year. Inglourious Basterds is accomplished film-making, mastered by Quentin Tarantino at his best and in total control. It might not oust Pulp Fiction from top spot in the QT registry, but it's certainly in the top two.<br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/><br/>In addition to being some of master Tarantino's most accomplished work to date, Inglourious Basterds is also blessed with a faultless ensemble cast and a blistering performance by Christoph Waltz. Overall, it's brilliant entertainment and a great technical achievement. It's certainly passed the moral line, but we love it. Why? That's probably the master's trick."

","Inglorious Basterds contains much of QT's traits; Long stretched out scenes, details, so on and so forth. It's classic Tarentino. I've read many of the reviews saying this is his worst piece yet and I question what the thought process is behind that. The movie does drag on, yes, but it's QT. . . What did you think you were signing up for when you watched this movie? <br/><br/>Overall this movie, to me at least, is a masterpiece. It's got its funny moments from Brad Pitt, who plays his role as Aldo Raine brilliantly. It's got its suspense from Christoph Waltz who keeps you on the edge of your seat when ever he talks. His delivery is smooth and witty and always packs a punch.<br/><br/>Although it is not exactly what experts would call ,""Historically Accurate"", it's a nice ""What if?"" kinda story. What if the war had actually ended this way? What if Hitler never offed himself after years of war? It keeps you thinking.<br/><br/>Definitely worth the watch if you have the time, patience, and mind set. If not you might as well cross all QT movies off your list. 10/10 for sure."

","This movie is a bit tough to watch at times with regard to the realistic nature of the violence. Being a person whose childhood was somewhat impacted by the evil Nazi history, I found Tarantino's rendition of the insanity and cold murderous nature of Nazi actions true to the historical references and quite effective.<br/><br/>I believe if we want to end the war on terrorism, our government should put together a group of ""bears"" that chase down terrorists and build a reputation of fear and respect to those who are bent on acts against our freedom.<br/><br/>Well done Quentin!"
"joshi_3592","10","1","7","19 December 2009"," Among the best films of the decade.
","This is one of the best films I've seen in the past years. And for you who haven't seen this film yet, yes it does change history. Apparently the director Qentin Tarantino didn't think the real WW2 was fancy enough, so he spiced it up for this crazy film.<br/><br/>Being a Tarantine film it is a little nasty at times. But it's hardly he's most violent film so most adult people should get trough this with no problem. Just don't show it to anyone under at least 15 or 16. Still war is violent and this film reflect on that very well. And it's mostly the Nazis that die so you won't feel that bad.<br/><br/>The one unique thing I liked about this movie was it's apparent homage to Sergo Leones ""the man with no name"" trilogy. Especially ""the Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" which happens to be Quentin Tartinos favourite film, as well as one of mine (I recommend them as well by the way). i think Sergio Leone would be proud of this movie. The dramatic music and the long but not boring scenes make this an unique film which finally goes back to classic film values. To be honest I'm a bit tired of todays film tendency to do everything very fast paced. Another film I think you'd like, which also has had an obvious influence on this film is ""the Dirty Dozen"".<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is marvelous. there has been rumours that Christoph Waltz may get an Academy Award for this film, and I really hope he does. The rest of the cast is also great. The character of Brad Pitt is just what I expected for an Tarantino film. brutal but hilarious at the same time. You'll love this film is you like a little black humour.<br/><br/>So in conclusion I can't think of anything to give this movie but a 10/10."
"Mikey_0782","9","1","7","23 November 2009"," Tarantissimo !
","There are a lot of bad comments about this movie, there are as much bad comments in fact as there are good or even excellent comments about it.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie is typically made for the Tarantino-style fans. It's not a war movie, it's not a simple drama, it's not a history movie either, it's a Tarantino movie. And as a Tarantino movie, this clearly deserves a 10. Now I gave 9, because as a Tarantino fan myself, I just hope (and I know) that there's even more and better that could come from this special, yet excellent, director.<br/><br/>Why does everybody compare Tarantino movies to Pulp Fiction ? Pulp Fiction was a damn good movie, but you can't say it's his best. It's just... when I watch a Tarantino movie, whether it's Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Kill Bill, Death Proof or now Inglorious Basterds; not only am I not thinking about or comparing it to any other Tarantino or non-Tarantino movie, but also I am actually not even evaluating the movie itself. He just makes scene-by-scene kind of movies I think. You have to listen to the dialog, admire its simplicity and complexity at the same time. You have to remember it's fiction and that his characters are not based on true stories in their attitudes, but that they are mostly the archetypes of their types. You're following a story, like you would with any other movie, but with Tarantino you're interested in the different characters and how they interact with each other.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds is, I think, just another little story that could have happened during World War 2. The interesting parts are the confrontations between different parties, like the German officer and a French farmer hiding Jews, the secretly disgusted and disguised Jew girl and a German hero or the British secret agent and the Gestapo officer. This movie shows for example how clever the Germans were, how bold the Americans were and even what cowards the French were. It's about an uneven battle and how things could have come down to particular situations.<br/><br/>Now, did I want to see more cruelty towards Nazi's ? Yes. Did I want to see more of Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz ? Yes. French being my mother tongue, did I feel like the French parts could have been better regarding the vocabulary and grammar used ? Yes. (because I have to admit, in Tarantino movies, characters always use typical accents, vocabulary and grammar... and the French scenes sounded a bit like the actors were reading their lines instead of speaking naturally, can't say anything about the German parts as I don't speak it very well) Would I rather have had Marion Cotillard in Shosonna's role than ex-porn-director-now-awful-actress Mélanie Laurent ? Definitely ! But I'm not going to disregard all that's good about the movie, I am definitely going to see this movie again, and more than once."

","I had my doubts, I was expecting a cross between a Tarantino and Valkyrie. A bit of blood, violence, good dialog and strong women mixed in with HISTORICALLY correct happenings and thus ending like the history leaves room for...heroes dead, Hitler surviving and later dying by his own hand. Historically correct..nothing more.<br/><br/>Man, was I surprised. Watch this movie, laugh, love it and feel happy in knowing that SOMEONE (Quentin) dared making a movie like this. It's not another feast of violence, it is also a feast of vengeance, humor, action, great dialog, fantastic acting and again..vengeance. Fiction, of course, but man does it feel nice!"

","Even though Inglorious Basterds is not as good as Pulp Fiction, without a doubt it's one of Tarantino's very best. Quality wise it ranks near the top of his directing filmography. The biggest problem I have with the film is that it sometimes gets bogged down with self-indulgent dialogue that seems to cause the movie to drag. Other than this the movie works well and comes together perfectly in the end. Cristoph Waltz, in a breakout performance, is incredible as ""The Jew Hunter"" Colonel Hans Landa. Brad Pitt is just having fun with his role, not taking it too seriously. An absolutely fantastic effort from Quentin Tarantino. Immensely entertaining and engaging."

","If you like Quentin Tarantino films, you'll love ""Inglourious Basterds""! What makes this movie great is that I had no idea what was going to happen next! There were many scenes that were suspenseful, unpredictable & caught me completely by surprise. The villain Col. Hans Landa (played by Christoph Waltz) is one of the best on-screen villains that I've seen in a long time. He's evil, memorable & intelligent. As for Brad Pitt, even though his name is credited first, he has a very small supporting role in this film.<br/><br/>Like most Quentin Taratino films, there are a bunch of characters with chatty dialogs, but what make this movie unique & ingenious is that the characters are speaking in their native languages. There are more German & French in this movie than English, so expect to read a lot of subtitles.<br/><br/>The movie is directed very much like the ""Kill Bill"" series, but with a historical presentation to the film. It doesn't even pretend to be historically accurate, so that you can just enjoy the movie for what it is; which is another action-packed, highly violent, bloody, comical, & unpredictable film.

"dierregi","8","1","7","29 September 2009"," Fictional basterds take no prisoners
","In our sombre days of politically correct, Nazis are just about the only villains who can still be mistreated and abused on screen - but possibly not for long, considering the controversy around ""Der untergang"", the movie that should make us feel sorry for Hitler. However and luckily for the public Tarantino does not care about feeling sorry for the Nazis and delivers a great dark comedy.<br/><br/>The setting is in occupied France during WWII, but the events are purely fictional – this is NOT a DOCUMENTARY!!!! The Nazis portrayed in the movie are archetypal bad guys, just about as realistic as Freddy of the ""Nightmare"" series, or Aladdin and his magic lamp. Unfortunately, part of the public seems unable to understand this and criticises the movie as if it has any pretense of being based on a true story.<br/><br/>The movie follows two main threads: the activities of the ""basterds"" – a group of American Jews sent to occupied France to kill and scalp Nazis and the revenge of a French Jew girl, who barely escaped from the massacre of her whole family.<br/><br/>I find the movie main fault in this double-thread. Contrary to what one might believe, the ""basterds"" of the title are only secondary characters. It is a shame because each scene featuring them is pure fun, from the memorable speech which introduces the group to the final, mass-destruction scene in the cinema. The part about Shosanna and her revenge is drawn-out, melodramatic and a bit too close to reality to be just pure fun.<br/><br/>As usual with Tarantino, some of the dialogs are a bit too fancy and tend to dilute the tension of some scenes, but I truly appreciated the use of several languages, rather than a monolithic usage of English, as it happens in most American productions. However, I do understand them all, and I can even state that the Italian spoken by the snotty Colonel Landa is not as good as it might sounds.<br/><br/>Contrary to what I feared, Brad Pitt is actually quite good and the character he plays delivers the funniest speeches. Equally good are Fassbender, as a parody of a stiff-upper lip Brit officer and Schweiger, as the completely crazy and OTT Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz. Much was written about Christoph Waltz performance, and even if just about everybody (even those who hated the movie) seems to have liked it, I personally found it overstated and slightly garish. Even if this is a comedy, at times his character appears to be just plain silly. Nonetheless, he is probably Oscar-bound for what is basically a shrill portrayal. Still, the Oscar are not anymore a landmark of professionalism....... Finally, this is the best Tarantino since ""Jackie Brown"" – which was a long time ago. Apparently, QT is not quite worn out, but let us hope he will be able to streamline his movies a bit more in the future, especially by cutting down the verbosity of some characters."
"shark-43","6","1","7","30 August 2009"," Tarantino Meet With Your Editor!
","I enjoyed I.B. - it was fun, exciting - at times moving but it was too long - there were soooo many scenes he could have cut. I have no problem with a film that takes its time, that wants to move slowly but I feel at this point in his career - Tarantino is in love with every single scene that he won't cut it down for anyone - and here Tarantino is a movie freak - he loves these 70's action films, these wild European ""men on a mission"" war films - well they most certainly aren't 2 hours and 32 minutes long! This could have easily been a 2 hour flick - having said that - the acting is tremendous - Waltz has a career making performance as the Nazi officer Landa but my god - Diane Kruger was heart breaking as the German movie star/collaborator and Ms. Laurent as Shosahanna was magnificent as was the young man who played the war hero they made into a star in ""Nation's Pride"". The actor who played LaPadite in the opening scene was amazing - in fact, the weakest performances came from the Inglorious Basterds themselves - Pitt was fine - he was having fun and it worked but Eli Roth should stop acting in films - he is stiff and wooden and I never believe him for a minute. One has to go into this film saying - we are gonna watch Where Eagles Dare meets The Dirty Dozen on acid - and then you have it. An enjoyable mess with some sterling performances."

","This is what happens when a director becomes more powerful than the studio. This movie is easily 45 minutes too long. The 70-80% subtitle reading becomes worklike in a movie 2:40 long.<br/><br/>That said, this is a fantastically acted movie. Most scenes keep you riveted to the screen awaiting (fearing) what is about to happen. I do feel that the subtitles detracted from the greatness of the acting and caused us to miss some of the nuances of their performances. The lead Nazi, Col. Hans, was beyond compare. His role was worth the price of admission. Brad Pitt was funny and understated, and I believe under-utilized.<br/><br/>The action sequences were blunt force trauma to the senses; beautifully simple and graphically accurate. Several of the more brutal scenes will be remembered forever.<br/><br/>Inspite of some other reviewers here, I enjoyed the fantastical rewriting of history.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an excellent movie with great acting and directing. It just needed to be shorter with less sub-titles."
"Cube_TX","9","1","7","23 August 2009"," My favorite Tarantino film since Pulp Fiction
","This was one of the movies I had been very eagerly anticipating. I've been a fan of many Tarantino films and this one looked to me to be something I'd enjoy. My 16-year-old was also pretty excited to see this. We finally got to go today to an earlier showing that was STILL completely packed.<br/><br/>First and foremost, this movie is not for everyone. The tone is very ugly and the entire setting gives the film a disturbing tone. Brad Pitt is great in this film, but believe it or not is totally upstaged by Christoph Waltz. Many will find this film too long and will wonder why Brad Pitt isn't in more scenes. The people who wonder this wouldn't be familiar with Tarantino's films, which always feature backstories to other secondary characters and use many cheesy techniques, effects and music reminiscent of old spaghetti westerns and kung fu movies. Tarantino has also been one to stretch scenes out in order to increase tension and anticipation. Some people would find this tedious, while many others would find it to be brilliant filmwork -- it's up to you to decide.<br/><br/>I found the film to be very intentionally funny, while at the same time keeping with its disturbing tone. I truly hated the villains, which is always a sign of good writing. I WANTED to see these villains get what they deserved. The heroes are not totally clean-cut likable people, nor are they meant to be. None of these people would be a ""role model"" type, but this too is common in all Tarantino films.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd say this movie was better than Kill Bill, but nowhere near Pulp Fiction (though I'm biased in that I thought Pulp Fiction was outright fantastic).<br/><br/>FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHILDREN TO THIS FILM! I was amazed that a couple next to me took their son who could not have been more than 6 or 7. The graphic violence and language alone should be enough to convince you to find someone to take care of your younger kids for the afternoon. We left our 3-year-old with my mom. The kid in the audience kept asking loud and annoying questions too.<br/><br/>I very much recommend this movie and would gladly see it again on DVD or even in the theater again if I have nothing else to see and extra time/money. You will not be disappointed, but be warned that if you are already not a fan of Tarantino or his style you will not like this movie and find it too long with frustrating and tedious scenes."
"C-Younkin","8","1","7","22 August 2009"," Let's go kill some Nat-zee
","The strongest part of Quentin Tarantino's new flick, ""Inglorious Basterds"", is surprisingly the talk. Sure, there is blood aplenty and lots of gruesome looking sights but Tarantino does his best work in the drawn-out, talky scenes (and most of the movie is either in German, Italian, or French subtitles, but you won't seem to mind), usually keeping the audience in rapt attention and never letting-down in terms of payoff.<br/><br/>And there is no one better at shaping Tarantino's dialogue here than Christoph Waltz, playing Col. Landa, a Nazi-hunter during World War 2 promoted by Hitler to round-up French Jews. Waltz creates a villain of outstanding cunning, talking pleasantly and allowing some comfort before he unleashes the underlying snake within. The movie opens on one of many outstandingly well-written scenes, where Landa faces a man suspected of harboring Jews. After his speech comparing Jews to rats, the man is in tears and the audience's skin is crawling. This is how every villain should be introduced.<br/><br/>Other highlights come later. Melanie Laurent is gut-wrenching as Shosanna, a Jew who got away from a slaughter, initiated by Landa, but her family was not so lucky. Years later, she's hiding her Jewish roots while running her own cinema in France. This is a chance for Tarantino to let his love of movies play a big role, referencing facts of 40's German film, like propagandist Joseph Goebbels, making a movie critic one of the heroes, and setting the finale in Shosanna's theater as Goebbels plans on premiering his war hero film there. This puts Shosanna face to face with Landa, in a suspenseful and haunting scene. Shosanna agrees to host the event, but only so she can set the theater, populated with Nazi bigwigs, ablaze.<br/><br/>A second plot hatched involves the Basterds, a group of Nazi killers led by Brad Pitt. They are involved in Operation Keno, the brainchild of a traitorous German actress (Diane Kruger) to blow up the theater. A barroom rendezvous between some Basterds dressed as Nazis and the actress unfolds in fantastic plotting and tension, as the bar is unexpectedly overrun with drunk Nazi's. A German soldier who can tell a phony German accent, a guessing game, and some drinking keeps the suspense simmering and keeps the audience fully involved before Tarantino finally lets it boil over into the violence.<br/><br/>He's brought the idea of the Western standoff to other genres before and does the same thing here. The trumpeting music, stare-downs, and conversations in between moments of scalpings, head-bashings and carvings, throat cuttings, and other gruesome ordeals only serve to make the eventual violence that much more fun. And it all explodes off the screen by the finale, in which flames, tommy guns, double crosses, and all-out mayhem ensues.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt gives one of his best performances, playing all-American Tennessee-boy Aldo Raines. After his opening anti-Nazi rant, he tells every member of the Basterds that he wants 100 Nazi scalps from each of them. Pitt is in great form here, putting on a rough monotone and coming off like a bloodthirsty John Wayne. He also gets some of the best dialogue. ""Were in the killin Nazi business, and business is a-boomin."" Some other notable Basterds are the Bear Jew (Hostel director Eli Roth), a character who likes to beat Nazi to death with a bat, and Stiglitz (Til Scheiger), a German who killed 13 Nazi soldiers and then got recruited by the Basterds. As Raines points out, when it comes to killin Nazi, he has ""great talent."" Tarantino's trademark foot fetish leads to another great scene later on and a David Bowie song nicely sets up the last act. And the movie is funny. Aldo and some of his cronies pretending to be Italian filmmakers (with the southern-accented Aldo massacring the language) is a comic highlight, as is Mike Myers in a cameo as a General.<br/><br/>""Inglorious Basterds"" never lets you forget that Tarantino is a consummate filmmaker, plotting everything with originality and tremendous cool. This is by far one of the best films of the year."

But what is more confusing is the person those who has given 10 out of 10 and I am one of them. Now u says what confusing in that I mean the two generally rating if this movies is 1 or 10 it means there are those who completely rejected that movie or there are people who say it is brilliant. So people are biased and given rating well I think may be because I didn't find anything wrong in that movie and if it doesn't deserve 10 rating I am sure it also doesn't deserve 1 rating too so it should be in between that but I guess happen as I see in user comment.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie a must watch 10 on 10 rating and surely for a true QT fan ."

I don't think I've seen a movie with finer pace and styling. From the costumes to the photographic images sprinkled throughout the film, very polished.<br/><br/>Christoph Waltz STUNNED me with his portrayal of Col Hans Landa, the iciest villain I've ever seen, made easy to appreciate with Tarantino's fine direction. Every moment of his on screen time slowly drips with agonizing, captivating suspense. Despite one's knowledge of history, this movie builds a slow and evolving hope and simultaneous sadness in the viewer that the characters in this film can pull their ultimate goal of bringing down Hitler: I sat through the movie with a sad feeling, knowing how all movies about people who try to overtake Hitler always end. I don't think anyone really believes it's even POSSIBLE to rewrite history until the answer finally comes. It's climax is a wonderful combination of cathartic satisfaction and fantastic entertainment. I couldn't help but laugh and clap out loud by the end. It was kind of an ""Obama winning"" moment for an American audience, but much more stylish.<br/><br/>Other things I personally loved about this film: -The finest placement of a David Bowie song in film that I've ever seen. That scene should have been made into a separate music video. -Hitler getting aggravated, and eventually butchered. Delicious!<br/><br/>This is one I will own and see repeatedly."

","I was really eager to see the movie before it is released.My expectation is fulfilled on the movie.I saw Quentin movies like pulp fiction,reservoir dogs and death proof but this just might be his masterpiece.I might also add the acting of Christoph waltz,where the hell is this actor for the past years,what a genius.Each and every one who acted in this movie was really brilliant.this movie created a new era in the Hollywood films.the first 20 minutes of this film is really brilliant.what a natural acting from Christoph waltz.brad Pitt also acted brilliantly in this movie.the actresses Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger also acted brilliantly. I think this movie deserves at least 3 Oscars. But damn sure Christoph waltz will get it."
"matt-dereno","10","1","8","15 February 2010"," An excellent film with much structural equivalence to Pulp Fiction
","So I finally got a chance to experience Inglourious Basterds. I am a ""Basterd"" for not having giving Basterds director Quentin Tarantino his due diligence on this Website long since the Nazis lost World War II and a million times again in war films done to death. How could anyone inject fresh life into the stale genre of World War II? Tarantino is not just anyone. Tarantino is the most unique and creative director alive today so far as I know from the foxhole of my Western ethnocentric view. His take on World War II is nothing short of a cinematic pulp blitzkrieg. <br/><br/>Basterds opens with a scene on a French farm and the tension is ratcheted up to such a high level it is enough to make you flinch at the most innocuous of physical events. For instance, the slightest eye movements appear ready to trigger the psychotic Nazi Hans Landa to do something evil. All this tension persists despite nothing really happening to set it up all. Is it because we know what we are in store for in a Tarantino flick? Tarantino is a master of building the unspoken tension. He can tap into that distinctive human intuition that simply knows when two people, who otherwise hate each other, are forced to share the most mundane of surface information with each others, as if nothing else mattered. <br/><br/>So it happens in the opening scene. The ""Jew Hunter"" Hans Landa (Waltz) arrives at a farm with his entourage and asks himself into the house of a French farmer, where he soon requests a glass of milk. He interrogates the farmer about a Jewish family reported to be hiding out in the vicinity.<br/><br/>This scene is structurally parallel to the opening scene in Pulp Fiction where Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vince Vega (John Travolta) enter a low-rent drug dealer's apartment and do the whole ""And I will strike down upon thee"" biblical bit. When the farmer is plowing the field and Landa's SS entourage is arriving, it is like a visit from Jules Winnfield and Vince Vega. <br/><br/>The similarities don't end there. In the Pulp Fiction scene, you had the ""Big Kahuna burger"" as a conversation piece on which to mortar the bricks of potential energy and tension. In Basterds, you have a ""glass of milk."" Once in the farm house, the SS officer Landa asks a series of rhetorical questions. To paraphrase: "" This is farm, is it not?"" Yes. ""I assume on this farm you would have milk?"" Yes. ""I'll have some milk."" It is the pulp fiction seen transplanted to Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>There is structural similarity with Tarantino's Kill Bill films too. The ""girl with the green eyes"" is out for revenge. In Kill Bill, it was because ""The girl"" was left for dead and her wedding party was all killed by Bill and his gang. Here it was because Shoshanna's family was wiped out by Landa and his machine gun-wielding soldiers shortly after the glass of milk. <br/><br/>The more I see of Tarantino, the more I am convinced he was heavily influenced by Sergio Leon, or the western ballads of the 60s, when John Wayne was fading and Clint Eastwood was riding into town with his own brand of six-shooters. Here he makes a western out of a Nazi film, which is no more concerned with the real holocaust as the issue of slavery was a concern of Blondie, Tuco and Angel Eyes in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, which took place amidst the backdrop of the American Civil War. <br/><br/>All is not Nazi gold that glitters. There are a few slow points to Basterds. <br/><br/>Somewhere along the middle of the film, Basterds is plodding. The whole cinema angle took a while to set up. I am not totally convinced story-wise that the beginning farm scene (though cool as it was) was a good place to start the film. We learn that the girl Shoshanna was the one survivor of the farm house massacre (e.g. ""The glass of milk"" scene) thus presenting the tie-in to the cinema angle later. However, it is still back-story for the cinema plot. She could have easily explained what happened to her in a sentence or two. But, then we would be deprived of our ""glass of milk.""<br/><br/>The whole climatic scene in the cinema house is really intense. Personally, I think it goes over top. The slaughter of massive groups of humans cannot be seen as something to cheer for in my mind, even if they are Nazis. It makes one think personally if Tarantino is simply lost in his pulp fiction world of entertainment, or I am underestimating him. Perhaps Tarantino deliberately tries to bring out uncomfortable thoughts about revenge by changing the hands on the triggers? In his world, an eye for an eye is something that deserves applause and maybe that reality is our ugly nature.<br/><br/>I had to stew on Basterds for a bit, before I could really think about it whether it was an Ace or a King. In retrospect, seems like an awfully silly question. This film is an Ace."
"lackyluk2001","10","1","8","7 January 2010"," Well this movie made two breakthrough , Major Dieter Hellstrom and glorious Col. Hans Landa!!! Two characters that proofed the last 10 years of movie history
","I'm big fan of all Quentin Tarantino movies, its no doubt to anyone that he is the most clever movie director from the USA, with most movie knowlage of all directors.<br/><br/>Well the movie itself is almost the perfect, if we delete with the gum-eraser the Brad Pitt, and his bunch, in fact not all the bunch but just a part of the bunch, (I would exclude the bunch from the chapter 4 because there was good acting from the bunch side I mean Michael Fassbender as Lt. Archie Hicox who was very good and Gedeon Burkhard as Cpl. Wilhelm Wicki who was solid). <br/><br/>Also I would delete the part with the Hitler character and we would have maybe the best Tarantino movie and maybe one of the greatest movies in the last 60 years.<br/><br/>Now about the perfect part of the movie:<br/><br/>I want to say that ""Chapter One: Once upon a time... In Nazi-Occupied France"" and the ""Chapter Four: Operation Kino"" were two parts of the movie that made the passage to the history, they are so brilliant, powerful and extremely good, they are so good and mesmerizing that I would be hunted for years because I cant delete the brilliant acting of Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa and August Diehl as Major Dieter Hellstrom from my mind. <br/><br/>Brilliant acting I applaud you!<br/><br/>Col. Hans Landa was great also in the Final Chapter: Revenge of the Giant Face, especially when he spoke with the Brad Pitt and when he shifted the language from the German to Italian than to English and back to German also he used French, brilliant part.<br/><br/>Remarkable movie its the absolute star! We now have the two great actors Christoph Waltz and Dieter Hellstrom."
"Gordon-11","Null","1","8","25 December 2009"," Too slow to be engaging
","This film is about two groups of people trying to sabotage a German Nazi film premiere in Paris.<br/><br/>""Inglourious Basterds"" as an interesting story, but it does not engage me as much as I hoped. The plot is quite thin, there is not much happening in two and a half hours. A lot of time is spent to make a shot atmospheric. As a result, the pacing is very slow, I keep having to wait a long time for something to happen. For example, the initial scene in a farmhouse lasted over 20 minutes, when in fact it could have been over and done with in five minutes. ""Inglourious Basterds"" needs very generous editing to shorten the film, in order to enhance its thrill and suspense. The only reason I think that ""Inglourious Basterds"" managed to be engaging in its current form is because people wanted the good guys to win, and hence stick to their seats to hope their desired finale happen."
"boris-larp","9","1","8","30 October 2009"," Tarantino is back!
","I have to admit I'm a Tarantino fan. Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs. I can't get enough of those titles. So I was really looking forward to Inglourious Basterds. When I read the reviews, I was scared though. Scared that Tarantino had lost it. Nearly every review I read was negative.<br/><br/>Now I have seen the film I think I know why. It isn't like the trailer. If you expect a Hollywood action-packed Nazi-killing two dimensional movie, you won't like it. Of course you have the Basterds and they do kill some Nazi's. But the movie is more about the dialogs and the plot than about the action. It's like 90% story and 10% brainless shooting and scalping. And I think that's right.<br/><br/>So basically: Inglourious Basterds is one heck of a movie with an interesting story and nice action!"
"praswistiadi","9","1","8","20 October 2009"," magnificent film
","Quentin Tarantino is magnificent. I rally love the way he control the pace of a film. From the beginning of the movie. The part in the french house, where Landa (Waltz) interrogating the french family. For the first 2-3 minutes i was eagerly anticipating of something (drama obviously) big. But then, until around 5-10 minutes it became something big. For most other films, i would've already judged it a bad movie. But the changes of pace is really what made Quentin Tarantino is great. <br/><br/>The whole film was excellent, and the whole cast did a really good job in their portrayal of each character.Even brad Pitt, which i thought maybe was unable to play this character, i still think he really did a good job. But one actor which i thought did the best job (and quite frankly surprised me) is Christopher Waltz. Truthfully, i didn't know who he was until the film, but i've seen him in a couple of films, but i just didn't know it was him. Waltz portrayal of Landa is very very good for me, the way he expresses himself, the way he think, the Nazi'ness, the ability of speaking in many languages and still made the character easily to believe. <br/><br/>The best scene for me was when the basterds rendezvous with von hammersmark (diane kruger), the set was made perfect, the acting, the intensity, the comedy, was very nice. The ending of the clip was also very good, especially when hammersmark shot the Nazi private. For me that part of the film, is one of the best clips i have seen in my life.<br/><br/>The low down for me is the ending of the film. I think Hitler's death should be more dramatized, not that easy. The low down is also the ""italian"" jokes, for me is just a little bit corny. It was not that funny and shouldn't be put in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Inglorious Basterds an almost excellent film."
"metal_man1789","10","1","8","14 October 2009"," A Basterd's Work Is Never Done...
","I would like to begin by stating that I do not think Quentin Tarantino is a God, just a really great filmmaker. And what a film Inglourious Basterds is. The most interesting thing about this movie is that the Basterds are probably the least important characters in the film. Instead of focusing on Lt. Aldo and his savage troop of Jewish soldiers, Tarantino instead shines the light on the other players, including the vengeful Shoshanna and the diabolical Nazi Hans Landa. Peppered throughout the film are constant reminders that you are watching a film that exists because of films, and if you love films than you will certainly appreciate this film. It has beautifully filmed action, the most suspenseful opening of any Tarantino flick, and the best excuse to like the bad guy since...well, since The Dark Knight, I suppose. I highly recommend this movie for any true fan of cinema."
"kircharles-1","10","1","8","12 October 2009"," Jewish Revenge
","If you see yourself a party-spoiler pundit and assume that a ""Holocaust Industry"" exists, or if you at best (like me) believe the theme of ""Holocaust"" is just exhausted after a long trail of ""Holocaust and Nazism on-screen"" movies, you may change your mind after watching Tarantino's ""Inglorious Bastards"". On the other hand, if every new Holocaust movie is an wake up call for ""revenge"" for you, you ought to watch this movie. Most people get to know what was the II WW's Nazism and holocaust from the movies. To be sure, these were never reliable sources, however, we owe to these movies our well established twentieth century sensibility to Nazism and holocaust. I am referring here to a long list of movies that helped to shape our symbolic systems. From the Holocaust perspective, when should recall ""Les uns et les autres"" (1981), ""Shophie's Choice"" (1982), ""Schindler's List"" (1993), ""the Pianist"" (2002), ""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"" (2008). If Marc Ellis is right, a simplistic emotional attachment to the Holocaust might have been deleterious to the Jewish life in last decades. A slight shift might be found scattered here and there: ""La vita è bella"" (1997), ""Train de vie"" (1998). These movies attempted to create more fantastic, unreal narratives for sure, while introducing some unlikely lightness to an audience simply addicted to grumpy and dogmatic approaches to the mentioned events. A third block strikes in the sarcasm key in a riskier and non- politically correct way. Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" (1940), Mel Brooks's ""The Producers"" (1968) bring a comic aspect to the portray of Nazism and Hitler. But the possibility of a comic portray to revenge against Nazis is only hinted by Brooks in his ""History of the World: Part I"" (1981). But ""revenge"" is Tarantino's playground (how is it possible to forget ""Kill Bill""?), hence, revenge against Nazis and Tarantino's roads were about to cross at some point. Tarantino delivers the whole enchilada. American Jews revenge their murdered kins and spread terror among German soldiers. Lots of blood. Lots of tension. Lots of irony. The whole Tarantino's formula is there, take it from Kill Bill or Pulp Fiction, you bet it is there. Tarantino dares to change the history books(if you have ever played the ""Return to Castle Wolfenstein"" video-game you know what I mean!). Full revenge is finally achieved. Full destruction. Some compromise, few half-words. Tarantino brings the good gospel of revenge, the video-game on screen, the ultimate irony, the modern Golem. Tension is released, lots of good laughs. You may even admit to yourself that catharsis was finally performed. But I wonder how after appreciating the ""Jewish revenge"" on screen, if the Holocaust narrative will retain the same extraordinary mobilizing power as it has been inculcated in our minds and hearts for the last decades. As with any out-of-control Golem, we should probably ask whether it is possible to indulge ourselves in any reflection on contemporary revenge."
"batispexa","9","1","8","12 October 2009"," wonderful in its own way
","Few films surprise a film snob like me. After seeing the preview, I did not want to watch the movie. I was so wrong! It is not like its preview. This movie is not about killing or shooting or Brad Pitt or anything like that. It is about wonderful camera work, beautiful shots, references to other movies which a movie lover will recognize and soak in the mood that they create, it's about music, it's about perfect pacing, it's about great suspense, but most of all--it's about humor and irony and it proves that for a film to be great , it does not have to be drama. I would not say it is the best movie made. I would not say it is the best comedy I have seen. I would just say that it is the best movie in its genre--what genre? I don't know. Tarantino one."
"lovefist1000","10","1","8","11 October 2009"," I think this might just be his 'masterpiece'.
","I've looked forward to Inglorious for some time, being incredibly scared that Tarantino could let the side down once more after disasters like Death Proof and co. However, after seeing this film, my faith has been totally restored.<br/><br/>The acting, direction, dialogue and basic style of the film carried his signature all-over it, and i wasn't disappointed with any aspect of the movie. A key point that stood out, was Christoph Waltz's performance. This film clearly shows he is a new force to be reckoned with, and will soon be up with the big dogs.<br/><br/>I heavily advise you to watch this movie!"
"RainDogJr","10","1","8","10 October 2009"," ""I must say, damn good stuff, Sir."" and probably Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction
","Roger Ebert, after seeing Inglourious Basterds at the Cannes Film Festival back in this year's May, pointed out the originality of Tarantino's latest picture. He mentioned certain elements of the movie and pointed out that he didn't recall another war movie with those certain elements (""Inglorious Basterds is, I believe, the only war movie with its climactic scene set in a movie theater. The only war movie with a critical last-minute confrontation in the projection booth. The only war movie with a lecture on the fire hazard of nitrate film stock. The only one that pays much attention to the names of such great directors as Pabst and Clouzot""), of course in reference to the fact that Quentin always takes stuff from other movies and has many critics because of that fact (""Quentin Tarantino is sometimes criticized for including too many references, some say whole scenes from other movies in his own work""). Of course I'm not like Ebert (I can't even write pretty well in English! Hell, I'm certainly more like Aldo the Apache, the basterd played by Brad Pitt, pretending to speak Italian!), I have seen few war movies but still I can add that to see Adolf Hitler asking to his men for a bubble gum you will have to check out Inglourious Basterds!<br/><br/>But of course there's more, there's more that make of this a really magnificent fun time at the movies. It's a 153 minutes movie but believe me it feels like a 90 minutes one. It moves fast sometimes (mostly thanks to the basterds, the group of American soldiers that have been terrorizing the Nazis) but it is a movie with ""slow"" scenes but it's a movie without a second of boredom, it's a movie where the ""slow"" scenes grabs you and make time pass as fast as possible. Divided in 5 chapters Tarantino's movie isn't like Enzo G. Castellari's one from 1978 (Quel maledetto treno blindato, better known as The Inglorious Bastards). Here we have a clear mission for everybody in the not-Nazi side and all the pieces will get together in order to have a German night in Paris, a night for the latest piece of Nazi propaganda, a precious chance to end with the war. <br/><br/>I will bring QT's previous picture, his half of Grindhouse Death Proof, to this comment and no I'm not one of those many that hated Death Proof, actually I loved it but definitely there's only one really cool character to remember (well maybe two thanks to the amazing Zoë Bell). Boy, Inglourious Basterds has lots of truly memorable characters, of course the acting is brilliant, of course is just fascinating to watch all of these characters."
"bobb328","10","1","8","10 October 2009"," I liked it better than Pulp Fiction!
","Inglourious Basterds really is Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece. It has the great characters like Reservoir Dogs, quirky dialog similar to Pulp Fiction, fun action/camera angles/soundtrack from Kill Bill. Many people say Pulp Fiction is QT's greatest movie but I didn't see it when it came out, I saw just two months ago, which after all those years of movies stealing little things from it I think I missed out on it's originality. Inglourious Basterds is still very unique and has so much suspense you feel like your heads going to explode. There's such a layered plot you'll want to keep coming back to watch it. Go see it! I highly recommend it, I still can't stop thinking about it."
"velvoofell","10","1","8","29 September 2009"," Playing 'Soldiers'.
","If the males - and some females - may recall, playing at being soldiers as a boy was usually all the more fun because every death on the pretend battlefield was the most spectacular or most gory that kid had ever witnessed and now copied. Every ""Sir! Yes, sir!"" was emulated from the most memorable sources, be they Saturday matinées of war movies on television or misremembered quotes from films our ""grandpappies"" told us. The baddies, including Hitler, Saddam Hussein or whichever popular enemy of the state was in the news at the time would be holed up somewhere a bunch of kids could easily bomb. It didn't have to make sense or be historically accurate - it was kids playing soldiers and all the fun, ponderousness and real-life dram that could be produced as a result.<br/><br/>This is exactly the tone, albeit kitted out in period-accurate clothes and environs, of Tarantino's homage to the 'War' movie. Brad Pitt, the popular kid in school, is the chief ""goodie"" while Christophe Waltz, in the cinematic performance of the year, essays the nerd-brained, psychotic villain. Jewish revenge fantasy? 'B-Movie' script transformed into Oscar fodder at the insistence of the Weinsteins? Very possibly - however my advice is to leave your history degree and copy of 'Sight and Sound' at the door and enjoy Tarantino's cheese-dream vision of WWII."
"RResende","Null","1","8","28 September 2009"," It works, but NOT in the eye
","I gave this film a much greater amount of reflexion than i usually give to any film before commenting on it. Some of the things in it are puzzling, not so much because of the film itself, but to the way people react to it.<br/><br/>This film has qualities, to me Tarantino deserves some credit for some good things, but there are fundamental issues that are important to me and certainly other film goers. The thing is, film is rooted in images, there was a time, if you'll dig 8 decades, in which image was the only thing filmmakers could rely on, in order to give us a story. That's pure visual story telling, that's what Chaplin and Keaton did, Meliés, the incredible Pabst, which Tarantino talks about in this film. This means that the images, either for the way they were sequenced, either for the way they were shown, told us something. Maybe we could sum it up in a few words to anyone who hadn't seen the film, but that wouldn't mean anything, because ""Seeing"" was what it was all about. Remember ""City Lights""' last sequence? The tramp, beaten up, defeated, is mocked at by some street kids, the ex-blind flower girl, now with vision (thanks to the Tramp), sees the scene, laughs at it but than takes pity on the poor tramp. She gives him a flower and a quarter, only to find out, through the tact of his hand which she recognized, that he was the man who helped her while she was blind. They look at each other, we cry. These words mean absolutely nothing if you haven't seen the film, because the images ARE the film. Now, Tarantino knows this, that's the thing, he knows how to Watch films, he claims as his references some of the filmmakers i care more about. Most of them are pure visual storytellers: Leone, Pabst, Hitchcock, Kar Wai. Tarantino knows this, and it must hurt him deeply that he can't do their thing. He can be (i believe) deeply moved by the preciousness of the Bye bye Babs shot, or the initial ever lasting 15 minutes of Once upon a time in West, which Quentin quotes in the first sequence of this film. But he can't do anything that is remotely as visual (or visual at all) like these scenes. There is a number of tools and bricks that build a sequence, build a film, which Tarantino simply doesn't master. Framing, timing, editing. On the pure visual field, Tarantino simply shoots, and has a special talent to adequate songs to his scenes. Now i wouldn't give that so much attention, if Tarantino would be considered for what he is, a clever dialog writer, with some clever narrative ideas, but basically an ordinary director. It seems dangerous that the collective consciousness takes Tarantino as the big thins, the follower to his masters. He does Do what the masters did, so he Talks about it, and Talks us into believing he is doing the masters' thing.It took me a few weeks to get to this point. I had to turn to Tarkovsky and Kalatozov so they would confirm me i was thinking right. They did.<br/><br/>Having said this, i think this film is the strongest Tarantino has made since Pulp Fiction, because he dedicates a lot of time to the 2 things he does best: building tense dialogs, and finding a narrative structure that fits. In Pulp Fiction he borrowed that from Kar Wai, here he sticks to the episodic chapters. The dialogs are great, they build tension and little times have i seen such cleverness in how different languages are alternated. Tarantino collects from his previous experiences in using chit chat to advance a scene, and does it well. So notice that in the first scene it is not what you see that makes the scene, it's what it's said. In my book, that is good writing, not good film-making, and it is precisely the opposite of the assumed reference, Sergio Leone. The same applies to the shooting scene in the bar. It's the dialog that leads us to the final short shooting. And that's my point.<br/><br/>There is a very interesting thing done on the narrative level. We are led throughout the film, by 3 characters, to a final stage, a film theatre: Lada, Raine, and Dreyfuss. Each plans their own film, and the external film we watch is a mix of all those others. On the lower level we have the dumb Nazis, who believe they go to the theater to watch the film they made, but they are the meal to 3 different blood seekers. In the very end, Raine stands on top, despite everything, but of course the line that matters and impresses is Landa's. It's rooted on the detective story, with him always on top all the way, until almost the very end. Christoph Waltz's performance is excellent but the writing is very clever, in all respects, in all the twists. Visually, the best sequences are the ones in the theatre, and of course it's dear that all goes around films, even the fire is started by film, literally.<br/><br/>The other great thing is the awkwardness of hearing David Bowie or Morricone driven themes in the middle of occupied France. It's like Alban Berg's music, which always gives us the impression to hear something tonal and classical, only to deceive us later. That pastiche is makes this film slide into ambiguous fields of undetermined genres. Great.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is a funny guy, because now he plays making fun of his public image, while giving us a totally different thing. That's something Clooney has already done for a while now (see them together in the Coen's project for that).<br/><br/>I really loved the theatre building, the hall was a clear beautiful space, and well shot.<br/><br/>My opinion: 4/5<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

"deastman_uk","7","1","8","26 August 2009"," Legendary Strudel
","Tarantino is getting more like Mozart - technically brilliant if not quite emotionally mature.<br/><br/>But within minutes you remember that great films derive emotion from the élan of the director. The first chapter of this film can be put besides the opening of Once Upon a Time in the West for bravado film making. Its just two men in a hut, one drinking milk.<br/><br/>We get those cardboard cut out characters of WWII blown up to stunning Technicolour 3D. So much better than Kill Bill, which gave nothing back to the genre it kidnapped.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of osmosis between Tarantino and other artsy directors. Almondovar and Allen seem also to use those detailed digressions and physical incongruities in otherwise well structured films. Yes, Tarantino steals of course but others take note too.<br/><br/>Basterds is pulp, a bit left field and very well made all at once. And again, it appears the director has probably made a new career for a forgotten actor. And a apple desserts."
"Diggler31","9","1","8","23 August 2009"," Another Tarantino Classic
","Where to start. Quentin Tarantino has been at the forefront of hip films for some 16 years now. With such classics as Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction under his belt, this movie takes a turn into an area that you will find very unfamiliar to his usual works.<br/><br/>The film is set in WWII France during the Nazi occupation, though the movie does seem to pan out more like a spaghetti western rather than a war film. While it does play up the whole ""Inglorious Basterds"" gang of Jewish/American thugs, there is far more to it.<br/><br/>One thing that people have been led to believe due to the trailer is that this film is an action extravaganza. IT IS NOT! Like all of Tarantino's previous films, this is very much dialog driven with smatterings of extreme violence. Actually I felt that the violence while slim had far more impact than Kill Bill's bloodletting bonanza.<br/><br/>Also if you don't like subtitled foreign dialog, then you are probably going to dislike this film as a very large chunk of it is in German and French.<br/><br/>Overall this was a fun film with smart dialog, fantastically diverse characters (I smell an Oscar nomination for Christoph Waltz) and multi-layered storyline.

","Thank you so very much Quentin Tarantino. You continue to provide endless entertainment for American theatergoers. ""Basterds"" is, simply put, a masterpiece. It embodies all things Tarantino. The movie has a very strong script, plenty of stomach-wrenching gore, an superb soundtrack, and a strong cast. <br/><br/>""Basterds"" requires theatergoers to abandon a strict definition of the word ""history."" Many Americans have a very reverent manner in dealing with all things WWII-related and, save for Mel Brooks and a few other choice individuals, generally frown upon ""disrespecting"" our veterans. ""Basterds"" is a total departure from this mentality. <br/><br/>Let's be honest with ourselves, we're a rather uptight society, and you would be showing a surplus of naívety to think that the overall scheme presented in this movie isn't something that crossed the minds of every American solider involved in WWII. <br/><br/>In the 5th act, Tarantino lets the audience play a part in the biggest mind-f**k since ""Johnny Got His Gun."" For the last 20 or so minutes of the movie, we watch, in agony and aggravation, as Nazis take delight in the portrayal of one Nazi sniper killing nearly 300 Ally soldiers. As we watch the Nazis laugh hysterically, we are filled with a disgusting feeling that makes us want to grab some friends and skin some Gerrys. But just as we wield our daggers, Tarantino turns the tables. He burns down a theater full of Nazis and lets us watch as Eli Roth blows Hitler and Goebbels' faces off with a machine gun. Now he's got a theater full of Americans laughing at a movie depicting hundreds of Nazis getting incinerated and gunned down. Who's laughing now? <br/><br/>And so, it is for that reason that I say ""Thank you"" to Quentin Tarantino. He makes it okay to turn WWII, the darkest moment in our world's history, into something fantastic and wild."
"pvpxan","10","1","8","21 August 2009"," Two wrongs may not make a right, but they do make for a great movie.
","Pure gold. Great cinematography, suspense, and action. If you have ever seen a Quentin Tarantino then you might have an idea what to expect in terms of violence, however there is much more to it. It should be noted that this is also complete fiction and follow no historical events.<br/><br/>Tarantino does a masterful job of making a war movie that does not feel like a war movie. Oddly the movie take great pains to develop the Nazis almost more so then then Basterds possibly to give the audience a better view of Nazis. The movie also does not build the Basterds as heros. If the movie did have a hero, it would be the french girl who owns the theater. When it comes right down to it, the movie is about retribution. Two wrongs may not make a right, but they do make for a great movie."
"Jondahl-1","9","1","8","21 August 2009"," ""I think this might just be my masterpiece""
","I just got home from the Swedish premiere of 'Inglourious basterds' and there is really only one thing to say to summit my impression of the film: It was worth the wait. <br/><br/>The movie is, much like 'Kill Bill', divided into chapters, and they all have a different style in both cinematography as music and screenplay that stretches from classic spaghetti western to old noir style to modern action thrilled movie style. I think most of you already know about the plot so I won't go in to that a lot but the movie is roughly about vengeance, again much like 'Kill Bill'. <br/><br/>There was a lot of positive surprises about the acting, Eli Roth and B.J Novak gives spot on performances , but there was one man that stole all the spotlight from the much bigger names on the screen: if Christoph Waltz doesn't get an Oscar for best supporting role there is something seriously wrong with the members of the academy. The only thing i found a little too much was the forced southern accent of Lt. Aldo Raine, played by Brad Pitt. It just seems a little too much at times, but it's really nothing that big at all and overall Brad Pitt delivers an exceptional performance just like we are used to. Even Mike Myers holds back and really pulls off the English officer that he's playing.<br/><br/>There are a lot of scenes in this movie that will definitely be remembered many years from now, especially the wonderful opening scene. We all know that Tarantino is all about conversations and I in this movie he still delivers spot on conversations in both English, German, French and even Italian. Also, as usual, the music is matched perfectly with every scene and sometimes it is just an orgasm of feelings that will hit the viewers as the scenes are mixed with both classic and popular music. Many hardcore Tarantino fans will also have a great time looking for all the hints and references to other Tarantino movies and popular culture. But even if you aren't that big of a Tarantino fan you will still enjoy the, to quote the movie poster for the grindhouse feature films, ""two and a half hours of pure dynamite"" that 'Inglourious Basterds' is. And don't get angry if the story doesn't follow the real history of World War II, because after all, it is just that: a movie. <br/><br/>Overall I think this is a really, really good movie and definitely one of the best movies I have seen in cinema for many years and I strongly recommend it to everyone who likes anything about cinema.<br/><br/>The movie ends with the phrase ""I think this might just be my masterpiece"", and I think that could very much be true. It's not a new 'Pulp Fiction', but it's close, very close."
"rayato","9","1","8","21 August 2009"," Killing Nazis never looked so good.
","Yep, Tarantino killed it. Killing Nazis never looked so good. Brad Pitt was fantastic, his best performance ever. Cristoph Waltz' Col. Handa is one of the best villains I've seen in a while, he's such a diabolical a-hole. I <3 Eli Roth as the Bear Jew, beside Pitt he was my favorite basterd. I would give this film 5 stars but there is a scene in a bar in the second act that would've made its point in 5 minutes but instead takes 20 MINUTES. There is no point to this and it felt extremely indulgent. Forget runpee.com, if you need to run out on the theater to pee, wait for this scene. Having said that, the first and last act in the movie are frickin insane! The final half hour is so good it's almost unreal. Overall, if you love action and hates Nazis, WATCH THIS FILM!"

","I think it would be easy to write an essay and breakdown each scene of this movie but I wont do that. I must say, however obvious it is to say, Tarantino is one of my favourite directors. He see's himself as the audience and often talks about his influence from all walks of cinema. We have seen this in his past movies with the inspiration of guys such as Sergio Lionni. Quentin is so clever how he retains his own dark but bouncy style in a WWII movie with aspects of both Hollywood and world cinema.<br/><br/>This was a fantastic picture with great suspense and some amazing performances; I was particularly drawn in by Mélanie Laurent and obviously Christoph Waltz. The story was great and very quirky too, I enjoyed the dialogue and thought the cinematography was superb with some great colours. Quentin's directing was second to none with some unbelievable shots and typical panning and twirling - I felt like I was there.<br/><br/>In true Tarantino style the suspense led to a brilliant climax which is nothing less than genius. These are his 'mountain climbing' days and I know I cannot wait to see what he does next. Some movies deserve 10/10, this surely one of those special moments in cinema!"

It have nothing in common with the real history of the Nazis.<br/><br/>i really loved to see all the leaders of the Nazis dying and i wish it happened in real like this.<br/><br/>it is an typical tarentino film, it not for everyone. Funny and interesting at the same time.<br/><br/>there's no doubt that tarentino is a very competent director. also i liked was that the film starring a lot of German actors like Til Schweiger. the acting is very good.<br/><br/>a well made film."
"paudie","8","1","9","6 October 2009"," A bit self indulgent, violent but very funny
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film but I don't think it ranks with Tarantino's classics like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The film is based around three long scenes and you could say the rest of the plot is only there to facilitate Tarantino to get to those scenes that he has obviously spent a long time in writing.<br/><br/>The cast is very good. Chrisoph Waltz is brilliant as the SS officer without any scruples. Expect him to get an Oscar nomination. However I found Brad Pitt a bit annoying with his Southern accent and Popeye chin. <br/><br/>The film is two and three quarter hours long but thankfully doesn't drag too much. The plot is mainly about two separate plans to kill many of the Nazi leadership in a Paris cinema. One is to be carried out by the ""Inglourious Basterds"" of the title – a group of American Jewish soldiers sent behind enemy lines in France ""to kill Nazis"". The second is organised by the cinema owner, who has very personal reasons to hate the Germans. We are introduced to her in the first of the long scenes that Tarantino directs and writes brilliantly. He ratchets up the tension minute by minute as Colonel Landa interrogates the French farmer hiding the Jewish family.<br/><br/>The second of the long scenes sees some of the ""Basterds"" meet their German contact in a cellar bar, surrounded by German soldiers celebrating the birth of a baby. Again the tension rises slowly as the scene heads to an inevitable bloody conclusion. <br/><br/>The final main scene in the Paris cinema as the German leadership and all the surviving characters gather is also excellent, though it veers towards high farce at the end.<br/><br/>If you like Tarantino films you will like ""Inglourious Basterds"" also. As with his other films it is very violent. There is also a lot of laugh out loud humour, often in the most violent scenes. You will have to go with the flow as Tarantino the director indulges Tarantino the writer but you will almost definitely leave the cinema smiling."
"charlytully","9","1","9","22 August 2009"," Funner than VALKYRIE; sexier than DEFIANCE
","Remake, schmeemake, if BASTERDS director Quentin Tarantino is redoing any WWII flick, it is Robert Aldrich's 1967 opus, THE DIRTY DOZEN. Not only are the climactic scenes of these two films virtually identical, but the tongue-in-cheek tone they share is seldom seen in such other recent revisionist WWII movies as SCHINDLER'S LIST (=the ""good"" mature German), THE BOY IN STRIPED PAJAMAS (=the ""good"" immature German), VALKYRIE (the ""fragging"" German), or DEFIANCE (the ""fighting"" Jews). Tarantino's idea of someone like the Detroit Tigers' WWII era superstar ""Hammering Hank"" Greenberg, who still holds the major league record for home runs in one season by a Jewish player (58), directing his Louisville slugger skills against the skulls of Nazi storm trooper officers is a flight of fancy reaching the level of poetic justice. The notion that everyone is expendable in a war movie has not been exemplified so well since THE DIRTY DOZEN, either. People who study both of these films will find many other parallels that spell, if not plagiarism, at least outright homage."
"elisachristophe","10","1","10","18 October 2009"," Tarantino rewrites history and that ain't bad.
","So I finally watched Inglourious Basterds. I was a little skeptical about watching it. I hadn't seen the trailer nor read anything about the film. I also didn't watch the interviews the cast and crew gave while promoting the film. Mostly I didn't because I felt uneasy about it.<br/><br/>For the first time ever I wasn't looking forward and craving a Tarantino movie. I don't know why. It really made no sense.<br/><br/>I am a HUGE Tarantino fan. For a long, long time, I wanted to write my final paper about him, it would be almost a love letter to him I admit and that is one of the reasons I didn't.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino is one of the reasons I decided I wanted to work in cinema in the first place. I remember clearly the day I watched Pulp Fiction (1994) for the first time. It had just been released on video; I was about 11 and tricked my mum into letting me rent it. I watched it during the afternoon, after I came back from school. I thought the film was pretty cool and I couldn't believe I had pulled it off and made my mum let me watch it. There I was just being smug when, suddenly, I was hit by the adrenaline-shot-in-the-heart scene. At that moment I thought ""I want to do this. I don't know what this is, but I want to make films too"".<br/><br/>So, clearly, not wanting to watch Inglourious Basterds kind of surprised me too. But yesterday when my dad invited me to go to the cinema with him, I felt obliged to. I thought ""this is Tarantino; he is one of your very few idols, so get over yourself!"" And I am really glad I did, especially because Inglourious should be watched on a big screen with surround sound.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a true ""Tarantino"". All his trademarks are there: blood baths, western references, recurring actors, beautiful long shots, the chapters, the dark sense of humour, the feet fetish everything. So if you like him, you are bound to love it. If you don't, then I guess you should consider watching it anyway.<br/><br/>It is a wonderful piece of fiction. I don't think I can stress enough how wonderful it is without being completely politically incorrect. So, to sum it up and try and be politically correct, Tarantino rewrites history as never before and it is I N C R E D I B L E. Visually it is a feast for the eyes and when it comes to the narrative it is even more astonishing. Plus he lets his imagination run wild and do to Hitler and his army what - I guess - anyone in their right mind would have wanted to do. It is a fantastic (in every sense of the word) imaginary revenge and it is fun, lots of fun.<br/><br/>Then, there is the performance and the perfect casting - and here I have to insert another ode to Tarantino: He is a great actor's director. Every actor who has been in one of his films has given unforgettable and amazing performances and in Inglourious Basterds it is no different. Not only that, but the casting for his films are always perfect. Every single actor in his films is great. They are so expressive and intense, fitted perfectly to their characters. There are no small and unimportant roles. Every character seems to deserve the best actor for it and every actor delivers the best portrayal for their character.<br/><br/>And no, I'm not referring here especially to Brad Pitt as Aldo Rainer. I don't think anyone is surprised any more that Pitt is an amazing actor and, to be completely honest, I don't expect anything less than incredible from him. I am talking about everyone else and particularly about Christophe Waltz as Hans Landa. Waltz truly takes over and Inglourious becomes his film. His performance is theatrical in a way without being over the top or fake. It is so astounding that once again I'm thinking about awards...<br/><br/>There are so many great things to say about Inglourious Basterds that I could go on for at least another 672 words. It would be easy to pick it apart and use every adjective I know for great over and over again, but I guess it is suffice to quote what a friend of mine said: ""Tarantino is a genius clown and not in a bad way. What is important is the cinematographic chaos. Talk about artistic expression!"" I really couldn't have put it better in so few words."
"turk_rooster","10","1","10","16 October 2009"," The Strangest Resistance
","Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) gives a stunning performance in Tanantino's latest – Inglourious Basterds, - that sees alternate history as two parallel and similar plots are hatched to put an end to the Third Reich. Rather limited in the insanity quotient, and actually serious in parts, the plot revolves around the Nazi-killer team led by Lt Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and their encounters. Typical chapter-based Tarantino narration – the first scene about the purge and introduction to the central character of menace, the long scene and encounter wrt Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) in the basement, the showdown between Hans Landa and the German actress, are the most memorable. The inexplicable fact of Shoshanna owning a theater in the heart of Paris explained away rather trivially, the sharpshooter Pvt Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) and his mixed emotions, the ramblings on Goebbels' propaganda, the strange silhouette of Marcel and his giant pile of inflammable film make sure that Tarantino's quirky touch is very much alive and kicking. A mellower, more circumspect Tarantino, but enough to keep fans engaged"
"shivam_s88","9","1","10","8 October 2009"," Glory all the way for these Bastards!
","Another movie for which I got only good things to tell! The brilliance that lies in the Quentin Tarantino's work is distinctive in it's own commendable way! He is known for overdoing certain things, like the bloodshed, fight sequences which work perfectly, for him, and of course throwing in some awesome dark humor (Pulp Fiction - best example), you will get to see all this in Inglourious Basterds. I might have little bias for the movie, probably because of the duo, Quentin Tarantino-Brad Pitt, and come on, I bet just first look of the movie would have got you hooked on for sure! I personally find the movies set in the Nazi era very fascinating and also the ones based on racism, like The Pianist and Schindler's List (Both Oscar winning flicks - must watch by the way) based on former, and American History X & Crash, based on latter.<br/><br/>Now coming on to Inglourious Basterds, movie is set in Nazi era showing slaughter of the Jews by the SS and Nazi Army but not to the extent of Schindler's or even Pianist, more than the Jews, it has gore filled with slaughter of Nazi army, and that too, Gore-Tarantino-Style!<br/><br/>Even though it might appear that the story's protagonist is Brad Pitt, I really didn't find that way, in fact I found the story somewhat revolving around Mélanie Laurent (Shosanna Dreyfus) (who by the way is a French actress) and what amazing performance she delivered, I'm a fan!<br/><br/>Speaking of performance, do look out for Christoph Waltz, the guy in ""negative role"" - Nazi Col. Hans Landa, sheer brilliance! The characters or the ""Bastards"" if you may, have been hand picked and have done perfect justice. Take for example Eli Roth who played Sgt. Donowitz aka The Jew Bear, great screen presence. Now, Brad Pitt - Lt. Aldo Raine, supporting a thick Southern accent, gave out a great performance, as always, but didn't really have a lot of screen time, as I said earlier, not really the protagonist. Mike Myres has a ""guest appearance"", nothing that'll stick to your memory. There are some really hard hitting sequences in the movie, like at the end when the projector keeps rolling but projection comes on to the Smoke with the sound still on, it sent chills down my spine. Or the one where The Jew Bear lashed out on a Nazi Officer in the middle of the Jungle, whoa! Now having said all this, the movie did not leave a mark in my memory, which obviously I expected it would. And what could have been better, the background score, there was so much possibility there. Anyway, this one the biggest movies of this year and worth catching on big screen, and a little heads up, movie has lot of French and German, so keep an I on the screen - subtitles . P.s. I still have to confirm if Inglourious Basterds is remake of the Italian movie - Quel Maledetto Treno Blindato."
"sourav-dey06","9","1","10","4 October 2009"," Gloriously Inglorious
","This film is in one word ""spectacular"". This one is the second best work of Tarantino after Pulp Fiction. The film is completely entertaining and evokes thoughts among the audiences too. All the five chapters and the connections between them, and how he builds the film over those chapters which on its own are small movies, just like episodes, are a work of sheer talent. This man knows how to make films. He is indeed a storyteller, and I doubt this credibility in any other contemporary directors. As expected the climax was just too good as all his other movies. Its a pleasure watching Tarantino. The film builds on its dialogues, and I would strongly suggest anyone watching this piece listen them, you will definitely enjoy the true essence of the film only if you don't miss any of its dialogue. Although I must mention that the film is a bit long, and I felt anxious rather boring. And hats off Mr. Waltz!! You were wonderful a basterd or bastard whatever it be...

","Definitely a Tarantino classic. Grotesquely violent as usual along with pithy comments, witty humor and fist clinching suspense. Overall the film was awesome, although too far fetched (Hitler is assassinated...?). The main antagonist is the film is one of the most evil sobs that only Tarantino could masterpiece.<br/><br/>The only thing that drove me nuts is the ever prevailing PCness of this flick. Once again ""all Germans are Nazis"" is the undertone of modern day American cinema (Valkerie was a god send exception to this). Being a German American I'm really fed up and extremely angry with this ""politically correct"" stereotyping of my heritage. The film even went beyond accusing Germans of the heinous racism of Jews and pointed out they don't like African people either. Was that really necessary? Well I guess necessary is interchangeable with politically correct.<br/><br/>Other than that gripe, the cinema and screen shots were awesome. It kept you on the edge of your seat every second."

","Last week I wrote about What's Your Raashee?; you didn't like it. Well, to each one his own. But this time, I ask you. Get out from your house; go to the nearest theatre and watch a movie called 'Inglorious Basterds' To start with describing Quentin Tarantino's previous work would sound really stupid. So, in case you do not know who he his – please don't read any further. Delete yourself from my friends list and go drown yourself. Continuing on the movie, it starts not with a bang but with a twenty minute dialogue scene. ""Boring"" is what you'd think. But well, I couldn't let go off my seat till it was done. The sub plots all come together, the cinematography, the action and the music is out of this world. However the movie has a lot less music as compared to Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill but the lines and the games and the sarcasm and the setting – it's all so beautiful. Just last week I was telling a friend of mine why Sarkar is a futile attempt when it comes to depicting the evil in a man. I told her that evil isn't guilty, it isn't hidden. It is bold, outright, radiant and full of power. Evil comes with authority, it commands the fear in another person and brings out weaker side on the table. It will then slice you, break you and devour your thought – all this without the simplest clue, want, desire or notion of causing you any harm. Evil is accidentally dangerous. And that is what QT has depicted in this movie through the brilliance in an actor called Christoph Waltz (Col. Hans Landa) Brad Pitt is at his best; the closest we come to seeing that age old Texas roughneck that has supported Tarantino scripts since Reservoir Dogs which was remade in India as Kaante. He is strong, determined and spits out hatred through hilarious dialogues. Eli Roth, Diane Kruger and Melanie Laurent are very strong supporting actors. The camera work is excellent, the thrills are outer-worldly and the script is the best part of this goodie game. It has a beautiful, spine chilling climax. It has a strange love twist, a strange character twist and an excellent basement rendezvous scene which I think is the best turn in the movie. I gave it a 9 / 10 on IMDb. If you loved Reservoir Dogs, If you loved Pulp Fiction and if you Loved Kill Billthis film will not disappoint. It's the last good film for this year at least, till Lovely Bones. Do not miss this masterpiece."

I really had high expectations as I had read it resembled the earlier Tarantino movies (Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs). The quality of the dialogue and the complexity of the plot were really Tarantino but unlike his other work Inglourious Basterds is dynamic and thrilling during all of its 150 minutes - one can feel the pressure even during the ""Royale with cheese"" type dialogues. I also noted QT's development when it comes to film music - the soundtrack is really incredible even if it doesn't consist of good old rock'n'roll tracks; it really touches your heart.Here I should also say that the movie isn't and does not pretend to be historically accurate - as Tarantino stated ""...it's a spaghetti western set during the WWII"".<br/><br/>Obligatory for Leone, Tarantino and Guy Ritchie fans, recommended for anyone above 10.

","Plot: The movie set in Nazi-occupied France begins with SS officer Colonel Hans Landa (Waltz), nicknamed 'the Jew Hunter' discovering a Jewish family hiding under the floorboards of a farmhouse and killing them with only the daughter making an escape. Aldo Raine (Pitt) puts together the Basterds, a team of 8 Jewish-American soldiers who specialise in killing Nazis. They leave their mark by gruesomely scalping the dead and marking those left alive. Despite the title the film isn't all about them and as a consequence they aren't on film all that much. We are then moved on a few years later where in Paris we see Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) the daughter of the family killed by Lander, has created a new life for herself under the new identity of Emmanuelle Mimieux and is now the owner of a cinema which is to host the unveiling of Joseph Goebbels' new film 'Nations Pride' starring a German Soldier besotted with Shosanna/Emmanuelle. This night brings the film to its climax with each of the characters intertwining.<br/><br/>Funny scenes: There are plenty of funny moments but one in particular was the German officer(s) playing the game 'who am I' where they have a card with a famous persons name stuck to their head. Pitt and Waltz's characters are very funny. Waltz is brilliant at portraying evil and hilarious all at the same time.<br/><br/>Look out for: Mike Myers, I didn't realise it was him until about 5 minutes into this scene. See if you can spot him!!<br/><br/>Unfortunately: you might find some of the scenes a bit lengthy but thankfully, for me, Waltz was a joy to watch. His cool, calm and collected voice just reels you in and you just love him. You know you shouldn't but you do. The film moves from French to English to German (even a little Italian) so can get a bit confusing and what I find with subtitled films is that you miss a lot when you are staring at the bottom of the screen for half the film. It was also a bit too gruesome in some parts for me but hey you might like that sort of thing.<br/><br/>The film manages to poke fun out of history but also stirs up emotions. Fictional characters are mixed with real life historical figures including Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels. The film contains plenty of blood and gore and one scene in particular that looked like something out of Scarface.<br/><br/>Verdict: Excellent. I love Tarrantino films and I was not disappointed here. This has to be his best one yet. It's not at all historically accurate but its not a documentary after all!! Waltz was the shining star of the film for me."

","With brilliant films like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill in his repertoire, I wasn't going to miss this good looking war film from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Quentin Tarantino. Set in World War II, the film begins with Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet) trying to hide and protect a family of Jews, and he is being interrogated by Nazi ""Jew hunter"" Col. Hans Landa (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Christoph Waltz), and when LaPadite eventually gives in the Jews are killed horrifically with machine gun fire through the floor, with only Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) escaping. Then it moves to the story of the ""Basterds"", an army of eight men, led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and Sgt. Donny Donowitz (Cabin Fever director Eli Roth), who revel in the killing of Nazis, leaving only one survivor to spread to fear to Adolf Hitler (Martin Wuttke) and his armies. Three years on, Shosanna, under a new identity, has found safety repairing a small Paris cinema, with German sniper Pvt. Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl) and friends nosing about. She, with the help of the Basterds have devised a way to get many Nazi officers, as well as the key Nazi leaders, including Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth), and of course Hitler, at a premiere for a new film. With everything set it all looks good to go, one or two glitches occur during the night, but the mission goes completely to plan - of course this is not historical fact, so don't be surprised to see Hitler mashed to death by gunfire. Also starring Diane Kruger as Bridget Von Hammersmark, Michael Fassbender as Lt. Archie Hicox, Til Schweiger as Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz, B.J. Novak as Pfc. Smithson Utivich, Samm Levine as PFC Gerold Hirschberg, Julie Dreyfus as Francesca Mondino, guest stars Mike Myers as General Ed Fenech and The Birds' Rod Taylor as Winston Churchill, and look and listen out for appearances by David Bowie, Harvey Keitel and Samuel L. Jackson (of course). It may be lengthy, and reading subtitles for the German dialogue is a little annoying, but with some very good performances, particularly a cool and determined Pitt, and a brilliantly charming but very sinister Waltz, plenty of nasty violence, a little amusing pop-culture like reference, and eye-catching wartime and explosive scenes, not much to complain about, it is a most worthwhile Second World War action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Sound Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

Firstly I think Christoph Waltz deserved that Oscar even more than when Ledger won for The Dark Knight.. I am being serious on that point. His performance was so witty, funny and just a delight to watch. The script in my humble opinion so was carefully crafted almost like a play. It was funny,ruthless at times, and just so damn brilliant. I also think Melanie Laurent's performance was criminally overlooked by the academy. I don't think they realised just how beautiful and talented this young french women is. Anyway performances were all amazing even August Diehl as Major Hellstrom gave a strong supporting performance, especially for the small amount of screen time he had.

Although Pulp Fiction might be his finest film due to it's cult status and innovation as a shapeless piece of matter revolving around different stories, Inglourious Basterds is just pure magic. I can just sense that if this were what really happened with the war than Nazism would have been much more recognizable as an omni-senseless so called ideal. Quentin knows how to reflect life into film form just like Van Gogh did with paint. Quentin Tarantino should be famous 300 years from now just like all the great genius artists.<br/><br/>I just want to say that Quentin is undoubtedly a genius and icon.

","I've discovered in writing reviews that they tend to actually write themselves. Some reviews demand that a synopsis, others to the themes and style of the movie being reviewed. In either case you're trying to give the reader a sense of the movie and whether it's something they want to see or not. Since Pulp Fiction Quentin Tarantino's movies have so intricately weaved that a synopsis would lead to a lengthy review, and in the case of Inglourius Basterds it's best to see the movie and let all the elements reveal themselves.<br/><br/>As you've seen on the commercial about Inglourious Basterds, it's about a squad of Jewish American soldiers behind enemy lines led by Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine and their mission is to kill ""Natzis."" There is more to the plot, it also revolves around a Jewish woman Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) who escapes the clutches of German Col. Landa (Christoph Waltz) who is in charge of German occupied France.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds reveals the mature artist in Tarantino. The opening scene is confidently filmed letting the characters talk, as we learn just who Col. Landa is, and despite his civilized and cultured demeanor he is a cunning and devious officer committed to carrying out his orders, hunting down Jews. In other parts of the movie when Shosanna comes face to face to with Col. Landa Tarantino lets the camera rest on her and her struggle to remain calm as the Colonel makes small talk with Joseph Goebbels.<br/><br/>While all the action takes place in war time France and Germany, this movie may be more about movies than war. The characters are self-consciously aware of movies Pitt and his band watch a German officer beaten to death with a bat with the stated reason that it's the closest they get to seeing a movie these days. Shosanna is the owner of a movie theatre in Paris and her plan revolves around her knowledge of film. So, is Tarantino just aware of the part movie's played in the lives of people of the war time era? Or is he making a statement that making movies is a war? And a nasty one at that.<br/><br/>Tarantino plays with his usual palette of colors violence, humor, crisp dialogue, and music and mixes all of them that create new colors and shocking results that only Tarantino can pull off. There is violence, you will see people scalped, beaten to death, and shot to pieces, but it is war. Tarantino's violence has always seemed stylized to me, not cartoonish, maybe hyper-real is a better to describe it. The violence looks like it could be real but there is an element that lets you realize the violence is fictional without pulling you out of the movie. And there's Tarantino's dark humor that if were in different circumstances or situations we might not ordinarily laugh at, but Tarantino bends the situation just enough for a dark humor to materialize and that's mostly because of the dialogue Tarantino is noted for. If the movie hadn't had me already, by the time David Bowie's song Cat People (Putting Out The Fire, from the movie Cat People) hit the soundtrack, it would've captured me right there.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie Pitt's character comments as Tarantino's surrogate ""this just may be my masterpiece."" I think he just might be right."

","With The Verdict by Ennio Morricone playing as the camera pans over a serene countryside - the titular sequence of Inglorious Basterds creates a false sense of security for the slow boil encounter which takes place between Hans Landa and Perrier LaPadite later in the scene. This entire Chapter was excruciatingly tense - amplified by only the sound of a ticking clock and Landa slurping a glass of milk.
I thought the inclusion of subtitles during this scene was also a very smart move to further the plot (from French subs to English & back to French again) and really increased the dramatic irony.<br/><br/>Christoph Waltz' portrayal of Hans Landa was impeccable. Landa speaks with such eloquence it borders on eccentricity. He is perhaps thee most well mannered villain in cinema history. Under his charming veneer- he is a sadist, and takes pride in his nickname 'The Jew Hunter'. His love of mind games is entertaining, and he is arguably one of the best antagonists since Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>The chapter titled ""Revenge of the Big Face"" was very ironic, and the entire scene of Shoshanna applying her 'war paint' and mourning veil as David Bowie ""Cat People"" plays in the background was genius. The lyrics were very fitting for her characters appearance/motivations and foreshadowed the final moments of the film. Her revenge story was wonderful, and it was also really nice to see a female heroine in the movie.<br/><br/>Wee things I loved;
-Samuel L Jackson's voiceover (almost like an infomercial)
-holographic projection of Shoshanna's face (The Wizard of Oz vibes)
-Cinderella moment between Hans Landa & Bridget Von Hammersmark, although he is certainly no Prince Charming.
-Tarantino's cameo
-the 'Who am I?' Game
-the slow mo shot of the lit cigarette
-Hammersmark's cast in the shape of a wedge
-Eli Roth's entrance/sports commentary
-the arc shot of Landa & Hammersmark in the cinema when he asks about her foot
-Brad Pitt's Italian accent
-Scarface reference
-the vying plots
-cartoonish portrayal of Hitler"

"julacislak","10","0","1","5 May 2020"," Surprising and entertaining in every way
","'Inglourious Basterds' is another masterpiece from Tarantino, and while it usually isn't the first movie people associate with him, it's certainly one of his best. QT plays with alternate history, introduces us to great characters and doesn't hesitate to show some blood.<br/><br/>Let's start with the greatest member of the cast, and obviously I'm talking about Christoph Waltz. Even Tarantino himself praises his performance, and says that Waltz ""saved his movie"", as he was about to scrap the whole thing unless he found the perfect Landa. It's not a surprise Waltz has since appeared in many great Hollywood movies, he's simply an amazing actor.
Obviously, other cast members do not disappoint either. Pitt as Aldo Raine is so fun to watch, as well as other Basterds. I've heard many complaints about Eli Roth's acting and his portrayal of Sgt. Donowitz, but I have to disagree. Donny is one of my favourite characters, and while Roth isn't the greatest actor in the world, he manages just fine.<br/><br/>The plot starts out slowly, but the opening scene is arguably one of the best ever made. We get to know Hans Landa and his way of working, and we're on the edges of our seats since the very beginning, and can feel the suspense in our bodies. The story revolves around two plots, that merge into one during the ending. It's entertaining, has some comedy, a lot of drama, great dialogue and great fight sequences, and it's all peak Tarantino.<br/><br/>It's not a typical war film, as there's not much actual war. This only works in the movie's favor, as it's something different and entirely engrossing. Definitely deserves full 10 stars"

","Inglorious Bastards is an incredibly violent, action packed, simply awesome movie. The movie has many points that tensions rise significantly, and that grasps the audiences attention and this is aided by a fitting, gripping soundtrack.

","In the movie, Susanna's death was too deep for me. The plot and soundtrack of this episode are absolutely amazing. Because of this paragraph I did not hesitate to give 5 stars.<br/><br/>Susanna plans to blow up all the German seniors who are watching in the movie theater at Frederick's premiere, and plans to change the content of the movie before the explosion.<br/><br/>Susanna put on the last film and finally came to the most tense moment.<br/><br/>At this moment Frederick suddenly came to the screening room. Lengyan didn't persuade him to go away, but suddenly ran away and broke in.<br/><br/>Susana suddenly turned around and asked him to close the door. When I thought she had a better way to solve it, she took advantage of the Buddha's turn and closed the door, took out the prepared pistol and fired three shots without hesitation. Ephesus fell to the ground.<br/><br/>Until now, there have been a lot of sudden shots in the movie, without giving you any room, and there are a few that I thought had important roles without leaving room to die directly, so I have no strong accidents about shooting her.<br/><br/>Susanna began to look at the cinema from the window. At this time, the lens was given to Susanna, and Foe was not in the lens. Susanna looked at Fo from time to time, and the camera gave it to Fo, so after repeating it a few times, according to the previous law, there may be a reversal at this time, and then suddenly nervous. Suddenly Cough coughed a few times, he was really not dead! Susanna looked back suddenly, he suddenly lost his movement, is he really dead, with this doubt. It was at this moment that there was a bgm suddenly and started playing UnAmico, Susanna started looking at him.<br/><br/>This music is so sensational, and suddenly I feel that time has frozen, and I ca n't help but start immersing myself in it. She kills someone who loves her deeply. Did she react like me? Susanna walked over slowly. Under such music (UnAmico), she suddenly felt sorry for the pair.<br/><br/>Just when she turned his body around, Fu shot the gun without any hesitation towards Susanna, and without hesitation, kept firing until she fell to the ground. I was taken aback by this reversal. I have n't come out of the last emotion. The song is still playing. Susanna, who is in a red dress, was shot with blood and was splashed. In the song of un, beautiful Unlikely, with a messy background, only one sentence in my mind blooms like a flower.<br/><br/>Susannah fell to the ground and looked at Fo. I slowed down a little bit, and I was still struggling, looking forward to a reversal. As a result, Fer made up the last shot, and then the two left together. UnAmico was still there, until the next scene suddenly stopped abruptly.<br/><br/>Before I saw this movie, I would only give 4 stars, but because of this episode, I decided to give 5 stars. This is the first time I watched Quentin's movie. An immersive experience, I fully felt his violent aesthetics. If you don't play cards according to common sense, even violence will make you feel beautiful. This is his charm. After watching the movie, it couldn't slow down. The style of this soundtrack in this section is very rare in this entire movie, and there is almost no, but it is not abrupt at all, because there is more abrupt music in the whole movie, and it always reminds you to keep you refreshed. And this paragraph made people have a point to stop and think. I wanted to give four stars at the beginning because although the whole movie's narrative has many bright spots in the middle, the overall narrative is relatively flat, and this paragraph is the entire There is a big point in the movie that makes people stop and think about giving you a head start. The whole movie has also become different."

","Inglorious Basterds takes Tarantino's masterful dialogue, camerawork and violence and turns it into a marvel of a film. This is the best movie Tarantino has ever done.

","Right up there with the very best of Quentin, this film is a wartime masterpiece. Beginning in 1941, in Nazi-occupied France, the German army are in pursuit of all remaining Jewish families in the country. An intimate group of soldiers known around the world as 'The Basterds' bring vigilante justice onto the Nazis and continue to recruit the very best at providing 'ONE. HUNDRED. NAZI. SCALPS!' each; to exact vengeance for all the Jewish people they discriminated against. Firstly, it's a great premise that is accompanied by the fact it really cares for the afflicted in these dreadful times and through the beauty of escapism, gives audiences an alternative vision of Hitler's downfall that is altogether more satisfying. The cast are all brilliant; particular stand outs from Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine, The leader of the Basterds (GORLAMI!!') Melanie Laurent as Shosanna Dresfuss and of course a masterful career defining performance from Christoph Waltz as the evil Col. Hans Landa (THATS A BINGO!) who manages to make the normally delightful act of eating a strudel nerve shreddingly intense. Each chapter is perfectly paced and told well; the rendezvous in an enclosed tavern named La Louisiane for example is absolutely brilliant. The soundtrack is possibly my favourite in Tarantino's catalogue; classic tunes by Morricone echo throughout including the beautiful Un Amico in the cinema toward the end. Exciting and relentlessly entertaining"

That's not to say they are bad, absolutely far from it, but I just didn't overly enjoy a lot of the performances.<br/><br/>That's with one huge exception of course - Christoph Waltz. He is outstanding as Landa, it's consistently a joy to watch him act - that early scene with him at the LaPadite household is excellent. Away from Waltz, MÃ©lanie Laurent is very good in her role as Shosanna.<br/><br/>The plot and the way it's portrayed is what stands this film up. It has some majestic, tension-filled scenes, great dialogue and the eventual pay-off is fulfilling. In fact, for me, 'Inglourious Basterds' got a little less interesting between the middle and end parts, though thankfully the conclusion grabbed me back in.<br/><br/>Highly recommend."

Pitt,Roth and the whole cast is surely amazing,but the most interesting scenes are not that much:the very first scene with the SS soldier and the farmer is truly amazing and it makes you hold your breath and watch until the very end of the scene. The second scene that is truly great is bar fight,once again the great cast is making its impact on the scene combined with interesting dialogues and a lot of tension. Sadly the things that i didnt like are quite a few:bad dialogues in most of the scenes are saved by Brad Pitt and the others,the little jew girl that ran from the SS officer,if you remember her because of the boring storyline,is maybe one of the worst characters in the movie. What about the end? Well the end wasn't shocking and was pretty boring too(sadly Brad Pitt couldn't do much here).

","An fun, engrossing, beautifully crafted piece of nonsense, the likes of which we hadn't seen in a long long time. The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilised monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating an Italian? I thought so. His character's name sounds like Aldo Ray and I'm sure that's no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970's  Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino's trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He's clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don't read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That's how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time.

But that doesn't make for a good film, it makes for one dimensional characters.

With each BRILLIANT movie he unleashes we see more into his Awesome movie universe where fact & fiction cross paths & memorable & iconic characters do what we wouldn't love to do in real life!!!
Here Tarantino gifts us with a WW2 man-on-a-mission Thriller that's both full of violent grit & what if fantasy.<br/><br/>I absolutely love this film & think IT'S a work of Art & a cinematic instant CLASSIC just like his MASTERPIECE ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"" both include beautiful looks & a stunning mix of scary fact & spectacular fiction, here we have a Nazi occupied France & a team of brutal American Nazi-scalp hunters, i love the idea of a bunch of toughs doing to evil Nazi scum what should've happened to the cowards back then but atleast here i get to see some savage justice executed beautifully on screen!!!
We know what the Nazi scum did to the Jews through History so it's Awesome to see some savage killing done to them.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent especially the Awesome Eli Roth as the brutal ""Bear Jew"" who beats then to death with LOVELY baseball bat, he's called sgt: Donny Donowitz & he's a jew soldier along with the leader of the team Lt. Eldo Raine played by an excellent Brad Pitt & I'm not a Pitt fan at all but he's great fun here as the redneck leader of the ""Basterds"" sent to kill & scalp as many Nazi's as possible!!!
The rest of the cast is fantastic with the outstanding Christoph Waltz & Diane Kruger & Melanie Laurent & Michael Fassbender & more it's an incredible cast on screen.
The cinematography is gorgeous & the music is always excellent as with all Tarantino films, this is a kicka## war Thriller with lots of dark humour & also real intense moments & stunningly crafted scenes & the old fashioned 1940's production design is phenomenal in it's look & detail, we get a bloody quest of vengeance but also a beautiful story of a young Jewish girl who escaped the Nazi's & opened up a beautiful Cinema but smartly plots her revenge on the Nazi's that killed her family, there's the beautiful what if? Final showdown scene that is in it's self a rip roaring exciting & incredibly uplifting sequence that we can all only wish really did happen!!!
The movie is one of the greats of cinema & is an instant classic, Tarantino knows how to tell a wild story that is totally entertaining & totally engrossing & transports you to that fantasy world of his with his incredible characters.
Thank you again Mr. TARANTINO

"aimeedreux","6","0","3","20 December 2019"," Nothing About This Film Matters
","Inglourious Basterd falls prey to a common theme among Tarantino's work: being incredible stylistically but lacking in anything to emotionally connect the viewer to the film.<br/><br/>My main two issues with Inglourious Basterds are the unnecessary existence of a majority of it's characters and plot and the absence of development of any character excluding Shosanna (Laurent).<br/><br/>What I mean when I say 'unnecessary existence' is that if you removed large chunks of plot or character the film would end the same. For example the Inglourious Basterds don't need to exist because Shosanna sets the theatre of fire anyways, rendering their plan useless and vice versa. The characters of Lt. Archie Hicox (Fassbender) and Bridget von Hammersmark (Kruger) don't need to exist because Hammersmark getting shot in the leg which leads to the Basterds being discovered by Col. Hans Landa (Waltz) doesn't matter because Shosanna was still going to set the theatre on fire. Even Landa who I personally thought was the highlight of the film due to Christoph Waltz's superb acting didn't need to exist because he ultimately doesn't affect the end result as if he hadn't killed Shosanna's family the Basterds still would have exploded the theatre, it just would have been the Ritz instead. If Hitler didn't go to the premiere nothing would have changed except his death, his presence didn't make security tighter and significantly complicate the plot. What I'm trying to get at is that by creating double plots Tarantino has cancelled out the necessary existence of the actions of either side leading to the viewer feeling detached from the situation, for no matter what happens the end result will remain the same. It would have been a much more effective film if instead Tarantino had either chosen Shosanna or the Basterds to focus on, meaning their actions will actually hold weight.<br/><br/>Secondly, for a movie that kills of a majority of it's characters it's a wonder that I find myself not caring about any of their deaths. This is because almost every character is exactly what we are given when they are introduced, we find no further information into their past, their motivations, their relationships with the characters surrounding them and this ultimately results in a two-and-a-half hour long movie where I don't care about anything that happens to any of the characters. There are two exclusions to this rule, Shosanna (who I personally think the film should centre on instead) and Wilhelm, the random conscript shot in the bar scene. Why do I care more about Wilhelm then next to any other character in the film? He's only in one scene and has near no lines himself, so why do I care about him? Because we're given emotioanal attachment to him, he's a new father who just had his child, a child who will be fatherless is he dies. We also know his a conscript meaning that he most likely doesn't strongly align himself with Nazi values. Him calling Hammersmark a traitor makes sense within the context, he's most likely seen countless friends die at the hands of American and British soldiers, so why would he see the Allies as so called 'good guys'. This is an issue. The fact that I care more about random Wilhelm's death than I do for any other character displays the absence of development any of the characters emotionally detaches the audience from the film, resulting in a lack of emotional weight in almost every scene.<br/><br/>However, Inglourious Basterds had it's highlights, the most notable of which was Christoph Waltz's acting. He truly has back issues from holding up this film, engaging the audience anytime he came onto screen and making what could have been a boring villain the best part of the movie. The second was, as I said before, how stylistically incredible it was. However, I'm not going to go on and on about that as anyone who has ever seen a Tarantino film should know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Finally, how could it be better?<br/><br/>IT SHOULD BE ABOUT SHOSANNA<br/><br/>The film opens with the death of Shosanna's family creating emotional weight for her as character as we now understand her motivations behind her actions. If the Basterds didn't exist her plan to set the theatre on fire would then have more weights if it didn't work there would actually be consequences to the end result. Her relationship with Marcel would've had time to develop and make their ending have more impact, as well as reveal, beyond the fact that they're in a relationship and Nazi's are bad, Marcel's motivations to die to kill hundreds of prominent Nazi figures. Furthermore, in the actual film Shosanna's connection to Landa in never a main plot point and by entering the film around her his role could be upgraded to obtain more screen time (which would only improve the film).<br/><br/>In the end, I rated Inglourious Basterds 6/10 because despite the problems with character and plot that I've just gone on about it's still a fun movie to watch but I'm just disappointed because I feel that it could have been so much better."
"zbestwick","10","0","2","16 December 2019"," Cinema That Sends a Message
","Inglourious Basterds exists on three levels:<br/><br/>1. The literal level, wherein a group of soldiers and a Jewish woman in hiding try to kill Hitler in order to end the Second World War. The events of this movie alone warrant a high rating, it's a vibrant and exciting film full of expertly written dialogue and great action.<br/><br/>2. The first metaphorical level- commentary on WWII. Tarantino relays his thoughts on Nazis through this film, a revenge story. The Basterds' actions often mirror those of the Nazis themselves (marking their victims, killing without remorse, etc.) In the end we get to see Hitler and Nazi Germany come to the end they deserved, the end we all wish they'd have come to in reality: They get, shot, blown up, and burnt to a crisp. It's cathartic, and it makes the point that figures like Hitler belong in the bowels of Hell, and they deserved a taste of their own medicine.<br/><br/>3. The second metaphorical level- commentary on the role of cinema. This is the most important message Mr. Tarantino has to deliver, and it is not one that is easy to decipher. Nation's Pride, the film-within-a-film, is a Nazi propaganda film wherein countless American soldiers die at the hands of a German soldier. This film is received with applause by its Nazi audience, Hitler included. The movie itself, Inglourious Basterds, involves countless Germans dying at the hands of American soldiers, and was met with universal audience acclaim. Coincidence? Absolutely not. Is Tarantino criticizing his audience? I do not know, but this film's true meaning lies here.<br/><br/>Basterds is a treasure trove of symbolism, and it just might be the greatest movie ever."

","""Utivich, this might just be my masterpiece"" Tarantino quite possibly is breaking the fourth wall and addressing the audience in this last line of the film. Inglourious Basterds is in fact Tarantino's masterpiece as it not only perfectly blends his broken up chapter format story telling and querky style with what is likely the masterclass in dramatic irony that would leave even Hitchcock the master of suspense in awe. The directing is possibly Tarantino's best even over Pulp Fiction, and dialogue keeps one hooked to the end as usual for Tarantino. Your eyes can't look away even for a moment! Also one of my personal favorite villain portrayals of all time by Christoph Waltz as he shows absolute command of the screen and steals ever scene he is in even if one is rooting against him."
"jaredpahl","9","0","3","26 November 2019"," Inglourious Basterds is an Expertly Written Time Bomb. The Blast is Worth the Wait.
","The importance of a good ending cannot be overstated. Take the case of Quentin Tarantino's nazi revenge fantasy, Inglourious Basterds. The majority of the 6th film by Tarantino is talky, a bit slow, not quite as thrilling as you might expect from Quentin. But even if these early scenes, as literate, beautifully shot, and tense as many of them are, don't grab you completely, they serve as foundation to what becomes one of the most daring, insane, masterful endings of all-time.<br/><br/>The movie is told in four chapters. Chapter One is a prologue of sorts introducing us to the two main players in the story, Hans Landa, The Jew Hunter, and Shosanna, an escaped Jewish girl who eventually inherits a Parisian cinema. It's a classic showcase for Tarantino dialogue, with two men at a table playing the most subtle of mind games with each other. It's also the first chance for Christoph Waltz to show off the joie de vivre he brings to Landa, a highly intelligent nazi hitman. Chapters Two through Four are also slow, dialogue-driven set-up pieces. The Basterds are introduced, Brad Pitt's team of Jewish soldiers, Hellbent on murdering as many Nazis as they can before the war ends. So is Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl), a German war hero and star of A Nation's Pride, the fictional propaganda film created for this movie. Lastly comes a British spy unit, headed by Michael Fassbender's scene-stealing Lt. Archie Hicox and German actress-turned-double-agent Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger). As the plot moves forward, we realize that each thread is leading to the same place, the Nazi premiere for A Nation's Pride.<br/><br/>With Tarantino's dialogue propping them up, and these actors filling them with such vitality, the scenes building up to Chapter Five are never less than watchable. A Tarantino scene cannot go on too long. In this film, even the mundane things, the eating of strudels or the playing of a card game, are laced with multiple layers of tension. It's hard to explain good dialogue except to say that when it has the rhythm and colorful vocabulary of Tarantino's does, you don't want it to stop. Also watchable are the performances, with standout turns from the aforementioned Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender. Waltz is the main acting attraction, oozing a kind of satisfied mastery over the art of evil. He is stunning from the get go. But Fassbender is the overlooked gem of the bunch, in a small part that he makes brilliantly large. His dutiful British agent is a fabulous creation, smart, sophisticated, and intimidating. He bloody rocks!<br/><br/>Then comes Chapter Five, Revenge of the Giant Face. What a ride these last twenty minutes or so are. Perceptive viewers may feel they know precisely what's going to happen come the big premiere. The revenge plot/war-ending sabotage mission is spelled out along the way, lighting the fuse for an eventual explosion. The genius of this script is that just when we are finally ready to sit back and watch the fireworks, things begin to change directions in ways we didn't see coming. Surprise after surprise left me awe-struck (One such moment happens to be one of the best laugh lines of recent memory, ""Grazie!""). It's a cascading wave of resolutions that seem to come out of nowhere, yet we realize were totally inevitable. Of course there is also delirious, shocking violence, and some terrifying, iconic, monumental imagery. These images sear themselves into your memory for weeks. The whole film is exquisitely photographed by Robert Richardson, but the ending rises to another level entirely. For a film to coast along for two hours as a buttoned-up suspense yarn, only to evolve rapidly into a work of insane madness, it had to have been made by a filmmaker as creatively liberated as Quentin Tarantino. So many directors, even the great ones, work off existing templates. They accomplish certain goals with skill. Tarantino makes his own goals and his own methods of reaching them.<br/><br/>Like a great magic act, Inglourious Basterds lulls us into trusting our own intuition, before revealing something utterly unexpected. If you were to only watch through Chapter Four, Basterds would seem like a disparate collection of stories loosely tied together with thematic similarities. The movie would be a suitably tense, very well-constructed, middle-of-the-road war picture. It's that balls-to-the-wall madness of Chapter Five that retroactively infuses the rest of the film with significance. After being blown away by a swift burst of provocative violence, all of a sudden, Inglourious Basterds is a whole lot more interesting.<br/><br/>94/100"

"CesaCine","10","0","4","17 September 2019"," One of the best from Quentin Tarantino
","Inglourious Basterds is one of my favourite movies of all time and i'll tell you why.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is a 2009 movie by Quentin Tarantino set in 1941 when the Nazis occupied France. In the first chapter Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) is introduced. Landa is the main antagonist of the film and in the first chapter he is looking for the Dreyfus family in France, however, Landa finds them but Shosanna Dreyfus is the only survivor.<br/><br/>One of the first things you notice about the film is the great acting, amazing ambience of France during the WWII, Ennio Morricone's music is extraordinary and the writing and directing of Quentin Tarantino is still spectacular. The 2 hours and 30 minutes of film are worth it.<br/><br/>My only problem with the film is the ending of Hans Landa but apart from that the movie is incredible.<br/><br/>I think every award that the movie won is totally deserved and I would recommend it to everyone who likes war or dark comedy dramas. It's certainly one of the best movies from the writer and director Quentin Tarantino without doubts."

"Koma-Mo","9","0","3","16 September 2019"," Tarantino's take on a war film.
","This is Tarantino's take on a war film, mixing his style that he has perfected and used throughout his career and it works perfectly well here. The amount of detail that he adds to this movie is splendid and I really liked how much he focuses more on the dramatic side than the action. You still have your over the top violence, in which I enjoy watching, but it worked well here and it never went overboard. What does happen may surprise some people as Tarantino does something that does deviate itself from reality and enters his fantasy. Thanks to his craft, there are also several scenes here that really increases the tension and had me on the edge of my seat thinking what will happen. Because anything can happen at any minute, he expects us to expect the unexpected and when something does happen, you'll end up being surprised with the outcome and maybe get a laugh out of it, as I tend to laugh with the wildness and surprise of what occurs.<br/><br/>One thing that does have to be said though is that this is Tarantino's world, so it's best not to expect this film to follow history to a tee. Just like in ""Kill Bill,"" he tells the story in chapters and he implements these characters together as we get to know who they are, along with seeing them intertwine with each other for the climax. With great pacing and pure entertainment sprinkled throughout the film, fans will be able to enjoy it and be invested in the plot. However, I do have to say that the subplot involving Shosanna was a little weak. Her character is interesting and I am invested in her plan. However, even though the performances were great here, I felt that Frederick Zoller, portrayed by Daniel Bruhl, was fairly uninteresting. His character was a little too oblivious to how Shosanna feels, which made him a bit obnoxious and didn't have anything to do until the climax. Felt more like he was needed for the plot to happen and was not really a memorable character compared to everyone else. You do understand the pain that he feels, but other than that, he felt like the weakest character out of everyone.<br/><br/>I liked that Tarantino went for more of a foreign approach here with the majority of the film being dialogue not spoken in English. As the film has characters involved in foreign lands, it's a pretty risky but smart move to have these characters speak in their native tongue rather than going for the safe route of having them speak English. Most of the cast was not well known to regular moviegoers at the time and they had the most time on the screen. It even went so far to the point of having someone like Brad Pitt not playing a major role and being pushed to the side line until the third act of the film. Not having your top billing actor throughout the movie is a bold decision, but it is also a very nice decision as all of the performances were great and it allows us to see more great actors who we can look forward to seeing. Everyone did a great job, but most of all, Christoph Waltz. His character was very unpredictable and was so fun to see every time he was on screen. When he appears, he steals the show and you know that something is bound to happen with him appearing on the scene. His presence alone adds the tension and unpredictability on what will occur.<br/><br/>There are a few scenes that do feel out of place, such as having a blacksploitation logo pop out of nowhere to introduce a character, along with having some of the minor characters in Aldo's squad being put to the sidelines, not having any major to do throughout the movie; even to the point of disappearing without explanation. Some of these can be nitpicks and I do admit that. But in the end, this film is still fun to watch and is another great film by Tarantino."
"ronakkotian","9","0","3","6 September 2019"," Bloody sensational!!!
","Quentin Tarantino is one of those few directors who never had a misstep. I haven't seen all his films but from the ones I've seen, I could tell that this man had a huge talent and passion for cinema. Once again, he stands his ground.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is about a group of Jewish American soldiers who plan to assassinate the Nazi rulers in France during World War II. At the same time, a cinema owner plans for the assassination as well.<br/><br/>What I love about Tarantino's films, aside from the violence, is the characters and dialogues to go along with them. This film has all of that and more. It's hard for me to say which spot Inglourious Basterds takes compared to the rest of Tarantino's filmography but I'm certain that it'll be high up.<br/><br/>Just everything in this film is done so well that you're in constant awe at what you're witnessing. The opening scene alone had me transfixed to the screen. What really sold me were the constant interactions between characters. Majority of the film is dialogue driven rather than gory, over the top violence which is what I loved. I enjoyed listening to the conversations each character since they defined what kind of person they were. If you consider watching this movie just because of the violence then you may be disappointed. The film does have Tarantino's repetitive use of violence but this film mainly revolves around the characters.<br/><br/>The acting overall was solid. Brad Pitt and his team of 'Basterds' were entertaining to watch. They all worked well together and some of the comedic scenes were really funny. As soon as you find out what his team are all about, you immediately root for them based on the entire premise of the movie. The same can be said about Mélanie Laurent. As the movie takes place during a time of unimaginable cruelty and savagery, you want to see these people emerge victorious. However, the best part of this film is undoubtedly Christoph Waltz. He is so good in this movie. I have to praise him a lot because his dialogue delivery was immaculate. You hate his character but at the same time you enjoy seeing him. Tarantino deserves a lot of praise as well since the lines he wrote for Waltz seemed so intriguing. Waltz's expression and tone made his role feel believable. You're not meant to cheer for him but you do anyway.<br/><br/>The direction is brilliant. If you're familiar with Tarantino's work then this shouldn't come as a surprise. The use of violence was handled really well. The violence wasn't there for just looks. Every time you see it, it has a sense of purpose. The pacing was well done. I couldn't believe how fast 2 hours 30 minutes went by.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is definitely one of Quentin Tarantino's best works. There are some great memorable characters and performances from everyone involved. The dialogue is phenomenal and above all, it's a blast to watch."

","Quentin Tarantino is indisputably an unique filmmaker, always bringing his own voice and personality to a film when he is behind the camera. However, Inglourious Basterds is his worst film due to its excess. For me, there is a QT Scale, where at one end is Jackie Brown and the other is this film. Everything Tarantino is magnified to an extent that it kind of distracts. The extreme violence, the quirky dialogue, and the homages to other films feel as though Tarantino is directing with one hand, if you get my drift. It's ludicrously self-indulgent nature is painful. That said, it isn't any less fun to watch. Tarantino directing with one hand down his pants is still better than a lot of other directors. Well-acted and well-shot, its compelling characters and fantastic performances will have your eyes glued to the screen for its runtime, leading to a climax that is horrifying, tragic, and cathartic all at the same time."

The first scene is filled with so much suspense as we are introduced to Col. Hans Landa in which I think Christoph Waltz gives one of the best performances I have seen in any films. The dialogue for being multi-lingual is extremely well written and easy to follow. The plot is very complex but with Tarantino's right writing and directing it all comes together and leaves you wanting more. I will say this masterpiece is very violent and knowing that going in is very important if your not into violence. That being said, a lot of the violence is very realistic and makes you feel like you are killing Nazis right alongside Lt. Aldo Raine (played by Brad Pitt who gives a strong performance as well). This film is extremely intense and full of suspense and humor as well as a lot of satire and a great original score.

I would advocate watching this movie on double speed if you are prone to boredom during prolonged scenes as I am. One identifies with the main characters, as they are on a mission that is generally considered the height of morality and manliness. The plot is clear and no one can argue with the motivation of the characters to accomplish their goal, but the approach to preventing this otherwise compelling mission is a little less than graceful; though it is an action-adventure movie, not a poetic painting, so grace is not a necessity.

","23 August 2009. Curiously, this movie is repulsive, depressing, and despicable. Regardless of personal taste, this movie also contains some of the most amazing acting performances and brilliant scenes of psychological intensity this year (2009). Director Quenting Tarantino continues his propensity for violence and in this movie even more raw, graphic almost indulgent use. There are echos of KILL BILL editing and storyline presentation that is a bit derivative while there are captivating musical verses reminiscent from HANGING AND PICNIC ROCK (1979) and the energizing musical score from MANHUNTER (1976). Unfortunately, unlike Steven Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993), the German characters while presented with some authenticity, none of them have any redeeming value as human beings, perpetuating the stereotypical monster inherent in the Nazi race, perhaps allowing for the pervasive slaughter on screen. Instead of a more well-rounded, conflicted performances, Tarantino sticks with the more straight-forward action-thriller without moral conflicts which would have made for a more serious drama.

","On the whole, 'Inglorious Basterds' is a very entertaining, if sporadic in tone, film. The two and a half hours does not seem to drag, with several different strands to the story providing needed variation. Some elements to the story are much more intriguing than others however, with Brad Pitt's storyline standing out as simplistic, slapstick, bizarre and downright out of place.
The real reason why every film lover should see this film are two scenes which I will not spoil, but will remain with the viewer for a very long time. One is the very first scene, and the other takes place in a bar. Acting, direction and dialogue which will come to define Tarantino films.
Another interesting aspect of this film is that very little of it is actually in English. This really makes it unique for a 'blockbuster' American movie, and adds authenticity to an otherwise ludicrous (at times) affair.
Overall, entertaining, incredible acting (especially from Waltz) and featuring trademark sizzling Tarantino dialogue. It does not always strike the right tone, but two sequences in particular improves it from a good film to a great film."

","Inglorious basterds is a war film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino in 2009.In this film there are two main characters.They are Shosanna and Lt.Aldo Raine.Shosanna is a young French Jewish cinema proprietor who wants to get revenge from the Nazis for assassination of her family.Lt.Aldo Raine is a leader of the Jewish American team named ""Basterds"" . There are 8 Jewish American soldiers in that team. Shosanna and Aldo are planing to assassinate the Nazi leader in Germane .In this film we have to talk about col.Hans Landa.He is my favorite character.He is a very sharp detective and he act as a very trivial person but he is not a trivial character.he is very serious in his case.Christoph Walts won a Oscar for this extraordinary character .Now I would like to talk about the sound track of this film.This sound track was originally released on August 18,2009.This sound track express our feelings very well.When I listen to this music I feel that this sound track explains each characters feelings.This sound track nominated for Grammy award for best compilation soundtrack for visual media.In Inglorious Basterds Brad Pitt 's character has rope burn/scars around his neck,indicating he was lynched or hanged but that he managed to escape .These scars are never mentioned to once in the entire film.Tarantino said he'd written a story for his scar but finally decided to leave it up to audience.Tarantino is a great film director who uses strong dialogues for his films.So finally I think this film describes about justice and the war.Shosanna finally get her justice and the war finishes from that."

","It's a good fantasy movie for those of us who would have liked to see Hitler punished for his war crimes. But reality laughs at this far-fetched tale. The climax shows Hitler and his top brass in a movie theatre with all but 2 guards, leaving the members of the Inglorious Basterds freedom to run amok in the theatre doing what they please. Really? Megalomaniacs such as Hitler are always paranoid about their security and would have a battalion in and around the theatre protecting the vicinity at all costs. Secondly what seemed silly is Hans Landa (Christopher Waltz) making a deal with the Americans, without having any bargaining chip in the hand. After the Americans had won the war, they had no reason to follow through conditions put by a known war criminal. It's like the law giving the hostage taker what he wants after he lets his hostages go. Absurd !! I guess Hans Landa was depending on the strict scout's honor code. Tarantino didn't think that far and he didn't think the audience would either. Lastly, Plastic surgery was very much prevalent in the 40's so Hans Landa, after being defaced with the mark of a swastika could have it easily removed. So, what's the point? All in all, childish and not a very believable take on an historical event."

","SPOILER:<br/><br/>I was not a bit surprised by the rating of this movie. It's a Brad Pitt movie and who doesn't like Brad Pitt. He has been known to make a pretty good action movie and is a top-rated actor. That being said, this movie is not for the faint of heart and is not one I would let my children watch. This movie has a great deal of bloodshed and action, with a ton of foul language. This is combined with plenty of gross scenes. In which I found myself looking away several times as I was utterly grossed out. That being said, I did enjoy the story-line, as it flowed very well. There are also several historical references and historical characters mentioned in the movie. Many are not entirely accurate but close enough for anyone who is a bit of a history buff. <br/><br/>The movie does take place in Nazi-occupied France during WWII, where a team called the basterds was tasked with eliminating the Nazi's. However, their leader takes it step further by requesting 100 Nazi scalps from each of his men. The men then receive news that there is going to be a movie premiere in which all of the top Nazi officials will be attending. As a bonus, Hitler will be there as well. They begin to lay out their mission to take down the regime with the help of a double agent. They are unaware that there is a third party who is also interested in killing all of these top Nazi officials. <br/><br/>The editing of the movie jumps back and forth and is not very smooth. I suspect that this was intentional. Since the film was depicted as a book by showing chapter's in-between some of the scenes.<br/><br/>The special effects were great despite being gross, and they were very realistic. Especially during the scalping scenes. Those scenes caused me to look away. <br/><br/>Even though I was grossed out by many of the scalping and beating scenes, I still found myself captivated by the movie. The movie ending is, of course, wholly fictional but entertaining nonetheless. It would have been great if the war did end with Hitler being killed by American troops in public rather than committing suicide hidden away in a bunker. It is a great action flick, and I do recommend it to anyone who can stomach all of the gore and foul language."

The dancing dialogue draws tension from the simplest of situations, but it can lend to a generally slower feeling earlier on. Luckily, that subsides quickly so, despite the fact that there isn't an incredible amount of substance - though, more than in Tarantino's previous two attempts, 'Kill Bill (2003-2004)' and 'Death Proof (2007)', it is still an entertaining experience overall. 7/10"

","""Inglourious Basterds"" (2009) is a pride inducing war drama that makes the viewer root for the home team throughout their vulgar methods. The film takes place in the World War II era where the Nazi-occupied France is being torn apart by a team of Jewish-American soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine, played exquisitely by Brad Pitt. The perspective of this film isn't from a single person like many other successful films, but from a group of individuals as they take on the 3rd Reich. <br/><br/>The pacing of this film is perfect for the story it displays. Even though some viewers may be turned off by Tarantino's trademark out time shifting sequences, I urge viewers to embrace it because it allows the film to keep the audience intrigued. When you think there is a moment that is not understandable, just wait, the sequences will explain themselves. I think the point of this film was to show a heighten sense of history while instilling American pride for those fighting for what's right. This film is outstanding and a must see especially for those that enjoy a good war movie."

","Tarantino has always been a bit of an indulgent filmmaker to me. Script full of lengthy scenes filled with at least one 'speech-ifying', righteous characters that sound all a bit similar; sumptuous visuals; classic score; lengthy running times and at least a touch of unnecessary violence.<br/><br/>This film isn't a new take on things. It does look good, and sound great too -- the man certainly knows the craft. Most of the dialogue-heavy 'someone's going to be found out' scenes are at least led by a delightfully bonkers Christoph Waltz,<br/><br/>An OK effort, 30mins too long and still manages a rather pointless (if loud) denouement. <br/><br/>He's done better, and worse."
"espoeth","2","0","1","3 January 2018"," Tarantino succeeds
","What this film succeeds in doing, in my opinion, is to accurately show what thirst for revenge does to the human psyche. Where other films might show the Germans as the ""baddies"", this film manages to make the viewer look at the German military as more restrained, cultured, dignified and human. They are with the arts, cinema/music, languages, are polite and courteous. Conversely, the Americans and Allies are painted as uneducated, uncultured, sub-human animalistic savages. While neither of these extremes, of course, represent the whole truth, Tarantino seems to intentionally role-reverse the good guy/bad guy concept in this film, particularly. Whether he is doing it to make a statement about the evils of war is dubious. What's clear is that the audience is not cheering on the Jewish cinema owner, whose terrorism / suicide plot is almost Satanic in its portrayal, nor are they cheering on the ""basterds"".<br/><br/>This film is not meant to be a parody or commentary on history, but simply a spectacle of unimaginably immoral conduct; where many reviewers might see it a justification of violence, it is plain to see that each member of the ""Inglorious Basterds"", as well as the cinema owner and her accomplice, is in fact motivated by the age-old fallacy of redemption through revenge, which never ends in redemption or satisfaction, but only in tragedy, loss and suffering."

"ericventura","8","0","1","19 June 2017"," Quentin Tarantino is Quentin Tarantino
","Quentin Tarantino is Quentin Tarantino. Inglorious Basterds is a blend of film genres from war to western, drama to comedy, and tragedy to satire, producing a film enshrined in poetic justice between the hunter and the hunted.<br/><br/>Tarantino seems like a kid in a candy shop, too excited to pick just one thing so he picks them all. Thus, this movie ends up as a genre mosh pit. Maybe he's confused or maybe he has a piercing and stylistic direction to his recent films. For sure, he has his own stylistic twists reminiscent of classical films and spaghetti westerns. From the opening credits, the viewer is transported back fifty or more years to Sergio Leone films, most notably The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966). Yet, this simple stylistic twist sets the stage for the rest of the film as a movie set during World War II in the style of a western.<br/><br/>Each scene separated from the rest of the piece is a masterpiece itself. From the perfectly timed editing that leaves out just enough to the harrowing musical composition and its blend of modern and Ennio Morricone. The acting is mostly average (with the exception of Brad Pitt, who stands out as a mediocrity) except for Christoph Waltz, who chills from the opening scene. He sets the tone when he steps on the screen. And his negotiations scene is so riveting that the antsiest dog would be fixated on his performance. Something about his mannerisms, his confidence, his facial expressions, his tone of voice, makes his performance worthy of each award he received, should mark him as an exemplary actor, and earn his place in the best performances in cinematic history. The filming of individual scenes is perfect, but put together, they have problems.<br/><br/>While Tarantino frames the story as a western, he fails to emphasize the structure as clearly as Leone. He fails to pronounce the poetic justice that makes up a great portion of the film. He fails to accentuate the irony of the hunter and hunted that makes up the majority of his thematic development. He leaves his characters as static statues with only personality in order to develop everything else, but the film remains non-cohesive. Possibly, the structure of the film into chapters may have thrown off the fluidity of the piece. Tarantino attempts the delicate structure of Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages (1916), but instead achieves the loose structure of Memento (2000).<br/><br/>Additionally, the plot is fragile and poorly thought out. But he deserves a pass for artistic license."

We have here a rereading of the second war ala Tarantino, to where the Nazis are hunted, first I would like to talk about the first 20 minutes of this movie are fabulous, yes, the first scene lasts 20 minutes, is long, I know, but she did not seasick, quite the contrary, you delighting in every second of it, quite the Christoph Waltz acting work, which is quite spectacular in the film, completely stealing the Brad Pitt scene in the movie, the soundtrack not only that scene, but whole film is spectacular, really, in terms of soundtrack, Tarantino is unique. The photograph of the film is really unbelievable, but this first scene is something surreal, has a color palette with lots of black, gray, white, but has a strong red, it is very balanced, it's really beautiful, all the merits here for Robert Richardson and Sally Menke, not counting the camera angles, it looks like the camera in Tarantino movies is exactly positioned in the place it should be. Well, since we talk about performances, as we talk about photography, we have spoken soundtrack, go to the strength of Quentin, the script, the script is great, a little confused, and some other elongated scenes (like the tavern) and does not have much of those characteristic dialogues Quentin (will not be the opening scene), but it's a good script, which tells a story of revenge to global levels, and creates a character that is already in the history of contemporary cinema, Hans Landa , who speaks French, Italian, German and English and let me terrified enemies with a painted humor, humor that is very well applied in the film.

","Quentin Tarantino returns with the story of the Basterds, a group of Jewish soldiers performing guerilla warfare and terror tactics behind enemy lines to strike fear into the hearts of German soldiers during World War II. Inglourious Basterds is a very difficult film to pigeonhole. It's part Jewish revenge fantasy, part gung ho war film, part knowing parody of patriotic flag wavers and 100% Tarantino. His trademark patchwork of styles and references is as evident as ever; the opening scenes are pure Leone, turns into The Dirty Dozen and then zig zags off on tangents all over the place. It's impossible not to enjoy a film with this premise and Brad Pitt's hilarious send up of a hick war hero is almost as good as Christoph Waltz's high camp evil Sherlock Holmes (complete with pipe). But I'd have to say much of the film that does not feature these two could've stood for some judicious pruning and very oddly for a Tarantino film, the soundtrack sometimes just did not work."

Apart from him the main actors did a phenomenal job.<br/><br/>Now, back to the important part. Whats so different about this movie from the others it's that...

Tarantino himself has said that Waltz ""gave him his movie"".<br/><br/>Also, the whole ""chapter"" idea is nice, though, from Chapter 3, they are not so well defined and the idea gets lost. <br/><br/>Other actors are also doing a fine job. Tarantino's directing is obviously improved from his first films, is good and interesting.<br/><br/>The script, if you forget the silly ""alternate WW II"" setting, is, in general, interesting, showing, in several different ""angles"", the ""nerve games/battles"" that are often not shown in movies - because it is hard to do. Yet, here, they are all well done (of course, Chapter 1 being superior to others).<br/><br/>Also, I like that there is much less blood pumping around than in other Tarantino movies. That got old with Reservoir Dogs.<br/><br/>But, the silly ""alternate WW II"" setting is way to silly, it becomes a real issue. It's not funny enough to warrant this level of silly. Were it less silly, or were it stripped of WW II references, and portrayed some ""generic war"", it would not be (such a) problem. As is, it wanders, at times, into the ""revenge porn"" movie kind of thing, which is never good.<br/><br/>Also, it's too long. I understand the idea was to depict the ""mind games"", and that takes time, but, for example, the Whole Chapter 2 could have been stripped and just given as some back-story in later chapters. Especially since it is the weakest and most ""borderline revenge porn"" of all chapters.<br/><br/>There are some other aspects I don't like, but, those are ""Tarantino trademarks"", so, it doesn't make much sense to waste time on discussing them.<br/><br/>Bottom line: although not entertaining as some other Tarantino films, this is certainly worth a watch."

Everything about it was enjoyable for me. This characters are enjoyable and memorable. The cinematography does everything it needs to in order to enhance the story. The setting is convincing and rich with detail. Oh man, I could go on for hours. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa was spectacular. The opening scene of this film is one of my favorite ever. Brad Pitt was deliciously entertaining and bad ass. It's just, wow, such a great film. Easy 10/10."

","This movie is a dark comedic historical fiction where Lt. Aldo (Brad Pitt) the leader of the Inglorious Basterds was given a mission to end the war. The counterpart to the bastards story line is Shosanna and it begins with her family being found under the floorboards of their neighbors house and being slaughtered by the Jew hunter (Hans Londa) Shosanna barely escaped.The movie is broken into chapters and moves from Shosanna's life to the bastards fighting but then in the final chapter they meet with the same goal in mind. Tarantino portrayed the American Nazi hunters as ruthless killers who don't standby morals they do what they have to do to put a dent in the Nazi population. Also, Tarantino loosely if at all uses actual events and Hitler's death in the movie is inaccurate and irrational. I gave the movie a 7 because I enjoyed the comedy, the gruesome fighting, and the way the plot progressed. Tarantino use many different shot and I found it interesting that he shot some of Hitlers scenes at eye level; instead of the usual low angle and/or Dutch angle associated with criminals and people in power. Overall the movie in fiction but a laugh for someone with a dark sense of humor."
"cartesianthought","6","0","2","20 December 2015"," I'm a big fan of Tarantino but this one left me disappointed.
","Tarantino took an overly popular topic of history, applied with the ideas of revenge justice and the role of cinema. <br/><br/>To this movie's credit, the stage design and costumes were expertly done and it's slightly more intelligent and witty than your average. Christoph Waltz as the charismatic and terrifying Hans Landa was made for the movie's best moments, but none of the other cast members truly stood out. <br/><br/>A half hour could have been easily cut from 150 minute movie. I also felt like the dialogue was a bit spoonfeeding and I would have preferred a ""show - not tell"" approach. I guess my point is that there's a really good movie hidden beneath layers of fat."

","Any film featuring a black leather trench coat, vintage fountain pen, blue-black ink, glass of fresh milk, Calabash Meerschaum pipe, and a corn-cob pipe within the first twenty minutes is okay by me. Unfortunately, out of those six items, five of them are enjoyed by a sophisticated Jew-hunting Nazi by the name of Colonel Hans Landa of the Waffen-SS (Christoph Waltz). If you listen closely to the Nazi Colonel's opening dialogue, you can distinctly experience Quentin Tarantino's writing and direction seeping through the Colonel's performance.<br/><br/>Aside from Brad Pitt (Lt. Aldo Raine) sounding like a Nascar driver from Tennessee and NOT eating throughout the movie (i.e. Ocean's Eleven), the entire cast brings this alternate universe to life. It's hard to talk about anything without completely giving away the plot, so all I'll say is that Samuel L. Jackson is no Morgan Freeman.<br/><br/>Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) is an amazingly stoic Jew bursting at the seams with revenge. Frederick Zoller (Daniel Brühl) is a perfectly humble and nice young man on Opposite Day. He's actually a huge #$%^# prick.<br/><br/>Captions captions captions. Blood. Guns. Fire. Mike Myers. German. French.<br/><br/>Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) would be a ritzy douchebag if she were a man. I suppose that would make her a douchebaguette.<br/><br/>You know what? If you were never quite satisfied with the historically accurate fate of Hitler, Inglourious Basterds is a fun way to explore a much more violent and satisfying alternate reality."

","This movie is a fantastic work of art, and one of Tarantino's best, which is saying something. People have criticized this movie for being long and boring and have said that the first scene, the bar scene, and Christoph Waltz's performance are the only enjoyable parts. This is completely, and utterly, false. Though those two scenes are brilliant and Christoph Waltz delivers one of the best performances possibly in the history of cinema, there are so many other things that these criticizers have overlooked. For instance, the entire damn movie. What the hell were those people thinking?! If you cannot see the art of this film and the brilliant, breathtaking filmmaking, you are not a true fan of cinema in the slightest, and definitely not a true Tarantino fan. Honestly this film is fantastically made in every facet of film, the acting is superb, the directing is, well... It's Tarantino. If you want a more reputable name on a film, you'd have to speak to a dead guy by the name of Alfred Hitchcock, and even then you might not be getting what you're looking for. Seriously, one of the greatest films of all time. And did I mention the writing? this story is amazing, every character is well drawn and there is literally close to nothing wrong with this film. 10/10 without a doubt."

","What a fantastic film. Everything about it is amazing. Acting is superb especially Christopher Waltz as S.S. Colonel Hans Landa. He just keeps you glued to the screen. All around wonderful film. A bit violent at times but that's expected in a Tarantino film, but his crowning achievement for sure. He should have won an Oscar for this. The soundtrack Is just perfect and really enhances every scene. And the location and cinematography just beautiful. Really makes you feel like your back in time with the actors in a small village in France during its Nazi occupation. surprisingly accurate in its depiction of the Nazis and made me want to go out and buy some books about World War Two and learn more about that time in history."

","Inglorious Bastards is a movie that I would be able to watch every month, purely because of the satirical and unique humor that it possesses. <br/><br/>Christoph Waltz demonstrates a wealth of experience in the acting field. I find it amazing how easily/quickly he can adapt into such a diverse character such as Col. Hans Landa. With the likes of Brad Pitt, Eli Roth and Michael Fassbender, these characters collaborate with each other in the most unique way to just make the film all the more humorous. <br/><br/>Definitely not a film to miss."
"blakiepeterson","10","0","1","10 July 2015"," Tarantino At His Most Mature
","Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Seinfeld of directors. Not that he's a neurotic Jewish man that carries around the weight of materialistic complaints — it's that his projects continually seem as though they're heading in one direction (let's use comedy as an example, shall we?), but end up being about nothing. Nothing as in genre, as in writing, as in plot, tend to end up being all about Tarantino and his obsessions, and not much else. If Tarantino wasn't a brilliant madman, I don't know where his films would go; can you imagine if he was a boring guy that forced us to sit through his innermost fixations?<br/><br/>Thankfully, he's never made a film resembling something hackneyed or trite; even his worst, ""Death Proof"" (which in turn was part of his double-feature project with Robert Rodriguez, ""Grindhouse""), is so gleefully entertaining that calling it bad never seems to be an option. Saying it wasn't as good as ""Kill Bill"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" would be much more accurate. Truth is, it's impossible for Tarantino to make a bad film — his weakest moments still make our cinematic senses come completely undone. <br/><br/>""Inglourious Basterds"" is his seventh film. It is also, dare I say, his most mature. His violence is as depraved as ever, and his love of the exploitation feature is at its loudest; yet ""Inglourious Basterds"" seems to be more fond of tension than pulse-pounding thrills and exchanges, dressed to the nines in conversations that always seem to end in carnage and loaded with sadistic characters whose demons are disguised by archetypes that suit them (the hero, the villain, the femme fatale). It is his most sprawling film, at nearly three hours, and it is his most highly budgeted — but here, he no longer seems like the some punky indie kid who happens to have a great ear for dialogue and a delectable eye for photography. His boyish adorations are still on display, but this time around, he's more subtle with them. <br/><br/>It's 1944, in Nazi occupied France. World War II is raging. Hitler (Martin Wuttke) is at his most powerful, not realizing that death is waiting just around the corner. But Tarantino wants you to do him a favor — forget that you ever took AP History, that you had ideas of how the war ended. Dive into his pulp fantasy. Who needs to look at Hitler as anything but a perpetually screaming, red-faced, maniacally cackling dictator when you have Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), aka ""The Jew Hunter"", tracking down Hitler's so-called vermin with smooth-talking sadism? Who needs patriotism when America is represented by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and his Inglourious Basterds, who avenge the deaths of their men by beating and scalping enemy German soldiers? Who needs a hero when you have Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), a femme planning to utilize her theater during a Nazi film premiere as retribution for the death of her family?<br/><br/>One could get offended by how willingly Tarantino rewrites history for the sake of lurid fun, but why consider obeying political correctness at a Tarantino film? Leave your prudishness at the door — I promise you'll have a better time that way. This is, after all, one of the most innovative war films ever made, if you can even call it a war film. It mocks the stupidity of the Nazis with scathing satirical pronunciation, slowly but surely assembling itself into a revenge movie more calculated than either one of the ""Kill Bills"". It's slower, more methodical in its actions — but Tarantino can hardly make something burn sluggishly. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is written and directed with a great deal of style and energy, but it is clearly realized by a filmmaker who knows his strengths and wants to show them off just as much as he wants to branch out. He often lets silence speak louder than words, and when his words speak, they seem to be laced with an assortment of explosives sure to go off. Here, everything is at stake. You can forget about the fun and games of ""Pulp Fiction"" — these characters have bigger things to worry about than pissing off the mob.<br/><br/>The performances are just as powerhouse as Tarantino's brazen inhibitions — the actors not only fit into his vision like a silky black glove; they also make use of their heightened charismas like standout character actors on the loose. Pitt is a laugh-a-minute as the Southern accented Aldo Raine; you can just as easily lose yourself as he delivers monologues to his dopey Basterds as you can when he's attempting to disguise himself as an Italian as Shosanna's movie premiere (plot twist: he fails miserably). Laurent is a succulent cocktail of bitter, droll, and ruthless, a new muse for the Uma Thurman admiring director; Diane Kruger, as double-agent/German actress Bridget Von Hammersmark, gives the film some of its best lines as the celebrity who is simply too good for this sh-t. But the film belongs to Waltz, who is so unnerving in his smarmy calmness that the second he loses his temper we can only pull back in terror.<br/><br/>""Inglourious Basterds"" is an untouchable film of sorts; even if you find its violence too aesthetically gratuitous, its humor too masochistic, you can't deny just how special of a filmmaker Tarantino is. I hate to use the word ""special"" — isn't that label used for bratty tots barely getting by anyway? — but a cinematic world without Tarantino seems like an empty one. So it's good to have a Venus Fly Trap in a grouping of poppies. There, you'll find a unique talent quick to name a cameoing Mike Myers after a giallo queen."
"heisenberg12","7","0","3","5 July 2015"," Overrated- the stupid ending ruined it
","I want to give this movie a 10, but I just cant. At times it was groundbreaking, amazing, and awesome, and at other times it was frustrating, angering, and stupid.<br/><br/>There are two scenes that I would put up as some of the best I've seen in any film in recent memory. They are masterful and unbelievably good. The only way I could break this one down is the good and the bad approach.<br/><br/>Good: Opening 20 minute scene was spectacular, the female lead Laurent was great, Christopher Waltz gives one of the best performances I've seen of the 2000s and really almost single handedly makes this movie a 10/10, the plot- I really liked the story how it all revolved around film and movies and how the plan involved the help of a famous movie star, as well as how Laurent's character was undercover and at the center of the plan, the supporting actors- the crazy guy who loves to kill Germans who the IB's recruit is a great character along with the Englishman who goes with him to pick up the movie star and all of the other major characters who had lines (except Pitt- I'll get to that in a second), the cinematography, the dialogue, the humor- wow, this was one funny movie, no doubt, and it was riveting and held your attention from start to finish despite being a dialogue driven movie. There were times it was very reminiscent of Pulp Fiction, and I absolutely loved the similarities, but it was ultimately its' own movie.<br/><br/>However, for as many good things about this movie (which is why I am so tempted to want to give it a 10, there were several letdowns.<br/><br/>Bad: First, I was so pi--ed that Shosanna(Laurent) died. It was the most disappointing and pointless death in a movie I ever seen, and it loses 1 star right there. I really liked this character and she had a solid plan going that she was executing. There was absolutely no point in her dying. I actually LOVED this character so I was very mad at the filmmakers when she got killed pointlessly. She was really the main protagonist of the film, and all they had to do was allow her to escape and live happily ever after on a farm. That was BAD scriptwriting. That's just my opinion, but seriously- there was no reason for her to die- what a letdown. <br/><br/>Second, relating to that, the whole ending sequence was a letdown and disappointing. Don't get me wrong, I loved the whole dynamite being placed and left in there, and I absolutely found it hilarious that Waltz (Landa) changed his mind and negotiated that deal- that was great, but for it just to be some big shoot-up-the place-massacre with Shosanna dead, I thought it could have been more of a caper or a twist could have been implemented to it. For example, what should have happened was the black guy, Shosanna, and the IB's left all should have escaped as the theater burned to the ground, instead of it blowing up and presumably having them die. I would have liked to have seen the black guy and Shosanna escaping like an ultimate crime caper, maybe even have them kiss in the parking lot and then show them on the farm together drinking milk or something- anything happy. <br/><br/>Also, I would have liked to have seen Hitler escape because it just didn't make sense like that- yes it's fiction and I can handle much of that, but come on, at least have SOME historical accuracy breathe here at the end. They could have had Hitler escape from the second floor somehow and crawl away wounded but still alive so at least the war went on the way it really did and there would be a connection. Lol that would have been funny and still kept with the humor. Im not saying this ruined it or anything, but it was just a little bit too far fetched and that prevented me also from giving it a 10/10. <br/><br/>Also, Brad Pitt- what was he thinking? I mean, don't get me wrong, he WAS funny and I found his character pretty funny in most of the scenes, but man, his acting in this was terrible. It was surprising that his acting was the weak link of the whole cast. I never would have thought that. Im not saying he sucks as an actor, and I know the humor was part of the role, but compared to the rest of the cast and actors/actresses who were superb and excellent, he was definitely the worst actor of the bunch, at least in this particular role. I know he's not that bad and has some talent to act, that's why I was surprised. Don't get me wrong- he wasn't the worst ever or anything like that, but he just acted pretty poorly in this, but it's funny too because I think he was just trying to be funny.<br/><br/>Other than that, this was a great movie (could've been even greater if they would have made the ending better and done some of the things I mentioned above). Christopher Waltz was absolutely amazing and I can totally see why he won the Oscar for this. If nothing more, I would say this is one funny movie (one of the strangest funny scenes was watching Hitler laugh at the movie while people are being shot- that kind of humor is so weird yet also surprisingly hilarious at the same time. I thought the actor who played Hitler was hilarious in every scene he was in)."

","This was without doubt one of my favorite Nazi war movies I've seen. A nice blend of comedic fun with harsh gritty violence makes for a very enjoyable film. Although not totally accurate at all, this movie brings an interesting twist to one of the biggest wars ever fought. When you see a film consisting of Brad Pitt and Michael Fassbender and directed by Quentin Tarantino you would assume it would deliver a good film, and it does just that.<br/><br/>As a movie lover, this film has it's quirks but doesn't take away from the actioned packed monster called Inglorious Bastards.

","I was surprised when I saw the reviews for this movie on IMDb, a lot of users hated this film. This is my favorite film so I wondered why so many hated it, and the more I read the more I realized. People totally missed the point of this film. This film was a parody of the genre and a satire on our history. Most people complained about the ridiculousness or the extreme violence. That's the point. The ridiculousness shows that Quentin meant this as genre spoof. It's a movie about a band of Jews that go past enemy lines and kill Hitler, what do you expect? The other big complaint was the extreme violence. This is a trademark of Quentin, I understand if not everyone looks at a director before they watch a movie but they should. Another point is that the extreme violence makes this a satire. All throughout the history books we are told of the extreme violence the Nazis did to the Jews, now the opposite is true. If one was to come in with no previous knowledge of the Nazis, someone might have sympathized with him. This shows the brilliance of Quentin and his best movie."

","Fast paced and action packed Inglorious Basterds sets the standards for ""no guts no glory."" This film is a must see for those who enjoy war fiction and have a taste for the blood and gore that go with it. I enjoyed this movie and would deem it as a cult classic to go along with many of Quentin Tarantino movies. The theme shows major on moral implications throughout the film.<br/><br/>Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) and Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) follow their own instincts in this film and make it come to life in their breathtaking appearances. Colonel Hans Landa ruthlessly interrogates and kills anyone not loyal to the Nazi reign. While Lt. Aldo Raine mercilessly kills Nazis with his ragtag bunch names the Inglorious Basterds. The film takes place in Nazi-controlled France during the height of the Nazi reign. The central idea was based around the motif that what the unified group of Inglorious Basterds was aimed straight at diminishing the control of the country from the Nazi tyranny. Always displaying that the ragtag group had and always gained the upper hand in the issue. In the end the good and just always conquers the evils of the villain it seems in this case with the instance at the end where Colonel Hans Landa ended with the swastika symbol on his forehead much like his predecessors before him. Colorful and distinct the phrase non guts no glory came into play as each time someone was killed there was a massive bit of blood shed added to every death in the film which was incredibly awesome.<br/><br/>The only other film that comes to mind while enjoying this film is 300 Rise of an Empire for all the bloodshed and gore that goes well with any action packed war movie. I enjoy watching films that extensively go over moral implications and this hit the spot right on. The determinant is always based on right and wrong and this depicted such quite adequately."
"brianberta","3","0","1","13 May 2015"," This has a great beginning with an okay buildup, but it fails miserably at the ending
","Many people nowadays will say that Quentin is a genius filmmaker who hasn't made anything bad before and all his films are masterpieces. But there is a small minority of people who say that while he is talented, he hasn't made anything fantastic for a while. This is probably his worst film by far.<br/><br/>I'm actually very surprised at how much praise this movie has. As other reviewers have said, the beginning is the best part. This movie builds up pretty good. It was a bit too drawn out for me but it was still pretty good. I liked learning about what the characters were planning and it was pretty entertaining.<br/><br/>But the ending was awful. It's way too fantastic and unbelievable. Especially Hitler's portrayal. The viewer cannot suspend disbelief at the unrealism. I respect liberties taken with history, but to create an ending which completely denies the actual historical events and brings the movie down to some mediocre cartoon: just mocks the viewer's intelligence.<br/><br/>Also, I really hate the way that it portrays Hitler and his guards as morons and cowards. It's just laughable.<br/><br/>This movies sadism is another major flaw. Quentin likes putting violence in his movies. It's fitting considering that WW2 was a brutal time period. But considering that the movie has a mostly straight face, Quentin takes it a bit too far. The movie shows cutting off the scalps of Nazi's, carving the swastika in their forehead, and showing Hitler getting shot 100 times even though he was probably dead after the first 5 shots.<br/><br/>Diane Kruger and Christolph Waltz gave excellent performances but Brad Pitt was not even remotely believable the second at his entrance.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""Desperado"" because it was in part a spoof and very entertaining. I disliked this one because it was too fanciful and unreal. I felt like it insulted me."
"Breh22","9","0","2","10 April 2015"," Pretty Neat
","A very very different movie in the WW2 genre. It takes some historical figures and makes them into Quentin's own creation and fate. I do have to say that if you do not like reading then this movie is not for you. A very large portion of the movie is in french and I was reading subtitle after subtitle but surprisingly wasn't bothered by it that much. I thought that it was maybe a bit too long for how little was actually going on. <br/><br/>This movie has great personality and stylish acting from major big dogs in the business. Christoph Waltz does a great job and is a stand out performer in this one. Brad Pitt's character is just funny and I appreciated his simple and short dialogue as much as I appreciated Christoph Waltz character(Hanz). In short, if you like all the other films by Quentin then you will not be disappointed."

And dragons, real dragons, essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or tale, are actually rare.Not all those who wander are lost.<br/><br/>I should like to save the Shire, if I could - though there have been times when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words, and have felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them."
"sandnair87","9","0","2","25 March 2015"," Tarantino 'In-Glorious'ly Vintage Form!
","Inglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarantino's self-indulgent love letter to war movies —his version of a war drama, with history rewritten to avenge the guilty in ways that satisfy his pop-art cinephilia. It is the vintage filmmaker's rewrite of World War II with a spaghetti western vibe and a cinephile fantasy that a movie theater could defeat the most reviled figure in human history and end all war. <br/><br/>It should be noted at the outset that Tarantino's treatment of the Second World War is unquestionably superficial. Don't look for nuance or depth or for refined scrutiny of what lay behind the Holocaust! Laying his story out in five riveting chapters, Tarantino manages to keep his densely populated tale clear. To put it curtly, the movie centers on a plan to assassinate Nazi leaders (including the Fuhrer) by a group of Jewish-American soldiers (the Basterds from the title) that coincides with a theater owner's (whose family was brutally massacred by a ghastly Jew-Hunter SS Colonel Hans Landa) vengeful plans for the same. Christoph Waltz, delivers a purring, eye-rolling, wonderfully (and intentionally) hammy performance as Col. Landa, underplaying the cold-bloodedness of the character to arresting affect. Brad Pitt is hilarious as hillbilly officer Lt. Aldo Raine, flaunting a cracker-barrel Southern drawl. The rest of the primary cast plays their parts with aplomb.<br/><br/>But, you can't help but admire Tarantino's chutzpah! Despite the wartime setting, we're still in Tarantino's universe. He assembles the tale like a juxtaposition of protracted sequences, each with copious amounts of verbal foreplay. The payoff is usually worth the wait, with telltale tough talk and violent punctuation eventually leading to a bloody massacre in almost every sequence. The violence is often extreme but it comes in bursts and has a comic book element about it. What really propels the movie, though, isn't the gun- toting but Tarantino's brilliantly ingenious dialog and self- assured direction. Nobody has giddier fun making movies than Quentin Tarantino, and it's almost contagious. In every scene, you sense him behind the camera, giggling at his handiwork, winking impishly.<br/><br/>Even the film's final line — ""I think this just might be my masterpiece"" — sounds like the writer-director being cocky through his lead actor. Inglourious Basterds reaffirms Tarantino as an impudent dude who'll err, but never on the side of caution."

","The feature is about two parallel plans to assassinate Nazi Germany's political leadership. The first one by a young French Jewish cinema proprietor (Melanie Laurent) and the other one by a team of Jewish-Americans soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). This is one of the greatest films I have seen lately because Quentin Tarentino doesn't bother himself with offending or stepping all over stereotypes and clichés. In the movie, Quentin Tarentino mixes many different nationalities, many languages such as English, French, German and a little bit of Italian. This variety is quite interesting because in the same dialog, they mix 3 or 4 languages. This movie is also very exciting because all the actors shine together, from lieutenant Aldo Raine, wonderfully played by B.P. to the colonel SS Hans Lauda (Christopher Waltz). The latter played maybe one of the most complex role I have ever seen and he smashed it. He is indeed the main character, he control the action from the beginning. The film is a picture of the entire war because spectators not only see British, American, German soldiers. They also see the world of French and Germans civilian's collaborators and resistant's. The movie is extremely funny in places, although it also turns darkly serious. What can I say apart of welcome back Tarantino."

","After have seen Inglorious Basterds by Quentin Tarantino, I can finally assert that a war film can be really different, and fun. Indeed, what makes this film unusual is the permanent irony in the dialogs and the humor of the characters. The action takes place in France during the second WW. In this context it's really rare to find a film which isn't grave. Even the atrocities are shown with the same eccentricities and exaggeration, what makes the movie something totally delirious and surprising. The story began in a french village when the colonel Lan, called Jude's hunter kills a complete family with the exception of Soshana (interpreted by M.L).In the first scene the performance of the actor is remarkable. He plays very well a very complex and paradoxical character, an heartless and cruel man but who always stays polite and calm.

After this slaughter Soshana wants to revenge her family and the film deals with the way that she is going to kill all the regents Nazis during premiere in her cinema We also follow the fight of an American army group who wants to kill all the Nazi they found.

"steamaccount_2011","9","0","2","3 March 2015"," Tarantinos best work since Pulp Fiction, without question
","I was compelled to finally create an account on IMDb after seeing the multitude of negative reviews that this title has for some reason managed to generate. I couldn't help but notice they often mention this ""talking at tables"" phrase, as if it was some kind of negative, often spouting that the only positive or redeeming feature of this film is Christopher Waltz's performance as 'Colonel Hans Landa', which is without a doubt one of the best we've seen for a long, long time. To say that his awe inspiring and completely Oscar worthy performance is the only quality to find here is without a doubt, in my mind a complete and utter fabrication.<br/><br/>This reference to the ""Talking at tables"" insult only serves to further baffle me when the best scene in this film is not only one that doesn't feature Christopher Waltz, but takes place behind a table for the largest majority of it. As you would expect from a Tarantino film, it is not driven by the stylised, often over the top violence (Kill Bill aside) but by the dialogue and direction. I am not one for spoilers so I'll refrain from leaking any, but needless to say from the very beginning of this scene you are quite quickly assaulted by an atmosphere of highly strung, brilliantly constructed tension, leaving you to wonder what on earth is going to happen next, driven entirely by pop-culture references and subtleties, what happens within this french bar is almost magic.<br/><br/>This is something that Tarantino has always been talented at; his ability to bring characters to life and create tone. Throughout this movie I couldn't help but fondly remember the apartment scene in Pulp Fiction between Jules and Brad, or the opening sequence to Reservoir Dogs(in which coincidently they are sat around a table). I was constantly reminded of just how brilliant Quinen can be when he gets something right. I cannot think of a scene in this film that I wasn't completely absorbed by, its' content is fresh, funny and at the same time remains coherent and believable.<br/><br/>The performances on the whole are across the board above par. Christopher Waltz is the stand out performer here, his portrayal of he arrogant and manipulative 'Colonel Hans Landa' has catapulted his career into a deserved upwards spiral and this role has collected almost a cult like following. Brad Pitt delivers what we have become accustomed to receiving from him; Humorous, charismatic and charming, a likable character delivered by a perfectly cast actor who eats up the dialogue as if spouting it naturally. The rest of the backing cast is similarly talented, each of them producing genuine performances that are brimming with character.<br/><br/>There are further elements about this film that are completely typical to Tarantino, the score from Ennio Morricone is expertly applied and adds to this atmospheric, magnetic piece. The shooting of the film is superb, camera work befitting the tone and clearly well directed by a master of his trade.<br/><br/>I could continue to praise this film but I fear that I would grow tired of my own words, my best piece of advice is simply; WATCH THIS FILM. As long as you are not a transformers fan,in which instance you might find the relative lack of action tedious.

","Well thanks for that Quentin Tarantino I finally made it through. I found this movie extremely frustrating because although it is well acted, suspenseful, clever, violent, funny and perfect in a lot of ways the editing (?) drove me nuts. Now I know Tarantino did it this way on purpose but it made most of the ""chapters"" with their l-o-n-g drawn out scenes and endless dialogue just painful to watch. I wanted to get on with it, and honestly found myself bored with 90% of this extended, dragged out movie.<br/><br/>Every scene just went on & on with so much unnecessary footage, that I suppose was meant to add to the suspense but honestly just made me want to hit the FF button.<br/><br/>I will say that the ending is kinda awesome (I wish it were true) and that Christopher Waltz is worthy of his Oscar and then some. The opening ""chapter"" at the French farmers house with all the pipe lighting and politeness and Shosanna! did kinda blow my mind, it was so good but jeez. 08.13"

","I was really excited to see this film! It was the new Tarantino film, and he's my favorite director, so I was crazy hyped. But then he completely ruined this film by focusing on politics instead of the Basterds. When the Basterds were on screen, my mouth was foaming with testosterone, but during every other scene, I felt like killing myself. They were so long and boring and seemingly pointless. Also, I hate how they were in foreign languages. Even if it is in Germany, you don't need to have so many conversations in German and in French. This movie could have been a great movie and one of my favorites if QT had focused more on the Basterds and their exploits, but instead he focused on seemingly everything but. I absolutely loved the scene where the Basterds are scalping the Nazis, or when the Basterds shoot everyone in the car, and I find myself quoting Lt. Aldo Raine and Sgt. Hugo Schiltz all of the time, they were such bad ass and awesome characters. Honestly, I think that this movie should have been called Inglourious Talking-in-Foreign-Languages."
"nzpedals","5","0","2","15 December 2014"," Too many flaws
","It's quite a good story and gripping, enthralling all the way through. It's only afterwards you might realise that it is total fiction even though set in the midst of real events – that gets confusing. <br/><br/>There are four main characters. In the order of the merit of their performances, Christoph Waltz plays Hans Landa, a German Army officer who has the job of hunting down Jews in France in 1941. He is smart, suave, and charming, but ruthless, heartless and in the end, devious and scheming in looking after his own neck and wallet. Waltz does a superb job.<br/><br/>Equally good is Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus who then becomes Emmanuelle Mimieux, the owner and operator of a small cinema in Paris. She knows about Landa and fears him, and shows it. When Landa leaves, her relief also shows. She is calm and collected as she plans and carries out the dramatic ending. <br/><br/>Acting is more than just saying the words of the script, really great actors show in the expression, the emotion needed. Waltz and Laurent both do this very well. <br/><br/>Daniel Brühl is Frederik Zoller, a sniper in the German Army who gets a propaganda film made about him that Goebbels want to use. He meets Emmanuelle and tries to befriend her. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt plays Aldo Raine, of Apache and Jewish descent. He leads a clandestine band who ambush isolated German patrols, kill all but one of them and disfigure the survivor to send a message to all Nazis. Alas, Pitt is mediocre in this role, unconvincing and sometimes looking hopelessly out of place. He never gives thoughtful emphasis to anything said. Disappointing and perhaps a failing in directing? <br/><br/>Other flaws are that they could have done a much better job in finding a Hitler look-alike, and the same for Churchill – Timothy Spall does a better job of that. There are a lot of scenes with sub-titles. If I read the S-Ts, I might miss the actors performance? They conveniently speak English quite a lot. Then there are the hand-written sub-titles to tell us who various characters are, as if we really cared whether Goring and others are in the plot?"
"sn319","8","0","1","6 December 2014"," Ingloriously Wonderful
","If you're not big into Tarantino films, you'll find yourself bored sitting through Inglorious Basterds. It's a film that spends a lot of time talking and setting itself up rather than moving. In that regard, it's a typical Tarantino movie. And that's what I love, the witty banter and well-rounded characters that comprise every movie Tarantino makes. And that's how this movie works so well.<br/><br/>The Basterds are a group of Jews fighting the Nazis to get revenge for their fallen brethren. They scalp Nazis after killing them and are really unsavory characters. Brad Pitt plays their leader, Aldo Raine, and he is the star. From his ridiculous accent to his comedic dialog (especially his attempt at speaking Italian), he's wonderful.<br/><br/>The film sets itself up nicely but, the biggest problem and one I touched upon, it can dry up a little bit. It's not that the film is boring, it's that it runs overlong due to long-winding discussion. Tarantino is a master of this sort of dialog when in a more modern setting but the World War II setting didn't allow for as much comedy. It had it's funny moments, but most of it was subtitled banter between hero and villain.<br/><br/>The main idea of the movie is that a Jewish girl who escaped from being slaughtered three years before has inherited a theater and the Nazi's will use it to premiere a violent movie about a single German killing hundreds of Americans. The Fuhrer as well as all of the higher ranking Nazis will be there. She finds it a perfect opportunity to kill them all. As do the Basterds, which is when sparks literally start to fly.<br/><br/>The finale of this movie is brief but glorious, but it's also baffling. Tarantino humanizes the Nazis while completely decimating them. He has one talk about his family and makes that the point of a scene but then turns them into cannon fodder. It's like he wants to say Nazi's are people too, then say ""Screw Nazis"".<br/><br/>While the message is a little mixed, the movie itself is an enjoyable ride."
"Barev2013","10","0","1","22 November 2014"," Glorious rewriting of history as it should have been
","""Tarantino's INGLOURIOS BURSTERDS"" by Alex Deleon for August 26, 2009<br/><br/>I have never been a great Quentin Tarantino fan (I hated ""Pulp Fiction"" and walked out of ""Reservoir Dogs"") but right off the bat I will have to say that even if he doesn't get an Oscar this year, Mr. Q. should at least get a medal – the Congressional Medal of Honour (of Poland and Israel?) – for telling it like it should have been, even if it wasn't quite actually that way. Any person of Jewish persuasion who does not stand up and cheer at various points in this tremendous historical revision comedy isn't worth his (or her) weight in schmaltz. And any Gentile person of liberal democratic red blood who doesn't let out a few whelps of ""Amen"", or ""right on"", during the proceedings, needs to be taken out into the alley and shot in the head.<br/><br/>The basic plot: A merciless vengeance unit composed mainly of Jewish commandos under the leadership of a delightfully southern drawling Lt. Brad Pitt (best thing he's ever done!) is parachuted into Nazi occupied France in 1941, their mission, to strike total terror into the hearts of all Germans by not only brutally slaughtering every German soldier they can get their hands on, but scalping them American Indian style, bashing their brains out with baseball bats (another all-American touch) and carving swastikas into the foreheads of their victims. One such swasticated German soldier is purposely let go so that he can take his tale of terrorization back to the Fuhrer hisself. Der Fuhrer (Adolph Hitler) is tellingly portrayed as a frenzied madman who does everything but literally chew up a rug (Supporting actor contender in my book) when he sees what these stop-at-nothing ""Basterd"" vigilantes are doing to his pure Aryan troopers. Propaganda minister Goebbels also comes in for significant treatment in a film almost as good in its portrayal of Nazi pageantry and evil as Istvan Szabo's ""Mephisto"" in heavy reverse gear.<br/><br/>The plot, told in five well defined chapters, is far too complicated to unravel in a mini-review such as this, but it's all about getting good and even with the Germans for their well-known collective brutality and genocide policies. Suffice it to say that all the krauts get what they deserve in the end and just about every one of the many twisted and complex roles in the film are tossed off to perfection. Very fetching is one of the heroines, Madeleine Laurent, as ""Shoshana Dreyfus"", a French blonde Jewish girl whose whole family was murdered by the Germans and who is hell bent on revenge no matter what the cost. (and does she ever get it!). Equally fetching and outstanding is blonde German actress Diane Kruger as a conspiring anti-Hitler German actress who will get herself unceremoniously strangled by Herr Oberst Waltz for her glourios underground efforts. Kruger, interestingly, was Helen to BradPitt's Hercules in ""Troy"" some seasons back, where she was little more than Teutonic window dressing, but here she has come a long way as an actress and is most cleverly employed by Quentin.<br/><br/>Of exceptional note in this delicious international cast is German Actor Christof Waltz who very nearly steals the show as a smooth-talking tri-lingual Gestapo officer, almost as charming and suave as he is evil and cruel. Nearly half of the film is actually spoken in German and French, (with and without sub-titles) which adds a touch of class and authenticity, giving a realistic semi-serious edge to this basically surreal black comedy. Bunuel would have loved it and, even though it does get a wee bit talky here and there between scalpings and other instances of arch mayhem, I found the film extremely satisfying -- in short loved it. My only complaint was that there were not enough juicily explicit scalpings (since at the beginning unit commander Brad, half-Apache, tells his men that each one is expected to bring a minimum of 100 German scalps home, or die trying) -- and in the final inferno, where a full house of high-ranking Nazis (including Hitler, Goering and Martin Borman – just follow the white arrows) and their women folk are locked into a French cinema which is then set on fire – (remember that a favourite way of getting rid of Jews in WW II without wasting bullets was to lock them in a synagogue and then burn it down) -- we don't actually get to see them roasting alive in dynamic close-ups. What was needed here was a walk-on by Robert Duvall doing a variation on his Apocalypse Now theme –""When I smell German flesh burning it smells like .. sniff-sniff ... VICTORY!"" – and some lingering closeups of roasting live red German meat dripping juicily in the flames. All I can say to anybody who stumbles onto this review is, forget about the BS the critics have been writing to show how deftly they can dissect a truly joyous and educational film to death. Just get out there and see this bloody movie – or we'll break your laigs – and take the whole family too, because this is definitely family fare of the highest order. Not to be missed if you like movies that tell it like it should have been .... and you can take that to the bank!<br/><br/>Grokked at ODEON Muswell Hill, London, Tues. August 25, 2009<br/><br/>PS: If you loved ""Swindlers List"" forget this.... Alex Deleon, London<br/><br/>PSS: Christopher Walz did in fact get the Best Supporting role Oscar in 2010."

","You see even I hated Quentin Tarantino for the lack of plot. But he does not make serious, thoughtful or intellectual movies but humorous movies (if you get those) in an excellent manner. He knows how to tell a story so that a person who watches it must enjoy himself. The opening scene is such a tense one that you would get what to expect later and even very tense situations come later but he fuses them with humor so subtly that you get a real kick at that time. He is the best story teller in Hollywood. No one makes a screenplay like him where nobody watching the movie is disappointed. I have seen all his movies none of them bored me. Yes they maybe similar but they are unique in terms of their content and all his dialogs are iconic.

"Clockwork_Orange55","10","0","1","18 August 2014"," ""With Tarantino and great actors at work, ""Basterds"" is tour de force in writing and acting.""
","I would rarely allow my tongue to spit out the word 'perfection' on a movie, but I did that for ""Inglourious Basterds"". ""Basterds"" is a movie that has the ability to bliss out every movie fans. As close as it gets to some of my favorite films, ""Basterds"" is not much a take on a story, but delivers for the sake of experience, and if you truly love cinema, you will adore this basterdized version of Tarantino movie-making, trust me.<br/><br/>Once upon a time in Nazi-occupied France, charismatic SS colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) arrives in a French dairy farm only to play his slow-burn but charming interrogation game. Upon discovering that a Jewish family is hiding underneath a floorboard, he orders his men to annihilate the family, leaving only a girl named Shosanna (Mélanie Laurent) to escape.<br/><br/>Meanwhile in America, the film introduces Lieutenant Aldo Raine, a leader of a militant group that consists of Jewish-American soldiers. They call themselves 'The Basterds'. Their goal? To destroy any SS soldiers they encounter. The story takes on two paths: Shosanna's and Aldo's, only which they would intercept with each other during the final chapter, and Hans Landa only partly visits the two. Hence it's fair to agree that Aldo, Shosanna and Landa are the primary characters.<br/><br/>""Basterds"" is entirely comical, so do not expect absolute historical accuracy of the events of WWII. The film is a take by Tarantino on the World War as to entertain, but not to educate. ""Basterds"" is WWII is in his very own imagination, and his WWII fantasy is his very own history, not the story that we will see in the history books. An argument which mentions that historical inaccuracies do live as a major flaw of the movie is inarguably invalid.<br/><br/>In ""Basterds"", I sensed that there is a lack of purity in the moral behavior of the characters. It is true that Aldo Raine is a hero-like character, but he is a man who is likely lacks great sympathy for anyone. Shosanna's act too made it evident to support my point. Is she is truly seeking for justice; she would just aim to only murder Landa, not the entire Nazi regime. Cruelty lives in all the major characters, and I guess its final affect would be to boost an idea that in war, goodness rarely thrives, but only a 'bad vs bad' would mostly run the show. I mean, in a war, most of the 'pawns' are murderers, right? Duh.<br/><br/>Tarantino is once again responsible for making a movie that delivers impeccable performances. If Tarantino is in the throne of a film project, you would witness strong acting performances. Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Mélanie Laurent, Michael Fassbender, Diane Kruger, Daniel Brühl and Sylvester Groth are unquestionably terrific. When Brad Pitt plays music through his acted unintentionally hilarious accent, Christoph Waltz charms us with his charisma. When Mélanie Laurent the Shosanna turns to beast from beauty, Diane Kruger turns away for an unusual angelic beauty. Great acting is great acting, but it is Tarantino's bravura screenplay that helps to secure the performances. With Tarantino and great actors at work, ""Basterds"" is tour de force in writing and acting.<br/><br/>Its cinematography is a knockout, and too its production sets. I am confident that ""Basterds"" is a masterful act by Tarantino. Great dialogues, great build-up of scenes, great acting, and great plot – ""Basterds"" is very close to be his best picture since ""Pulp Fiction"", and indeed it is the most definite approach of his personal tarantinoesque movie-genre. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a masterpiece, and one of the great films of decade. Period.<br/><br/>Score: 4/4<br/><br/>(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)"

","I remember seeing a late night show with Pulp Fiction in a movie theater where half the audience was drunk. I was uncomfortable, not so much with the violence, but with the unabashed enjoyment of the audience. I thought I was supposed to have my laugh get stuck in my throat because of said violence. I may have been wrong. Since then glorifying violence has become a staple in Tarantino's films.<br/><br/>Pulp was the last Tarantino movie I actually enjoyed. I watch a lot of films and get many of Tarantino's references, but I rarely find a point to them nowadays. I think he became to enamored with his own movie- making. Today it's more self absorbed than an Andy Kaufman joke.<br/><br/>If you thought Kill Bill was grand then you will probably enjoy this. If a grand budget could turn a Barbara Cartland book (she's a really bad romance novelist) into Jane Austen, then this pulp fiction drivel would have become Kurasawa, but sadly it remains a shriveling mess albeit one in a beautiful wrapper."

","A typical Tarantino pastiche. Neither a comedy nor a serious drama. With Pitt and Waltz laughably overacting, as are most of the other characters clichéd. Waltz getting an Oscar? It must be for some other reason that his acting, if you can call it acting. All characters are under- developed, just standing there without anything to say. Tediously long scenes with talking heads going on and on. It is may be OK flick for people who have only seen recent films and have no reference to compare them with some truly great films from the past. Also, the subtitles are tiny and translated in a rather stilted English. The only nice thing I can say about the film is the cinematography. It is inconceivable to me that the Weinstein Brothers would have so much faith in Tarantino and allow him to do his thing. They should have looked at any Coen Brothers film before letting Tarantino go ahead with this script."

","I was in a very strange mood last night so i decided to watch a violent film,so out with my blue ray of Quentin tarantinos,""inglorious basterds"".I personally have nothing against the Germans and think they are a good crowd now.The film plays away in his usual chaptered style.There are some reasonably graphic scenes of nazi swash sticker markings being carved into peoples foreheads but then this is an 18 cert war film. I particularly like the way much of the film bases around the cinema,the one with a lesser seating capacity as the venue that was previously intended.The image of cement splicing on a section of 35mm 1.37:1 footage to the end of reel 2 of the lassies laughing image with sound was quite incredible,the footage as the story implies was made by film making equipment in house.The piles of highly inflammable nitrate film were ignited behind the 4:3 screen,with the doors fixed closed leading to a human barbecue.So a good film all around,it was released around 2009,but well worth watching,i have even played an unrun sealed 35mm trailer film print that i purchased on ebay for £3 through a 1965 Phillips fp20,so i must have liked it.Leading roll actor was brad Pitt as lieutenant Aldo Raine,and Melanie Laurent as Shoshanna Dreyfus,the operator of the cinema.As well as very good scenes played out representing the force of the third Reich.If my memory serves me correctly Quentin instructed that the film was only distributed on what i would guess to be to eight sections per batch of 35mm celluloid film allowing for pushing 16,000ft/though probably 70mm also,modern polyester base of course.

Despite it's length, the movie is nice to watch, as it usually is the case with Tarantino's movies. The photography is exquisite, the colors warm and the costumes sitting just right.<br/><br/>The cherry on the top is, of course, the performance of Christopher Waltz, in whom Tarantino finally found the adequate mouthpiece for his rants. Although most of the text he speaks is nonsense, i enjoyed each an every second of his act.

We share similar interests, and therefore. I enjoy his movies just as much as he does. This movie, was no exception.<br/><br/>Yes, many parts of the movie didn't make sense. YES, we understand. Maybe not every Nazi officer and Hitler himself would attend one small cinema at the same time. But the accusations of the cinema only having 2 guards are false, they were everywhere. Which could be seen when Aldo Rayne got arrested. The thing is, people want to force others to hate something they didn't like from the start. This movie was just a victim of people trying to over analyze small details and accuse them of being false or illogical. Well guess what geniuses, this movie never happened. It's a WWII fantasy, and a hilarious one at that.<br/><br/>A lot of the bad reviews were centered around the poor acting of Brad Pitt and the Basterds. I think Brad Pitt made a glorious performance as the over American, Jewish, Nazi-hating soldier. Out in Nazi-occupied for a bloody revenge with the rest of the Basterds. I mean, who could say no to that? It's not about some goddamn french overemotional drama. This is a bitter soldier here trying to kill Nazis, what would you expect? As to the hate of Eli Roth and the other Basterds. Same answer, don't expect an over emotional and deep acting performance out of these guys. It will just disappoint you. I for one especially love Hugo Stiglitz, Just this cold murderer obsessed with stabbing Nazis. It's lovely.<br/><br/>Many performances in general was wonderful in this movie. Christoph Waltz' Hollywood breakthrough was no shock, he did his role as ""The Jew Hunter"" like no other actor. You could really go through what he was thinking, and he terrified us all.<br/><br/>The story in itself is just a nice multiple storyline adventure that have all of them crash in a total ""ehr mah gerd"" in the end. With beautifully scripted scenes that really took their time and space in the movie and of course those really gory scenes that we all enjoy. Nothing was rushed, and that's what I love about Tarantino movies. Yes, most things seemed extremely unrealistic, but the accused plot holes are just the cause of dumb people analyzing scenes in an attempt to look smart. Don't believe it. It's a movie for goodness sake, a fantasy, since when were they ever realistic anyways?<br/><br/>All in all, don't start watching this movie with the expectations that it will be horrible. Because it isn't. Just do what all of us experienced movie lovers do: Enjoy a movie for what it is, entertainment in 24 frames per second.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10/10.

The opening scene is straight out gripping and acted marvelously by Christoph Waltz, who won an Oscar for his performance. His character displays a certain gentleman like charm, which can change instantly to be real evil and menacing if provoked. His calmness and unpredictable behavior really gives me the creeps. Brad Pitt also gives a great performance as the leader of The Basterds. I find the characters of Hans and Aldo to be similar in some ways. Both are leaders of their respective groups; both are equally famous and have earned nicknames; both are highly intelligent, responsible and ruthless in carrying out duties. The rest of the cast also put on great performances, grounding the movie in an alternate World War II reality. If you're looking for a thrill ride, pure excitement, bloody action and a sweet taste of revenge, this is a great movie to be indulged with. I was totally satisfied."

But Lt. Raine has another objective as well. Being part Apache he tells his men to collect the scalps of all those they kill to spread fear into the enemy. Now, rather than divulge the rest of the story and possibly ruin the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a very unique movie. While it has a World War 2 framework it doesn't adhere to actual history. It's definitely alternate reality. Be that as it may, I especially liked the performances of Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz. Likewise, having three beautiful actresses in Melanie Laurent (as ""Shosanna""), Diane Kruger (""Bridget von Hammersmark"") and Julie Dreyfus (""Francesca Mondino"") certainly didn't hurt the film either.

This film utilizes action, violence, and a number of sound and editing techniques to deliver an enjoyable and breath taking film for the audience. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, we watch as Shosanna, played by Melanie Laurent, comprises a plan to take down the Nazi leadership when they view a Nazi propaganda film in a Parisian cinema which she operated. This plan was in the attempt to fulfill a personal vendetta, as she narrowly escaped assassination by Colonel Hans Landa, also known as ""The Jew Hunter"", played by Christoph Walz. Another key character Lieutenant Aldo Raine, played by Brad Pitt, also plans to take down the Nazis in the cinema, in order to fulfill his quest of eradicating the Nazi force in the war. The film followed Raine and his crew of Jewish-American soldiers as they seek to ""take no prisoners."" Raine and his men work with actress Bridget von Hammersmark, played by Diane Kruger to get a seat in the cinema for the propaganda film showing, in order to be in the position to execute their plan. Shosanna and Lieutenant Raine's plan inadvertently join forces the night of the film showing. Although the plans are not executed as intended, with Shosanna, Bridget von Hammersmark, and Raine being discovered by Colonel Landa, they were successful in the end as the cinema burned. As an added bonus, Landa fooled by Raine and had the Nazi swastika carved into his forehead at the end of the film, marking him forever (IMDB, 2013).<br/><br/>A prominent theme, or unifying central concern, in this film is the struggle of human dignity. This theme involves a conflict between two sides of human nature (Boggs, 2009, p. 27). This theme is displayed over and over again, as we see the struggle of Shosanna, Bridget von Hammersmark, and Lieutenant Raine, each supporters of the Allied Forces, to overcome the Nazis. <br/><br/>In depth sound and editing techniques helped Tarantino and Roth bring this film to a superior level. The separation of the film into different chapters is a signature move of Tarantino, and, along with voiceovers and instrumental music, helps the audience transition from one scene to the next. The violence shown on screen (and sometimes heard off screen) seems especially realistic and more gruesome through the use of three dimensional sound. A superior level of clarity in the sounds of stabbings, gunshots, and baseball bats bring an almost horrifying amount of realism to the film. <br/><br/>The effects and theme in this film are reminiscent of other Tarantino films, including the ever popular Pulp Fiction (IMDB, 2013). The violence and graphic nature of the films, as well as the struggle of human nature help each of the films deliver enjoyment and captivation to their audiences. <br/><br/>References: Boggs, Joseph M., and Dennis W.

","All I heard going in was that there wasn't enough of the ""Basterds"" in the movie, and there was a long act that they weren't, but overall I'd say it was about them. I'm not a huge Tarantino buff, but it wasn't as crazy as I was expecting for one of his films. In retrospect, the whole story was quite small in scope. In chapter 1 or the prelude, whatever it was called, I was totally expecting the farmer and his daughters to ax-murder the Nazi visitors, so that was a little disappointing (and not a spoiler because it didn't happen). But it set off the rest of the film. I liked it. Don't know if I'll watch it again anytime soon, but it's worth holding onto."
"CompuLOL","2","0","1","19 September 2013"," One unglorious movie that should have never been made...
","Tarantino should be ashamed of the overrated crap he was been putting out throughout his career. And with this awful movie, he has finally proved once and for all that he's was never a real filmmaker; and that he has the writing skills and imagination of an ugly prepubescence fanboy. That obv only other same kind could possibly like. I'll grant that the film does have some style and decent sense of a narrative and overall structure; but in the end, it all falls apart because it never actually makes sense in real historic terms. And worse; it's just an hour longer that needs be, which makes it even more ridiculously boring. It's just an exercise in form over substance, vanity, and an obv glorious self righteous morality standard. A series of polish, impossible, and fantastic day dreamt up situations that only a kid could relate to. So pretty and expensive crap is still crap, at least in my book. The plot doesn't make sense at all, and hence it comes together as one would expect of a musical, or a silly childish play. The unrealistic and grandiose assassination plan is just the icing on the BS cake. Furthermore, the characters are a cartoon. So the whole movie is a big bad joke; but on the viewer. Since it's not funny by itself either; but even fails to be even a little amusing as a drama. The acting is terrible and out of time, place, and apt character. Pitt in particular is unnecessary and inconsequential. The only good, memorable, and salvageable part is whist in the woods how the bunch used their coward guerrilla tactics to savagely kill an enemy unit. In real life they'd have been owned and laugh at ASAP for the stupid, ridiculous assholes that they really are. Nevertheless, those actions should've been the center of a slightly better movie. Instead of a series of lame scenes like the whole finger issue at the bar; which is just appalling and insulting to smart and discernible audiences. It'd have been funnay had they started decounting to the middle finger :rolleyes: Doesn't matter anyhow, since they'll obv prevail no matter how much tainted bad luck gets thrown at their supposed perils. Yet it somehow oddly managed to remind me of a bad ensemble western; but in a WW2 setting, and with a way larger budget. Specially in regard of how ""the heroes"" never miss and can do no wrong, while everybody else is just the opposite. And finally and in all fairness, I did find the romance between the jew theater owner and the black worker funny; albeit for the sole implausibility and seriousness it handled itself. And BTW the ending is one of the worse messes and WTF moments I've seen in a mayor studio release, but not surprisingly; since I was actually rooting for ""the bad guys"" to kill these unlikable idiotic bastards form the very start..."

","Another great movie in Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglorious Basterds"" is a big, bold, audacious war movie that will annoy some, startle others and demonstrate once again that he's the real thing, a director of quixotic delights. For starters (and at this late stage after the premiere in May at Cannes, I don't believe I'm spoiling anything), he provides World War II with a much-needed alternative ending. For once the basterds get what's coming to them.<br/><br/>From the title, ripped off from a 1978 B-movie, to the Western sound of the Ennio Morricone opening music to the key location, a movie theater, the film embeds Tarantino's love of the movies. The deep, rich colors of 35mm film provide tactile pleasure. A character at the beginning and end, not seen in between, brings the story full circle. The ""basterds"" themselves, savage fighters dropped behind Nazi lines, are an unmistakable nod to the Dirty Dozen.<br/><br/>And above all, there are three iconic characters, drawn broadly and with love: the Hero, the Nazi and the Girl. These three, played by Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent, are seen with that Tarantino knack of taking a character and making it a Character, definitive, larger than life, approaching satire in its intensity but not — quite — going that far. Let's say they feel bigger than most of the people we meet in movies.<br/><br/>The story begins in Nazi-occupied France, early in the war, when the cruel, droll Nazi Col. Hans Landa (Waltz) arrives at an isolated dairy farm where he believes the farmer (Denis Menochet) is hiding Jews. He's right, and a young woman named Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) flees into the woods. It is for this scene, and his performance throughout the movie, that Christoph Waltz deserves an Oscar nomination to go with his best actor award from Cannes. He creates a character unlike any Nazi — indeed, anyone at all — I've seen in a movie: evil, sardonic, ironic, mannered, absurd.<br/><br/>The Hero is Brad Pitt, as Lt. Aldo Raine, leader of the Basterds. Tarantino probably wants us to hear ""Aldo Ray,"" star of countless war films and B pictures. Raine is played by Pitt as a broad caricature of a hard-talking Southern boy who wants each of his men to bring him 100 Nazi scalps. For years, his band improbably survives in France and massacres Nazis, and can turn out in formal eveningwear at a moment's notice. Pitt's version of Italian is worthy of a Marx brother.<br/><br/>The Girl is Shosanna, played by Laurent as a curvy siren with red lipstick and, at the film's end, a slinky red dress. Tarantino photographs her with the absorption of a fetishist, with closeups of shoes, lips, a facial veil and details of body and dress. You can't tell me he hasn't seen the work of the Scottish artist Jack Vettriano, and his noir paintings of the cigarette-smoking ladies in red.<br/><br/>Shosanna calculatingly flirts with Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), a Nazi war hero and now movie star; he persuades Joseph Goebbels to hold the premiere of his new war film in her theater. This sets up a plot that includes Tarantino breaking several rules in order to provide documentary footage about how flammable nitrate film prints are.<br/><br/>A Tarantino film resists categorization. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is no more about war than ""Pulp Fiction"" is about — what the hell is it about? Of course nothing in the movie is possible, except that it's so bloody entertaining. His actors don't chew the scenery, but they lick it. He's a master at bringing performances as far as they can go toward iconographic exaggeration"

","It is difficult to say whether this is a film that is in the vein of what one would expect from Tarantino. Sure it has the shameless violence and blood, it has the incredibly outlandish ending, and it also has the very unexpected black humour, but it has also gone in a direction that I at least did not expect to have come out of the mind of Quentin Tarantino. The reason that I say this is because a bulk of the movie is actually in French and German. Normally most filmmakers would have the characters simply speaking English, without the need for subtitles, but then Tarantino is not your ordinary filmmaker. In fact the scene that I believe stands out the most is the scene in the restaurant where the conversation between Goerbels and Shosanna is being translated from French to German and vice versa.<br/><br/>People describe this film as being a fun movie, but I personally would not go that far. I feel that people say that because they really want to like Tarantino, and simply sit through what some would call the boring parts, waiting for the comedy to come about (which it does in this film). However, I feel that the 'boring' parts of Tarantino's films are what makes it distinctive, namely because it not only creates the characters, but actually gives them life.<br/><br/>What also impresses me with this film is Tarantino's use of cinematography. This is something that has differed from many of his other films. In fact parts of this film almost seem to come straight out of a Michael Bay production. For instance, in scene in Winston Churchill's office. The thing that catches me here is the amount of space that it is used. There are only three people in this scene, and these three people are separated by huge amounts of space. In fact, Winston Churchill always remains at a distance from the other two characters. Another scene is just before the final scene where Shosanna is leaning against the round window wearing a scarlet dress, and through the windows you see the same scarlet on the Nazi flags. It is interesting how Tarantino does not actually contrast the protagonist from the antagonist by giving them different colours.<br/><br/>Obviously the black comedy is there as well, particularly since the mission comes to a complete halt when all of the German speakers are killed in a random gun fight in a French bar, and the spy ends up having her leg put into a cast (and the excuse is because she injured herself mountain climbing). I guess that is another aspect of Tarantino's realism (and despite the fact that this film is pure fantasy, the element of realism in the film is extra-ordinary – this once again comes down to the use of language). I guess this is almost a send up of other similar films where the protagonists must come up with a back up plan that ends up working. Okay, it works in this film, but it is so obviously farcical, that we wonder how it happened.<br/><br/>Well, it didn't. In fact the out folding of the plan is still quite believable. They do get caught, and they are interrogated, however we must remember that the war is coming to an end, and the Nazi's are on the losing side. This is why the film 'Nation's Pride' is being shown. It is a propaganda piece highlighting the heroics of a German soldiers who held out for four days against an American assault. Landa knew that the Germans were losing, and going to lose, and he saw this as a way out. However, he did not count on Raine disobeying orders. I guess this comes down to realism again – Landa follows orders because to disobey them means you get shot. Not so with the Americans. He even says that at the end, to which Raine replies 'Naw, I'll only get chewed out. I'm used to getting chewed out'.<br/><br/>Oh, I cannot finish this off without applauding Brad Pitt's performance, but then again, I always applaud Brad Pitt's performance (even in World War Z)."

","A short review of Inglorious Basterds (2009) <br/><br/>Could a movie about a dreadful war be more brilliantly and comically as this one was. They obviously done their research about WWII because the information given in this movie about it was spot on.<br/><br/>I've been a big fan of Quentin Tarantino since I saw Pulp Fiction and he has done it again in this brilliant, but at times tragic, accurately made movie about WWII. Most of Tarantino's movies are in the IMDb's Top 250 and this one currently stands at number 108 with an Academy Award under it's belt.<br/><br/>The story is about a group of Jews who form a group called The Basterds run by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) who have a great interest and talent for killing Nazis. But at the same time a young woman called Shosanna (Mélanie Laurent) who owns a cinema ,and who's family were slaughtered several years earlier by Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz Academy Award Winner Best Actor in a Supporting Role)and his men, is asked if her cinema can be used to premier a movie about a German War hero, in which most Nazi parties including Adolf Hitler will attend. So Shosanna and The Basterds plan a way to destroy the Nazis for good.<br/><br/>This movie also contains in my opinion one of the best scenes in world Cinema history.<br/><br/>I like a lot of blood and this movie had plenty of shooting and new ways of executing Nazis. With a big build up the the finale of this movie, Inglorious Basterds is a brilliant movie staring Brad Pitt, Christoph waltz, Mélanie Laurent and Eli Roth with a lot of shoot em' up violence and a tragedy in which revenge is fulfilled with sacrifice."

Schindler's List, then honestly, I have no idea what your doing going into a movie by Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>What I Would Change?<br/><br/>The only thing I would change about this movie is how little screen time some of the basterds got, I really felt that the first draft of this script had a lot more of the basterds doing something more then just being there but, it got cut out for time or some bullshit. I would have sat through a three hour movie if the extra 30 minutes went to the basterds.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts<br/><br/>All in all this movie is a fantastic movie that I would recommend to anyone."

","Tarantino is all about presentation. More than story; his films are based on strong screenplay. Great dialogs, humorous situations, great acting, great music, catchy violence are the necessary ingredients of a Tarantino movie that make his films entertaining even though you might not like the story. His story or twists may be some times non believable or hard to digest but still you feel entertained that is his talent. Tarantino knows exactly what audience will love. This movie also follows the attributes described above. Its story might not be believing but you are always kept interested and entertained.

It has the intertwining stories of Lt. Aldo Raine, Shoshanna, and Col. Hans Landa. The performances are all very good, but the standout was definitely Christoph Waltz. Waltz performance was by far the best in the whole movie. The plot is original and interesting. There are lots of people bashing the movie for it's historical inaccuracies, but those people are idiots. It's a movie, and it's made by Tarantino! It's not supposed to be accurate! Seriously.

","PLOT: A group of Jewish-American soldiers are sent over to Nazi occupied Europe over the watchful eye of Lt. Aldo Raine, calling themselves ""The Basterds"" with the goal of killing as many Nazis as they possibly can.<br/><br/>MY THOUGHTS: It is a very unique concept of taking a historical period and putting a fictional twist on it. Everything in this movie didn't happen, but, you kind of wish that it did. It makes the end of World War II more amazing than it was in real life. The story is amazing, but so are the actors. The best by far in the picture is Christoph Waltz. The fact that he plays such a sadistic Nazi makes you believe he truly is one. He also acts in German, French, English, and even Italian which makes it even more amazing. Brad Pitt also did a good job in playing the leader and is quite funny in many scenes with his over the top American accent. Michael Fassbender was also extraordinary in the movie and did a fine job in going undercover as a German and also plays the role in various languages as well.<br/><br/>PROS/CONS: There are no real flaws with this movie that I can think of. It doesn't lag much like Death Proof did with its story and it keeps you entertained all throughout. Every character brings something to the story and it was a perfect picture (though there is really no such thing).<br/><br/>OVERALL: 9/10"
"faraidmobin","8","0","1","31 July 2013"," Different type of War movie, Can be classic.
","Inglorious Basterds (2009) Yesterday, I have seen another movie named Inglorious Basterds. It was released at 21 August in 2009. It is a drama type movie with the flavor of adventure and war. Directed by Quentin Tarantino, this movie was starred by Brad Pitt, Mélanie Laurent, Eli Roth and several others.<br/><br/>In my perception, this movie is full of some furious soldiers, who can savagely do mass genocide. The movie showed about the time of Second world war, when Nazis were killing Jews like human mice. A group of U.S. soldiers, led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who took a pledge to kill those Nazi bastards by removing scalps from their head, to show that they can be far better vicious slayers than Hitler's disciples!!! Colonel Hans Landa (Cristoph Waltz), who was working for Nazis, had come to France in mission of killing Jews. He was known as Jew Hunter among the people. There he killed a Jew family, of which, a girl fortunately saved her life. That girl, Shoshanna (Mélanie Laurent) pledged to take revenge against those Nazis. After some years, she got that opportunity to kill all high officials of Nazis, including The Fuhrer. Finally, she killed them like rats.<br/><br/>The most important thing of that movie is the double stranded character of Colonel Hans Landa, which was shown at the end of movie. He also got the prize for that, a very accurate prize, I guess.<br/><br/>This movie is not like a conventional war movie. It shows some specialties like conspiracies, secret talks between high officials, secret vital missions and many other things that made that movie juicy. More ever, the romance, which was shown between Shoshanna and Sgt. Frederick Zoller, also pretty good.<br/><br/>Rest in peace, dear Shoshanna.

","Quentin Tarantino has once again proved to his audience that he is s genius, i don't use the word genius too often however there is no other word to describe Quentin's ability, it is the most purest and genuine form of what a true director really is.<br/><br/>The first scene offers us a scene of which it's context is a very well known concept in books and films etc, this is of course one of cinemas most moving tales which is the struggle of the Jews in Nazi Germany. The scene starts off peaceful, a beautiful view of French Landscape, a happy family, however right from the moment you see the familiar grey gloomy glow of the Nazi's driving up the hill, you are already left in fear for the family, this is because we are looking at a true family, they are working with each other, they speak to each other lovingly, they show respect and love for one another, we are not looking at a disintegrating family that are distant from one another, therefore already Quentin has made us feel as if these people are the good guys, the music saws through with a triumphant scream, an orchestra, widely used, yes, but still effective. <br/><br/>When the Jews that are hiding in the house die our anger and sadness are lifted up and the girl escaping away for me is iconic, it represents hope, it shows bravery, it shows that how ever many people the Nazi's kill there will always be someone to fight back and by god that girl did.<br/><br/>The fire in the cinema, the blood oozing out of the infamous Fuhrer, our true feelings of hatred and anger flow through our body, Quentin makes the audience his vulnerable psychos, i was left there watching each and every one of those people getting shot and i smiled throughout the whole thing.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds is a masterpiece it symbolises the true importance that a lot of humans still are too scared to admit, that vermin in this world deserves to go, whatever the circumstance if a human on this planet is too blind to see the value of human life, then that human is no longer part of our race, justice needs to be served, revenge shall take place.<br/><br/>My Favourite actor was definitely Christopher Waltz as Col. Hans Landa, despite seeing a tad of Dr King Schultz in his performance, he still portrayed in my opinion one of the most fearful characters in cinema, his sarcasm, his unusually relaxed approach to his enemies left you always feeling as if he was going to attack and i think that constant feel of fear and tension is important when displaying a characters true characteristics.<br/><br/>Despite the silly and obviously unrealistic decision in the movie which was Aldo Raine and his two Italian's going into the cinema to complete the operation, which i thought really did let the film down as it didn't maintain the tension that flowed through the piece, however it did create some laughs with Aldo Raine saying ""Bonjourno"" and Quentin Tarantino certainly did claim back his spark with one of the most intense scenes in cinema history which was the burning of the cinema.<br/><br/>I can safely say this film is one of my favourite movies and i will be watching again ( when i have the bravery ) sometime in the future, hats off to Quentin and his mastermind actors/actresses."

","Well done, Quentin! What a prankster! Well, how else to acquire refinement in the desire to repeat the success of «Pulp fiction», except not to encroach upon the Holy of holies – untouchable history? I mean the history is not in the abstract sense, but only one of its specific and significant milestone – hard times of great disasters. Intrigues of Nazis don't cease to chafe the itching imagination of figures of cultural and art. Daring daredevil Tarantino also decided on an original experiment in the genre of alternative history and built, in a rollicking manner peculiar to him, his version of the fall of Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>«Inglourious Basterds» - is free and easy, bouncy, very juicy and sparkling show. What the relish and unbridled irony Tarantino mocked the most colorful Nazi bonzes with, giving the unconditional supremacy on parody grotesqueness of Adolf Hitler's image. The expressive and eccentric character's images together with fabulous and extremely funny dialogs successfully compensated the effect of excessive longueur.<br/><br/>Yes, the film is a little boring. But this blemish, in my opinion, is quite explainable. Tarantino, making his way through the throes of art, worked on the script of «Basterds» for more than 7 years, repeatedly disemboweling and cutting out again the storyline. The Director, in his own words, riveting his best masterpiece. And when the spiritual creator turns thoughts to his brainchild, long pining in a belly of his fertile imagination, he is unable to limit and pacify the stream of his creative conscience, which was tore outside. When you make something welcome and inspiring, it is very difficult to interrupt this fascinating process in cold blood.<br/><br/>The movie's atmosphere is already extravagant, blood-aesthetic and bouncy as usual. But acting didn't strike with anything special. The familiar, self confident and moderately histrionic Brad Pitt's type organically merged with the image of Aldo Raine, without showing us any of the amazing wonders of acting. The tacitly eloquent, as if hastily invented image of Hugo Stiglitz, smoothly muffled played by Til Schweiger, rather disappointed. Michael Fassbender, Melanie Laurent, Diane Kruger and Eli Roth didn't stimulate any visible and distinct emotions at all. Just quite decent, compliance with the spirit of the script, satisfactory acting.<br/><br/>But quite another matter – the image of Hans Landa, effervescently and fantastically embodied by Christoph Waltz. Charming, charismatic «Jew Hunter», tricky villain, aesthete-polyglot, filigree wise cracker Hans Landa – the blinding pearl of movie.<br/><br/>«Inglourious Basterds» - it's not just traditional cinematic product, which is a collection of all necessary components. It's not just a plot, competently stuffed with all sorts of director's godsends, and not another, even original attempt to rethink the historical process. Quentin Tarantino, skillfully playing, weaved the intricate and elaborate cobweb, having thought over and having worked in details each ornament, each texture, providing his unique «design» with indispensable attention and success. This bizarre cobweb, woven from the intriguing plot, expressive characters and images, sparkling humor, numerous art- scene references, fruity dynamics' violence, owing to it's daring specifics won't probably cause unanimous delight and approval, but will reliably provoke the interest and desire to untangle its masterful artful design.<br/><br/>And thankfully, that Tarantino's plots are predictable the non- standard specifics. Tarantino never will disappoint us with a tragic strain and won't cause the attacks of nausea from overly snivel romantic stories. <br/><br/>The attempts of «raids» on the Tarantino's idea to pass the laurels of victory over Nazi Germany to Americans, look like absurd and pathetic efforts. Yeah, say the Russians missed Hitler, but the bunch of Americans, according to Tarantino, plainly fried the whole top of the Third Reich at one bout. Why so seriously to perceive this movie? And why in the world the American director must create to please to the Russian patriotism? If the agility of fictional Americans jars and revolts somebody - save your nerves and don't watch this movie!"

","THE GIST: Quentin Tarantino has defined himself as an auteur in the good sense of the word. His films have gone on to hallow the halls of the Cinematic Hall of Fame, but this, as a character says in the very film, may be his masterpiece. Full of rich, wonderful characters, careful plotting, a brilliant script, and unbelievably good performances (specifically from Christoph Waltz as the treacherous Nazi commander Hans Landa and Melanie Laurent as Shoshanna, the Jewish escapee). INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is a wholly revelatory work of modern cinema, one of the most important films of the 21st century to date and a revisionist fantasy full of so much cinematic depth, it would take books and essays to cover all that is at play here. Some have called it the World War II film to end all World War II films, which I would agree with. The film's only hindrance comes in it's final act, or ""chapter"" as Mr. Tarantino would refer, which lacks some of the subtlety that the first 4 chapters had so enchantingly.<br/><br/>THE BEST PART: The thrilling and dynamic opening scene, full of suspense in the classic Hitchcockian sense of the word. One of the best opening scenes I've certainly ever seen.<br/><br/>THE VERDICT: Quentin Tarantino is a landmark filmmaker as proved especially with his truly awesome and provocative INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS. Continuing a discussion of cinema itself as well as revenge, both physically and mentally (for the audience), the film will live on as one of the modern classics of the era."

","My first encounter with Quentin Tarantino's film was not that romantic and smooth. I was curious about his films because so many people praise him and treat him (and his films) like cults. So I bought Pulp Fiction (1994) and watched it when I was around 16. I ended up not understanding the film; I enjoyed some parts of it, but at that time it just didn't make any sense to me. So when Inglourious Basterds was released and nominated for so many awards, I wasn't really eager to watch it, worrying that I would end up not understanding the film; I haven't reached the 'level' of understanding, enjoying and appreciating his films yet.<br/><br/>Until last night. <br/><br/>Right now I'm fangirling (again) over Ben Whishaw and Michael Fassbender. So I browsed Michael Fassbender films and found out that he actually appeared in Inglourious Basterds. I had the film laying down quietly in my hard disk for ages and I hadn't watched it, so I decided to watch. I'm not really sure at first, but I kept watching the opening credit (quite classic), then to the opening scene. It was already 2 am but I just couldn't stop watching it. The way he directed it was so cool and interesting that it made me curious and hungry about what would happen in the next scenes. Wonderful atmosphere. I kept waiting for Michael Fassbender to appear. He finally appeared in the middle of the film. I thought he was going to play a German role, instead he played an English role. (Oh my God, he's just so...) This is ultimately not the film that will be my first choice or whatever, due to the violence in it, but I have to say that this film is quite something. It's different and unique, especially the way Tarantino captured the scenes. He loves long shots (and they're brilliant), peculiar-angle shots and dividing his films into some chapters. My ultimate favourite scene is when they're down in the tavern. I think it was so great. Christoph Waltz's performance was excellent! Hands down. Unfortunately, Brad Pitt's performance was somewhat appears weird to me, seems unnatural.<br/><br/>Such a creative idea to make a film about alternate history (ending) of World War II. I like the way Hitler died, the ending of World War II, all collided with films, with cinema. We know that Hitler also used films as his propaganda. He said that if you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed. As we can see in this film, the man of his propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, accompany him in the viewing of the film. My lecturer in class told me that Hitler's favourite director, Leni Riefenstahl, made a film for him in 1934 called Triumph des Willens. I haven't seen the film yet, but it is said that the film had successfully build Hitler's might and right despite his weaknesses (for example, he's not that high and mighty in terms of his height)."

","The good- - The script, I love all of Tarantino's scripts but this one takes the cake with outstanding but what you would come to expect from Tarantino dialogue and brilliant characters along with clever humor and brutal/intense scenes. - Christoph Waltz, what can be said about him that has'nt already been said. He was BRILLIANT in this role and Hans Landa is one of the greatest movie villains of all time. - Brad Pitt, I like it when actors have a little fun with their roles and Pittdid and brought the character to life really well. - Every other actor in the film, everyone was brilliant, really - The editing, it's amazing how little time they had to edit this and how well they pulled it off, well done Sally. - The soundtrack, set the tone of old style shoot em' up comedy. - sets, the sets where really good and looked very real - attention to details, you have to see this film multiple times to catch a ton of brilliant little details all over the place and it's fun to play what I call 'the Tarantino game' where you search for easter eggs all over the movie.<br/><br/>the bad- - deleted scenes, several scenes where deleted to save time but some where actually important to the film's story. - Adam Sandler being an idiot, Sandler was originally supposed to play the bear Jew but blew it off for another role in a terrible movie but god he would've been so good in this movie it hurts to think about it. Although Eli Roth was good in the part, Sandler would have been better.<br/><br/>the Tarantino- - Choice to have language changes, most of the film was either in German and French. - The middle block, the whole block was devoid of English and was a little boring but found ways to keep it interesting"

Inglorious Basterds is a classic Tarantino film in its entirety; it is all the drama and action of World War 2 recreated in classic Tarantino style. <br/><br/>Explosively violent, the action scenes are far and few between but when they come you will not be ready. The humor is stinging but never becomes offensive or cheap. The whole cast is incredibly commendable, but the true star is Christoph Waltz (as the Jew Hunter). Quite frankly, this is one of the finest performances I've seen in a film in a long while. <br/><br/>It's a memorable and incredibly entertaining film that knows it's style and isn't afraid to show it.

The Inglourious Bastards are a bunch of American soldiers departing on a top secret mission to end the war. But the film not only focuses attention on this group, but in many unforgettable characters that we see throughout the film, no one is less important than the other, all with their own characteristics. Throughout the film we see many moments of long and intriguing dialogs that hold your attention, and others that are interesting but sometimes they are not that great (that Tarantino already proved be better than that) but this doesn't ruin the movie at all. <br/><br/>And also in the movie we have several times when violence explodes on the screen, moments that you was not even expecting, just like a normal Tarantino movie. <br/><br/>The entire cast is phenomenal, with unforgettable characters. The film is interesting in that, as I said before, there are several characters of different nationalities. For example, who is German only speaks German, who is French only speaks French, who is English or American only speaks English.<br/><br/>Crhistoph Waltz in my opinion was the best of all the characters, he's a cold heart Nazi bastard, but at the same time is so much polite and intelligent, and he's the only character who speaks all languages ​​present in the film. Not only it gives an unforgettable performance, but also Brad Pitt, Mélanie Laurent, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender, and Diane Kruger, and so many others that make's the movie. <br/><br/>Full of violence; a lot of fun; intriguing dialogs, Tarantino delivers another original classic to his movie list!"

","If I am to talk films here, I must immediately state this- I am a HUGE Tarantino fan! I love all of his films I've seen so far and three of them are in my top 10 favourites of all time! That being said, I had watched Inglourious Basterds once in the past and wasn't very satisfied even when it was called one of Tarantino's best.<br/><br/>A group of Jewish soldiers who call themselves the Basterds plan to execute Nazis. The leader of this group, played brilliantly by Brad Pitt, is Lt. Raine, who demands 100 Nazi scalps from each of his men, even to the point of Adolf Hitler fearing these Basterds! What's not to like from this part of the story alone! Nazi executing Jewish badasses! HECK YEAH! That is only one part of what is an exceptional story. On the other hand, we have an escaped and on the hunt Jew, from the Jew hunter, played in an Oscar winning performance by Christoph Waltz.<br/><br/>Seriously, the Jew Hunter is one of the greatest villains and one of my favourite characters in a movie, especially a Tarantino flick! This Jew now owns a cinema after fleeing from the Jew hunter as she witnessed him kill her family. When a new German film is scheduled to be located at her cinema, she plots to burn down the cinema and thus kill the Jew hunter and the Germans which really coincides with the Basterds plot to destroy the Big Four and win the war! That is most of the story revealed and makes for an entertaining as hell 2 ½ hours! <br/><br/>Every Tarantino flick, basically, has a powerful opening and this film certainly is one of them! The conversation between The Jew Hunter, Hans Landa and the man hiding the Jews was fantastic! The dialogue is Tarantino's trademark! A soldier's greatest strength is his weapon and Tarantino's weapon is based on his ability to write amazing dialogue and characters! Whilst not quite up to match with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs as well as recently released Django Unchained, Inglourious Basterds has a lot to offer with its story, the characters, the dialogue and the fantastic execution! Whilst the film is generally fantastic, it's the only Tarantino film that I find to seriously get slow for a good ten minutes! That's when we have the German soldiers and a few Jews in disguise as they talk around for a café. Whilst this dialogue is mainly entertaining, it's really the only time I feel Tarantino film may have been dragged on. This, at that moment, was a serious issue for me but boythat end just justifies the whole thing! The last half hour to forty five minutes of this film is utterly amazing, it's just genius in every possible way! <br/><br/>The entertainment, the laughter, the thrills just never stop! Like all good Tarantino films, this film contains a fantastic cast and an amazing soundtrack- as all Tarantino films do! The scene stealers, Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz are what truly elevates this film like Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta did with Tarantino's masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. No character truly feels one dimensional, none feel bland and such, the story never feels uninteresting! One of the best moments of the film, for my money, would be the very end scene where Brad Pitt remarks ""This might just be my masterpiece"" as the credits roll and that amazing soundtrack plays! That was just amazing the way Tarantino really is just attempting to convey how he thinks this 2009 film may be his masterpiece but it isn't just that. The scene was shot amazingly and acted breath takingly.<br/><br/>We have a Tarantino veteran returning in this film and may be unnoticeable to some! That is legend Samuel L Jackson as JulesNah, kidding he narrates the film and he's always welcome! To pick the most entertaining aspect of the film, it would have to be the story with the Basterds! That was generally fantastic. In the end, of all the Tarantino films I've seen which include Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2, Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained, Inglourious Basterds would probably still rank my least favourite of them but is still a pretty damn high achievement in film making by legend Quentin Tarantino who yet again, fails to disappoint one of his fans!"

","Quentin Tarantino is one of those people you either love or hate. It's his unique stories and methodical attention to detail that have always stood out to me. For all you haters out there, the one thing you can't deny is Tarantino's unique ability to bring out the best in everyone he works with, and that is why many times, the cast members of his films earn Oscar nominations. Inglourious Basterds is another uniquely strange story that just works, because of Tarantino. As has become his signature, the story is broken up into seemingly unrelated stories that all come together in a terrific ending. The story centers around a group of Jewish-American soldiers in World War II, whose assignment was to go into France, undercover, and track down and slaughter Nazis. It's a terrific cast led by Brad Pitt, but to me he wasn't so much the star of this film, that honor belongs to Christopher Waltz, who in his first major role, did win the Oscar for best supporting actor. It's a strong story and a great film, but something bothered me about it. Inglourious Basterds is of course a fictional story, so the attention to detail, such as having everyone speaking in their native languages, seemed someone unnecessary to me. That combined with subtitles that moved at the speed of light, made the story somewhat hard for me to follow. That's why I watched it a few times before reviewing it. There is no denying that this is one hell of a story with another tremendous cast, that deserved every award that it's won, however Tarantino's attention to detail, usually a strength, did take away from the film, as a whole, and did make some parts difficult to follow."

","Since Resovior Dogs, Quentin Tarantino has carved out an impressive career for himself. Apart from Kill Bill one and two (both stupid and very bad), all of his material has been in the ..around 7...score. (Out of 10) No classics, just good --fairly simple--movies. With Inglorious Basterds, once again he makes a simple film...that anyone can understand. After he made Resovior Dogs and Pulp Fiction, Tarantino told the world (many, many times) ""I am a story teller"". We know that. Where he fails (in relation to Capolla and perhaps Scorsese and the Coens) is his in-ability to change his style. There is always blood accompanied by incandescent music. We know he does death....very well...anything else ??"

I seriously wonder why anybody would watch half a film then submit a lengthy review. Is this the worst movie ever? Not a chance, and anybody that says so hasn't watched many bad films, for instance The Stuff was on TV recently, I tried watching it, it was junk and I turned it off after forty minutes or so, and do you know what? The Stuff isn't the worst movie I've ever seen AND I didn't submit a lengthy review of it on IMDb as I didn't even watch it in its entirety...enough said.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds is a good, entertaining Tarantino film, and if you like his film style, use of dialogue over massive action scenes to convey plot and tension and his excellent eye for what makes a scene really work then you'll love it, if not and you just find ""people sitting around tables talking"" boring then you won't."

Plot is simple, acting is above average and dialog is pretty boring. Also, I could point out very staggering performance of Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz(probably that roll was planed to be for QT) and to bad that Michael Fassbender and Diane Kruger had very short roll, but amazingly solid performance.

"Hawkensian","8","0","1","18 November 2012"," 'Inglourious Basterds' is an entertaining, original war film with high production values
","'Inglourious Basterds' is not a film to be taken seriously, it's a farce. Firstly, many of its characters are caricatures, especially Brad Pitt's role Lieutenant Aldo Raine, who speaks in an exaggerated southern drawl. Secondly, the story completely rewrites history in grand, bloody fashion. Overall, I found the film to be good fun; I found its total disregard for history to be refreshing. It has been called 'juvenile', to those people I say ""lighten up"". <br/><br/>Its characters, context and plotting seem to have annoyed many people. The majority of the negative reviews I have read on IMDb are unfair and written by people who are cine-illiterate and sometimes downright illiterate. To dislike this film is understandable, but to give it 1/10 is immature and makes their opinion completely invalid. <br/><br/>Many will find it distasteful, and it is, the German soldiers aren't considered people by the Basterds; some deserve their violent treatment, others do not. However, contrary to popular belief, the film isn't crammed full of violence. It certainly has graphic outbursts, but it isn't pervasive. Instead, much of the film consists of dialogue delivered by its strong cast, constructing its rather large, multi- character story. The main acting credit of course goes to Christoph Waltz, whose turn as the intelligent, ruthless and utterly inescapable Col. Hans Landa is a highlight of the film. <br/><br/>There are moments that are removed from the farcical features of the film, notably the tense farm house interrogation and the basement bar scene, both of which are superbly constructed and acted. Think 'The Lives of Others' only with characters that face far more brutal consequences (if not as dramatically affecting.) <br/><br/>I quite like the film's story and plotting, it's a long film but I didn't grow tired of it like some people have. I didn't expect the film to incorporate so many characters, I didn't expect its scope. It's interesting to wonder what the film would've been like if it had adopted a 'Reservoir Dogs' approach, it could have been a stripped down thriller that closely followed the Basterds' exploits, it may well have been a better film. Instead it's more related to 'Pulp Fiction', a lengthy film with many characters and a marked tone of black humour, however 'Inglorious Basterds' isn't as funny or as interesting. <br/><br/>Tarantino's methods of film-making are questionable. For example, I've heard he refuses to hire composers as he doesn't want another crew member to have that degree of influence over his work. Some think his total control over his productions is becoming his downfall, and those claims could have credibility. He's an auteur some may say, I say he sounds like a control freak, however I understand he has a very particular vision. It would be interesting to see him work on projects that aren't completely his own. Working that way would see his career become more prolific and hopefully would avoid him making awful referential trash like 'Death Proof' again.<br/><br/>Although not a career high, 'Inglourious Basterds' is a worthy addition to his canon that's original yet in possession of all the entertaining earmarks of a true Tarantino film.<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"

","In World War II, the Basterds are an elite unit of Jewish-American soldiers specialising in killing Nazi officers. When they get wind that the SS top brass will be attending a film premiere in Paris, they jump at the opportunity to destroy the cinema ...<br/><br/>As ever with Tarantino's work this movie is exciting, beautifully constructed, extremely stylish, violent and controversial, and features several remarkable performances. On one level it's a brilliant intellectual discourse on the depiction of Nazism within cinema (the Fassbender character is an expert on UFA, the second half revolves around a film-within-a-film) but on another it's a very blunt and sadistic exploitation piece in the vein of Ilsa: She-Wolf Of The SS, with plenty of torture and mayhem to shock the gentle cinephile. It plays with conventions of storytelling, re-writing history, suddenly killing off characters you thought were more important, even adding slapstick humour (Waltz' reaction when Kruger explains the reason for her injury is priceless) to an extremely disturbing tale. The two subplots dovetail effortlessly into the cinema finale and the final twist of uber-nasty Colonel Landa's treachery leaves you gasping. There are perhaps a few limitations; there isn't very much action and Tarantino loves to stage long, involving dialogue scenes which perhaps slow things down a little too much, but his direction is so assured and the actors are so captivating that it rarely feels sluggish. In particular Austrian actor Waltz is simply outstanding in an almost unplayable part - charming, ferocious and contemptible all at once, whilst both Laurent and Kruger are terrific in the two key and contrasting female roles. For moviehounds the film is packed full of historical film trivia - the title (nobody knows why it's misspelled) comes from the English title of Enzo Castellari's 1978 B-picture Quel Maledetto Treno Blindato, a sort of Dirty Dozen knock-off, it's full of crazy music cues from several obscure movies (the slow-burn David Bowie song comes from Paul Schrader's Cat People), Mike Myers and Rod Taylor appear in one scene but under unrecognisable makeup jobs, QT alumni Samuel L. Jackson and Harvey Keitel both do voice-overs and the characters argue the merits of Leni Riefenstahl. And where else could you see Eli Roth (director of gory current US cult horror flicks) pretending to be Antonio Margheriti (director of gory sixties Italian cult horror flicks). All in all this is great stylish fun and a fascinating picture to pick apart afterwards."

","Although I like this movie very much, every time I see Brad Pitts face it ruins it. Yes, he's pretty to look at and that's about it. So leave those roles as such. Absolutely not sure why he was cast other than the dollar sign? He has no depth. And as much as I LOVE Mike Meyers....where did that come from? Wrote my thesis on the tragedy and found this movie alarming as it offered something of a popular understanding for young folk that could inspire further hatred. Be careful on that Hollywood seeing as there is not one thing right about what happened. The language and Europen dialect was fairly spot on which shows a great deal of research coupled with some fine actors. Thanks for a good movie but maybe your casting agent should be fired or maybe you all made enough money to say ""Who cares?"".<br/><br/>Great movie but fire the casting agent.

","That was what happened to me. I saw the trailer and expected the movie's title to also be the theme. Also, I thought Brad Pitt would have a major part in it. And finally, I was curious about Tarantino's ability to write compelling dialogue in German. And, boy, was I wrong!<br/><br/>Like many other reviewers, I came to realize that the Basterds only play a minor role in the story of the movie and the importance of Aldo Raine is even less significant. The whole of the plot is dominated by the brilliant Hans Landa, which is most evident in the scene before the movie premiere. When Mrs von Hammersmark introduces Aldo Raine to Landa as an Italian friend we hear the SS Officer ramble in fluent Tuscan. Obviously only to test the ""friend"" for he is clearly not the person he is being passed off as. And of course Lt. Raine, knowing nothing about Italian, barely gets two words out of his mouth.<br/><br/>It makes you wonder why Christoph Waltz won the Academy Award for ""Best Supporting Actor"", when instead he is clearly the leading actor. And truly, the Austrian makes this movie come to live. Maybe even more so, because he was type-cast as the sinister and devious villain before Tarantino even knew of him.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I enjoyed the movie with the same sense of seriousness I attribute to all other ""Tarantinos"" and made my peace with it mid-way through.<br/><br/>Final address to the Writer: Dear Quentin, I will readily endure another half-hour rant about Madonna's hidden agenda, as long as You stick to English.

But for some reason I just didn't love it.<br/><br/>Maybe it was because it was too violent for me, but that doesn't make much sense because I like the Final Destination films, and they have tons of violence.

","Quentin Tarantino's next step in creating excellent commentaries for his motion pictures, is his history rewrite of the Holocaust, ""Inglourious Basterds"". Tarantino rewrites the story of the Holocaust, and gets away with writing a story about Nazi killers called the Basterds. The film follows a well-written script, and a spectacular cast including Brad Pitt, Diane Kruger, Melanie Laurent, and Christoph Waltz (my favorite role in the film). Although the film had awkward moments and had an ability to write fiction into real life, the film never bothered me on the subject of recreating the Holocaust history. It was just another excellent piece of commentary given by the great Tarantino. This film has experienced wacky moments, and scenes that can relate to what really happened during the Holocaust. This film has everything you'd expect in a Tarantino flick: blood, killings, suspense, quirkiness, unique camera moves, and well-written material. About the cast, Brad Pitt was just splendid, but it's Christoph Waltz that deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar win as Colonel Hans Landa of the SS. This film is well-written, excellent casted, and super challenging to make this an amazing motion picture by the Tarantino man. ""Inglourious Basterds"", in my review, ""A perfectly rewritten draft of history."""

","Quentin Tarantino's alternate take on World War 2 is a mix of the old Hollywood western and B movie gore fest. The story has 2 plot lines one is Shosanna Dreyfus / Emmanuelle Mimieux(Mélanie Laurent) who escapes being killed by Col. Hans Landa(Christoph Waltz) she then makes to Paris where she inherits a cinema which is chosen to premiere a propaganda film where all the top Nazis are in attendance and Shosanna plans to burn down the place killing all the Nazis. The other story revolves around the Basterds lead by Lt. Aldo Raine(Brad Pitt) who are tasked to kill Nazis. They get wind of the premiere and plan to kill all the top party officials.<br/><br/>The film has a feel y spaghetti western with parts of old spy movie thrown in. The movie is way over the top in showing violence a Tarantino trade mark. I must say the first scene is the best one where we really get to see Waltz shine as an actor. The movie does drag in a few places with a lot of dialog in French and German. Overall I enjoyed the film but it is not my favorite Tarrantino film.<br/><br/>Grade B"
"nossa01","9","0","3","4 May 2011"," Vengeance
","The film ""Inglorious Bastards"" is about a war between Nazi Germany and the Allied Jews. The Nazis are slaughtering Jewish families from the command of Adolf Hitler. SS Colonel Hans Landa is essentially in charge of hunting the Jews. A group of soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine attempt to kill the Nazis. Also, a woman named Shosanna Dreyfus who owns a cinema attempts to kill Adolf Hitler and the higher ranking members of Nazi Germany. Shosanna Dreyfus successfully kills Hitler and the higher rankings member of Nazi Germany by setting fire to her theater. This film follows both story lines as they attempt to take down Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie is pure vengeance. Hitler and his Nazis have done terrible things and slaughtered many Jews. The group lead by Raines is made up of Jewish-American boys who are seeking vengeance on Hitler and his Nazis for killing their kind essentially. Shosanna Dreyfus is seeking vengeance for what Hitler and his Nazis has done to her and her family.<br/><br/>This movie is mostly shot in high-key lighting. There are little areas of darkness in the movie, except for the scenes in the bar. This may display the mood that is happening at the current time. Even though the movie may seem sad to most (the killing of so many people), both parties seem to be content in what they are doing because they feel they are doing the right thing. In the parts where the film gets a more low-key lighting, it is when one of the parties is in trouble per say. One example is when the solders led by Raine are preparing to go into the basement bar, they feel it is a poorly set up area because if the situation went wrong they would be fighting in an enclosed area where there is little room, and they also cannot see if the men they wanting to kill are in there. They feel uncomfortable, and therefore, the lighting may be representing this. This goes along with the theme because Hitler and his Nazis have done terrible things already, it is the soldiers and Shosanna's time to seek their vengeance for what they have done. This is something they want and are striving for and will be happy when they finally give Hitler and his Nazis what they have coming. Essentially, the sad time has already passed.<br/><br/>This film also briefly uses the element of flashback when Shosanna Dreyfus is in the restaurant and she sees SS Colonel Hans Landa walk in. she flashes back to when she was a young girl and was chased out of the house that she was staying in that was illegal housing her family and hiding them from the Nazis. Dreyfus ran from Landa, and this is what she flashes back to when she sees him. This reiterates the theme of vengeance because Dreyfus is thinking about what Landa has done to her and her family, and there begins her plot to kill those in the theater for the viewing of ""A Nation's Pride."" This film is similar in theme to the film ""The Patriot"". In ""The Patriot"", Benjamin Martin's son was killed by a British Officer. Because of this he forms a militia to go after the British army out of vengeance for what they have done to him, his family, and his son. He tends to be more like Raine's army of soldiers rather than Shosanna's technique of taking out Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie is about vengeance in its purest form. It shows one technique, that of Raine's soldiers, who choose to confront the Nazi's in a gruesome and head-on way. While yet another revenge technique is shown by Shosanna, who chooses to be sly, sneaky, and more plotting than her counterparts in her way of taking out Nazi Germany. Both techniques shows the true theme of vengeance against someone/something that has wronged a person."
"juliusbarnswallow","8","0","3","22 April 2011"," Subtext is everything
","This movie can be read as an allegory about the Native Americans--there are OBVIOUS references and not so obvious. The first thing that tipped me off was a shot that recreates a famous shot from The Searchers...when at near the end of Chapter One the Nazi officer stands in the doorway...as John Wayne does in The Searchers. (See the Searchers.) From there it gets more obvious. Brad Pit is the APACHE, who forms a band of Jewish soldiers to get him SCALPS. So already the Jews are identified with the Native Americans twice. Then there are the Jewish soldiers' names: the ""Bear"" and ""Little Man."" Hitler and his men die in an ambush something like Custer's Last Stand at Little Big Horn. Notice also the makeup (war paint)the Jewish theater owner puts on as she prepares for the ambush. The unpleasant subtext thus, is that the Nazi's domination of the Jews is comparable to the ""white"" man's domination of the ""red."" (See Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee.) The Nazis are compared directly to the Americans' when the sniper war hero is called the German Sergeant York."
"KineticSeoul","8","0","4","10 February 2011"," Despite the minor flaws, it's a film worth seeing. Especially because of Christoph Waltz.
","This is one of those movies that got way more credit than it deserves, and that isn't to say it's a bad movie. In fact it's far from it, this movie is actually pretty good but just not a masterpiece like some people are claiming it to be. This really is a self indulgent film for Quentin Tarantino, which can be for the better or worse. Now Quentin Tarantino is known for writing some of the most genius and brilliant dialogues, and the dialogue in this movie is very good just didn't seem all that amazing compared to his past movies. But it's still memorable and there is enough tension to it. This film is basically a war epic, not a historically accurate film which makes things a bit more satisfying especially because of the outcome. This film is not a action movie like the misleading trailers make it out to seem, but mostly revolves around the dialogue, in fact it's mostly about the dialogue. Brad Pitt is the most well known actor in this movie and his portrayal of Lt. Aldo Raine the wise cracking southern accent guy who is the leader of the Inglourious Basterds was done very well. It really was entertaining to watch his performance, but the main scene stealer has to be Christoph Waltz. He really did put on a phenomenal performance in playing the Nazi villain Col. Hans Landa aka The Jew Hunter. His character is smart, intimidating and evil to the point you can't help but be interested in this character. In fact all the scenes he is in, is like some of the best scenes in this. Now another positive aspect of this movie is that the main enemies in this is the Nazis and it's the enemies in movies and even video games where there deaths mean enjoyment for most audiences. On that note, watching the plan come together really is a lot of fun to watch even if the dialogues on the way to get there seem pointless at times and a bit to self indulgent. Diane Kruger was also a excellent choice for this movie, she played Bridget von Hammersmark flawlessly and she was really hot in this. In fact the cast of this whole movie is nearly perfect, I couldn't have thought of a even better cast. The music choice is nearly perfect as well and fit nicely with every scene it was in. The main negative aspect of this movie is the fact that besides Christoph Waltz being the best part about this movie, the most entertaining parts are with Inglourious Basterds but they are just hardly in the movie. The build up of some of the characters are done well, but it just didn't seem like the Quentin did enough with some of the characters that are in the movie. This film is basically sub-plots coming together for one goal and for the most part is done very well and it held my interest. Overall despite the minor flaws, but the set up is done so well to the point I give it a 8.3/10.<br/><br/>8.3/10"
"Imdbidia","7","0","4","9 February 2011"," A WWII movie, Tarantino's style
","Another entertaining movie by Tarantino.<br/><br/>The strong powerful music, the use of 60s's-style typing and tempo, the visually explicit violence, and the ""inspiration"" in other people's movies are all Tarantino trademarks and, therefore, they're present in this movie.<br/><br/>The script is not as brilliant as Kill Bill, and reminded me more of Reservoir Dogs in its tone and style, but the film is truly entertaining, thrilling and captivating sometimes, obscure and pointless some others. It has, I think, the playful mood of a war movie that I like, the Great Escape. And that's great.<br/><br/>Most of the main actors are well in their respective roles. I especially liked the actor playing the Jews-Hunter Nazi (Christopher Waltz), the actor interpreting soldier Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), Diana Kruger, and Mike Myers in his little cameo. Brad Pitt is OK in his role, but too much facial gesticulation for my taste. Just the opposite happens to Melanie Laurent, too hieratic and emotionless in her role. Some of the secondary roles and actors are almost a caricature, as the movie oozes a cruel sort of humor, but the actors are not especially inspired.<br/><br/>A paradox. There are not good or bad people in this movie, all are nasty in different degrees. The ""basterds"" are extremely violent and inhuman, which somewhat dilutes their good intentions, fighting against inhuman people. If you are as cruel as the most cruel person, you are not better than that person, even if your principles and aims are very different. I think that is extremely well depicted in the role of Zeller, who shows to be a lovely soldier, who, despite killing 300 soldiers, was not that happy about that. Instead, the ""basterds"" were justifying their extreme random violence. The Jews/hunter is very clever and likable, more than any of the ""basterds"" who are less clever, more naive and idiotic than this man. This is a confusing message, although reflects very well the idea that in war everybody is inhuman, despite ones having more reason or principles than others. The film, moreover, exploits some stereotypes, too.<br/><br/>I consider an error the presence of Hitler at the end of the movie, and what happens to him. It can be understood as a projection of a Universal psyche, as most people in his senses would have liked him killed by his own body-ward, or, even better, by a Jew - He deserved it after all. However, that did not happen, and that fictional license rests credibility to the movie storyline, which is not bad.<br/><br/>In many scenes, the violence is justified, but in others is not. I know that this is quintessentially Tarantino, but I think that, by treating all moments with so much explicit violence, the tone and tempo of the movie somewhat gets diluted; if Tarantino had dosed the violence in the film, leaving to the dialogs some of it, the spectator would have been less overwhelmed visually.<br/><br/>Saying this, I really enjoyed the film, kept me entertained and wanting more."
"Jonathon_Natsis","9","0","5","1 February 2011"," 'You know something, Utivich? I think this just might be my masterpiece.' –Lt. Aldo Raine.
","With this closing line of his stylised war epic, borderline-insane film mogul Quentin Tarantino offers an all-too-obvious example of breaking the fourth wall via his character's words. Brad Pitt was referring to his skill as a 'human sculptor' of sorts, but as he looks directly into the lens of the camera, we're left with no doubt that no-one is as impressed with the final product as QT himself. His masterpiece? Not quite, but there's no shame in coming second to Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds follows the exploits of two individuals bent on ending the Second World War. Aldo Raine leads a group of Jewish-American soldiers known as The Basterds, who roam the countryside contributing to the war effort in their own unique way. Meanwhile, Jewish woman Shoshanna Dreyfus lives under a new identity as the owner of a French cinema, biding her time in order to get revenge on the Germans for the assassination of her family four years ago.<br/><br/>There are many factors that denote the excellence of this film. Tarantino has always had an eye for casting, and Basterds shows that he hasn't lost a step in this field. Christoph Waltz plays the menacing Hans Landa, nicknamed 'The Jew Hunter' by his peers 'precisely because he has earned it.' <br/><br/>A figure that couldn't be more similar to Heath Ledger's Joker (in terms of motive and characterisation) without being more different (with respect to how he satisfies those motives), Landa is one of the most engaging characters ever created by QT, and is played with the determination and pure evil that secured Waltz an incomprehendable number of Supporting Actor awards. <br/><br/>While the superstar German is complemented by pleasing performances from Pitt, Laurent and Kruger, perhaps the only negative of the film is Eli Roth as The Bear Jew. While I can take him or leave him as a filmmaker, I've always said his place was in the director's chair, not in front of the camera. For such a well-written character with so much presence on-screen, Roth's overacting and general inexperience dampens the intensity of certain scenes, but never to the point where they are no longer engaging.<br/><br/>Best described as a poor film that is ultimately misunderstood, Death Proof allowed many people to raise the claim that Tarantino had lost his way, letting cinematic exploitation become his priority in place of writing the most original screenplays in Hollywood. Those claims are swiftly put to bed courtesy of the dialogue written for Inglourious Basterds. The opening interrogation scene, the game of Celebrity Heads in La Louisine and Shoshanna's impromptu apple strudel meeting with Landa all make for compelling viewing (while composing of little to no English) and showcase QT's undeniable talent with the pen and paper.<br/><br/>This film made for one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in a cinema, as the indulgent, period-defining cinematography is something best seen on the big screen. But this is to take nothing away from the edge-of-your-seat set pieces, determined character acting and an ending that takes some historical liberties (to make the largest of understatements). As for a rating, Martin Wuttke as Adolf Hitler puts it best: Nein, nein, nein, nein, nein!/10.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

","I have never seen a more engaging film in my entire life. The poetic dialog, crisp visuals and pounding soundtrack come together in a way that only an extraordinary director can orchestrate. Inglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarantino's long awaited WW II movie ( although he doesn't really stick to to the facts ... ). He took several years to finish this screenplay, as he admits in interviews that he could never find the right ending. eventually he did find it, and the rest is history. This film truly takes place in Tarantino's universe. Once you accept that, you are taken on a roller coaster ride, with a perfect balance between well crafted, exciting dialog and fast paced, extremely violent action.<br/><br/>my advice : watch this movie as soon as you can, it is truly worth it!"
"tom-koppen","9","0","7","23 January 2011"," Quentin Tarantino's best movie (2009).
","I didn't expect much from this film, I suppose the trailer focused too much on Brad Pitt and gave me the wrong idea, doesn't mean Brad Pitt was bad in this.<br/><br/>It was great and in my opinion the best film of 2009, much better than The Hurt Locker and Avatar. When you make a fictional story about Nazis's and make Hitler look like an imbecile, not the ""evil"" angry creature that he was, you probably can't win the best directing or best picture Oscar. Let's hope Quentin can make ""a more serious movie"" in the future so he finally gets rewarded for his work by the academy, though it's the lack of seriousness which makes his movies great I guess.<br/><br/>Noticed and read some complaints about borrowing and ripping stuff from other movies. Tarantino does it in a good way, showing stuff from foreign or forgotten movies to a wider/different audience, bringing that cinema back to life. Must admit that I was really shocked seeing scenes very identical or very recognizable sometimes, but probably these movies would have never come to my attention if QT didn't copy from them."

","In the first of the five chapters that Inglourious Basterds is divided into, a Nazi general philosophises about rodents with a man and scares him enough for him to give away the people hiding under the floor. One woman somehow escapes the bullets and runs across a beautiful grassland all the while being eyed by the Nazi officer. He doesn't shoot and nor do his soldiers. He waits. He waits till she is a body-length away before fading from view. He takes aim. He shoots. His gun's run out of bullets.<br/><br/>All the two and a half hours of this film are made of such brilliant scenes and most of them are unpredictable. For Quentin Tarantino, this isn't new, these small moments are his calling card. When the air- hostess of Pam Grier walks into the airport terminal in Jackie Brown, it's his moment. When a group of odd-named characters sit around a table discussing tipping waitresses, it's his moment. When a drugged assassin has one shot, only one shot, at stabbing a life-saving syringe into the heart of his boss' woman, it's Tarantino's moment. He is a connoisseur of his own taste: a taste built on watching movies, absorbing heroes and living their stories. Inglourious Basterds is another one for himself and his taste. He picks a genre (war, here), goes back a few years to the World War, stops at regular intervals to choose people to pay small tributes to and just has fun with blood and gore. The violence is extreme but he makes it look cinematically ravishing. Faces are smashed, throats are slit, tons of bullets burst into tons of bodies and blood even floats like confetti. You wince at a man being disfigured, but you still wait for the next round of gore because it is just so well made. The violence repels, the image attracts. Add music to it, give the characters a blessed array of actors and you have a winner on hand. Almost a winner on hand. The problem that the film has is what Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction didn't have. Cut up Inglourious Basterds into small pieces and each piece can make for a masterpiece. Together, they step on each other. At 150+ minutes, it doesn't feel long at all. It doesn't feel like one film either. Each character has credibility, a reason to be on screen. Yet, when it's time to collect everyone in time for sundown, you realise they've strayed away. There is something lacking in the whole experience. It isn't depth, for the characters are so, so full of life that you almost feel it's a chess board in front of you. Perhaps it is the knowledge that there is only so much Tarantino leaves himself as options while the film zips to its climax. The surprise is only in how the film reaches that climax. All this makes Inglourious Basterds feel like a fine experience, and an incomplete film. Would a few ordinary scenes have provided solidity to it? Was there a need for, as they say in football, the water-career, the one who isn't flamboyant but does the dirty work for others? Maybe it needed a bit of ugliness. Maybe it needed a context to make us appreciate the final scene for its importance to the film than for us to rejoice at its ingenuity. Inglorious? No. Ingenious, yes. Basterd, maybe."

Yes, he steals from other movies.

He shows just enough restraint to keep the film from getting weighed down by its own stylishness. It's a film that's both different from anything else Tarantino has made to date, but it's a film that could only be made by Quentin Tarantino. Inglourious Basterds will be looked upon as a dazzling film for years to come, and I know I'll be showing it to my kids (when they're old enough, of course).<br/><br/>Christoph Waltz is known as the film's shining star, and deservedly so, as his performance as Hans Landa is evil, frightening and somehow charming and endearing.

His Southern twang is great, and his Italian is even better.<br/><br/>The final scene is absolute cinema magic. There's something about the music that plays when Marcel is standing in front of the pile of films that really brings the tension to a fever pitch.

","Quentin Tarantino has a unique style that is all his own in terms of how he makes movies; he tends to be crude in the visual delivery, but still manages to make the movie entertaining. Inglourious Basterds is about one of the most gruesome wars in history, and this is right up Tarantino's alley so to speak, gore is what Tarantino does best.<br/><br/>Tarantino takes Inglourious Basterds and essentially rewrites history in order to tell a story about how things might have been if a few factors had been different. Specifically, how an elite squad of killers was commissioned to seek out Nazi's and treat them the way they were treating the Jewish people, and with no mercy. Lt Aldo Raine, played by Brad Pitt, is the quintessential good old boy ""redneck"" that heads up the elite squad of misfits. Col. Hans Landa, played by Christopher Waltz, is Raine's counterpart and nemesis on the Nazi side. The third main character of the film, Shoshanna Dreyfus, played by Mélanie Laurent, is a Jewish girl that escapes from Col. Landa's murderous grasp.<br/><br/>Each part of the movie is broken down into chapters, like many of Tarantino's previous movies, e.g. Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, and Four Rooms. Each chapter in the movie has its own sub plot and main characters that brings the entire story of the movie together. While most of the chapters have one of the three main characters, there is a scene that takes place in a basement bar that adds some supporting roles to the story. Lt. Archie Hicox, played by Michael Fassbender, and Bridget von Hammersmark, played by Diane Kruger, are the main characters in the basement scene that carry over to the end of the movie.<br/><br/>One of the ways you can tell that this is a Tarantino movie is by the dramatic sounds that occur throughout the movie. In each of the scenes while people are talking you do not hear any other background noise or music. During the scenes where there is only conversation occurring, it's almost a dead silence around the actors, which in turn assists in the build up of the climactic ending of the chapter. When we do get to the dramatic and violent scenes, the music and sound effects are almost overpowering and very loud, which takes you from one extreme to the other.<br/><br/>This film, Inglourious Basterds, is yet another Tarantino masterpiece that does not disappoint. He is able to take an extremely sensitive subject from history and rewrite it to tell a story about how things should have gone. Inglourious Basterds is both an entertaining and satirical movie."

","Unbelievable! To me Quentin still is the most surprising and inspiring director that we have around, a true genius, boldly going where no one has EVER gone before. His ideas are revolutionary in that they are shockingly simple: make a movie where Hitler gets what he deserves! Not in order to satisfy crude and simple revenge fantasies: just because nobody has ever thought about making such a movie! Cast, soundtrack and dialogue of his movies I don't bother to mention, they always speak for themselves (literally). Their qualities are so much above the ordinary. This movie is maybe his clearest example to my point: that his productions are always working on two levels at the same time: beyond the plot, the acting and the camera work he is always making a contribution to 'making a movie' as an art form. For myself, I might not rate it as my favourite one (in terms of telling a story), but it definitely is a revolutionary bold attempt in film making. Keep it up."

","If there's one thing that will instantly deny a movie a 4 star rating its an entirely predictable plot. This movie certainly does not have that.<br/><br/>Yes, I admit, this movie is not for everyone. It's pretty gory, but don't go complaining about it as if you weren't expecting that coming in. Lots of people die, there's a lot of blood, but if you can take or even like that sort of thing, it works to the movie's over-the-top personality.<br/><br/>The one thing that stood out to me in this movie was the prevalence of really long, seemingly low-action scenes. The mastery of this film is that in these scenes, you are still entertained because the outcome of the situation is entirely in doubt, and you find yourself coaxing along the protagonists through their sticky situations. The opening scene of the movie is a great example of this.<br/><br/>I find the use of multiple languages interesting, I guess some might not but I certainly don't think it detracts from the movie at all.<br/><br/>The ending to the movie is yet another example of an extremely long scene, and is a true work of art in the way the plot keeps you guessing and emotionally invested in the outcome.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this movie, so long as you can deal with a good deal of gore."

","Quentin Tarantino returns to form with ""Inglorious Basterds,"" an uber-violent World War II revenge fantasy, modeled, at least in part, on ""The Dirty Dozen."" Brad Pitt, replete with noose-scarred neck and Southern drawl, plays Aldo Raine, a lieutenant in the U.S. military, who's recruited a band of Jewish mercenaries - dubbed the Inglorious Basterds - to roam the war torn countryside killing Nazis then removing their scalps as souvenirs. The few who are allowed to survive have a swastika carved into their foreheads as a warning to all future victims that the boys are coming to get them.<br/><br/>The ""basterds"" get their best opportunity to inflict maximum damage when Goebbels agrees to premiere one of his Nazi propaganda films in a theater in occupied France, a premiere at which just about anyone who's anyone among the German high command - including Der Fuhrer himself - will be in attendance. The plan is for the ""basterds"" to go in and annihilate virtually the entire Nazi regime in one fell swoop.<br/><br/>After years in which we've watched Jews in WWII films being marched off helplessly to death camps, ""Inglorious Basterds"" provides an almost purgative function by letting us see the victims finally doling out some long overdue, eye-for-an-eye justice to their murderous oppressors - even if it's a retribution largely consigned to the realm of fantasy and fiction (though the recent ""Defiance"" obviously provided us with a factual account of just such a turnabout).<br/><br/>Interestingly, though, despite their having star billing in the title, the ""basterds"" themselves are actually accorded a surprisingly small amount of screen time in the movie, so that anyone going into it expecting nonstop violent action scenes centered around the group's activities may be sorely disappointed. In reality, much more of the movie's 152-minute running time is devoted to the story of a beautiful Jewess (Melanie Laurent) who, after escaping death at the hands of a sadistic SS colonel (the brilliant Christopher Waltz in his bravura Oscar-winning performance), is now, as the owner of the theater where the movie will be shown, in a unique position to exact her revenge, both for herself and for all her people who have suffered under this brutal regime (her plan is to burn the theater down with all the Nazis inside). <br/><br/>Tarantino has self-consciously divided his screenplay into five subtitled chapters. The scenes within each chapter run long and all take place in a single setting, but they are rarely static, thanks to Tarantino's skill at composition, his penchant for crackling dialogue, and the suspense that arises organically from the situations being dramatized. Still, this is far from a fast-paced action-movie crowd-pleaser, so one should be forewarned that a certain amount of patience is required from the viewer.<br/><br/>Episodic in structure and deliberate in its pacing - with a healthy dose of black humor and a soundtrack just anachronistic enough to provide the imprimatur of ""coolness"" one demands from a Tarantino film - ""Inglorious Basterds"" provides an imperfect but imaginative spin on World War II ""history."""
"kochwolf2003","8","0","6","27 June 2010"," An alternate take on history, with both earnestness and levity
","Oh yes, Inglourious Basterds does contain violence and even gore, too graphic for my liking at times. On the other hand, both the commercial trailer and NPR's Quentin Tarantino interview will have you believe the violent scenes are pervasive or excessively frequent, which they aren't. And that's good! This movie has plenty of intricate storylining and dramatic complexity woven into it. The opening scene shows very effectively how the day-to-day Nazi occupation of France may have operated in its sophistication and ruthlessness, penetrating even the remotest rural areas, and how that may have felt to those subjected to it--namely, to a Jewish girl named Shosanna. This scene alone explains a lot of the extremes to which Shosanna will go at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>While the action scenes are certainly fast-paced, the dialogue scenes are never hurried. They allow for ample character study, with the bizarre finding that some of the Nazi ""dignitaries"" exude a vibrant humanity (and I don't mean that the featured SS officer speaks four languages fluently), while some of the ""good guys"" remain flat and bland. Specifically, Brad Pitt's redneck accent (we later learn his character is supposed to be from Tennessee) seems forced and gratuitous. And while we are on the subject of Brad Pitt: Is he being groomed to be another Clark Gable? If so, then it isn't working.<br/><br/>The nature of the story dictates that you would find characters speaking French, German, and English with one another, and Quentin Tarantino does a bold job approaching the challenge of integrating these languages (as opposed to prescribing the generic use of English). Whatever dialogue is not in English gets subtitled in English, so you will be reading a lot of subtitles. When French and German speakers interact, they generally end up speaking French, although sometimes with the aid of an interpreter--which bears a certain irony because that interpreter won't help English-speaking audiences.<br/><br/>Since I happen to speak both German and French, I found those dialogues inspired and conducive to good storytelling, especially with the German and French delivered by actors who are household names in their countries. However, the expectation of many scenes being subtitled wasn't set in the trailer, and some people might find their unexpected and frequent occurrence annoying or exhausting in a two-and-a-half-hour movie. But again, as far as I am concerned, the ""naturalism"" of multiple languages worked for me and even added to the gravitational pull of a compelling plot.<br/><br/>It's neither good nor bad that the script takes considerable creative license with historical facts. We all know that at least the ending didn't happen that way, although you wish it had, so I admit this may be bad. The soundtrack also reminds us every so often, by going back and forth between historic shellac favorites and today's sonic imagery, that this is a story tailored to engage present-day audiences. The plot has intriguing twists to it, and the overall craftsmanship of the movie is solid, so yes, this movie has managed to engage me for two and a half hours."

","Out of all of Quentin Tarantino's films, such as Pulp Fiction, or Kill Bill, this one tops them all. Why, well for starters, the concept is pretty clever. Instead of being an epic WWII drama, Quentin thought, what if it were a comedy, mixed with drama. Little did he know what would come out, this. Brad Pitt is a military war soldier in WWII who forms a team of thirteen men assigned for one thing, and one thing only. Killin Nazis. Not in the style of devoted war heroes, but instead hardcore rad dudes who are the hippest guys in the war. The editing takes each scene with different people by chapters, as he usually does, with different plot points which by the end get mixed together to form one huge plot point. Christoph Waltz costars as a Nazi leader who follows these points and fools them all together, but his cleverness gets the better of him by the end. Not over long, and definitely not short, but manages to keep you entertained. Different from other war films, but thats what makes it so great."

It started a little slow, and when I saw that it was broken into 'chapters' my heart sank as I wondered how long the film was. After the first fantastic sequence, the pace seems to slow, but it does pick up again and at the end of the film I was left with the feeling that it would be one to recommend.

I was wrong. I loved it from the first minute. The acting, the setting, the plot were all great.<br/><br/>Waltz did deserved his Oscar for this job. He did not only performed as one of the most credible characters, he was also the most intelligent and the meanest of them all. He is the kind of villain that you hate because the actor is doing such a great job. It just convinces you. And I am not even mentioning his impressive language skills.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt on the other hand confirms that he's a great actor. I have always respected him. A lot of his movies are my personal favorites. So in my opinion he is terrific at what he is doing. He does not rely on his looks, but in his talent. But I think I said all this before.<br/><br/>The story was good. It wasn't outstanding but it worked out fine. What was really good was the way they developed the plot. There are a lot of scenes were you can feel the tension between characters, and it almost makes you want to participate in the conversation. That's why I liked the script a lot, it was really interesting and well polished.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was great as well (Except maybe the Bowie's song near the end).

","I'm a fan of Tarantino but to be honest, I didn't enjoy his vision towards WWII that much. The reason? Well, the Nazi occupation in France seems too comic book oriented. There is plenty of action, kick ass dialogs, conspiracies that lead to disaster, gore, violence, and character development. Sure, the production values are solid but I expected more from the ending.<br/><br/>But I COMPLETELY understand it's Tarantino's style and he won't change it. I get his artistic point of view and I enjoy his script but I wasn't convinced in terms of reality. Still, ""Inglorious Basterds"" is a movie you have to see to understand how a quality action oriented movie has to be. The Direction is superb and I always like Tarantino's narrative. Always gives plenty of chances for the characters to expand their points of view and learn more about their back story.<br/><br/>I mean, the Nazi surrender was way too easy. I expected a more intelligent move from Landa.<br/><br/>Hans Landa is by far the most interesting character. I enjoyed every single moment he was on-screen. Aldo Raine added the ""cool"" and suave hero that knows perfectly how to battle the Nazis. While Stiglitz was my favorite! I wanted to see more from him. Sossana and Bridget were too hot for the screen and their characters were relevant for the revenge.<br/><br/>The scenes I will always remember: Landa's introduction, Sossana's revenge speech, the shooting in the German bar, Jew Bear beating the crap out of a Nazi soldier, the Swastika ""tattoo"", the theater massacre, etc."

","Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds starts off with the bucolic peace of an isolated dairy farm in Nazi-occupied France being interrupted by a motorcycle squad headed by an SS Officer (Christoph Waltz) who is hunting for hidden Jews. The scene brings to mind late-60s spaghetti western, World War 2 action, Hitchcockian menace, Mel Brooks send-up – and maybe even more. With Tarantino at the helm, you know there will be violence, but it will be couched in silly humor, usually involving banter about banal topics. <br/><br/>In this take on the Second World War, Tarantino combines elements of The Dirty Dozen (suggested by the titular pack of Jewish guerrillas, led by Brad Pitt with a Mountain Man accent, whose mission is to hunt, kill and scalp – not necessarily in that order - as many Nazis as possible) with various other film genres to rewrite history as if it too were another film genre. In this case he concocts a scenario in which the aforementioned guerrillas, in collusion with cineastes, plot to blow up a Paris movie theatre during a screening of a Nazi war epic attended by the leading figures of the Nazi high command, including Hitler, Goebbels, Goering and Bormann.<br/><br/>There are many hilarious sequences, mostly having to do with levity against a backdrop of danger and slaughter. One moment you're laughing at an ironically placed bit of dialogue, and the next you're gasping at an act of violence or moved by the plight of the character at hand. The skill of Tarantino is that he is able to make you care on a strong dramatic level about key people while simultaneously populating his imaginary world with figures straight out of action comics.<br/><br/>It seems that at least half of the dialogue is in German, French or Italian, but the often verbose yellow subtitles blend too often with the visual background resulting in a loss of many lines and levels of plot that are provided through dialogue.<br/><br/>Tarantino's trademark pop cultural references are present in force, but appropriately focused on the cinema of Nazi-era Germany in which names like Lilian Harvey, Leni Riefenstahl, and G.W. Pabst and titles like ""Lucky Kids"" (Gluckskinder, 1936) and ""The White Hell of Piz Palu"" carried as much cultural clout as Jeanette MacDonald, Dorothy Arzner or Frank Capra or ""Maytime,"" ""Top Hat,"" or ""The Good Earth"" would have carried in the States at the same time. Tarantino even manages to replicate the look and feel of Nazi epic film opening credits with the faux movie that unspools at the Paris theatre (""Stoltz der Nation"" – ""Pride of the Nation""). He has done his Nazi-era pop cultural homework.<br/><br/>The best acting overall comes from Waltz as the SS officer. He clearly relishes every moment of the role and devours it like a gourmand at a feast. At times he brings to mind such versatile actors from the past as Peter Sellers and Alec Guinness. Runners up are Denis Menochet as the dairy farmer whose ambiguous, curiously restrained reaction to the SS intruders sets the tone for the whole film; Daniel Bruhl as the German war hero who becomes the star of the biopic about himself; Melanie Laurent as a fugitive Jewish woman hiding her identity as a Parisian theatre operator; Ludger Pistor as a good-humored Nazi officer who corners some of the conspirators in a basement tavern. The better-known Brad Pitt and Diane Kruger are effective but not outstanding."

","It's very surprising for me, Quentin Tarantino (QT) picks warfare genre for his next project, although according to many sources, thiz script has been buried for a very long time in Tarantino's desk. QT is authentically an inspirational and eccentric Director at the same time. His previous best works are ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) and ""Kill Bill"" (2007). It seems to me, he always finds something new to put in each of his film. The story is about a group of soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who is known as ""The Basterds"". They have mission to terminate every Nazi with their fiercely sadistic way. It's also about an unfortunately Jewish girl (Melanie Laurent) who was the only survivor when Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) killed her entire family. Afterward, she runs a cinema that incidentally is rented by Nazi for their important occasion. She has a revenge plan to demolish the whole cinema with all Gestapo and Nazi superiors inside. Simply, QT never focuses on one-man-show. With his unique directing, QT takes us to his world where anything could be different. From the first chapter, we are already served by thoughtful and memorable dialogue. I think the power of QT's movie is on the dialogue, unpredicted plots, sometimes comical and filled with memorable characters in each of his movie. If you free-minded enough then you can enjoy QT's movies. Like Col.

","During WWII, a crack Jewish outfit seeks revenge against the Nazis in occupied France. This is a good-looking film, marked by sumptuous cinematography and a fine score. There are good performances from Pitt, Laurent, and Kruger, but the film belongs to Waltz, who is mesmerizing as a cold, calculating Nazi officer with polite manners. Tarantino is a fine story-teller and he is at his best in seemingly mundane scenes where tension builds, such as the scenes in the farm house and the tavern. What holds his films back is his sick obsession with graphic violence. Fortunately, there are only a few minutes of that here. Despite its epic length, this film does not drag for a moment."

","It is a grand fiction that All Nazi soldiers were more evil and malice than US soldiers. Actually, immediately before the war the German soldiers were the most disciplined in the world and had the lowest cases of sexual assault against women and otherwise harming citizens. When the Russians took Germany, countless women and children were raped and murdered in cold blood. War is ugly and it is terrible thing. Most Hollywood type movies encourage the dehumanization of whoever the current ""enemy"" is in tandem with the US Military's own propaganda for the troops.<br/><br/>I found this film to be somewhat entertaining but find myself saddened by the fact that so many ""WW2 Buffs"" don't even know that both sides of the conflict were funded by banking families who controlled the executive branches of the US and Britain as well as other very influential people and powerbases in both countries.<br/><br/>It was very good that the Nazi's were beaten down - They were allowed to grow and Hittler was coached by these banking elites. Hittler was -not- a complete moron - Most of his generals did not understand that he was given free reign to raise hell. It didn't make sense to his generals in Military terms, however, It made perfect sense politically.<br/><br/>We are all humans and we ALL have the same inalienable rights.

"mnpollio","7","0","4","9 April 2010"," Two-thirds brilliant - one-third rubbish
","While not a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino and his often ADHD film epics, I do have some appreciation of his talents. So despite the fact that the previews for this film literally made me cringe, I decided to give it a shot and was pleasantly surprised. The film opens in Nazi-occupied France in one of the most tense and perfectly acted openings I can remember set in a farm house harboring Jewish refugees beneath its floorboards and a rather intimidating interrogation between the farmer and charming/threatening SS officer Christoph Waltz. Unfortunately, the action then switches to the Inglorious Basterds of the title and the writing/directing suddenly seems to have been taken over by a rather immature and volatile 10-year-old. The action shifts yet again to a cinema in France operated by a young woman who escaped in the opening passage and who is now masquerading as a Gentile. The woman - played beautifully by Melanie Laurent - finds herself thrust into the spotlight as she has become the unwilling object of affection of good-natured young Nazi war hero Daniel Bruhl and the Nazi powers-that-be have decided that her theater should host the premiere of a new propaganda film based on Bruhl's exploits, which will attract the Nazi hierarchy, and brings her under the scrutiny of Waltz again. Thankfully, this plot thread becomes the main one with the ""Inglorious Basterds"" taking a back seat. I say thankfully because something becomes glaringly clear early on. Every time the film focuses on the German, French or British characters, everything seems to flow with intelligence and suspense. When the film shifts to the American characters it turns into amateur night in Dixie with the writing and acting. Something even more notable when Brad Pitt and company have to interact with the international cast. Never have I seen a more glaring discrepancy in acting prowess than watching the American actors flounder opposite the European cast. While I am not a WW2 scholar, I am familiar enough with it to note that I have never heard of any U.S. forces conducting themselves with the bloodthirsty savagery of the title team during that campaign. Their cause and patriotism seem oddly irrelevant to them so long as they can maim and murder with abandon - which makes them not so much better than the Nazis they abhor. Indeed Pitt seems more than willing to torture allies for his jollies. The overly bloody sequences of them scalping people and disfiguring them with near psychotic glee seem to belong in a completely different film and mar much of Tarantino's otherwise amazing accomplishments here. Tarantino provides some truly terrific passages - including a lengthy mid-film sequence where British officer Michael Fassbender and one of the Basterds try to pass themselves off as Nazi officers in order to meet at a bar with glamorous double-agent Diane Kruger and chance makes it spin completely out of control. Acting-wise the international cast belts it out of the park leaving the American actors looking like hacks. Waltz is nothing short of astounding as the brutal and competent Hans Landa and he easily steals every scene he is in truly earning his Oscar. The case can also be made for wondering why neither Laurent or Kruger were not seriously considered for a nomination. In a film with so few appealing characters, Laurent woos the audience over to her side and makes her ultimate attempt at revenge one to savor. For the majority of the film, Bruhl is appealing and sympathetic as the lovestruck Nazi war hero. So much so that Tarantino must suddenly make him behave completely out of character from anything witnessed previously in the conclusion to excuse executing him without compunction. August Diehl and Gedeon Burkhard make strong impressions as well during the extended sequence at the bar, as does British actor Fassbender. Of the Basterds, German Til Schweiger comes off the most convincing. Eli Roth and B.J. Novak are just plain embarrassing, while Brad Pitt swaggers through the film in a laughably caricaturish performance sporting a ludicrous corn-pone accent with a grimace tattooed on his face that makes him appear to be smelling something rotten (perhaps his performance?). And Tarantino should also note that having every other character die in a bloody hail of bullets can become old and disheartening after a while. Yet despite the lousy writing for the Basterds segments and the dreadful American performances, Inglorious Basterds is well worth watching and remembering for terrific plotting for the majority of the film and the high quality of acting from the European cast. Truth be told, even with its weaknesses this, Avatar, Up in the Air and Precious are all substantially better films than The Hurt Locker, which topped them all at the Oscars."

","When I decided to watch this film, I was clueless about it. The ads suggested that it was a comedy. It is, but not in the way one would think. I also didn't realize that it was directed by Quentin Tarantino. So basically, the whole thing was a surprise for me.<br/><br/>In many ways, ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a good surprise. It's an intriguing, interesting, highly fictional story, with tension throughout, especially in the beginning scene where Colonel Landa (Christoph Waltz) questions a French farmer (Denis Menochet) about hiding a Jewish family.<br/><br/>The Basterds, led by Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) are out to scalp Germans, and their mission collides with that of a Jewish woman (Melanie Laurent) who has fake papers and runs a film theater in Paris. She has a mission, too, and on the night a film is shown that is to be attended by Hitler and SS officers, the plans take effect.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is very funny as Aldo, and Christoph Waltz gives a great performance as Landa. Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger, playing a German actress who is collaborating with the Americans, are both wonderful in their roles.<br/><br/>""Inglourious Basterds"" is filled with horrible violence done as only Tarantino can - you're laughing one minute and repulsed the next - it also has an excellent cast.

Additionally, there is are long periods, sometimes over half an hour, having nothing to do with the overarching plot. Is that okay? Can one do that? I thought movies about the joys of watching bad guys get shot were supposed to stick to the point. This movie does not. I do not feel betrayed or hurt over these issues, and was able to enjoy the movie despite its listed shortcomings, but I would prefer that in the future all movies not have shortcomings and conform more neatly to my preferences. Further, I hereby give notice to all filmmakers that if I wish to read a book, I will do so. The book will presumably be written by a literate and thus have certain advantages in life over the screenplay to this extremely chatty film. From what I have been able to observe, there are books available at both the library and the book store. The books at the library are mostly in foreign languages and frequently cover topics relating to career advancement, but this is a topic best covered elsewhere."

","""Inglourious Basterds"" is a strange brew. Watching it with the misleading marketing in mind creates a sensation akin to downing a mild beer with the expectation of hard liquor. The flavor of Quentin Tarantino's latest is disorienting but familiar, surprisingly placid but intoxicating under the right palette.<br/><br/>The marginal intellect of the director's early work has diminished recently in favor all-out genre exploitation, and though both ""Kill Bill"" films are perfectly entertaining, they're undeniably shallow. And then there's ""Death Proof,"" the novelty record of Tarantino's career. So if I suggest that ""Basterds"" has substance, take it with a grain of salt, we're still dissecting a Tarantino film.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the director has taken a giant leap back, which is a rare but accurate compliment. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a film of extended, often rich and engrossing dialogue, juxtaposed with the requisite deplorable violence. Brad Pitt as Lieutenant Aldo Raine is front man for the predominantly Jewish-American ""Basterds"" squad, whose sole objective seems to be snuffing as many Nazi lives as possible.<br/><br/>And that's where the ads leave the film, which is thankfully short of its creative goal. The truth is ""Inglourious Basterds"" is about the premiere of Nazi propaganda film in a theater owned and operated by a Jewish woman whose family was executed at the hands of the Third Reich and a particularly charming ""Jew Hunter"" portrayed perfectly by German actor Christoph Waltz.<br/><br/>There's already buzz for 'Best Supporting Actor' surrounding Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa, which is interesting in the context of last year's nod to the late Heath Ledger as Joker in ""The Dark Knight."" Aspiring actors: be interesting villains! Waltz's performance is probably more award-worthy than Ledger's, but both are really triumphant cinematic baddies. The atmosphere when Waltz is on screen is thick and tensely palpable. He's responsible for the best moments of the film.<br/><br/>Still, Waltz is hardly all the film has going for it. As usual, Tarantino has crafted a genre- defying collage of ideas that clash in a hip punk sort of way. Oddball comedy follows nail- biting suspense and precedes outlandish shootouts. Yes, the world of Quentin Tarantino is derivative, unfocused, and hyper-active, but the man is a mad chemist with the precise, pre- mixed ingredients for potent, pungent fun.<br/><br/>It really is impossible to review the film without commenting on Tarantino's greater body of work or the man himself. There are three distinct stages to Tarantino criticism, and not everyone can make it past the second. The stages are as follows:<br/><br/>1) ""That was bad-ass awesome, bro!"" Stage 1 is a surface level response to sweet, awesome violence and a kick-ass soundtrack. You're a little bit interested in film, and mentioning that ""Pulp Fiction"" is your favorite movie scores you art-house cred with that hipster girl in second period you think is way hot.<br/><br/>2) ""I've always found Tarantino's work vapid and egotistical."" With more than a basic knowledge of film, Tarantino's inspirations begin to reveal themselves, and the director appears an unimaginative fraud. His work says nothing about the human condition, enjoyed only by bottom-feeding morons.<br/><br/>3) ""You know, I actually liked Kill Bill."" You concede that Tarantino is a director of considerable skill and questionable taste who makes exactly the films he intends to. Their purpose is purely entertainment and, love 'em or leave 'em, are appreciable for what they are.<br/><br/>But complaints of unoriginality and tactless pandering to style over substance took a backseat among the loudest and most harsh critics of Quentin Tarantino's latest, deriding the film for its disrespectful historical inaccuracies (big, big inaccuracies to be fair). Spoiler alert, Hitler gets whacked.<br/><br/>So yeah, that never happened, but what does it mean? Tarantino offs the dictator almost as an aside, without suggesting what that supposition means for the canon of World War II storytelling or even, really, for the world of Basterds themselves. Inasmuch, the film does feel disrespectful and worse, indulgent, but only until you approach its hypothesis of an unannounced alternative reality from an artistic standpoint.<br/><br/>Hitler is gunned down in his balcony seat at the movie premiere. Clearly, obviously, not the end that the real man met. Quentin Tarantino makes a greater statement (in a movie about a movie, no less) about historical fiction. What's the ratio of one to the other? Surely countless films purport themselves as historical dramas, but take as many liberties as service their narrative arcs. At the end of the day it's still a movie, and Tarantino just takes it all the way.<br/><br/>He's hardly a Da Vinci or Duchamp, but history's most memorable artists have similarly challenged the public's perception of a piece of art. That's also not to suggest ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a flawless film, as it suffers from occasional pacing hiccups and irksome stylistic inconsistencies. Still, it's an important film and unquestionably Tarantino's deepest work since, conservatively, ""Jackie Brown.""<br/><br/>His take on World War II is entirely his own, and probably won't win over many second stage Tarantino critics. Ones and threes, let's have a beer and have some fun."
"Jothos","7","0","4","4 April 2010"," Good, but TOO many subtitles!!!
","Omg, I got SOOO dam sick of rewinding to read the subtitles in this movie. Everything else was great. But for one, they were too small (And no, I don't need glasses) for 2, sometimes a 2 or 3 sentence subtitle would be on the screen for literally a second and a half. Who the F reads that dam fast? And 3, over half the dam movie was in German and french, and why bother even having the actors act in a scene with that many dam subtitles? Cuz no one is even looking at their facial expressions. They're just trying frantically to read the friggin subtitles. And sometimes the subtitles blended in with the background, so you couldn't tell what the hell they said no matter how long it was on the screen. Christoph Waltz deserved best supporting actor though. he played his part amazingly. Just all the dam reading got old, and took me out of the movie. And the part of ""The Bear Jew"" could have been a lot cooler. After he beat the guys head in, he started running around and screaming and shouting like an idiot, and took whatever coolness that went with his title away. That's about it. :-)"
"neilist","10","0","5","28 March 2010"," This Film Is NOT ""Proof That The Jews Control Hollywood,"" Etc!
","Contrary to what some people are saying, Inglourious Basterds (""IB"") does not ""prove"" that the American film industry, and the Academy Awards, are ""controlled by Jews,"" etc. IB also does not prove that ""the Jews"" are so psychologically traumatized by the way that they allowed themselves to be murdered like sheep during the Holocaust that they have to come up with BDSM masturbatory of ""Hebrew Ubermench"" fantasies taking revenge on the Nazis, etc.<br/><br/>Instead, IB is a long-awaited celebration of the crack Jewish commando units that actually won WWII, contrary to all those Historical Channel so-called ""documentaries."" Everyone in Hollywood knows that Jews -- and in particular, American Jews -- won the war, despite all the lies that are told about the Red Army, the British, etc.<br/><br/>Further, IB is a sensitive and moving recounting of the horrors of war reflects the personal knowledge of a screenwriter and director who has ""been there."" Not many people outside the film biz know, but Quentin Tarantino served in the USMC in Operation Desert Storm (two tours!), and was awarded the Navy Cross for an action outside Kuwait City.<br/><br/>That's in addition to his services as a Reservist every summer for the last 10 years with the IDF! So when it comes to bloodshed, the anguish of personal loss, and the heartbreak of war, etc., Quentin knows what he's talking about about!<br/><br/>The ""real story"" here is why IB didn't get the Best Picture Oscar. (If you're thinking that Hollywood actually is controlled by the Arabs, I'm not going to contradict you.)<br/><br/>Bottom line: Go see IB, rather than wasting your time on ""based on a true story"" trash like ""Taking Chance,"" ""The Hurt Locker,"" ""Band of Brothers,"" etc. And the next time you see the IDF doing to those Arabs in Gaza what Lt. Raine and his boys did to those Nazis, thank Quentin and the entire cast and crew for helping to condition America to continue to support Israel's right to our G-D-given land! Shalom!"
"sddavis63","7","0","3","21 March 2010"," A Rare Movie That Combines A Lot Of Fun With A Lot Of Violence
","The movie begins with a scene that definitely pulls you in. In Nazi occupied France in 1941, A German officer (Landa, played brilliantly by Christoph Waltz) arrives at a French farmhouse. Nicknamed ""the Jew hunter,"" he's looking for Jews being sheltered by the locals. With little option, the owner gives up his Jewish refugees only to see them murdered in front of his eyes, except for the daughter, who manages to escape. In the next scene, we see a group of American commandos formed under the leadership of Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and consisting of 8 Jewish soldiers. Their mission: to get into France and kill as many Germans as they can - without mercy; and not just kill - they're to terrorize them and scalp them once they're dead, letting one escape each time to spread the news, with a Nazi swastika permanently carved into their forehead so that they'll never escape their Nazi past.<br/><br/>From there we find two different stories take root and develop: one of the young Jewish girl who seeks revenge; the other of the American commandos in France. Eventually, the two stories intersect (unknown to those involved in either) and the end result is a fascinating piece of alternative history in which the entire Nazi leadership (Hitler, Goring, Bormann and Goebbels) are wiped out in a Paris cinema as they watch a German propaganda movie.<br/><br/>This is a very violent movie with many graphic scenes. Frankly, it's probably not for the squeamish. Interestingly though, it manages a surprising balance - while extremely violent, it's also both fun and funny at times. The scene near the end when Raine and his men struggle to speak believable Italian (with terrible American accents) in the cinema to Col. Landa is brief, but hilarious. All the performances are good - most notably, in addition to those already mentioned, Melanie Laurent as Shoshanna and Martin Wittke as Hitler were standouts. It's a little bit long, mind you, and a few things seemed less than believable - why, for example, would such an important German propaganda film be premiered in occupied Paris rather than Berlin? Still, this is very powerful for a completely fictional film."
"lain_alphard","8","0","4","12 March 2010"," Good, not great
","I am not a fan of Quentin Tarantino, nor a fan of Brad Pitt. Thus, when this movie came out, I couldn't care less. However, I found this hype on the internet over one of its star, Christoph Waltz whom I've never heard before. And I was like, ""Okay, I need to see this movie. I need to know what it is with this guy that everyone is so crazy about him"". Unfortunately, I didn't have the chance to see it on theaters. And then time passed by. I forgot about it, until the Oscars last week when Christoph Waltz was awarded Best Supporting Actor. So, I rented it. And boy, am I not disappointed! He was amazing! It's been a while since I saw that kind of performance. His Colonel Landa was the second Nazi character I fell in love with after Ralph Fiennes's Amon Goeth. I kinda regret that it took me so long to watch it. Well, better late than never.<br/><br/>However, I couldn't feel the same about the movie. Yes, it's a good movie, but not a great one. My first, and prime, complain would be the content. It had smart and funny dialogs. But it's supposed to be about the Basterds! I meant, that is the title, right? ""Inglourious Basterds"". Yet, I didn't see much about them. I didn't feel much their influences to the movie as a whole and to other characters. I think it should be entitled ""Inglourious Basterds, Colonel Hans Landa, and Shosanna Dreyfus"", instead. Because that was what I found. As characters, Colonel Landa and Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) were in equal position as the Basterds in this movie. If only the Basterds appeared in the very first session rather than Colonel Landa, if only there was a direct encounter between them and Shosanna, if only there was more background about them, if only the movie showed more the effects of Basterds' actions to the Nazi, probably I could feel them more.<br/><br/>My second complain would be the pace. I usually enjoy fast-paced movie. Well, not this one. It was like I was offered with these delicious foods, but they were taken away from me immediately before I could even grab a bite. I didn't have the opportunity to gain some sort of emotion. Yes, I almost cried when Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet) had no choice but to hand Shosanna's family over to Landa. But that was it.<br/><br/>And there's so many things left unexplained. For example, how did Shosanna meet the ""uncle"" and ""aunt"" who later bequeathed her the cinema? In the end, I enjoyed it more for the acting performances. Especially, of course, Christoph Waltz. The other that caught my attention were Melanie Laurent, Diane Kruger, Denis Menochet, Daniel Brühl and Til Schweiger.<br/><br/>Despite all my complains, the movie is worth to watch. I would have regret it more if I didn't."

","What a film this is, ladies and gentlemen.. If you still haven't watched it and are browsing for reviews here on IMDb then you are wasting your time! Go watch it!!! I have been a Tarantino fan ever since I watched Pulp Fiction, but I am glad to say that in my opinion, Tarantino surpasses even that masterpiece with his latest effort. The script is terrific and original, the pacing is just right. Tarantino is an old school film maker. He doesn't use choppy editing in his films and allows the scenes and characters to flesh out. It is this trait of his that makes the film so effective. Watch out for the very first scene of the film and you will know what I am talking about. Its a joy to watch. This is the kind of film which you can watch more than once and find something new to admire each time. Tarantino outdoes himself in this film. The performances are all top-notch. Brad Pitt delivers one of his best performances as Aldo Raine. Eli Roth is great too. But it is Christopher Waltz who takes the cake with his eccentric portrayal of the ""Jew Hunter"". If you are still reading this, get your butts off those chairs and go watch the movie. The Best Film of The Year 2009!!!"
"WallyJT","9","0","6","9 March 2010"," Great, Fun Movie
","I went to see Inglorious Basterds with several friends, and I was the only one out of all of them who like this movie. Why? I had no idea. They all said they hated it. After another recent viewing of this movie, I think I know why they hated it. It was advertised as a balls-to-the-wall action-comedy flick, which it is not. It has moments of action and moments of comedy, sure, but that wasn't the main focus of the movie. It was more about character development and building tension, so I think my friends believe that they didn't get what they were hoping for, which is understandable. <br/><br/>The way I see it, it was a truly excellent movie, albeit with a couple small flaws. <br/><br/>Let's start with the flaws: A couple scenes drag on for a very long time. Like, really long. The payoff for these long sequences is always good, but not quite worth the wait it took to get there. It just feels like some things could've been left on the cutting board. This leads me to my next negative point, which is simply that the movie is too long. However, the movie is good enough that it won't bore you so that you're just checking your watch every few minutes waiting for it to end, but it still is a little overly long. I think 5-10 minutes probably could've been cut out. One more negative point is that the movie is sort of random. This isn't always a bad thing, but there are some things that are introduced and never brought back again. For example: the origin of one of the basterds is told in a short little scene with funk music and a voice narrating this characters background. This is a fun little scene, but nothing like that ever happens again for the rest of the movie. May I ask why?<br/><br/>Now on to the positive points: Every actor does a great job, but the crowning jewel that shines above them all is Christopher Waltz as Col. Hans Landa. This guy is incredible. It's hard for me to even describe how great this guy is. It's a funny, but also very intimidating character and Waltz pulls it off perfectly (he deserved his best supporting actor Oscar 100%).<br/><br/>Another great point is the story. A runaway Jew that has started a new life owning a cinema is chosen to host the premiere of Nation's Pride, a Nazi propaganda movie. The basterds also eventually get involved in this event, which is where the story of the cinema owner and the basterds finally connect. If I reveal more than that, I'll probably spoil it for you, but let me just say that the climax is simply awesome.<br/><br/>The way the story is laid out is great, too. The two stories (the cinema owner and the basterds) being in the same movie isn't as confusing as you may think, and the movie is great at building tension until you're sweating while you wait for something to happen (even upon repeated viewings). <br/><br/>Before I finish this review, I should tell you that the movie doesn't have everyone speaking English no matter where they're from, so be prepared for a lot of subtitles (and I mean A LOT). Just make sure you're up for a little reading.<br/><br/>All in all, this a great and thoroughly enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone, except the illiterate."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","0","6","9 March 2010"," Unusual and original, that's for sure!
","When I first heard about the original premise of ""Inglourious Basterds"", years ago, I got really psyched because to me it sounded like the absolute perfect movie. The way the eventual ended up was a bit different from its original first premise and the movie also certainly wasn't as great as anticipated but nevertheless it's a great original movie, that is mostly being perfectly watchable because of that.<br/><br/>Well yes, the movie is set in WW II but that by no means means that the movie is being a war-flick. Foremost it's being an action/drama but a very quirky one that is, with lots of humor in it. The movie is being really creative with its story and deliberately ignores history. It's a movie that deliberately pushes itself over-the-top at times, like Tarantino has done before with most of his recent movies, that are more homages to other genre movies than anything else really.<br/><br/>This movie can also be definitely seen as an homage to the adventurous WW II flicks, from mostly the '70's, that focus primarily on its entertainment, rather than its credibility and realism. But foremost I still see this movie more like an homage to the western. Lots of the shots within this movie fit within that genre and basically also the story could had easily been one that got set in the wild west.<br/><br/>I must say that out of all the Quentin Tarantino movies, this is the one with the best look over it. Tarantino movies normally really aren't the most expensive movies to make and this is easily the one with the highest budget. It definitely shows on the screen, with its more than convincing looking sets and a great overall visual stylish look. Robert Richardson's cinematography is great in this movie.<br/><br/>But if I have to name some of the down side of the movies, I don't need to dig hard for it. For me the entire quirkiness and fun and entertainment level could and should had been pushed a bit further. The ending made up a lot for this though. Also the overall storytelling was not something I was too pleased about. Instead of having a real main character, the movie decided to focus on several different plot-lines, with different characters involved. Because of this some of the movie its more interesting and great characters get pushed somewhat to the background. It's approach also certainly makes the movie overlong to watch but it seems that Tarantino just couldn't get enough of it himself and this was also more or less one of his dream projects, which he had worked on to get made for years.<br/><br/>As always is the case with a Tarantino movie, it's a very dialog-filled movie and even though the movie is lacking some of its great and powerful, tense, written monologues out of earlier Tarantino movies, it's all pretty good of course. The entire writing style makes the movie work out, even when basically everything in it is quite ridicules and far fetched. It also gives all of the actors plenty of room to do basically whatever they want. Brad Pitt is enjoyable and even Mike Myers really works out in it. People were worried when they heard that Tarantino wanted Ben Stiller to star in this but I could definitely had seen this happen in this movie. It's script is really suitable for this. But of course most praise goes to Christoph Waltz, who acts in basically four languages throughout the entire movie and is the constant great factor within the movie. <br/><br/>But also kudos to Tarantino's directing for this, since the movie features quite some French and German in it. It's pretty hard to direct a sequence and actors in a foreign and for you unknown language.<br/><br/>A movie that is mostly great to watch due to its originality but yes, it's far from Tarantino's best or most impressive or memorable movie.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"marcospaulomcc","10","0","6","8 March 2010"," Tarantino's masterpiece
","I know it sounds strange because there is Pulp Fiction in Tarantino's hands. But, IMO, Inglorious Basterds is better. It's definitely the most entertaining movie I've ever seen. And that it's what Tarantino always wants to bring us, entertainment. Watching Basterds, tension grows inside you scene after scene while you keep laughing hard at the dark comedy/clever jokes. That is just the perfect mix to prepare you for the ending. As it approaches, you keep thinking: ""Oh my God, I can't believe this is going to happen! We'll have problems counting the dead bodies, haha!"". Tarantino's mark. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) makes you laugh a lot. His accent is a little annoying at the beginning, but as you know him better, you realize that it fits just perfectly. Hans Landa (Cristoph Waltz), the villain, is unbelievable. When the movie ended I thought about 2 things: How that movie was perfect and that I just watched the man who was going to win Best Supporting Actor Oscar, and that really happened. This is a movie I'll watch thousands of times. And I recommend you to do so."
"gomezm3","10","0","6","5 March 2010"," Better than Pulp Fiction?
","Although Basterds is no Pulp Fiction, there is a total argument to be made for how this film is Tarantino's greatest, if not one of the greatest films to date.<br/><br/>First, remember that it is a fictional-history piece; Tarantino, while totally ridiculing historical figures (Goebbels), took a page out of the Nazi party in rewriting history. In Tarantino's case, however, history was rewritten to support the right side.<br/><br/>Secondly, this film acknowledges many issues that we have faced throughout the 21rst century (e.g. suicide bombings, torture, etc...). Did you notice that the Basterds, while torturing the Nazi's for intelligence (i.e. Guantanamo Bay), strapped bombs on themselves to blow up a movie theater full of Nazi's (i.e. Al Qaeda)? Think ""the bear Jew"" , ""Stiglitz"" and Aldo ""the apache"".<br/><br/>Lastly, this movie is a total homage to the films of old. Especially the very first scene with the dairy farmer. Although this scene is almost entirely felt through the dialogue, i dare any of you to find a scene of any recent movie whose suspense comes almost entirely from dialogue.<br/><br/>This film should be taken seriously for the 2010 Best Picture Oscar. I know that The Hurt Locker is also an amazing film, but Basterds is pound for pound an instant classic; top 15, maybe 10, of all time. My prediction: Basterds wins and Tarantino finally gets the Best Picture Oscar he deserves."
"atmcneil-1","9","0","6","5 March 2010"," Tarantino again.
","Quentin Tarantino has made some of the best movies of recent memory. Pulp Fiction and Reservior Dogs were instant classics. But his endeavor into the Kill Bill's was almost a career ender. I won't even talk about Death Proof. I'm just glad he is back in his true form: good characters, great dialog, unwinding plot.<br/><br/>Great characters. Brad Pitt shines out even with his terrible southern accent (Im sure Tarantino wanted it to be as ridiculous as possible). The two ladies are great in their equally cunning roles that has you wondering which side they're really on. The minor roles of the Basterds are all great, with props to the Bear Jew, who plays his strong/silent guy as one of the best I've ever seen. But the real stand out is the villain, the Nazi Colonel Hans Landa. An absolutely brilliantly developed character that Christoph Watlz nailed in his performance. He better win an Oscar, he's won every other award possible for a supporting role. <br/><br/>Dialogue. Any good Tarantino movie is about ninety percent dialog. Look at Pulp Fiction, the scenes everyone remembers are simply two or three people talking - not the violence and the gore, but the Royale with cheese, or Jule's Bible quote. This movie is no exception. My favorite scene had to be when Landa has Raine and his right hand guy at the table once captured. No torture, no shooting, not even a fist fight. They talk. And you have to love the childish happiness in Christoph Waltz's line ""That's a bingo!"" Even Brad Pitt's speech at the start of the movie to the Basterds is a mix of great writing: humor, revels the major plot, and opens the movie up to the viewers imagination as to exactly what he plans to do to Nazi soldiers. <br/><br/>The plot. Tarantino again uses his craft of winding several plots together to for one great story. There really are three major stories taking place: Aldo Raine and the Basterds, Shosanna's revenge, and the British plot to kill Hitler at the premier. These three twist and wind through each other in a fun, well paced style. You don't ever really learn all of the needed information up front, again a Tarantino classic trademark. He uses his time, his characters, and his dialog to pull you through in a very realistic style. The bar scene is what stands out, as you know through he whole thing, it will end terribly. There are a few points where you think the Basterds might get out okay, either way, Tarantino has you on the edge, waiting for the release of what happens for as long as you can stand it. The tension is amazing, even in a light atmosphere like a bar late at night. Beautiful writing and great acting. <br/><br/>Tarantino has made me a fan again, I even went and broke out my copy of Reservior Dogs on VHS again. I hope he sticks to movies like this, he has them mastered, and yet can make each one different in its own way. One of the best new minds in movies delivers one of his best inventions to date. I hope to see more from this extraordinary writer/director."

","Ah Inglorius bastards, combine the talents of great actors like Brad Pitt, Nazis, and a Quentin tarentino film and you great a great movie. Fun to watch, with excellent dark humor. Except for one thing, the movie itself sees what is possibly a post dramatic world played out. The end is what should be a triumphant hero and we get nothing more than a rich nazi with a get-out-of-jail card. The nazi symbol stitched on his head, anyone can fix that with a little plastic surgery although it was funny, some parts were a tad bit overly dramatic while reverting to the scenes that down played that dramaticism. All in all, it wasn't perfect. The scenes were frightfully funny except there was no way to tell it apart from any other generic tarentino film. It was, Nazis in the 80s, or a subtle way to tell you it was fake play, in a stylized traditional comic fashion. My harsh criticism kindly puts this movie as an almost flawless production with the exception of no real bad Nazis. Close but no cigar, and definitely not close enough; for instance Kill Bill v1 NO, Pulp fiction Yes...Django def That's right, another rehash. In the end though, this movie would fit perfectly in anyone's collection."

","What are all these hater comments about the Basterds. Those are probably the people who got offended by the movie, because the only way this movie would be rated one star is if we cut out the two hours of movie and leave only the 5 minutes of violence. I agree, mr.Pitt's performance is nothing to brag about but Tarantino's storytelling and Christoph Waltz's performance make up for it, and do even more then that.<br/><br/>This movie is not made to be historically accurate, this movie does what is suppose to do. So, stop reading reviews and watch the movie. I completely enjoyed the movie and I hope you will too."
"seaview1","8","0","5","5 March 2010"," Tarantino Reinvents War in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS
","Quentin Tarantino has been working on this World War II script for many years, and what is ostensibly a revenge film with moments of terrific dialogue and parallel subplots is a bit undone with untidy displays of violence and a fantasy denouement. Nevertheless, the play is the thing and few writer/directors could fashion such an entertaining if mean spirited film like Inglourious Basterds with bravura performances particularly by Christoph Waltz as a most charming and lethal Nazi.<br/><br/>Once upon a time during World War II a French man is questioned about the whereabouts of local French Jews by a polite German SS officer, Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) whose silky, sinister approach gets remarkable, deadly results from which one teenage French girl barely escapes.<br/><br/>Next we meet Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt giving a Chad Everett by way of Clark Gable impression) who has recruited Jewish soldiers to hunt down and terrorize the Nazis in an Apache Indian way. Any survivors do not escape unscathed but have a Swastika cross carved into their foreheads, their mark for life.<br/><br/>In 1944, a young French woman, Emmanuelle, owns a movie theater and is wooed by a German war hero, Fredrick, whose film, Nation's Pride, is premiering in Paris. Fredrick gets Joseph Goebbels, head of German Propaganda to move the premiere to Emmanuelle's smaller theater. She is in fact the young French girl (Shosanna) who escaped a massacre and is plotting to take revenge by killing all the Nazi attendees.<br/><br/>At the same time, British Lt. Archie Hicox is sent to meet a double agent in France and, with Raine's men, attend the Nation's Pride premiere to blowup the theater and kill high level Nazis including Hitler. Hicox meets the agent who is a famous German actress, Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger is glamorous) in a basement café. German soldiers and an SS officer complicate things, and a Mexican standoff ensues with explosive results. Having to alter plans, Raine substitutes himself and the surviving Basterds into the mission.<br/><br/>At the premiere, as head of security, Col. Landa discovers the Allied plot, and Raine is arrested and interrogated in another building. There, Landa makes a startling proposal even as Emmanuelle plots to ignite the film nitrate stored in her theater and the other 'basterds' in the audience execute their part of the plan. Seemingly spared the finale at the theater and having manipulated his own fate, Col. Landa and Lt. Raine have a day of reckoning.<br/><br/>The usual Tarantino touches are here including excruciating scenes with gunshots, scalpings, stabbings, and bat beatings. The film is structured in five chapters, and his love for movies is evident in references to German cinema icons, and, no doubt, major filmic influences from The Dirty Dozen (especially in the recruitment scene and the high octane finale), Where Eagles Dare, and any number of spaghetti westerns. Imaginative use is made of fluid camera movement and rapid edits.<br/><br/>While the cast is in fine form with Til Schweiger as a Charles Bronson-type, director Eli Roth as the Bear Jew, and Mélanie Laurent, radiant as the haunted Emmanuelle, the standout is Waltz. Pitt is a hoot as Raine (whose name is a play on actor Aldo Ray), and when he tries to spout Italian phrases, it is outrageous. Veteran Rod Taylor and comedian Mike Myers have fleeting cameos.<br/><br/>Some criticism of the film is warranted. Infamous figures get killed at the premiere; if you are going to rewrite history even in a fable, don't take something that is so ingrained as to make an utter mockery of it. Also, any sympathetic characters pretty much go out the window, so don't get too attached to anyone.<br/><br/>No Tarantino film would be complete without wonderfully written set pieces especially the one in the basement café that is very reminiscent of the final standoff in Reservoir Dogs. While his words are sublime and he is adept at setting up such scenes, he does not take full advantage of the possibilities of others which are given relatively short shrift like the arrest of Raine and the confrontation of Bridget by Col. Landa.<br/><br/>For fans of the talented director, this one is a must, but for the average moviegoer, the snappy screenplay may not be fully appreciated in the overall context of an entertaining story that drips a bit too much blood. Two things are for sure: A glass of milk will never seem the same again, and Brad Pitt looks fabulous in a white tuxedo."

","Wow. Look how far Quentin Tarantino has come. First, his brilliant crime caper Reservoir Dogs. Then, film classic Pulp Fiction, which won him an Oscar. Lastly, dialogue driven Jackie Brown and action homage Kill Bill Films. Now, his newest film Inglorious Basterds has dazzled us all and showed us Tarantino can never make a bad film (Four Rooms was only a segment, so it does not count). Tarantino's graphic,funny WWII masterpiece is both hilarious and outstanding because of it's ingenious screenplay, expert direction and excellent performances. Brad Pitt is hilarious as Lt. Aldo Raine, Eli Roth is smashing as The Bear Jew, Diane Kruger is equally good, but the star of the show is Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa. Suave and sophisticated, he is one of the best bad guys ever. Nominated for 8 academy awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay & Best Supporting Actor for Waltz. Oscars, don't you dare snub Tarantino now."
"EUyeshima","8","0","5","3 March 2010"," A Fantastical, Revisionist Look Back at World War II, Tarantino Style
","Polarizing filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's unadulterated love of cinema is really the most pervasive factor in his fantastical 2009 World War II adventure. Running an epic-length 153 minutes, it may appear on the surface like ""The Longest Day"", but the director/writer takes inspiration from Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, Robert Aldrich's ""The Dirty Dozen"", Hollywood wartime propaganda B-movies, and his own adrenaline-infused and blackly comic films (""Pulp Fiction"", ""Kill Bill"") to tell an audacious ""what-if?"" story about a group of guerrilla U.S. soldiers in Nazi-occupied France. The tightly wound plot revolves around three key figures: Colonel Hans Landa, an elegant, seemingly bloodless Nazi officer known as ""The Jew Hunter""; Lt. Aldo Raine, a Tennessee-born resistance fighter who has organized a special squad of Jewish-American soldiers whose goal is scalping and killing Nazis; and Emmanuelle Mimieux (née Shosanna Dreyfus), a pensive young Jewish woman who runs a movie theater in Paris.<br/><br/>As presented by Tarantino over the course of five discrete chapters, the three disparate figures converge upon Mimieux's theater for the premiere of a Nazi propaganda film called ""A Nation's Pride"". There in attendance is to be not only Third Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels but also the Fuehrer himself. Needless to say, the filmmaker has carefully set up all his chess pieces for a flamboyant finale that represents a manifestation of some kind of crude moral justice that revisionist history allows only grand storytellers like Tarantino. Riddled with quirky incongruities, some of which border a bit too closely to self-parody, his signature style is evident through a series of set pieces, most heavy on insinuating dialogue, that suddenly explode like the tavern mêlée in La Louisiane.<br/><br/>In a turnabout from his Oscar-baiting performance last year as the passive Benjamin Button, Brad Pitt brings cocksure arrogance to Raine in an enjoyably hammy turn. Mélanie Laurent perfectly captures Shosanna's simmering resentment until her cathartic release during the explosive conclusion, while Diane Kruger cuts a somewhat more predictable figure as a Dietrich-like femme fatale actress in cahoots with Raine's battalion. Tarantino fills smaller roles with oddball choices like Mike Myers as a pip-pip British general, Rod Taylor (""The Birds"") as Churchill, and ""Hostel"" director Eli Roth as a baseball bat-wielding Nazi killer. Regardless, the best work comes Christoph Waltz's nuanced turn as the sadistic Landa. It's a masterfully subtle performance amid a movie that is anything but subtle.<br/><br/>Waltz's best scene comes right at the beginning with his unbearably tense conversation with a stoic French farmer suspected of hiding a family of Jews. There is also glorious camera-work from veteran cinematographer Robert Richardson (""JFK""). The extras seem a bit too stretched out for the 2009 two-disc set, especially with no Tarantino commentary being offered in this package. Instead, on the first disc, we get two extended scenes and one alternate, the movie-within-the-movie ""A Nation's Pride"", and a few trailers. The second disc offers a half-hour round table discussion among Tarantino, Pitt, and film critic Elvis Mitchell; a faux-making-of featurette for ""A Nation's Pride""; a discussion of the original Italian movie, ""Inglorious Bastards"" (upon which this movie bears little similarity); and a few other more obscure extras. Love it or hate it, the film reflects the filmmaker's uniquely audacious style in his most serious effort to date."

I don't go out to the movies very often, i usually just opt to stay home and see the new films on DVD. if i even bother to check out the new movies at all. Tarantino usually gets me to the Theater. 'Basterds' and 'Grindhouse' were two of the few movies I went to the theaters to see in recent years.<br/><br/>I wasn't disappointed. Brad Pitt was great. he should have been nominated for an Oscar as far as i'm concerned. like all of Tarantino's recent films, this was stylish and lots of fun. sure it wasn't a serious classic like 'Reservoir Dogs' 'Pulp' or 'Jackie Brown', but it was really good Hollywood entertainment. the kind we've come to expect from QT.

","Inglourious Basterds is an absolutely outstanding new masterpiece of Quentin Tarantino. Although WW2 is a complete new direction for him, Tarantino manages to keep his unique style. Once again you have to laugh about things which are anything but funny, especially about the way Landa verbally tortures people such as Shoshanna or the Farmer at the beginning. The mostly very long dialogs are truly fantastic and because Christopher Waltz plays so well, you will admire the whole movie and discover an absolutely new kind of humor (especially if this is your first Tarantino Movie).<br/><br/>Due to its brutality (Hitler getting shot dozens of times i.e.) it's not made for everyone, but if you can somehow fight yourself to watch it, you will hopefully see and respect this valuable contribution to global culture!"

","Nein Nein Nein Nein! Not exactly the remake of the 70's Inglorious Bastards. I was glad as this movie did not end soon. Because I did not want it to end. Great character development, twisted plot and idea, brilliant film-making and applause-worthy performances. Surprisingly challenging role for Brad Pitt and he actually did well. (I was surprised to see Brad Pitt in a Quentin Tarantino movie trailer and again when his name appeared = opening credits). QT score! For pushing Brad Pitt's dialogue delivery and performance to the limits. Mein Fuhrer Adolf Hitler was shown (completely different) not in the many ways we've seen him before in previous movies that had him. QT score! Rest of the Basterds (cast) had an amazing 40's look and feel. QT score! I love war uniforms and fashionable 40's and 50's clothing. QT score! There are some movies that will teach and preach the greatness of FILM and help us understand that 'digital' can never beat FILM. This is one of those movies, with astounding cinematography and lighting. QT score! One of the directeurs who has great sense of music/musical knowledge is Quentin. QT score! I love fiction. And when you mix fiction and history, the outcome is sheer brilliance. I do have my opinions about how mein fuhrer was killed in this film (ahem) but the fiction in this film is one of the greatest stories ever told and told well. QT score!<br/><br/>Tsanksss to the Basterds in the crew, which made this a complete film. You don't have to be a Quentin Tarantino fan to watch this film. If you are, you will probably be thinking and talking about this movie for the rest of yer life (like many of us, his fans do).<br/><br/>Three best Basterds: Mike Myers. When I heard this man was going to be in the film, I was just jumping in excitement. Who wouldn't love the amazing mike myers... And yes, it truly was great to see him.<br/><br/>Eli Roth. The Bear Jew. The directeur of Hostel and Hostel II. He just proved in this movie that he was not just a namesake bad-ass.<br/><br/>Christoph Waltz. Oh where have you been you crazy basterd? His performance is so rich it will lead you to conclude that this man comes from 'plays' and 'theater'. When I tried to find more info about him, I was right. He was indeed from theater and what a performer!<br/><br/>Final words: Inglorious Basterds, is another brilliant treat from Quentin Tarantino along with an amazing crew and cast. Hollywood and English film-makers, we want to see more of Christoph Waltz!"

That's just not true. What Quentin was trying to show in this film is how twisted people could be in that blood-thristy era.

"omgfridge-670-64054","10","0","7","24 February 2010"," Scalpel?
","If you were one of many to get a glance at 'Inglourious Basterds' in its trailer form, then you would be under the impression that this movie is all about scalping some Nazis. True to the extent that there is scalping in this film but it's much more than that. Basterds is sliced up into five chapters each with its own purpose. This of course has been done by director/screenwriter - Quentin Tarantino. Even without reading that previous sentence, you could easily tell that this is Tarantino's work, as it has his finger prints all over it. No way is that a bad thing either, as Basterds has some truly jaw dropping, laugh out loud and cringe worthy moments that you won't soon forget.<br/><br/>In order for these scenes to shine, Tarantino has weaved his magic but he should be thankful for his cast. The main man on the cover was Brad Pitt as our knife wielding protagonist - Lt. Aldo Raine. Aldo was at the forefront of putting some serious gashes in the Nazi regime and Pitt couldn't have portrayed this character better, which shows him to be one of the more versatile actors out there. Completely out of left field, however, is the performance from the ""Jew Hunter"" himself, Christoph Waltz, who steals the entire show. It is no exaggeration that Waltz's performance will be talked about for some time to come as one of the best villains film has seen. <br/><br/>Over time, I believe this movie will only get better. Whether you want to poke around for flaws, It won't change that Basterds will be made example of for the right reasons. Especially since it has scenes such as the bilingual one seen in the first chapter that manages to set the tone for the whole movie. Chapter four may have dragged on, but due to some cutting-edge pacing, time becomes irrelevant as this film is on a whole other level when it comes to speed. If you were doubtful of 'Inglourious Basterds' being a worthy footnote in Tarantino's catalogue or a movie better suited for the chopping board, then I cannot stress enough that you should change your mindset. It is even more alarming then the amount of puns I have used in this review thus far. On the other side of the equation however, I'll be part of the crowd licking their lips in anticipation for Tarantino's next film. Or sharpening your machete if that's your prerogative."
"jzathajenious","8","0","4","20 February 2010"," The magnificent basterds
","QT is a unique director, and you just know that whatever subject matter or cinematic genre he tackles, it is going to be unique within that genre. This especially true of Inglourious Basterds. QT has crafted a wonderfully entertaining tale that doesn't seek to aim for historical accuracy, or even political correctness for that matter. But my lord is it gripping, entertaining, and plain fun. the characters do however display a mercilessness and ruthlessness; a real brutality that can be off putting, yet this is just a personal issue i had with the film.<br/><br/>The opening scene is a great example of the feeling, the atmosphere, and the suspense that will pervade the film for all of its 2 and a half hour running time (which incidentally, as the great films do, makes that time fly by). We meet a pivotal figure, Hans Landa, an SS super sleuth who is one of the most menacing, yet at the same time most cordial and charismatic interrogaters the screen has ever seen. his conversation with a french farmer who is hiding a Jewish family under his house, is amazing. the two men exchange pleasantries and meaningless banalities, all the while both know exactly what the other is thinking. you can see LaPadite thinking frantically, how firstly he can hide the jews, and also how he can protect his family. when it become apparent that Landa already knows every detail of his hiding, he wilts and gives up the jews in exchange for his families safety. One family member does escape however, the beautiful Shosanna, played by Melanie Laurent, who will get her revenge ultimately, but at a high price.<br/><br/>You could talk for hours about the first scene in the movie, such is the mastery with which its handle by QT, and such is the movie as a whole, with many memorable, and especially suspenseful scenes that would be the envy of Hitchcock. The bar scene in which Bridget von Hammersmark (played by the gorgeous Dianne Kruger) and a few nazi double agents are under suspicion by a shrewd gestapo officer is another incredibly well crafted, suspenseful scene. Once again, as he has made his trademark throughout his career, Tarantino provides great dialogue with which to ramp up the tension little by little until it reaches a boiling point. Scene by scene, the care and craft that have gone into the movie's structure elevate it above the dreck that pervades contemporary American cinema.<br/><br/>A small element within the film that made me uncomfortable was the ruthlessness and cruelty of the films characters, especially the Basterds. they're supposed to be the heroes of the film, yet they cruelly kill and maim their nazi foes, and show no honour nor any mercy. Eli Roth has a few brief scenes, and true to form, all his scenes revolve around gratuitous violence, whether it be bashing a nazi soldiers head in with a baseball bat, or mowing down a room full of nazi moviegoers in machine gun fire. Not to mention the role of aldo rayne was so completely overacted by Brad Pitt, his portrayal of Rayne showed the character as a slightly retarded, bloodthirsty redneck, with one of the worst southern accents I've had the displeasure of hearing. and also the backstory of Stiglitz wasn't adequately explained - a nazi officer who for some reason decided to go a homicidal rampage and start killing every gestapo officer he could find? no explanation was given for his motive and i found this really bugged me. and the other 5 or so basterds were given no story nor any screen time, so they were essentially props. So in short, as you can see, the basterds were the weak link of the movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>But overall, this is but a small part of an otherwise excellent production. The exquisite acting of Kruger, Laurent, Waltz, Bruhl, and most of the European cast was a joy to behold, and i was once again enamored with Tarantino's unique directorial vision. Huge recommendation from me, QT has done it again."
"Sanou_san","10","0","7","21 February 2010"," A war movie? More of a carefully schematic film with sharp plot
","I'm led to believe that this has to be one of the finest articulations Quentin Tarantino dealt with every movie he made. I was surprised he had its story completed for almost a decade. Putting that aside it was more astonishing he had Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill vol. one and two, a collaboration with Robert Rodriguez for a fairly impressive Grindhouse performance, all in process while having this secretly furnished. Well it pays well, because he had the movie an utter success. Others may tell it isn't, but why bother messing with them anyway? The film likewise I've always felt with Quentin's atmospheric trademark always contain something erringly new. The path of the story proves this, but the tone of Quentin's quality is always there. You get into the tension, the excitement and chilling exposition. That I always had the fun for Tarantino's films, and Inglourious Basterds is a living proof for that. To start, the selection of the characters was marvelous. Some I knew (Brad Pitt of course, Daniel Buhrl, Diane Kruger and Eli Roth) while others the first time I saw (such as Melanie Laurent, surprisingly Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender who were all brilliant). There were more characters in the film whom I first saw and were entertainingly surprising for their performances. This lead me to Christoph Waltz whose character was so fascinating that you wouldn't wonder if he's acting which fine spaces of black and white. His character, though antagonistic in first impression was interestingly residing in gray area waiting to unfold his real motifs. No surprise he had an Oscar for a nomination, and it is yet to be revealed. This I was always amazed by how cunningly Tarantino embedded in his articulate scripts. It appears however that some viewers see Quentin's long, expressive script as tedious and arduous, fit for some of its part to be labeled as ""unnecessary"" and have it removed. One of my friends commented that the film was disgustingly good and detailed but he was bored by the long lines of dialogues. Well I assumed he wasn't the type of a typical movie commenter who sees the value of the story rather than the value of the movie to become mistakenly popular. Objectively, his long script is meant to build the air of the setting, the mood of the particular part of the film. And I believe he was always doing well on this. Inglourious Basterds is another living proof for this. Remarkably other characters that are unpopular or seemingly greenhorn for the role were also reasonably impressive. Take for example the role of Melanie Laurent, Michael Fassbender, August Deihl, Denis Menochet and rarely is Daniel Buhrl. They were convincingly successful in pulling of their role and managed to bring the air of thrill and excitement on screen. Melanie Laurent possessed the shaking fear of a hunted Jew and managed at the same time to entrench her vengeance after them. Michael Fassbender was eloquently entertaining for his role, but sadly I admit he got killed instantly in the film and I wish to see more of him. August Deihl's character as Major Hellstrom was also captivating. I even got to hate his character. A piece of Nazi officer who's rudeness backed by his fidelity of his country's goal had made well his character ""hateable"". Denis Menochet in the beginning also did well, it is implied or left to the viewers what fate awaits him and his family in the film after Colonel Hans Landa (Waltz) did his job there. And it was a long time since I saw Daniel Buhrl's short appearance in Bourne Ultimatum. But I was impressed by his character in a drama, thriller movie in 2006 entitle ""Cargo"". Almost every part of it was good. And I would definitely sit once more in my coarse couch to watch it once more (like I always did with a lot of Tarantino's film). If one put this film as a war movie I would prefer it as sharp, scheming well planted piece of success Quentin had effectively"

","First of all, this movie is fictional. Don't expect to learn much about WW2 from this film and don't take it too seriously.<br/><br/>Second of all, you probably have heard a lot about the character Colonel Hans Landa aka The Jew Hunter. Christoph Waltz, who plays Landa, puts in a captivating performance. Waltz stays away from playing the maniacal sort, not interested in the purity or extinction of any race, not the evil puppet of a psychotic, preaching fuhrer. Landa is apathetic. He is cunning. You could say he is a narcissist. He is tasked to get rid of the Jews in France and the manner in which he goes about approaching his mission is amazing and frightening.<br/><br/>This man doesn't scream his head off. He doesn't storm into rooms with his soldiers gunning everyone down. He'll befriend you, break you down mentally and get you to expose the people you thought you could help.<br/><br/>It's important to remember that Hans Landa isn't evil, he just doesn't care about the situation. He does what he's tasked to do because he's good at doing it. And if there is a better opportunity elsewhere, he'll jump ship.<br/><br/>Third of all, this is not an all out action movie. It's a movie with a good balance of everything.<br/><br/>And finally, the movie is not all in English. It's mostly in German or French.<br/><br/>Having said all that, the movie itself is great. The acting is superb and the cast choices doesn't disappoint. The art direction and lighting in key scenes really add to the mood of the film. The choice of music for the film is also interesting.<br/><br/>What makes Inglorious Basterds such a good movie is the dialog. The dialog itself adds to the mood of the film, depending on the scene and brings depth to the various characters. Landa's dialog in the opening scene is an indication of his manipulative nature. There is a scene where a bunch of officers are drinking and playing a card game where they figure out what famous person they are. Tarantino puts his interpretation of King Kong as part of the dialog but the manner in which it is played out, in context with the scene, is just brilliant and a clever way of getting to the outcome of the scene.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds is good cinema. It's a must watch for people who enjoy character movies."
"wakemeup36","7","0","4","20 February 2010"," Nicely executed
","So yes, this movie isn't historically accurate at all, and although it would've been probably better if it was, it still comes off pretty good.<br/><br/>The story is basically 'if American Jews knew what was going on in and around Nazi Germany at the time and gathered a group of people to eliminate as much Nazis as possible'. It's not so much the story that's good about this film. It's the actual content that really won me over. Or to be more precise, how the scenes are executed. There is a lot of dialogue accompanied with small, sudden bursts of action. The fact that these action sequences, no matter how small, occur so abruptly and unexpectedly, makes the sequences much more intense and interesting that any shoot-em-up could hope to make.<br/><br/>Another great thing about this movie is that we actually feel for the characters. And not just one side either, we feel for both the Jews and the Nazis, so it's not biased either. I don't know if it was the director's intention to make us feel sorry for some of the Nazi soldiers but I sure as hell did. For example, there is scene where a Nazi soldier is brutally murdered with a club because he refused to give up the location of his fellow soldiers. He believe he died for his country doing the right thing. Another scene was where a Nazi soldier, who had just become a father, was shot multiple times by an enemy who he completely trusted for the time being. Betrayal, murder, vengeance are all part of the movie theme and I think it's a great portrayal of how much of a disgusting creature a human can be.<br/><br/>I would've preferred it if this story could've been somehow fit into history as that would make it much more effective as a film. But for now, this is just an alternate reality film and nothing more. Plus, the ending was somewhat ridiculous and kind of ruined the genius of the whole thing. Aldo's 'masterpiece' was pretty dumb, to be honest. Anyways, this really is a good and enjoyable film and I'd recommend it to anyone who's not frightened by sudden, intense moments."

I'm not enough of a cinema bug to know the actor who plays col landa but my god he just has to win the academy award for best supporting. He just captivates his scenes without veering too much from the role. It's a role that will remind you of some great Hitchcock characters. one could argue there is too much gratuitous violence, but fans of Tarantino know this and take it in stride, sometimes averting their eyes for a moment or two. in the end it's worth a certain bit of squeamishness for the masterpiece that he crafts out of whole cloth. everything works here and let's be honest never has a subject matter been more plumbed than this, but this fantastical tale is a whole new way to view history with the freedom of revisionism under the cover of camp."

","Well, this movie literally is blowing my mind. I spent two sleepless nights about it. It opens with the most heartbreaking and captivating scene I've ever witnessed in my life and throws me right back to being 13 and reading Anne Frank's diary. Maybe I'm being oversensitive: neither could I reread Anne Frank, nor will I dare to watch this scene a second time - not in a long time at least. But luckily, Shosanna Dreyfus, a 19-year-old French Jew, survives this scene. In the next scene we're introduced to Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), a Tennessee man who claims to have some Apache blood in him, and his men. Brad Pitt delivers the most hilarious performance of his career. His relaxed Tennessee drawl brings on such a contrast to the hysteria of World War II, it knocks me off my feet. Raine's mission isn't funny though: He wants to kill Nazis, and he wants to put fear into them. And the means he and his men use may appear brutal to those who are in denial of what happened at Auschwitz and in the factories of Alfred Krupp simultaneously, but what the heck: This is World War II, who would expect a non-violent movie? One of the most hilarious scenes of the whole movie comes next. Aldo Raine's methods DO work, Hitler believes one of Raine's men might be the Golem. Now what a beautiful reference that is! And to a modern audience that doesn't know about the Golem, he brings on a reference to Lord Voldemort at the same time. That's enough for the spoilers: This movie is worth watching several times, for there are plenty of references, great dialogues and complex characters. The fact that it has been partially shot at the same place where Joseph Goebbels' movies were filmed, that also knocks me off my feet. Go watch it!

","It's kinda hard to describe Inglourious Basterds if you don't understand what makes a Quentin Tarantino movie because that's essentially what it is. It looks like a war movie, or a Brad Pitt vehicle, but after watching it, you know it doesn't fit into either mold. <br/><br/>Tarantino is... irreverent yet worshipful. His movies tribute the most obscure of classics, or ""classics,"" but with his own unique spin. There is a lot of violence but those scenes don't have the gratuitous feel like they're there to provide cheap thrills. Rather, they're always creative and often with a good suspenseful build-up and infused with his twisted and wicked sense of humor, and all quite exhilarating to watch. <br/><br/>Basterds was mesmerizing in just about every way. Set in WWII, it plays like a WWII action drama, though the story is offbeat enough for you to soon realize that it's not. It's a fascinating tale that's brought to life by diverse talented actors from the US and EU and filmed in gorgeous locations around Germany and France. And though I was captivated by the movie enough to not have spent any time wondering about how it would end, it was still a doozy of an ending (that pretty much confirms that it's not historically accurate). <br/><br/>PS I wish the deleted scenes featuring Maggie Cheung would surface!"
"dromasca","8","0","4","16 February 2010"," don't be mistaken, it's just a Tarantino film
","I think that it is a mistake to judge a film as what it is not.'Inglorious Basterds' is not (just) a war film. It is not a historical film. It is not a film about the Holocaust either. It is a film by Quentin Tarantino. A genre by itself.<br/><br/>Tarantino makes entertainment using as starting point different subjects, and develops them his way. One can of course ask whether world war II and the Holocaust can or should be dealt with by films in any genre. I believe that the answer is yes and that this answer was given already many decades ago. The French made I think some of the first comedies about the war (Babette s'en va-t-en guerre with Brigitte Bardot was made in 1960), and later in the past century the Holocaust started to be dealt in various registers, including the comic one, the best example being of course the fabulous 'La vita e bella' by Roberto Begnini.<br/><br/>I liked this 'Tarantino goes to war' exercise although I do not think it is his best film. Relative to the the 'Kill Bill' two volumes 'Inglorious Basterds' seems a little bit too simple and too direct. Yet it figures a triangle of characters that are all acted wonderfully - Brad Pitt as the commander of the Jewish avengers squad is almost hard to recognize in voice and appearance, Christoph Waltz is one of the best villains seen on screen in recent times, and Melanie Laurent provides an exotic mix of revenge, ingenuity and femme fatale. The other point of attraction is the use o a cinema hall as the set for an alternate end to the world war - here Tarantino is at his best and the result is unforgettable. This is enough stuff to make of 'Inglorious Basterds' one of the contenders to the Best Film Oscar race especially now that the number of finalists in the category was raised to nine.It will not get the trophy, but it will give a good fight."
"goodfellas-foggetaboutit","9","0","5","16 February 2010"," Step back! We have a winner!!
","Vengeance. Drama. Retribution. Comedy. Fantasy. Tarantino's latest flick effortlessly wraps its arms around all of these themes and what emerges from this rich melange is a movie whose audacity has been surpassed by none in the recent past.<br/><br/>A group of Jewish-American soldiers, referred to as the ""basterds"" (yes, with an ""e"", because that's the way you would pronounce it - QT), takes the battle to the Nazis. They live in enemy territory, ambush German patrols, and ""take no prisoners"". Led by Lt. Aldo ""the apache"" Raine (Brad Pitt), the team boasts of formidable Nazi-killers such as Sgt. Donny ""the bear Jew"" Donowitz (Eli Roth) and Sgt. Hugo ""killed 13 Gestapo officers"" Stiglitz (Til Schweiger). Parallel to this runs the story of Shosanna (Melanie Laurent), a Jew girl living under an assumed name in Paris who owns a cinema. Her parents were killed on the orders of SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). Driven by a desire to avenge her parents' death, she finds the perfect opportunity when the top brass of the Nazis (Goebbles, Goring, Bormann and Der Fuhrer himself) decides to attend a film premiere at her cinema. The Basterds are also not too eager to let this one go by. And the rest...is NOT history! <br/><br/>The acting is brilliant. QT casts a virtually unknown Christoph Waltz as Col. Landa and what do we get? One of the best portrayals of a Nazi official ever, right up there with Ralph Fiennes' Amon Goeth in ""Schindler's List"". The often-smiling, mannered, gentle SS Colonel turns menacing in a second, his eyes change colour, his face devoid of expression. ""Au revoir, Shosanna"" he shouts, as she, soaked in the blood of her own parents, runs frantically away into the fields. Chilling. Melanie Laurent plays Shosanna as she should have been – reserved, often melancholy but exuding an inner determination. Her deliberate underacting in some scenes is beautiful to watch. Brad Pitt with his heavily-accented dialogue and quirky humour provides good support.<br/><br/>And then there is Tarantino himself. It's his film. You can feel his presence in every scene, in every dialogue, in every little thing. From the numerous nods to spaghetti westerns, B-movie stars, pop culture and stylized violence to the use of freeze frames, pointers-on-screen, third-person-narration and startling editing choices – it's Tarantino all the way. Yes, he is self-referential. He is self-indulgent. So what? Hell, he's earned it. The greatest hallmark of this film is that Tarantino maintains the balance between all these aspects perfectly. Nothing here is in excess.<br/><br/>The movie is essentially an account of using violence as a solution to every problem, a fantastical account no doubt. On second thoughts, it's also about venting repressed wishes of giving Nazi leaders what they deserved. It's a bold movie. It will create controversies. But in the process, Tarantino brings out our deepest, darkest wishes, whose existence we have never acknowledged, even to ourselves. As for me, I'll walk a thousand miles to see once again what happened to all those present inside the cinema at the end. Thank you, Quentin.<br/><br/>At the beginning of this review I said that this film evolves out of a melange of cinematic themes. Let me correct myself. It evolves out of Tarantino's heart, out of his vision of cinema and is laced with his love and obsession with the art form."

","Tarantino is a genius. I think one can assume that beyond a shadow of doubt. For it is only a man like him who can make an English movie which is in French, German and Italian for more than half of its running time. One who can discover a Christopher Waltz and draw him out to flesh out a gruesomely suave character like Colonel Hans Landa with Oscar winning aplomb. One who has the audacity, as on previous occasions, to take a leading actor, in this case Brad Pitt, and effectively transforming him into the caricature of the redneck farm boy leader of the Basterds, Aldo Raine. This film is a welcome return to his signature style of pathos fueled humour. The ironic deprecatory dialogue and the casual use of gore and expletives wouldn't fail to bring a smile to even the most prudish ones. Replete with references and homages to his many influences, and cameos by veteran ""Tarantino men"", the film also offers sufficient trivia for the obsessive ones amongst us, who revel in these small joys. The use of the soundtrack to reflect the mood of a scene and alter our visual perception of its import is another classic Tarantino strategy which is employed effectively yet again. Right from the opening strains of Fur Elise with the flamenco guitar, to Ennio Morricone's mid western style shootout theme employed during the ambush of a German platoon, or David Bowie's Cat People when Shoshanna gets 'dressed to kill', the music plays the role of romanticizing the scenes and adding texture and depth to it. The trademark long panning camera shot is well used on a few occasions and the editing makes sure that you are gripped despite the length. Hence technically one could certainly not fault this movie in any way. The acting is in most cases adequate, but never takes precedence over the film. The obvious stand out of course is Christoph Waltz, whom we hope to be seeing a lot more of. Why is it then that I have given it a rating of 8 and not more? Well the answer to that lies in my repeated use in this article of signature, trademark and classic. This is evidently attributable to directorial style and method, however therein lies the pickle. This is very much a 'Tarantino comfort zone' movie that has merely undergone a frame-shift mutation and is thus the only reason it will not become as much of a cult classic as say, Pulp Fiction. Regardless, I'm personally a fan of his style and he yet again pulls off what he's a master at, making movies which ooze a sense of cool."
"philip-priestley","9","0","5","8 February 2010"," Cracking - but more than just a guns blazing shoot 'em up
","First of all this really is a cracking action film. It operates brilliantly on the superficial level of just being a war romp and a heist movie. In invokes all the great stuff we enjoy in classics like 'The Dirty Dozen' and 'The Guns of Navarone'. You can enjoy it like that, but, like most of the great Tarantino films, it also runs on a deeper level, and it can provoke you to think a bit more too.<br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the way that it gloried in the horror of war, but also managed to be horrified and disgusted with it at the same time. This is a really fine line, but it is genuinely played out in a subtle and at times very amusing way.<br/><br/>The 'Goodies' and the 'Baddies' theme is subverted beautifully - the Jew hunting Nazis, and the Nazi hunting Jews being a perfectly balanced equation - each as spiteful, vicious and psychopathic as each other. More importantly - they are presented as being equally deranged, and evil. The morality in the film is just passive - it's just an amoral experience that you bear witness to. The scene in the German beer cellar is fantastic - with the Basterds dressed in Nazi uniform the lines are watered down even more. The only 'goodies' in that cellar are the poor unfortunate German foot soldiers celebrating the birth of a new life. So ironic - but brilliantly crafted.<br/><br/>The film within a film motif is also excellently done. Within the film is the premier of the Nazi propaganda movie, which is a parody of the genre 'Inglourious Basterds' is operating within. It provokes you to think about what you're watching. As the Nazi's watch and cheer their propaganda - the most evil audience conceivable - we sit and cheer our own film... where is the good and evil in this movie?<br/><br/>Honestly - this is superb. I genuinely think it asks questions of the genre and moves in forward in a slightly satirical and highly enjoyable way. <br/><br/>A must see film."

"phd_travel","9","0","5","7 February 2010"," Thoroughly entertaining and funny
","This is the most enjoyable and original of Quentin's movies to date and a pretty good war movie even if it is an all out fantasy.<br/><br/>I have not always been a Quentin fan. Too much violence and too many unpleasant images. But here everything comes together in perfect proportions. There are moments of great hilarity especially between the French cinema owner played by Melanie Laurent and the German Officer who is attracted to her. The scene in the tavern is both tense and darkly funny at the same time too. The inventiveness of these scenes alone deserves an Oscar for best screenplay. There are some moments of unexpected humor like when Christoph Waltz is negotiating at the end. And the over the top violence is appropriate to the story for a change, especially the feel good ending.<br/><br/>The casting - especially the European cast is excellent and their acting spot on. Melanie Laurent is fascinating. Diane Kruger is totally perfect. Bruhl and Fassbender are well cast too. Christoph Waltz is memorable and deserves all his awards. With this cast you don't depend on Brad Pitt who often can be too obvious and self conscious with his exaggerated expressions. The only thing is you wish more of them had lived at the end.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing more than once."
"bob-fritz","9","0","5","5 February 2010"," A glorious comic book for grown-ups
","Quentin Tarantino continues to assert his unique niche among filmmakers with ""Inglourious Basterds."" <br/><br/>What makes Tarantino's films work is that he's able to take elements from his favorite genres--some of which are not well respected in film circles--and turn them into something entirely his own. So it is with his WWII saga, ""Inglourious Basterds."" The tale of good ol' boy Brad Pitt and his all-Jewish Army unit whose sole goal is to ""kill Nazis"" draws obvious comparisons to films like ""The Dirty Dozen,"" but Tarantino's inspiration comes more from spaghetti Westerns--from the music down to the camera angles (an early shot of Christoph Waltz with his gun pointed at the camera echoes Henry Fonda in ""Once Upon a Time in the West""). <br/><br/>The clever dialog that made ""Pulp Fiction"" and the ""Kill Bill"" saga so enjoyable is well on display here. So is the blood 'n gore for which Tarantino's name is almost a synonym (although the film is less bloody than ""Kill Bill Volume 1""). At the same time, Tarantino shows the ability to thrill and chill without any blood. The banging of a baseball bat in the distance comes across as more chilling that an on-camera beating with the same bat. Contrary to what his critics may say, Tarantino is far more than a one-note goremeister. <br/><br/>As I write this, Waltz is the favorite to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, and I can see why. His ""Jew Hunter"" is not the stereotypical Nazi officer who shouts things like ""Schweinhund!"" He comes across as a gentleman as he subtly makes his evil intentions known, as in Chapter One of the tale. As the story develops, he becomes even more complex--the movie's most interesting character. <br/><br/>My only issue with this film is that the Basterds themselves could have been fleshed out more. I would have liked a bit more about their backgrounds and motives. Even though the film is named for the Basterds, the most developed characters are outside that group. <br/><br/>With ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Tarantino has created yet another big, bad, bloody, and, yes, glorious comic book for grown-ups."
"Flowbeer","9","0","5","5 February 2010"," Tarantino branches out to unchartered territory and makes another masterpiece!
","I was totally engrossed while watching this film and was amazed at the dialog, which was so different than his earlier works. It was a total departure from anything else he has ever done. It's part homage to the 'Naziploitation' films of the 70's, but it also has a sense of realism (like it's a true story) that makes it even more intense. The characters are complete and well thought out. The dialog seems natural, the German language scenes were perfectly done, as if he had real Germans (and history professors) helping him with the script/screenplay. He either studied a lot of German film or a lot of German history, because he really had a feel for it, just as he showed us he had a feel for 'Asian' culture and the kung fu movies of the 70's in Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2. I can't say enough good things about this film.<br/><br/>The bar scene was frickin' intense, but so was the opening scene, where the German officer (Christoph Waltz) comes to talk to (Liev Schrieber?) and asks if he is hiding any ""Jews""...it's such a long scene, but I like how all the small talk and pleasantries turn to seriousness in the blink of an instant. That guy was perfect for that part. So was the guy playing Stiglitz. And even Brad Pitt was damn good yet funny in his part, with that cheesy, Southern drawl. And Mike Myers (yes, 'Austin Powers'!) plays a great British intel officer in his cameo.<br/><br/>One person here says Kill Bill is his 'masterpiece'. Maybe it's another one of his masterpieces? Maybe he has yet another one in him to do before he dies? <br/><br/>I really liked this film.<br/><br/>9/10"
"steinhi","10","0","5","4 February 2010"," Quentin did it again
","Because I was kind of upset about all the bad reviews about the Basterds I decided to write my first Review on IMDb.<br/><br/>First of all I want to state that this film definitely deserves its place on the list of the best 250 movies of all time and in my opinion place 70 is kind of an understatement for such a masterpiece.<br/><br/>For me this was the best film of 2009 and it was also one of the best in the last decade. The story of the film can't be more satisfying because it is a great satire of the second World War. It never wants to be faithful to any of the events that occurred in that time.<br/><br/>The most outstanding parts in this film are the awesome written dialogs that are performed by outstanding actors, such as Christoph Waltz, who delivered the best performance of an actor, that I've ever seen in any movie. But also some of the others deliver a very good performance because they match their roles.<br/><br/>The very best about all of it is the Screenplay by Quentin Tarantino in which he applies different languages very well and with that the film gets another dimension because it shows, that it is possible to do great dialogs and even a whole film with loads of subtitles which aren't annoying at any time.<br/><br/>Overall I have to say that I don't get how you can possible give this film 1 out of 10 stars because I think it is obvious that the screenplay and part of the acting are deserving better and are way better than some other films that might get a 1 star review.<br/><br/>This is definitely the best Tarantino film besides Pulp Fiction and I think that I can say without hesitation: This might not be a masterpiece it is!

","From start to finish ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a triumph. <br/><br/>To me the purpose of the opening credits is to set the tone for what is to come and is supposed to encompass the mood and feeling of the entire film. And its cool to think that The Green Leaves of Summer does so. And the same with Rabbie y Tarantella by Ennio Morricone in the closing credits. It is truly remarkable that the opening and closing credits do nothing but make the experience more absorbing. This might sound silly to some but the beginning and ending credits are masterpieces in themselves.<br/><br/>There is so much in this film to talk about. I have already written a paragraph praising the opening and closing credits, and i haven't even touched the story yet.<br/><br/>The Films Key Points<br/><br/>Chapter 1-Once upon a time in nazi occupied France- The opening scene will be remembered as one of Tarantino's best scenes. Some may say that it is too talkative and boring but whoever says that doesn't appreciate cinema. The dialogue here is something to behold. Interrogative dialogue between two people has always been Tarantinos forte. There are factors that make this scene 1) The situation and time period. It is WW2 and we know why Hans Landa is there at the farm. Hans suspects the farmer, Perrier Lapadite, of hiding Jews. 2) The mood and tone. The music playing during the arrival of Hans Landa, The Verdict by Ennio Morricone, makes the scene and situation feel like a Spaghetti Western. 3) The dialogue. The dialogue does nothing but build suspense. 4)Christoph Waltz and Denis Menochet. They both show their acting abilities in this scene. Christoph handles Tarantinos dialogue brilliantly. He's up there with Samuel L. Jackson. And notice how Denis barely has any dialogue. He just replies in Yes Or No most the time. 5)The camera movement. Most of the scene the camera stays still. But when the camera does move it is virtuoso film making. Honestly."

","Usually movies that have plot holes that are integral to the whole main part of the movie automatically turn into FAIL for me since I am not usually willing to overlook the slight and just take the film at face value minus common sense. However, Inglorious Bastards was so enjoyable that I am willing to overlook the huge honking ridiculous plot hole of Shoshana running from the fields barefoot with nothing and magically coming to own a movie theater complete with an alias supported by forged documents, a movie theater that the movie needed her to own for the movie to work. I kept waiting and waiting for this to be explained. How exactly did she get those documents? How did she get the theater and have it in such a way that no one suspected her of anything? It's like the plot was decided and how and why was sort of just thrown by the wayside b/c it doesn't matter. Well, it does matter.<br/><br/>Spoiler - <br/><br/>Something that really confused me and perhaps it was just another plot hole was the end massacre at the theater. Shoshana and Marcel's plan was to lock the people in the theater and set it a blaze and torch them all. Fine. The Bastards plan was to blow the place up with TNT. Fine. Everything worked out in the end with the combination of both BUT if Shoshana/Marcel didn't have their plan, how exactly did the Bastards plan on killing them all, especially the heavy hitters when they essentially opened fire on the people a few minutes before the actual TNT went off? Wouldn't many people have been able to escape since the Bastards didn't plan on locking any of the exit doors? That just bothered me a little. Again, everything worked out b/c of both simultaneous plans but the 2 didn't know about each other."

","Now, I am a Tarantino fan. But no matter what you think of his films there is no denying the man is a cinematic genius. This is one of the best films I have seen in a decade and may be Tarantino's finest work.<br/><br/>Inglorious basterds has that awkward intensity that is the hallmark of any Tarantino flick. Forget the violence (which perhaps isn't for the squirmish) What you will remember from this film is the awkward silences, those moments when Tarantino has run a dialogue scene so perfectly to its climax, that whatever happens next is purely secondary.<br/><br/>The film is a fictitious story about World War 2, and 8 Jewish American soldiers (the Basterds) leading an Apache resistance against the Germans. Now, the plot itself, whilst satisfactory is not the highlight. In fact, the Basterds themselves are not even the highlight. Surely the highlight of this film is cunning SS Colonel Hans Landa, the feared Jew Hunter of the Nazi Party played by Christoph Waltz. Tarantino has create immortal characters before but this is surely his finest yet. Like all killers that fascinate us, Landa is as charming as he is deadly. He chooses whether you live or die.<br/><br/>Then there is the beautiful Melanie Laurent as Shoshanna, the film central protaginist, a a Jewish girl living in disguise as a theatre owner in Nazi occupied France. When it comes to be that the Nazi war hero Frederick Zoller falls for the lovely Shoshanna, the latest propaganda film starring Zoller is to premiere at her cinema, the stage is set for a final battle between the Basterds and the Nazis.<br/><br/>As I've said the Basterds are only a player in this film. Pitt is amsuing as the conspicuous leader Lt Aldo Raine. The rest of the Basterds are mostly background. They drive the plot are not entirely the focus.<br/><br/>Diane Kruger is also excellent in her role as the closet Allied German film star. The two final chapters in this film are magic. The bar scene will used as platform for young filmmakers for years to come. The violence is graphic but not unnecessary. The dialogue in this film (predominatly in German and French) is sharp, witty and engaing. The characters are brilliant. A special mention to German actor August Diehl as the suspicious Gestapo Major, who, next to Landa, delivering a menacing cameo performance that gets better with repeat viewing.<br/><br/>The three house flew by in my opinion. Some may say it dragged on, but with characters this good, it could've gone on for longer and I've wouldn't have minded.<br/><br/>A gem."

Before seeing this ""Pulp Fiction"" was his untoppible Magnus Opus. But with ""Inglourious Basterds"" he managed to strip away everything that makes him the director he is. That's right, Tarantino cut back the dialog that is relate-able and everybody can quote a million times over. There are no more Khuna Burger or Jack Rabbit Slim references.<br/><br/>As soon as that had entered my mind, I was somewhat worried. After all, how do you know a Tarantino film without the rapier fast wit dialog? But it is without all of those things that the audience can fully sink into the film and be moved. One of the first characters we meet is the despicable Col. Has Landa, giving us the things we have come to expect from film Nazis: fear, anger, hatred and least of all pity. We don't feel pity for him, but for those in his way.<br/><br/>And then we meet the heroes, or well the Bastards.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt wears his character like a second skin. Never mind the fact that he is a big star, he is given the chance to prove WHY he is.<br/><br/>This review would not be complete with out mentioning the wonderful performance of Shoshanna.

Many will criticize this movie, citing its historical inaccuracy, intense violence and peculiar staging. But I felt they all came together perfectly. The viewer is constantly forced to readjust, like an over-matched defender in a football game. Christoph Waltz is outstanding in a juicy role that should earn him an Oscar. Waltz's turn as a courteous and urbane Nazi who conducts his Jew-killing duties with relish is a hoot. And as if viewers weren't satisfied enough with the journey, we are treated at the end with a delightful twist that caps the fun.

To all the Tarantino haters out there (lol) that claim this movie was predictable, well that is only because you know when Tarantino directs, a lot of people are going to die. I personally love all of Tarantino's movies, because he creates the unique moments. I don't know how much of this movie is similar to what actually happened during the WW2, but realize that each character is developed and has his own mind set. The German soldier that was trying to hit on Shoshana, he didn't know the situation until he got a bullet in the back. Was he a ""bad guy""? Or Goebels, he was an ego maniac, but at the same time a silly guy that was trying to get the recognition for his film work from the fuhrer. And for what? Who are the people we look recognition from? None of them realized what was going on, they thought they were ""ok"". And then they all die in the cinema theater.

And the real clever part about it is that it makes you thirst for blood against the people you wouldn't be ashamed in killing...the nazi's. But where this movie goes sour is that it portray's the Nazi's in a - I don't wish to sound out of line - 'lovable' fashion. Especially regarding Christopher Woltz's character (Hans Landa). You can't help but wishing you were everything those characters were (except for being part of a totalitarian, psychotic, mass-murding posse).<br/><br/>But by the end of this movie it is clear nobody is innocent. Is this Tarantino's best movie? No. But does it touch on some wider concepts and challenge American entertainment with it's foreign subtitles? Yes. Therefore this movie is well worth the watch and can be very satisfying for the sick at heart. For me, this is another mediocre Tarantino film in which the characters exceed the story or even the background. However it turns you onto the idea of having no problem to kill and the most ingenious of it all is that it does it with killing the very people you would want to see killed the most through all our history. Now that is entertainment. Though let's not be irradiate and make it reality. hmm?"

The was the first time I remember falling asleep during a war movie. I agree with other posters that said Quentin tried to hard to make sure we all got his joke. I am flabbergasted at an average rating of over 8, perhaps there are two versions and I saw the bad one. It is possible with decent editing and cutting the running time in half that a tight movie would result. At half the length it might be good. Sometimes Quentin really hits it out of the park.

","""Inglourious Basterds"" is a perfect film. It boasts an incredible script, an innovative score, rich cinematography, great performances, and the finest direction job by any director this year.<br/><br/>Characters, rather than situations, form the heart of ""Inglourious Basterds."" The film's narrative structure cleverly introduces these characters in their respective backgrounds, only to thrust them together as time progresses. Shosanna, a young French woman, runs a cinema that may play host to the upcoming release of a Jewish propaganda film. The film stars Nazi soldier Fredrick Zoller. The Nazi officer in charge of security for the event is Hans Landa, the ""Jew Hunter."" Lt. Aldo Raine and his ""Inglourious Basterds"" see the release as an opportunity for them to strike. They employ the services of British officer Hicox and German actress Bridget Von Hammersmark.<br/><br/>Each character is richly drawn, both through the script and through the acting. Melanie Laurent is ferocious as the dynamic Shosanna. Christoph Waltz shatters the screen as Hans Landa. Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, and Diane Kruger also do exceptionally well. The plot itself moves at the ideal pace. It's full of outstanding set-pieces and dialogue scenes, the most notable being the opening conversation and a scene at a bar (I'm being intentionally vague).<br/><br/>""Inglourious Basterds"" is entertaining and outstandingly well-made. It warrants its run-time and its sprawling plot. It's the best film of the year."

","Surprisingly,this is the first film of Quentin Tarantino's that I have had the privilege of watching. A couple of reasons led me to watch Inglorious Basterds which include the hype the film received, admiration for Tarantino's films despite never watching one previous to this one and other movies or directors using a similar style(eg. Coen Brothers-No Country for Old Men),etc.Having watched this film twice, I would have to say in my opinion, I see a strong chance for this film to win a Best Picture Oscar as well as a Best Director Oscar for Mr. Tarantino. I thought it should also be given a chance in the Screen writing category.With films that have such a good ensemble such as this one, it is sometimes hard to choose who was the best. Even with the star power of Brad Pitt, I think it is Christoph Waltz who steals the show as Colonel Hans Landa. From the first moment I saw him on screen, I said to myself""this guy is going to steal the show and could possibly snare an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor,even a win if possible.""Also starring in the ensemble cast is Melanie Laurent,Diane Kruger,Michael Fassbender,Eli Roth,Til Schweiger and Daniel Bruhl."
"mark24173","9","0","4","16 January 2010"," Very, very good, with Tarantino's one weakness ever-present
","I went to see this movie not really knowing what to expect. I'm not a real fan of war movies, but I do think that Tarantino is one of the great modern directors, albeit with a patchy record at times (I didn't think much of Kill Bill part 2, while I loved part 1).<br/><br/>The opening scene of this movie is masterful, switching easily between French and English - not to show off the linguistic prowess of the actors (very impressive though it is); it is part of the script. It also introduces us to the performance of Christoph Waltz, about which the hype is entirely justified. He is nothing short of incredible in this role, never puts a foot wrong and deserves every accolade he gets. The only act which will stop him from winning the Oscar will be an actor in the same category sleeping with a member of the academy. It could be said that Waltz is almost TOO good in that he overshadows performances which would otherwise themselves be heaped with high praise. He owns every scene he is in and towards the end of the movie, in a scene with Brad Pitt, he makes a so-called heavyweight like Pitt (who is far from bad in this) seem like a quasi-amateur. He is that good.<br/><br/>The direction is of course excellent; despite the lengthy dialogues and conversations, the movie rarely lags for its considerable duration. The violence is, well, it's what you would expect from Tarantino. Not much to say on that score. The dialogue itself is great, and carried off in three languages (plus the odd bit of Italian, which is hilarious when you hear Pitt's character try to speak it).<br/><br/>The ""one weakness"" I referred to above is something that I've always found in Tarantino's movies. While he creates great characters and gives them great dialogue, I have never been able to really empathize or sympathize with them. They don't seem very ""human"". It might just be me, though. Even when Shosanna is killed, it didn't really register as sad or anything. Again, this might be me, but I've not had this problem with other directors.<br/><br/>That aside, Inglorious Bastards is recommended thoroughly. Waltz is not to be missed and the whole thing is greatly entertaining."

","I'm a big fan of Tarantino movies, or at least the best of them such as Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. I believe him to be a man who genuinely loves cinema, which is a pretty good start. So how does this stack up? Well, I guess that it left me with mixed feelings. The acting is actually pretty good and the interesting cast give a good account of themselves. The story is obviously ridiculous. I don't believe that QT expects it to be taken seriously. This is comic book cinema with comic book characters, good guys and bad guys. There is a fair amount of graphic violence, maybe a little more than was necessary to make the point. I think the problem I had was that the whole thing was too much of a joke, the kind that sounds good fun after a night out with friends but which usually you realise isn't going to that funny when you review it in the cold (sober) light of day. This may sound pretentious but given that we know QT can make outstanding memorable movies, is this elaborate joke a little over the top and a waste of time and resources? On the other hand, it kept me glued to the screen for almost two and half hours, which is no mean feat. Also, I find it interesting to speculate - what if this was a new low budget movie by a director that no one had heard of previously? Answer I suspect - instant cult classic. Maybe I'm foolish not to join in and enjoy the joke more but I have a nagging feeling this will be forgotten quite quickly."
"moviesleuth2","9","0","4","13 January 2010"," Not Tarantino's best, but I'll take it
","Quentin Tarantino took the early 90's by storm with two unforgettable masterpieces of cinema: ""Resevoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction."" I haven't seen ""Jackie Brown"" or ""Grindhouse"" but the ""Kill Bill"" movies were far below his pedestal. With ""Inglorious Basterds,"" QT is back, although it's still a shade below his best.<br/><br/>Like his other features, ""Inglorious Basterds tells many stories at once. First is that of the film's namesake, a group of American soldiers told to hunt and kill Nazi soldiers and take their scalps. The point of this is to just raise hell and spread terror throughout the Third Reich. The second story is that of Shosanna (Melanie Laurent), who escapes slaughter at the hands of Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). Once in Paris, she runs a movie theater, and fate has it that she will get a chance for revenge.<br/><br/>People have been saying that this is QT's most cinematic film, and that's true. ""Inglorious Basterds"" is probably QT's most accessible movie, but it's still QT. Of his films, this is probably the most straightforward, and the most ""normal"" (if it were possible to call anything by QT normal). It's still got the same flavor of his earlier films, but it's easier to digest.<br/><br/>Like in his previous films, QT lets his actors stretch their range considerably and he allows them to play parts that they are not known for. Brad Pitt may be the tabloid king, but he's a good actor. He let everyone know that he's still got talent with his Oscar-nominated performance in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" and Pitt continues the trend. Aldo Raine is probably the most demented character QT has ever come up with, and Pitt relishes it. He's obviously having a grand time playing the scenery chewing (or is that scalping?) lieutenant, and he's a joy to watch. As good (and famous) as Pitt is, he's not the one getting all the attention. The one everyone is talking about is Christoph Waltz, and there's a reason for it: he's awesome. Waltz is positively delicious as the sadistically gleeful Landa. He may a kidder, but he's smart, and sly as a fox. Nothing gets past him, and this leads to some tense moments. It's hard to say who's more fun to watch, Pitt or Waltz, but the multi-lingual Landa is a more developed character. Waltz deserves all the accolades that he's getting, and a shoo-in for a Best Supporting Actor nod. However, the two women of the film, Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger, are largely ignored. Both give terrific performances. Laurent is great as the revenge-driven Shosanna. She's intense, but able to keep composure. She's also able to fend off the advances of the Nazi war hero, Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) with wit and bite. Diane Kruger has been labeled a foreign sexpot, which I find unfair. Hopefully people will recognize her talent as the German actress-turned-spy. Also starring is Eli Roth, who, at least in this case, is proving to be a better actor than director.<br/><br/>With a story like this, QT ran the risk of not doing justice to, or worse, exploiting, the Nazi persecution of the Jews. But QT treats the material with enough sensitivity that he avoids this problem. There is no shame in enjoying this film for what it is: a bizarrely twisted and funny WWII movie.<br/><br/>The only thing that holds this film back is the script. It's not that it's bad, but QT's first two films had brilliant dialogue, and that's missing here. QT spent years developing this film, but unfortunately, the script doesn't show it.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is a wildly entertaining ride. Welcome back, QT."

","I won't spoil the story for those who want to see it by revealing the ending but ""Inglourious Basterds"" is typical Quentin Tarantino, spilling more blood per frame than ""The Saving on Private Ryan,"" which recreated the D-Day assault. Tarantino's story is complete fiction -- a squad of Jewish soldiers landed in occupied France for the sole purpose of killing (and scalping) every Nazi they can find. The scalping is a Tarantino touch that subtracts from what little credibility this film otherwise possesses.<br/><br/>It is nicely acted, however. Not by Brad Pitt. His Lt. Aldo Raines is preposterous. I'm sure he's fulfilling Tarantino's script, however, so don't hold this entirely against him. The fine acting comes from Melanie Laurent as a beautiful young Jewish woman who owns a movie house in Paris,Diane Kruger as a German actress who is working against the Nazis and especially, from Christolph Waitz as a Jew-hunting Gestapo colonel. <br/><br/>The finish is a whiz bang -- the least true, however, of any of the film's many untruths."

","After watching the first hour of this movie, I came upon a theory that I think makes a lot of sense as to why the movie Grindhouse wasn't a hit: They don't know how to market Quintin Tarantino. The previews show Inglorious Basterds as a fun, gory, thrill ride and in reality, it isn't. It isn't that I didn't like the film, it was just that I was expecting a Kill Bill style action-fest and it was pretty talky. The good news is that since Quintin Tarantino can write like no other, that makes the movie very entertaining. What I really love about this movie is the brilliant performances. I usually hate the saying that something is ""a revelation"", but Christof Waltz really is. I hope he wins a best supporting actor Oscar for playing the charming and mostly evil Hans Landa.

"marius-628-474385","7","0","6","7 January 2010"," Food for thought
","I wasn't impressed with this movie after seeing it the first time. The middle part was quite boring and some of the dialogs went on and on. Normally I don't watch movies more than once, but for some reason this one kept me thinking and I enjoyed it much more the second time.<br/><br/>However, the most fun I got from this movie was by thinking about it and trying to get into the director's mind. One of the things I noticed was the constant use of the upstairs/downstairs-perspective in the movie. Starting with the first scene in which Landa interrogates the farmer while Jews are hiding underneath the floorboards. Later on, the Bastards are watching the prisoners from above, Shosanna talks to Zoller standing on a ladder etc. etc. People downstairs are generally being killed from high positions (Zoller shooting many soldiers from the bird's nest in the German movie, Bastards killing from the boxes in the movie theater). It is better to be a hawk in the sky than a rat downstairs in this movie . (Remember the Landa-speech in the first scene!). No surprise that Bastard-Leader Raine is very upset that a meeting has been set up in the basement (downstairs) of the French tavern. Nothing good can come from fighting in a basement! And so it didn't. Nothing good comes from going to the movies either I must warn you (everyone involved in the movie business gets killed, a 'subtle'-Tarantino hint; even the flammable nitrate film is lethal.) You might be better off watching this one at home. Another important theme is interrogation. Tarantino spends a significant part of the movie showing us all kinds of interrogations, from subtle questioning (mostly Landa) to aggressive encounters involving torture and blackmail (mostly Raine). It almost seems as if Tarantino is trying to make a study of the 'art' of interrogation. Usually it involves trying to establish the true identity of the person(s) questioned. And most of the time there is a language problem, another big theme in the movie. All of this talking and dialog is sometimes a little bit boring but some of the scenes are really hilarious. My favorite was the interrogation of Hammersmark and her ""Italian"" escorts with Landa making fun of them and sometimes laughing in their faces. Clearly Tarantino is, through this scene, making fun of the poor knowledge of foreign languages of American people. One question keeps puzzling me. Is it possible that Hans Landa himself is a Jew, trying to hide his true identity by playing a fanatic Nazi? If Landa is a Jew, It would explain his statement in the first scene in which he claims to be an excellent Jew Hunter, because he can think like a Jew. It's also explains his surprising behavior at the end, becoming a turncoat and passively and actively cooperating with the assassination of the Nazi-leaders, out of nowhere really. Nothing before indicated him being anything else than a charming but ruthless and convinced Nazi follower. Except for one thing actually, he allowed Shosanna to escape from the dairy farm and later on in Paris his behavior suggested he might have recognized her (offering her milk, forgetting a question). To be honest, I have no hard evidence to support my Landa=Jew-claim. It is a fact however that all the other main characters in the movie are at some point hiding their real identity (Shosanna/Mimieux, Bastards playing German soldiers or Italian movie makers etc. etc.) or are actors themselves. That makes 'identity confusion' an important theme of the movie (remember the game they play in the French Tavern-basement). So isn't it likely that the lead character (Landa) is also playing a role and hiding his Jewish identity? Well, I guess this is a question that only Mr. Tarantino himself can answer. One thing is for sure, the Landa-character (excellent role by Waltz) is hardly a typical German/Nazi. OK, maybe I am getting carried away with this. Tarantino has directed an intriguing film which can be viewed on many different levels with many great scenes and great acting. On the downside I didn't feel connected with the characters in this movie. This became very clear to me in the scene in which Shosanna and Fredrick killed each other; their fate didn't move me emotionally at all. Overall, this movie is a great joy for the brain and for the eye, but leaves the heart untouched, a problem with many Tarantino-productions I must say."
"horror_pop","Null","0","6","7 January 2010"," ""You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know that this movie really is something!""
","It really brings me down when people keep saying how Inglourious Basterds is clearly inferior to Pulp Fiction. Comparing two movies that are as different as these two can be from each other is ridiculous; yes, Tarantino redefined cinema with PF, but if you were expecting another one, all I have to say is that you're an idiot. Why would Quentin want to waste his time making another Pulp Fiction when he could make something new, fresh, daring and just as enjoyable? Que the Basterds.<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds is a classic love-it-or-hate-it movie; people who hate it REALLY hate it, and people who like it REALLY like it. I find that people who end up hating it are setting their standards way too high. Come on, you're watching a movie where Nazis get scalped and beaten with baseball bats, directed by Quentin Tarantino; were you really expecting something that Siskel and Ebert would praise?<br/><br/>Inglourious Basterds has that classic Tarantino touch that his fans have come to love; scenes filled with clever dialogue and little to no action, different plots that are woven together beautifully, a colorful set of kickass characters, and even the infamous trunk-shot. Telling the story of a group of Jewish-American soldiers who embark on a brutal revenge mission against the Nazis, and a young Jewish girl who is forced to live in occupied France disguised as a French cinema owner, Inglourious Basterds is not for the faint of heart. People who complain that the movie is too gory; have you never seen a Tarantino film before? Even if you haven't, just looking at the film poster should've given you an obvious heads-up that this wasn't going to be the next 'Love Actually'! <br/><br/>As with all Tarantino's films, the characters make the story; how they're brought to life on screen, how they interact with other characters, and how they're portrayed through the directors eyes. German actor Christoph Waltz plays Nazi Colonel Hans Landa in his first American movie role. Landa comes off as charming, polite, and cultured, which makes him a very effective villain. On one hand, you want him to die and suffer for being a member of the Nazi party, but you also want to have a conversation with him by the fireplace with a cup of cocoa. Tarantino, as always, does an excellent job giving his villains human traits, making them all the more terrifying. I give Christoph Waltz very much praise; no one else could've played Landa like he did.<br/><br/>Another newcomer to American film is French Mélanie Laurent, playing Shosanna Dreyfus, a Jewish woman living in occupied France under the alias Emmanuelle Mimieux. Tarantino took a big risk in casting Laurent, as this was the first time the actress would be speaking English in a role, and it was a gamble worth playing. Laurent does a great job, especially when she shares the screen with Christoph Waltz and/or Daniel Brühl, who plays Fredrick Zoller, a German soldier who is infatuated with Shosanna/Emmanuelle.<br/><br/>Now for the boys on the title, the Basterds themselves. Aldo the Apache, the leader of the fearless team of Nazi-hunting Jews, is played by the always fearless Brad Pitt. Many complain that this role was miscast, but I have to disagree. I thoroughly enjoyed hearing Brad Pitt draaaaaaawwwwwl that Southern accent and delivering some of the simplest, yet greatest lines in modern cinema. He's just a great actor who gives his all in every role, and Aldo the Apache is no different. Eli Roth, a well known director in the gore circles, plays Donny Donowitz, or if you prefer his nickname, the Bear Jew, a Boston Jew with a love of beating Nazis with baseball bats. Also included in the mix are Gedeon Burkhard as the teams Austrian-Jewish interpreter (who doesn't get enough screen time if you ask me), and Til Schweiger (a personal favorite of mine) as the German Hugo Stiglitz who joins the Basterds after turning against his fellow Gestapo officers. The rest of the Basterds are played by relatively unknown actors, but they do their part with no less heart than he bigger names on the list.<br/><br/>As probably everyone who reviewed this movie, I also feel the need to bring up the use of language in this movie. Over half of this film is in a language other than English, which as a lover of all languages I found beautiful. It adds a richness to the style and story that not many directors would have the guts to try. It really is music to my ears to hear so much language in one single movie; most movies have a maximum of two, this one has four: German, French, English, and Italian. If you can't appreciate this move and refuse to watch movies that include subtitles, all I can say is that it's your loss. I must also bring up what every hater seems to be whining about: the successful assassination of ""ol' uncle Adolf"", to quote Aldo. I was able to overlook this obviously made up fact because I was completely immersed in the reality that the movie had created for me. That's what movies are for! Like everyone in the theatre, I cheered when it happened. Quentin took a big risk at creating such a climax for his movie, and I think he pulled it off like no one else could've. Mr. Tarantino, you have brass balls and I respect you for it.<br/><br/>My final verdict reads: go see this movie. If you love movies, go see this movie. If you love Tarantino, go see this movie. If you don't mind reading subtitles or training your ears in other languages for a change, go see this movie. If you like badass characters kicking ass, go see this movie. If you hate Nazis, go see this movie. If you like gore, go see this movie. Go see it even if you know you'll just nitpick it to death later."

And the only reason that I didn't give it a higher score was two-fold. Number one is that some parts were way too long for their own good and it got boring. I know that some films need to be longer for the story to grow and mature, but this one isn't one of them. He could have edited about 1/2 hour out of the film and still have gotten the story across just as well. Number two, and the bigger reason. I don't mind subtitles in films. But I DO mind it when about 1/3 of the time they go by way too fast and you can't catch everything that is being said. Especially when you are watching them with almost the same colored background as the lettering! Plus, when there are that many subtitles, it is also hard to watch what is happening. I'm not some dummy that can't read fast either, so don't go there, and I also have 20/30 vision. :) Other than that, it was a good film that kept me interested right through to the end. Also, you just need to remember that this movie is complete fiction, and not factual. So don't go into it expecting to get any historical value from it besides the obvious Nazi and Hitler atrocities that we all know from history class, because you won't. Brad Pitt actually took away from the film for me. His character was just not believable at all. But, maybe that's how Tarantino wanted him to play it..... over the top."

Add to that some lengthy passages where you only had a few seconds to read it. <br/><br/>All the pauses and rewinds make for an additional 30-40 minutes of viewing. <br/><br/>They should have put the subtitles below the picture in the black area at the bottom of the screen. <br/><br/>QT or Weinstein.............. <br/><br/>If you ever read this, Miramax needs to re release the DVD with better subtitling!!!!"

","""Watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies."" - Aldo Raine<br/><br/>Tarantino returns with his first film since the slightly underrated Death Proof, in one of the most entertaining and stylish movies of 2009. Brad Pitt stars as the leader of the Nazi-hunting Basterds, Christoph Waltz as a sadistic Nazi colonel, and Mélanie Laurent as a vengeful Jewish cinema owner. It is a story about revenge, dishonor and tragic circumstance.<br/><br/>The plot is slightly unconventional, in that many scenes are 20-plus minutes long, and there is a lot of dialogue. The pacing is consistent however, and the incredible tension created in each of the scenes means that it never gets dull for a moment. The film is blood-soaked but only in short bursts, and the shock of the violence is higher as a result. The cinematography is beautiful, as is the costume design. The film is shot in a very classical style and doesn't go over the top like some Tarantino films. It never feels like a Taratino film, which shows that he has grown as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>The script is incendiary, going hand in hand with the long style editing to create excellent character arcs (some of which only last one scene.) The performances, particularly by Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent, are totally unforgettable. If Laurent doesn't become huge after this movie, it will be a shame. Brad Pitt is the all-American hero, and though his role is more one-note than the other characters, he has some great lines and was very enjoyable to watch. The supporting cast has some surprises, like Mike Myers nearly unrecognizable as an Allied general, and Julie Dreyfus as the girlfriend of German filmmaker Goebelles, who both make the most out of smaller roles. Daniel Brühl also impresses in his screen debut, as a German war hero.<br/><br/>The plot is centered around the showing of a German war film at a small cinema in Paris, and the film within a film is about a German war hero who killed hundreds of Allied soldiers from the top of a tower. The German high command has showed up to view the film, and both the Basterds, a group of Nazi-killing assassins, and the cinema's owner, Shosanna, plan to take out the whole German leadership during the screening. The film is almost nauseatingly violent, but there is a method to Tarantino's madness.<br/><br/>The film may seem grossly jingoistic at first glance, but I think Tarantino is really trying to say something about the nature of violent imagery. Near the end, Hitler is laughing watching American soldiers die in a Nazi propaganda film. Then, in what has to be one of the most outrageous scenes in cinema history...<br/><br/>*SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Eli Roth and Omar Doom burst in and mow down Hitler and Goebbels with machine guns.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Has Tarantino finally lost his mind? Not quite. He's created an alternate history of the end of World War 2, one that we have all pictured in our minds at some point. My personal reaction to this scene was to immediately cheer and clap. Then I realized Tarantino had gotten me. Unbelievably, I actually felt a little sorry for Hitler. I mean, he gets shot to pieces and then shot some more. Leave it to Tarantino to make me feel guilty for laughing at Hitler's death.<br/><br/>My initial reaction proved the point he was trying to make with this movie. Just like Hitler is amused by the death of American soldiers in the film-in-a-film, we in turn laugh when a bunch of Nazis are mowed down. It seems perfectly natural to laugh at such brutality, because this is a fantasy: We would all like to see Hitler die horribly. But Tarantino is testing the audience. It should be shocking, not funny. Tarantino has brought to light one of the most overlooked double standards in film: Aren't American-centered war movies no better than propaganda, and have we been conditioned to view the killing of Germans as entertaining?<br/><br/>By using Jews to kill the Nazis, he is doing a spin on the adage 'Before seeking revenge first dig two graves'. They end up becoming no better than butchers, killing honorable people in the name of revenge. Most of the Jewish characters end up dying at the end, giving a literal meaning to the expression. In the first scalping scene, Eli Roth's character is reluctant to kill the German officer because he knows it's morally wrong. An image of him blasting a dead man's face to pulp with a tommy gun with fire in his eyes shows us what kind of person he has become by the end.<br/><br/>On the surface this film seems simple, but Tarantino has loaded it with philosophical questions. This is not a typical war film, but really a satire of them. Tarantino should be commended for making such an entertaining (which should make the viewer feel guilty, and did for me), shocking, well made and unique motion picture. Stylistically, it's such a throwback to classic film noir that we will likely never see a film like it again. It's so well made that most of it's excesses can be overlooked, and I think it deserves multiple Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>One final note, I didn't feel guilty laughing about the fate of the slimy Hans Landa, who gets exactly what he deserves at the end. In the opening scene he professes his love of rats, and like a rat he sells out the Nazis to save his own skin. In the end, his betrayal saves his life, but it's no longer a life worth living. Likewise, the French farm owner has to live with the knowledge that he let a Jewish family die. I guess it is better to die honorably than live dishonorably."

","It is not a WW2 documentary; It is not supposed to make sense, its entertainment; Entertainment is not supposed to make any sense at all.<br/><br/>Heard a few critics saying some nasty things about Tarantino's last movie ""Inglorious Basterds"". Some of them might be actually right when it comes down to some excesses in dialog, violence, music or even the construction of a couple of scenes, but that's Tarantino's ""thing"", he is a movie aficionado and really enjoys to deliver a punch in our guts when it comes to movie experience. He made it again, brilliantly. <br/><br/>OK, hardcore, close-minded critics will enjoy exercise their hand muscles writing awful reviews about ""Inglorious"". However, in my opinion, they have lost their focus completely trying to pin down ""inglorious basterds"" as a typical WW2 film. <br/><br/>Consider, Germans as thereal ""bad guys"". At the time, after a huge economic crises, they were following someone who actually believe what he was doing was right (the great man theory - Hegel, Nietzsche, and Spengler). Fuelled with patriotism, unable to resist the propaganda machine, threaten by a merciless dictator and desperate to survive the Germans had no escape other then oblige their own instincts and obey. (see the movie: (Die Welle)The Wave). <br/><br/>Consider the Jews. Given the chance to avenge the injustices committed by ""Die Endlösung"", The Jews would act the same way the ""basterds"" did in the movie. (see Thomas Hobbs, de cive (1651)- Man Is Wolf To Man). <br/><br/>Consider Quentin Tarantino. He is definitely a ""filnerd"" (film nerd) like most of us and like most brilliant directors/filmmakers he drinks from several sources when it comes to create his movies; pretty much like Herr Frankenstein, he cleverly saw, pieces from different movie genres together achieving a result most of us couldn't conceive (like Takashi Miike – Sukiyaki Western Django).<br/><br/>In his fictional world (I believe he lives in a parallel Universe), time and space are fluids running free regardless the obstacles diabolically placed by a bunch of obsolete, narrow-minded rulers. In his world he is Don Quixote fighting what he perceives as windmills and we perceive as conventionalism. <br/><br/>He is not God, Satan or the best director/filmmaker ever. Sometimes he thinks he is the last coke can in the vending machine but somehow, something or someone drags him back to reality and he comes back with a precious jewel to help us cope with our own troubled experiences. <br/><br/>Considering Hollywood. Hollywood is over. In a world where ""I dream of Jodie"", ""Gene Simmons Family Jewels"", ""the girls of the playboy mansion"" and ""E!"" rules, there is no more hope. Like a friend once said, Hollywood is like the TV show ""rides"", we pick up a ""damaged beyond repair"" car, paint over a few ugly parts and sell as ""custom vintage"" to a MTV/VH1 rapper/football player. People are getting dumber by the nanosecond. At this rate will be all joining hands as the last participants in the next Survivor (twilling of the Human Race). <br/><br/>Considering ""Inglorious Basterds"" For over two hours you will laugh, cover your eyes, feel sorry for Daniel Brühl's character, eat popcorn till it comes out from your eyes, praise Christoph Waltz's performance, repeat the word bongiorno over and, if you have any personality disorder (psychopath) you'll by Til Schweiger's poster and put it on your wall, will buy yourself a baseball bat and will decorate it with tag-lines from the movie such as ""A basterd's work is never done"" and probably after the screening you will find yourself a good pub and drink yourself to oblivion just to watch the movie all over again the next day."

","This is a great film, it has everything, good action, good drama, good acting, it practically there's a little bit of everything , and thats exactly the problem with it, what i saw was a fun WWII movie, and i also saw pulp fiction and kill bill,and reservoir dogs in it, it seems to me that Quentin didn't want to risk with this movie so wath he did was that he mixed all of hes past films.One of the great things about the movie, is that around 80 percent of it, its spoken either in french or German, the English dialogs are very minimum as as the scenes Brad Pitt appears, there's at least 15 minutes of the movie that we don't see Pitt,and that a good thing because it takes you away from the fact that its a big budget Hollywood movie, you get to see an know this great foreign actors. Given that this is WWII epic film, i knew i was going to see a different form of film-making from Tarantino, that i was a going to see a movie Tarantino style, but...instead i saw a movie pulp fiction, kill bill, etc style."

","I'm ashamed to say it, but I did not have much desire to see this film. I decided to give it a shot after it was playing at the right time to coincide with some free time I had. That was one of the best decisions I've made lately regarding movie watching. It was probably the best movie I have seen this year.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Christoph Waltz steals the show as the ""Jew Hunter"". He speaks four different languages, and he displays a sort of sophisticated ruthlessness that few could duplicate. He is calm, cool and collected for most of the film, but you can tell he could explode at any moment (which he unexpectedly does in one surprising scene). The French actress, Melanie Laurent, gives a fine performance as the young owner of a cinema in Paris with the chance to change the course of World War II. I'd like to see more of her in the future. Brad Pitt is a bit over the top in his portrayal of Lt. Aldo Raine, but he is still entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>What made the movie so special to me was Tarrantino's ability to build tension and an uneasiness in certain scenes. Without spoiling anything, I will speak about this in general terms. In three or four scenes, you are aware that the bad guy and the good guy are both onto each other, but the tension comes from seeing who will break first or make the first move. The consequences will be great, so this just adds to the emotion and the suspense of the moment.<br/><br/>In short, if you had any reservations about seeing this film, please put them aside, don't be too critical of historical inaccuracies, and just go and enjoy a very good movie."

Be it the climax , be it the scenes , the dialogs or the entire 2.5 hour brainstorming 5 chapter movie , every bit was a work of precision and expertise and u know that this man ""Tarantino"" is what u call a ""scene specialist"" .........Chapter One was like one of the best introductory parts I have seen in recent times ..... Wow !! that man Chris Waltz (Col Hans Landa , ""the Jew Hunter"") , took it away with storm actually , not only the start but the entire movie !! .. the start was like ""awesum"" ...... And the dialogs , u know , QT is the man known for the most famous dialogs in cinematic history ....... I am not like those die-hard or crazy fans of QT but surely one of his biggest fans ...... and its obvious why is it so !! He doesn't care if he offends his audience , creates chilling tension and suspense and there is no place of any slightest bit of any sort of emotion in his movies and what he has repeatedly highlighted in Reservoir Dogs , Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill and has again proved that this time . The next icing on the cake was the ruthless ""Glo""u""rious"" Basterds of course ..... Brad Pitt was like a character something u don't get to see often .... From gorging down his finger into Bridget's wound to executing the deal b/w him and Landa ... , its impossible to take off your eyes off him at any moment and not to forget Eli Roth (""The Bear Jew"") and Til Schweiger , they were really awesome.. <br/><br/>Apart from the dialogs , the scenes and the characters , the next best thing was the acting of young Melanie Laurent(Shosanna Dreyfus)....... she was like the ""queen of the climax"" .....and yes , she proved it that ""the taste of revenge is indeed so sweet"" and ""nitrate""ious"" ... Diane Kruger (Bridget Von Hammersmark) had a somewhat supporting role as an private informer for the ""Basterds"" , but she looked murderously gorgeous (trust me) .... And what more can be said , there is still so much to say about this movie ; but I definitely would say that this movie is those of like typical ""tarantine excellence and precision"" (and certainly the best after Pulp Fiction) and not meant for all , specially those who have not seen his movies earlier would find it a bitter pill to swallow but its a must watch for all you fans of QT (specially for the acting of Waltz and Pitt , the start and the climax)..... I don't know how my German friends would take this movie , but I am sure this is by far the best movie of 2009 and another work of masterpiece by QT .... !!<br/><br/>So , just go , see the movie , have fun , enjoy and re-realize the man whom u call ""Quentin Tarantino"" ......

","Some of you reading this may think I'm contradicting myself with my title and my rating, but do keep in mind that while I'm writing this the average weighted vote of every IMDb user who has seen this is 8.6/10 thus placing it in the top 50 of all major films of all time. Let me just say that I did enjoy this film quite a bit. If movies like this were nominated for Academy Awards Brad Pitt should be the frontrunner for best actor. The rest of the cast did a tremendous job as well and the story was good enough to keep me enthralled throughout the entire 2 1/2 hours of the film. That said, the reason I tell you don't believe the hype is that this movie tries to be too many different things at once. It doesn't give the audience enough of one or the other to really satisfy/sell them on whether this should be a comedy or an action film. If you take Brad Pitt out of the picture then the movie may have one or two jokes throughout the entire film. And if you take out even just one fight scene then it could hardly be called an action movie. The story just isn't good enough to overpower those flaws to deem Inglorious Bastards as one of the greatest films of all time. To say it's better than a film like V for Vendetta or Snatch is just absurd. I mean maybe it's just me but I honestly don't think I'm alone on this. By the way I was fine with the whole ""let's completely rewrite history and kill Hitler"" thing. I thought it was pretty cool actually."
"fowler1","Null","0","4","6 September 2009"," A Tainted Triumph
","Look, by now nobody needs one more plot synopsis of INGLOURIOUS - you all know the drill. Ditto on Christoph Waltz, who's very good (though I have a sneaking suspicion the level of hosannas he's receiving from critics are due to their never having heard of the guy before). For Tarantino and the Weinsteins, this represents a desperately-needed critical/b.o. rebound from the debacle that was DEATH PROOF, which is why it got a late-August release after all the other big summer movies have already come & gone. Add in the now-obligatory Tarantino-fanboy choir drowning out the relatively few naysayers and the result is QT's biggest-ever hit. But will you respect INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS in the morning? <br/><br/>Pros? Well, let's start with ""hurray for Steadicam!"" Finally, a movie that doesn't require taking two Dramamine in the lobby beforehand - hallelujah. Next, I'm happy to report that Waltz isn't the only heretofore-unknown (to Yanks, at least) European find the movie offers: Daniel Bruhl, Melanie Laurent, Michael Fassbender and Denis Menochet all turn in first-rate work. Fassbender's entire performance is a film-geek inside joke (he's Trevor Howard in THE THIRD MAN brought out of retirement, kinda), but it's a satisfying inside joke; Laurent and Bruhl provide the film with both heart and moral complexity; and Menochet - who resembles a younger, handsomer Jean Reno - is the unheralded component in that celebrated first scene, whose superb straight-man work sets up/off Waltz beautifully. The Bowie song works exactly as Tarantino intended it to (though he needs to lay off the Morricone swipes for a while - once is an homage; twice, a ripoff). The pacing, which has drawn criticism, is leisurely throughout, but that's okay: Tarantino is a storyteller who's as much about the asides as the plot - probably more so. He takes his time, sure, but we want him to linger in this world. (If your beef with IB is the glacial rhythm of the setpieces, wait a few weeks/months and watch it again - you'll probably discover you've changed your mind about the 'pacing' issue.) As for his long suit - the dialogue - he's mostly on form. And at least for once we get to listen to 40s hipsters, instead of the more tiresome contemporary kind (and I do mean tiresome: David Carradine's KILL BILL 2 monologue pretty much took the air out of that movie's tires, while DEATH PROOF clattered along, riding on its rims, interminably.) <br/><br/>Now for the cons. The marketing campaign for the film is just that, a con, and a huge one, right down to the ""kosher porn"" and ""as a Jew, I thank you"" quotes attached to the production; primarily designed to separate suckers from their scratch. (Somehow, I doubt Lawrence Bender and Harvey Weinstein would be very enthusiastic at the number of likable and even heroic Nazis in the movie had IB tanked that all-important First Weekend of Release.) This might be the first commando picture with hardly any commandoes in it! Secondly, there are so many logical and historical gaffes in the film they turn, inevitably, into potholes - you're willing to endure the first few w/o complaint, growing more and more ticked off as they just keep coming. (And please, no cries of ""duh! - it's a MOVIE, Einstein!"" We're not talking about a few holes here, but a block of Swiss cheese.) Third, the casting of Hitler and Goebbels is disastrous - a little levity is one thing, but this is CARRY ON FUEHRER! <br/><br/>And last (though hardly least) is the most troubling of all: at some deeper level, Tarantino movies are always about the cruelly kinetic joy of sadism and murder....and IB proudly continues this odious 'tradition'. The 'feminist' - and now, 'anti-fascist' - subtext of his films are just cynical window dressing, there to provide convenient but utterly bogus moral cover for the atrocities that make QT's wee-wee twitch to attention. Which isn't to say they're not effective: the image of Laurent's face superimposed on smoke in the film's gotterdammerung finale is real nightmare material, with a phantasmagoric eerieness that's hard to shake. But the crux of this sequence is watching screaming people trapped by design in a fiery inferno, and it's presented as popcorn-munching entertainment for the masses (we're meant to applaud in delight); given the hideous parallels to everything from the Triangle Factory to the Station nightclub (and to the poor souls who tossed themselves from the top of the WTC on 9/11 rather than burn to cinders), it's an evil scene. Depicting such a horror is one thing - CELEBRATING it as catharsis is something else entirely...... entirely too much, in my view. (The legion of Tarantino fanboys will no doubt insist that it's meant not to feed an audience's bloodlust, but instead to provoke thought and discussion. Well in that case, I'll be waiting for the Museum of Modern Art to book a HOSTEL II/MAN BEHIND THE SUN double-feature any day now.)<br/><br/>So there you have it. A well-made, fairly riveting Tootsie Pop, with a cancerous center lying in wait under the candy coating. I liked it for what it did well, though obviously with some deep misgivings; your own mileage may vary."
"peterweisz","8","0","4","6 September 2009"," The Revenge of the 'Terds
","I approached ""Inglourious Basterds"" with some major apprehensions based on the film's pre-release buzz. The three issues I found deserving of concern were:<br/><br/>1. Tarantino's reputation for portraying actual events with only a passing nod towards historic accuracy. <br/><br/>2. My distaste for ""funny"" Nazis. <br/><br/>3. The director's penchant, or perhaps fetish would be more correct, towards the graphic and prurient depiction of gore and violence.<br/><br/>Let me simply say that after seeing "" 'Terds,"" I still believe that these concerns are valid. Yet, thanks to Tarantino's skillful hand, they did not impede my overall enjoyment of the film. First the issue of historic veracity...<br/><br/>Tarantino, perhaps not wishing to stir up any post-JFK (the movie)-like dust-ups, couched this tale between two parenthetical disclaimers. The opening title slide proclaims: ""Once Upon A Time..."" (It could have added ""In a galaxy far away""). The penultimate scene (spoiler alert) is one of Hitler and Goebbels meeting their demise in a flaming French cinema in 1944 when everyone over the age of 10 knows that they died by their own hands in a Berlin bunker one year later. As if the message (""Hey, kids. This is a fantasy!"") was still not clear enough, there is the occasional disembodied voice-over, straight out of ""The Princess Bride."" Point being, that Tarantino reduced the number of theater-goers exiting this film who would ask themselves ""Hmm, is this a true story?"" down to a statistical insignificant percentage.<br/><br/>The film resembles, in style (if you overlook the goriness) and substance nothing so much as the two ""To Be or Not To Be"" wartime comedies (with Jack Benny in 1942 and Mel Brooks forty years later). These were screwball comedies set against a very real backdrop of Nazi brutality. The protagonist was also an heroic theater owner. Taken on those terms, Inglourious Basterds succeeds valiantly in propelling the viewer through an at-times bittersweet and at-times hilarious story arc that accelerates skillfully to its dramatic climax."
"damfinobk","7","0","4","4 September 2009"," Imperfect Bastards
","Quentin Tarantino's new film ""Inglourious Basterds"" is an exercise in style and suspense, and was everything we have come to expect from Tarantino: wit, blood, and plenty of talk. The talk doesn't bother me, but it does seem to be the number one complaint anyone mentions. The dialog is thrilling, probably more so than the bloody violence scenes. Brad Pitt was solid, but the show is all Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa. He absolutely steals the show as ""The Jew Hunter."" Let me rave first about ""Chapter One"" of the film, ""Once upon a time... in Nazi occupied France."" The scene reminds me very much of the lead up to the violence in Igmar Bergmann's ""The Virgin Spring."" The suspense builds to a horrible (and very real) climax that introduces us to the blood that we'll be seeing plenty of in later scenes.<br/><br/>However, I can be sure that thirty minutes of the film could've been cut without missing a single story point. The soundtrack at segments can be extremely well executed, bar one scene where Shoshanna Dreyfus is getting ""dressed to kill."" Now, if I'm not mistaken, it's a remix of a Johnny Cash song. (Now I could accept a lot of things where the soundtrack was concerned, but this was simply laughable.) Plot wholes abound, but if you don't pay too close attention to details, this won't bother you, as you will be paying more attention to the sharp dialog and the interesting characters too much to care.<br/><br/>And if you're looking for any sort of historical accuracy, don't watch it. Unfortunately for me, I am a big history buff, and it did distract me from fully enjoying the ending of the movie.<br/><br/>I'm leaving a lot of details out, some of them I consider too glaring to miss writing about, but I feel that it should be considered entertainment first and foremost. And where that is concerned, 80 percent of it is incredibly entertaining, especially Waltz, followed by Pitt. Judge for yourself. Either spend the 10 bucks, or rent it. Either way, you will walk away from the experience with plenty to talk about."
"georgegauthier","8","0","4","28 August 2009"," Pitt looks bad in close ups
","I was sorry to watch the extreme closeups of Brad Pitt at the beginning of the picture when he is interrogating captured Germans. The camera was most unkind to him, showing how badly he has aged. He has pronounced wrinkles and bags under his eyes. Also what is that scar on his neck? It looks like the scar Clint Eastwood's character bore from the failed lynching in ""Hang em High"". Perhaps the scar is a trace of a face lift. <br/><br/>Anyway, in his mid-forties and now looking it, Pitt would have been too old to be a mere lieutenant in WW II. And why did he not get promoted during the three years we see him in action?<br/><br/>The hardest thing to swallow in all the movie was the absurdly lackadaisical security at the theater. The Fuhrer would have had numerous SS guards inside and outside the premises, at the doors of the auditorium, on the balcony, etc. The black projectionist was not supposed to be in the theater at all, yet he walks around it openly, exits the main entrance then goes in a side door which has no guards on it, either inside or out. Unlikely, given typical German thoroughness.<br/><br/>Still I liked the surprise ending. I had not been told ahead of time that this was set in an alternative history, so I never expected the German leadership to get killed in June of 1944."

It was'nt exactly what I thought it would be(neither was ""Dusk Before Dawn"") but, it turned out to be better than anticipated.

","As a fan of many Tarantino films I walked into the theater with high hopes for this movie, though I would have to say that despite being a visually pleasing film with some well written dialog, it was flat out boring. I am not a film student who is interested in studying all the subtle things Tarantino does to make this movie interesting, I want to be entertained. One would think that a movie about an elite group of soldiers sent in to strike fear into the hearts of the Nazis through the use of brute force and barbaric tactics might actually contain action...nope. Though there were a couple scenes that made you think that the movie might be starting to pick up the pace, it didn't, and those few scenes were all too brief. I expected over-the-top ""Kill Bill"" type action, but the pace of the movie was more reminiscent of ""Death Proof"". You sit through over two hours of dialog just to be rewarded with 15 minutes of action. The movie is definitely watchable, if you don't go to see it expecting to be blown away by the fight scenes. There were some welcomed bits of comedy mixed in with the drama/suspense,but the lack of action will leave your inner bloodthirsty-bastard wanting much more."

The original is a battle action film about African American soldiers in Italy during World War II. An American soldier leads a renegade group of condemned back criminals against the Nazis. they are traveling in a convoy bound for a military prison, the black soldiers escape and but are recruited to take on a mission for the French underground to go against the Nazis. The movie stars Fred Williamson, Bo Svenson and Peter Hooten. The story has been changed in this version, but the bones of the two movies are very kind of the same."

","Ohh Yeah this was good fun. Quentin did a good job with this movie. The story line was brilliant, acting from everyone was outstanding and some of them in multiple languages. One of the best things about Tarantinos movies is that the BAD guys have fantastic roles that inspire great actors to perform splendid. This movie had lots of good old violence, but of courseit is a Tarantino movie after all. It had a couple of the Tarantino trademarks, which a true fan will appreciate, like side clips showing characters origin and on-screen labeling of person, places or things. The film has a beautifully rich color and outstanding cinematography, why can't more films look like this! Movie was almost 3 hoursbut only dragged at small points. I do not want to discuss the plot to much because I do not want to give it away.<br/><br/>Yes it has violence and foul languageso do not take your kids.<br/><br/>Plenty of bloody violence, plenty of witty dialogue, plenty of interesting characters.<br/><br/>The only negatives are some scenes drag on a bit and some more action scenes would have been appreciated. I would have liked to see a little more batting practice.<br/><br/>Not as good as Pulp Fiction but better than Deathproof. I give it a solid 8 out of 10. Will watch it again on the big screen then snatch up the DVD. I hope the DVD has some extra scenes."

","I have never been a huge Tarintino fan, and i still am not. But this stands out there as of my more favorite films of his. Really you have to go into the movie with the mindset that this is a spaghetti western/war movie spoof. I tried not to take the movie to seriously. And if you look at it that way it's actually quite funny. The typical Tarintino over the top gore makes it humorous. They scalp every Nazi they kill and the ones they leave alive the carve a swastika on there forehead. There are a couple of Mexican standoffs and some hilarious dialogue from Pitt. The movie was funny but Hans Landa was actually a pretty well crafted character and really was my favorite in the film. You have to see this movie no matter what, but if your a Tarintino fan you should really see it."
"ctomvelu1","7","0","4","22 August 2009"," WWII fantasy
","WWII drama is actually a fantasy about a small group of American Jews who land in Nazi-occupied France for the purpose of killing as many Nazis as possible. Brad Pitt leads this ragtag but deadly group. Director Tarantino breaks up the movie in chapters, which makes it comprehensible. Everything comes to a head at a Paris theater debuting the latest Nazi-made movie, ""Nation's Pride,"" which all the top Nazi brass including Hitler will; be attending. Pitt is hilarious as Lt. Aldo Raine, the Tennessee-born head of the assassins. Most of the cast is European and unknown here, but special mention should be made of Chris Waltz who plays the fictitious Col. Landa. He steals every scene he is in as a flamboyant, cruel and opportunistic SS officer on the hunt for Jews. Also, an actor named Til Schweiger makes quite an impression at a former Nazi who loves to kill Nazis. And he does so with a very big knife. Some film fans may recognize Diane Kruger as a double agent, and in a bit of stunt casting, horror director Eli Roth plays one of the the Basterds. True film buffs will be reminded of THE DIRTY DOZEN, although this long film (153 minutes) is not in the same league with that all-time classic. The music choices are uneven, and occasionally disrupt the film. Gorehounds will certainly enjoy the killings, some of which are accomplished with a Louisville Slugger. A couple of closeup scalpings are fun but hard to watch, and there's an absolutely exquisite moment involving one of Pitt's fingers poking around in a fresh leg wound. A good, not great film, perhaps better viewed in segments when it arrives on DVD."
"chowder1994","9","0","9","21 August 2009"," Decent movie, but not Tarantino's best.
","This film was a classic Tarantino movie, good storyline, good acting, good everything, but something I didn't enjoy was the nonstop subtitles. It may be just me, but I get kind of irritated with subtitles after the first hour. I felt like I was watching a foreign film with American taste, if that makes sense. The pace was kind of slow for my taste as well.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I would recommend this movie to any Tarantino fan, but before watching it, I was told it was the Pulp Fiction of the new generation. I didn't get my mind blown like Tarantino's previous work. Again, this is my own opinion.<br/><br/>But still, it's worth seeing."
"nilent","8","0","7","21 August 2009"," Terribly Terrific Tarantino Treat
","This, for me, is Tarantino's best yet.<br/><br/>The acting, directing and story are so good that the movie didn't really need any of the usual gimmick/games that Tarantino uses to embellish his movies. The substance of the movie was rich and deep enough that the cheap laughs and absurdist humor weren't spoilers so much as amusing distractions.<br/><br/>Tarantino is more than capable of making a straight movie, undiluted with cutsie stylistic tricks, that could knock yer socks off....and this movie proves that point as most of it is indeed, unburdened by gimmickry. <br/><br/>I can't say much about the opening scene without spoiling it....suffice it to say that the drastically extended dramatic suspense was stupendous.<br/><br/>The movie seemed to run about an hour and a half....but was actually wayyyyy longer. Even so, I would have enjoyed seeing another 30 minutes at least.<br/><br/>The brutally crazy massively psychotic violence of war is portrayed in a manner which, while externally graphic, is on occasion, lacking in a certain sense of reality......on the other hand, that's to be expected in a QT film, eh? <br/><br/>Overall, this is a highly entertaining and somewhat distressing movie that may have you contentedly cheering and ""rooting"" for a result that one should normally find revolting and repellent.<br/><br/>Go see it asap; this is one that is best seen on the big screen.....and yes the music and soundtrack are also very nicely done."
"sickeningjar","8","0","8","20 August 2009"," QT shows he can make a good film, but not yet a BRILLIANT one.
","I went into the cinema with fairly low expectations for this film. Given the disappointing previous efforts of Quentin Tarantino, namely Death Proof and Kill Bill, I was resigned to seeing another drawn out, pretentious and muddled film.<br/><br/>Based on what I had experienced in the last three films, I was expecting a horribly jumbled mess of genres, homages and pastiches, or an overlong and suspense-free violence-fest. And I fully expected that ten seconds into the film. I rolled my eyes at the spaghetti western music and the old-time fashion of the opening credits. Music resembling that of Kill Bill, and an opening credits sequence reminiscent of Jackie Brown. Oh dear... I know this is QT's trademark way of starting films. Unfortunately many of his so-called 'trademarks' are borrowed from other, older movies. At this point I was hoping that was all it was: just a routine title sequence. The scene that followed was make-or-break for me. An SS Colonel charmingly and politely, with just the right amount of underlying menace, questions a rural French dairy farmer about a Jewish family. This is ultimately a setup to introduce the two main characters, who will have the biggest connection between each other than any of the other characters in the remainder of the film. I have to say that this scene succeeded in reassuring me that this might just be a return to form for QT. The quiet, reserved and superbly played out scene is shot through with a lot of quiet menace. Perhaps it is because one character is a Nazi Colonel, and anyone born in the last eighty years knows what Nazis are capable of. But in my opinion, it is because the Colonel is played so brilliantly, we know there is a hidden agenda. This guy knows more than he pretends to, and the scene is just waiting to spring it upon us. When it does, it is before the scene outstays its welcome. Much of the film involves creating tension by the implication that one character is sitting on a fact or a revelation which other characters may not suspect, or at least hope they don't know. This had to be my favourite element of this film. Most of the rest we have seen before. Bloodbaths, unusual characters, unusual character traits (a US soldier who takes pleasure in using a baseball bat to dispatch his Nazi foes is particularly dark, as is the mission to collect the scalps of every Nazi soldier killed) are all familiar ground covered on previous QT outings. The quirkiness is new, however. Sometimes it appears to be a spoof, what with the comical Adolf Hitler, who is played as bumbling and forgetful. But it's Hitler, he was evil, so it's okay. The homages to exploitation flicks are still there, but kept to a discreet and welcome minimum. There is very little in the way of genre-swapping, or at least it seems not to do so, perhaps because the whole film is shot through with the same dark humour, that holds it all together. Most moments of comedy are counterpointed by an act of brutal violence, and sometimes vice versa. The overall verdict of this film is that is a more even, better executed effort than the previous films of the last five years. It feels more like an early QT film, and as such, makes for better viewing. There is no doubt that the film is supposed to be viewed light heartedly, but I can't help thinking that it could so easily have done well as a more serious flick. That in mind, I still liked the direction this film went in. A welcome cameo from Mike Myers in prosthetic makeup served to remind the audience that this is, after all, a comedy. All of QT's films are flavoured with a natural comedy, to reflect the comedy of life as well of it's seriousness, but this is his most overtly comical film to date. And it's a good thing, too, because without this, it would be exactly like any film QT has directed, pre-Kill Bill. Ultimately, it's a peak on the chart of QT's output quality, though it's plotted on a chart that has been descending since 2004. This is the kind of film we remember QT doing in the nineties, with a few tweaks. We're not looking at a new Pulp Fiction, however it's not Death Proof either."
"garydanko9","8","0","9","19 August 2009"," Inglorious Basterds GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE!
","I was intrigued to see whether Tarantino could deliver a new and worthy piece. I have literally just returned from the viewing. It is violent and is definitely deserving of its 18 cert. I am not normally a fan of overtly violent movies, however, I found myself drawn into this film and couldn't take my eyes of the screen. <br/><br/>Where i believe Tarantino has improved is that there is not self indulgent narrative. Everything clearly relates to the story line. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and almost gave it a 9, however i wasn't that keen on Brad Pitt. The star of this movie is the guy who plays the ""Jew Hunter"" he is menacing personified.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is definitely Tarantino's best offering since Pulp Fiction."
