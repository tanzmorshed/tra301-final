","Resident Evil: Afterlife attempts to take the series back to basics and delivers a campy action film that has fun with the material. In this chapter Alice searches for Claire and her group of survivors of the zombie apocalypse, which were headed for Alaska looking for the infection free zone Arcadia. Wentworth Miller joins the series and gives a strong performance. Additionally, the over-the-top action scenes are quite impressive, and bring a lot of energy to the film. However, things start to fall apart in the last act as the story goes off in some bizarre directions. Yet for a cheesy horror film, Resident Evil: Afterlife is pretty entertaining."
"urizen-7","1","110","158","7 October 2010"," What once was buried, should have stayed dead
","While I usually refrain from writing reviews, RE: Afterlife was such an excruciating experience to endure, I had to somehow vent my righteous anger. Thus: the review.<br/><br/>While I quite enjoyed the very first Resident Evil movie (except for the CGI showdown), starting with Number two (Apocalypse) the movies went from thrilling, spooky zombie movies to something like a low-budget Zombie-Movie-in-the-Matrix. I say low-budget, because the special effects and action sequences screamed of cheap and shoddy work, the stories were laughable at best, and yet, here comes another entry in a series that should have stayed dead.<br/><br/>To see all of Afterlife's Non-Glory in 3-D, probably made it even worse for me. As much as I like 3-D movies, RE: Afterlife cannot be salvaged by anything at all, short of standing up after the first three minutes and walking out the door. Or maybe urinating on the screen, then walking out the door. Or maybe adding another dimension, time, which would allow me to go back to the beginning of the film and shoot myself repeatedly in the head. <br/><br/>Starting with the first (of many) utterly ridiculous action sequences, dominated by so-bad-it's-funny-in-a-sad-way wire-fighting and wire-wall-jumping, the movie actually manages to go downhill from there, which is somewhat commendable, since I thought it not quite possible to even get any worse.<br/><br/>What follows is an assembly of disjointed, poorly conceived action sequences, way too many slow-motion captures, incoherent story telling, continuity errors that made my teeth hurt, and then you realize that the movie has only been running for thirty minutes, and you ask yourself what you could have done in a previous life to deserve this. <br/><br/>The ""story"", if you want to call it that, is driven by ludicrous plot elements that only exist for the sake of driving a non-existent story ahead, while half of what happens seems to only happen in order to create the need for even more embarrassing zombie-killing action. Or poor attempts at creating some of that Wow-Feeling we all shared when we first entered ""The Matrix"".<br/><br/>As some critic once wrote about the new Star Wars Episodes (I-III), the Resident Evil movies offer great actors the chance for the worst performances of their lives. I am still astounded by the fact that Milla Jovovich has not filed a law suit against the producers for prolonged career murder or violent destruction of reputation.<br/><br/>I honestly cannot find more than two good things about this film, and I actually am an avid fan of the video game series, so seeing some familiar faces, as well as monsters, should have at least appeased my inner nerd-ness, but alas, it wasn't so.<br/><br/>As my final verdict, I will now present the two and only good things in this movie: 1. Ali Larter in wet clothes. 2. Kacey Barnfield in tight clothes.<br/><br/>The rest deserves to be laughed at, tarred, feathered, quartered, strangled, drowned, poisoned, stabbed, clubbed, and then buried in a toxic landfill next to the remains of Uwe Boll."
"alexlee1905","1","46","63","14 December 2010"," Survive in a plane crash?? What were they thinking???
","Damn...I registered IMDb just to review this movie... Could the plot writer make something explainable ?? The story line confused me again and again.<br/><br/>How come Alice survive in that plane crash? She was normal human already! And where is Wesker when Alice leave the crash site? Since when Alice learn to fly? And where is the fuel? Food? Makeup?? The building in LA keep burning for 4 years? The armory has a shaft of something take you to the roof top? Wesker can dodge bullets (ok fine he is a superhuman), but can't dodge the knife? Here comes the most ridiculous part....what kind of self-destruction bomb is that? I mean look at the size, no way it can blast a ship that huge! OK even it is some kind of alien technology, if it was designed to blow the ship, would you mount it on a corridor where everyone can touch? Not even you can touch it, you can just dismount it with ease and dump it like a grenade?? WHAT KIND OF SELF-DESTRUCTION SYSTEM IS IT??? What were they thinking??? Not to mention there is a couple of helicopter there and Claire knew which one Wesker will go aboard! And She knew Wesker will came back after she and Chris punch hundred of holes on Wesker and shut the gate. In conclusion, don't pay to watch this movie, rent it on DVD or watch it online!"
"CrimsonKingLives","3","138","208","11 September 2010"," Did we see the same movie?
","I'll be honest, I went to see this knowing it wouldn't be great. The 3D looked awesome, and I was excited to see Wesker. What I wasn't expecting was a dull, pointless, plot less, horribly-acted cornball ""action"" movie.<br/><br/>Milla has worn out her welcome as a poor-man's Angelina Jolie. I love her, I really do, she's one of my favorite actresses, but this has gone too far. That said...<br/><br/>Without trying to spoil anything, it seems that Paul Anderson had no idea where to go with this sequel, thus throwing everything out from the last film, (I wont go into detail), while shoving small things from the video game in, just to fill time and justify the 'Resident Evil' title. It falls flat, and leaves many of the scenes feeling unneeded and forced.<br/><br/>My MAIN grudge against RE:A is the lack of plot. I do like to see a good mindless action/horror film (Machete and Piranha are on my top 10 list already!), but this film took itself way too seriously, and forgot where the hell it was going at times. Taking a look back at the movie, it seemed like nothing happened throughout the whole 96 minutes! The action scenes, in my opinion, were lame, tame, dull, overdone, and the slow-motion wasn't impressing anyone. It came off, once again, as forced and corny.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of the RE videogames and do nitpick, but at the same time, I've taken the movies for what they are. The first film was great, second meh, third bad, but this one was downright horrible. I'm really not sure I saw the same movie as most of the reviewers here, because what I saw was a flashy, dull, pointless entry in an already dead series. Time to give it a rest Paul.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Afterlife gets a 3/10 *'s"
"rodders81","1","73","113","19 September 2010"," Rather Stick Rusty Pins Into My Eye Balls!!
","I went to the cinema with realistic expectations; however even my with my very low outlook I was shocked by how poor this film was.<br/><br/>The plot was so thin that I honestly feel that it didn't exist. The movie instead was random events of poorly scripted action scenes that at times looked like an 80's cartoon. I am going to list in no particular order the glaring aspects of the movie that exemplify the lack of thought and continuity that went into its creation.<br/><br/>Ammunition: Call me a cynic but surely even futuristic weapons, require to be reloaded or even ammunition? Instead we have full blown automatic fire from handguns that just never run out.<br/><br/>Food: Where does the food come from? Stored? Why is the Hollywood sign still burning 5 years after the end of mankind? Make up: Character been through the 'wars' covered in mud and guts, blink and perfect makeup is reapplied and hair in perfect condition. Miracle!! Fashion: Again would a few survivors, ever have designer trimmed beards, haircuts, clothes in perfect condition? Fuel: A small aircraft that can fly without the requirement for being refuelled.<br/><br/>Ship: Here comes more of my sarcasm: ' I have searched the whole ship and can't find 15,000 people hidden on board, or a giant science lab, or hundreds of fighter planes' .... Oh did you mean check that out that massive door with the umbrella logo on it... well blow me!! Giant Hammer: Random monster with a hammer, comically knocking down a metal door, if you've watched the movie you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>Armoury: Look lets swim underwater, whilst holding our breath for 20mins to an armoury. Luckily for our intrepid characters the weapons and ammunition are stored together in the same room and oh look at the giant air conditioned unit in the ceiling, fantastic security and it leads straight to the roof of the building, magic.<br/><br/>3D effects: I have watched many 3D movies of late and this one was so poor that I think they forgot to make it 3D.<br/><br/>I feel that this movie could have been a five star bonanza except that there was not plot, thought or direction put into the movie. The movie never promised to be a dramatic enterprise with gritty story lines and depth of characters, never less I am sure any self respecting director of any note would have the self pride and integrity to produce something of more quality and reverence. My recommendation, do not watch this movie!!"
"cycoone","4","97","158","30 September 2010"," What happened?
","One of the things I like about the Resident Evil films is that they take the time to fill in the details while holding the audience in suspense.<br/><br/>This forth film completely falls flat on both accounts. Thanks to 2 dimensional characters, an overdone plot, and poor use of foreshadowing, the entire film is predictable. At the same time it doesn't bother to show or explain how certain important plot devices came to be. The movie reeks from it's overuse of Deus ex machina.<br/><br/>The special effects were the only engaging thing about this movie. A lot of it felt like The Matrix in 3D.<br/><br/>One other thing this film did well was continuity from the 3rd film. I like that they didn't spend much time on flashbacks while being faithful to the events of the 3rd film.<br/><br/>All in all my feeling after seeing the movie was that I was expecting more. They could have made it longer, filled in some missing details, developed the plot/characters more, and had a much more enjoyable film."
"thelazydoc","Null","20","28","10 October 2010"," A collection of failures
","Afterlife fails on every level of what makes a decent movie.<br/><br/>Which is probably the most fascinating aspect about it. If one wants to learn how NOT to direct, cut, narrate, explain, suspension curve and visualize a movie, this is where it's all in one place. Adding shallow characters, mediocre acting and an incredibly insulting script does not make it better.<br/><br/>RE used to work as a zombie movie. While this has arguably gotten a bit old, Afterlife is just without purpose. In hindsight it seems to be set up as Alice vs. Wesker or the other way round, but it does not work at all. <br/><br/>1. The action scenes do not follow any logic, create no climax and are mostly pointless. Some style elements such as matrix-slow-motion etc. are placed randomly across the movie without purpose.<br/><br/>--Start: Alice infiltrates Umbrella headquarters, killing the first guards close combat. This is about the only decent scene in the whole movie. Reinforcements are then just annihilated by her superpower-look, along with devastating the entire area. Which makes the initial effort to kill people one-by-one feel pretty much effort. After that, suddenly she has countless clones of herself for support, who conveniently all die in a fire when the complex finally explodes. WHAT THE.. !?!? OK. Let's ignore the script, it just fails.<br/><br/>2. Suspense/Cut: There is no suspense at all. Things happen. Any chance for suspense is muted by the insane script and the incredibly bad cutting, where the scene switches EVERY TIME as soon as anything remotely exciting could be about to develop. <br/><br/>3. Visuals/CGI: Afterlife has no ""feel"" to it. The Umbrella stuff is always brand-new shiny tech and of the outside world we do not see much at all. At the end, when they enter the tanker-like ship, it promised to be some dark grungy place. Instead, EVERYTHING was bright white. Except the helicopters, which were just black. Actually it looked like the CGI budget ran out, but it could also be that silly intentionally. <br/><br/>4. Acting/Characters: Cheesy and generic. Not totally annoying at the best times. Kim Coates wasn't bad in the 2 scenes he got, this is not the type of movie he should be in but he is at least interesting.<br/><br/>I feel this movie was only pieced together lovelessly to generate some new video game sales."
"msb-utils","6","100","167","6 October 2010"," no story, but enjoyable
","I liked this compilation of scenes. I liked the soundtrack; I liked the acting; I liked the settings; I liked the effects. As a game, it works greatly. The movie is a sum of chunks of stories. Most of them are action stories. A few are horror stories. Another few are mystery stories. And none of them are connected to each other. They just share common characters. <br/><br/>Honestly, the plot is just an excuse for great action scenes. And I liked the action scenes. I rate it zero for the story, ten for the technical quality. And I have to admit it: in the end, I liked it as a whole."
"the-timelord-victorious","1","81","134","10 September 2010"," They should've ended it at the third one. Utter trash.
","I've always enjoyed the Resident Evil movies, I know they're far from being Oscar worthy material, but overall they've been entertaining one way or another. The first was great, Apocalypse was alright, Extinction was great, if not on par with the first. Afterlife however, is just awful. <br/><br/>Who the HELL is the Executioner? and who created him? Why is Afterlife full of pointless slow motion shots? Why does Alice never show any emotion at all? Why is she making a video diary for half an hour? Why do the zombies have weird tentacles? Yes, I know that they're from Resident Evil 5 but honestly, it's never explained. Why are they here? Why is Wesker dressed like The Terminator? Where is Jill Valentine? She was credited but I'm positive that she wasn't even in the damn thing. Why does Clare disappear for half an hour? Oh, and probably the most important question of all, who in the right mind hires composers under the name 'TomandAndy' to compose a movie like this?<br/><br/>Also, I love how confident they are about a sequel. They even left the damn thing on a cliffhanger. Probably one of the worst cliffhangers I've ever seen. The only redeeming feature I can actually think of in this garbage is Milla Jovovich and even she isn't on top form. <br/><br/>Overall, probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. Bad acting. Bad writing. Bad dialogue. Utterly pointless. They should've stopped at Extinction."
"ztlfire","1","39","63","22 September 2010"," What did you expect?
","To even begin to describe just how right people were to doubt Mr. Andersons ability to write a script and direct would be a book in itself. His inability to capture the imagination, to remain consistent to his own plot, to develop characters, and a story line that coincides with the overall story, even understanding the term continuity is a feat for Hercules alone - obviously. Mr. Anderson's lack of creativity and possibly suffering from short and long term memory loss is abundantly in effect with this farce he's created. He claimed it would 'pull the audience in' when in truth all it did was make people walk out - and people are usually easily pleased but not from where I was sitting.<br/><br/>Battle field Earth marries matrix and has an affair with ultra Violet the end result is the bastard child he calls Resident Evil Afterlife.<br/><br/>I will pull out just an example of how terrible the plot was by quoting the goof's section and adding a few of my own: (spoiler next) During the final confrontation with Wesker, Chris and Claire enter the scene. Wesker addresses them by NAME and states they ""have become quite an inconvenience"". How, and when did they do this? Chris has been locked up since the outbreak of the virus and Claire had no impact on Weskers operations in this or the last movie WHATSOEVER.<br/><br/>In Andersons mind this was a 'salute' to the fans. THE PROBLEM Mr. Anderson is that when a character has no idea who is who and has NEVER encountered them before the dialog makes absolutely no sense and the 'confrontation' is redundant. Not to mention the entire story is warped. Quite a HUGE thing to escape his mind and I wish it ended there. But the man did not just develop a huge plot hole; the entire movie was nothing but plot holes INSIDE plots holes. I never even knew that was possible until now. <br/><br/>His only focus was the 3D CAMERA with his wife as the 'little piggy'.<br/><br/>Mary-sue is back and is now the living embodiment of an oxymoron (which also isn't possible tech but there you go ) and an utter cliché. She loses her powers but can still leap 20 feet in the air and kick a tray of sharp objects with absolute accuracy, not to mention take blows from GIANT Ax's full on and get up with not even a broken rib let alone a bruise. Oh and there is a stabbing but you'll mistaken it for a tooth pick because it seems even when a blade is run right though the arm of Ms mortal Mary-sue all you get is a GUH! and it's business as usual.<br/><br/>The acting WOODEN and the stunts are ridiculous! Considering it's apparently the real world with no 'jacking into' a massive computer world where basic physics don't apply, it's hard to sell and digest just about most of the stunts. <br/><br/>The OC meets the Resident Evil characters and the movie is one god awful fan fiction. With plenty of WTF moments and FTS, even Micheal Bay would be LHAO as the terribly created explosions and gun shots. Because even gun fire is digitally created badly resembling old Japanese English dubbed movies with the lips moving and the dialog happening a few min later! WHERE DID ALL THAT MONEY GO when making this movie?! the answer: 3D.....3D.....THREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Slow motion thrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeee deeeeeeeeeeeeeee Really Mr. Anderson, if you wanted to molest the camera there are cheaper ways of doing so than getting a production company to cough up millions of dollars, rent you their staff, and devote more minutes to agonizing slow motion scenes (instead of developing THE ACTUAL STORY) - and cheat people out of their hard earned money which we desperately need in these hard times.<br/><br/>SHAME ON YOU.<br/><br/>To those readers who want a good time SAVE YOUR MONEY for marvel and DC because Capcom has seriously misjudged Andersons professional integrity and ability to deliver the only thing he's achieved is proving his doubters right- he is a hack. His work is a drop out middle schoolers work. Your money and your time will be greatly wasted. Those positive reviews are beyond misleading. They paint a picture of a movie that never happened. Or are written by EXTREMELY generous people or people with low expectations and just wanted to get out of their houses."

","Fourth spectacular , action-packed and stirring installment of the ¨Resident Evil series¨ , adapted from the video games characters produced by Hiroyuki Kobayashi . Yet another noisy film rendered from a video game which never gets as eerie as a Zombie picture should . Umbrella Corp (The Hive) is the front for some genetics operations and a secret military tech . The deadly virus has decimated the world, exception a little zone in Alaska where live people no-infected . Years later , one time Racoon was destroyed , the Umbrella corporation led by ambitious Dr. Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) continues his weird experiments with the deadly T-virus . The deadly virus has been released and reanimated the dead , the Zombies spread the epidemic and those exposed to cruel bite suffer a complete transformation turning into meat-eating sickos . Alice (Milla Jovovich) is attempting to survive , and goes to Alaska , traveling throughout ice desert . While still out to destroy the evil Umbrella Corporation , Alice flies with Claire (Ali Larter) to Los Angeles, where she sees a group of survivors on the roof of a prison asking for help and under siege of the undead . Alice finds new mysterious survivors (Kim Coates , Sergio Peris Mencheta , Boris Kodjoe and Wentworth Miller) at a building in L.A . Alice joins a group of survivors and they must confront carnivorous hordes of zombies starving of human flesh and an evil corporation chief who creates the most horrifying creatures ever made . The survivor group is surrounded , facing the world destruction by deadly epidemic . The misfit bunch wants to relocate to the suspicious but supposedly unharmed safe haven known only as Arcadia.<br/><br/>Unstopped-action gore-feast that provides for high-octane escapist amusement with some eye-catching visuals and pulsing soundtrack . This exciting picture contains thrills, chills , action-filled with fierce combats and lots of gore and guts. The horror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized. This sequel takes more , more approach , more fights , more blood and gore . The film turns out to be a crossover between 'the nuclear apocalypse of Mad Max 2', the 'George A Romero's Zombies', 'Zack Snyder's Dawn of the dead' and genetic experiments from 'Sigourney Wever-Ripley in Alien saga' and the monsters from ¨Blade¨ and ¨Lord of Rings¨. Of course, the film takes ideas from former parts as 'Resident evil'(2002, Paul W. Anderson, here also producer , director and screenwriter) and 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' (2004,Alexander Witt) . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with scary and amazing frames. It's predictable but we have seen the previous chapters but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting from the action-women, Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. The flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods, plenty of screams, shocks and tension . The make-up assistants create a truly horrible zombie cannibals . Horrifying and astonishing images about apocalyptic events with deserted and destroyed cities, such as the fantastic scenarios in Los Angeles totally inhabited by flesh-munchies creatures . Cool,luminous cinematography using Steadicam by Glen MacPherson and haunting,pulsing Techno-musical score by Tomandandy .The motion picture is regularly directed but with startling visual style by Paul W Anderson.<br/><br/>The complete saga is formed by the following films : ¨Resident evil¨ by Paul W Anderson with Milla , Eric Mabius , Michelle Rodriguez , James Purefoy , Colin Salmon ; this is the best , dealing with a group of containment specialists are sent in and have to fight employees who have been contaminated , while A.I. computer instigates a series of defensive measures to contain the virus . It's followed by ¨Resident evil II : Apocalypse¨ by Alexander Witt with Jared Harris , Iain Glen , Oded Fehr , Sienna Guillory . And ¨Resident evil III¨ by Russell Mulcahy with Ali Larter, Ashanti , Mike Epps , Oded Fehr and of course Milla Jovovich."

Mila Ill always loved you...ever since when you spoke the word 'multipass' but this....bad! To write a review requires 10 lines but... but I might have to stretch it with nothingness...like the movie. The bad guy looks like 'agent Smith' from the Matrix, dodges the bullets the same way and pretty much uses the same lines. The scenes on the ship looks fake. The storyline is weak and the best acting comes from on of the infected standing on the roof 3rd row and just having his head blown off when trying to say his lines...sorry...Im gutted!

"p-stepien","6","25","41","6 January 2011"," Patchwork filmmaking
","Alice (the eternal Mila Jovovich) is back and in multiple copies. Her prime target is the Umbrella Corporation and the now T-virus enhanced Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts). After a full frontal attack the Umbrella base is left destroyed, but the whole batch of Alice clones get blown sky-high, when Wesker manages to fly away unscathed and detonate the plant. Conveniently for the movie the original Alice survives unscathed as a castaway on-board the plane. During a skirmish with Wesker Alice gets injected with a antidote, that turns her back to being human (but somehow she still manages to survive a terrible plane crash unharmed and keeps her over-the-top fighting abilities largely intact). With Wesker dead and Umbrella disposed of Alice returns to the States to search of her friends, who left for sanctuary in Alaska, only to disappear in mysterious circumstances.<br/><br/>In general a much improved instalment of the series and if anything the whole series remains enjoyable, if uninventive. In this part Anderson actually outdoes himself and instead of thinking up something original he starts borrowing scenes from other movies. Wesker looks and fights like Neo's twin brother, the new zombies bring to mind ""Blade 2"", whilst The Executioner has a disturbing familiarity to Pyramid Head of the Silent Hill franchise. Nonetheless some of the scenes are very memorable with the combat with The Executioner a real highlight for the movie (especially given the abrupt ending of the final fight).<br/><br/>There may be a bit too many generic elements with this movie, but that has never stopped the franchise from being mindless slash-em-up fun. Even if a somewhat weakly scripted one. Also Alice remains a very likable heroine, so no matter how bad the script if she gets proper screen time and a couple of intriguing fights, than the movie just never seems to feel like a waste of time."

","I'm a huge fan of Milla Jovovich and the Resident Evil movies. The last one - ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" - I thought was a great movie and the best in the series so far.<br/><br/>So I had to see this latest installment, what a disappointing and mediocre movie it turned out to be. The 3D was so fuzzy and distracting throughout the film but even if it hadn't been in fuzzy 3D it still was badly directed and poorly written, with hardly any of the signature action scenes, and all the actors were very pitiable and amateurish, with an exceptionally lame lead villain. Most of the action was blah and boring, in routine slow mo cuts. Don't go to see this movie if you want good or creative action scenes or an interesting story.<br/><br/>Most of the actors made no impression whatsoever, with the exception of Milla and Wentworth Miller of ""Prison Break"" fame. And even Wentworth Miller was given little to do, he didn't have but a handful of lines in the movie and it was a waste of his considerable talent. I really hope that he does better movies and roles in the future. I think he could become a major movie star, but not with appearing in crappy movies like this.<br/><br/>I am giving it a generous 5 rating, and that is from a fans perspective. If I wasn't a fan I would give this movie a 3.<br/><br/>Please let the next Resident Evil have a different director than this sub par effort had, and please let it not be in horrifying 3D."
"springsunnywinter","10","174","353","5 September 2010"," Resident Evil: Full of Life
","I am a huge fan of the video game series; I've played & completed every Resident Evil game there is and I have 100% trophies of Resident Evil 5.<br/><br/>I loved the previous Resident Evil movie trilogy although many fans were disappointed by them because it wasn't to close to the games and Alice is the main character who isn't in any game. The filmmakers can't please everyone when it comes to movies based on video games because if the movie is very similar to the game then people will say that ""What is the point of the movie when it is just as same as the game?"" but if it is very different then people will complain that it is not related to the game in any way, shape or form. What Paul W.S Anderson has done is created an original story and had the setting of the game in the first film & in this one as well. Which is the best thing to do and he has proved that he is a terrific writer & director, he may not be the best filmmaker ever but he does know how to make good movies based on games and he is one of my favourite directors. His two movies Mortal Kombat & Resident Evil are both the best video game adaptations to date.<br/><br/>The plot of Resident Evil: Afterlife is that it takes place after Extinction and Alice is continuing to look for survivors in world that has been infected by T-Virus that has turned into flesh eating zombies plus she wants to take revenge on Albert Wesker and this time she if fully prepared with her clones, telekinetic powers and awesome weapons. Fighting Wesker isn't an easy task because he is superhuman himself just like in Resident Evil 5. This instalment is very close to the games and particularly Resident Evil Code Veronica & Resident Evil 5. Those who have played the 2 games will get flashbacks while watching the movie.<br/><br/>This was the most anticipated film for me this year and it absolutely did not disappoint me at all. I loved every minute of it right from start to end. Resident Evil: Afterlife was relentlessly entertaining, exiting and a perfect popcorn movie at the cinema kind. The movie had a great blend of action, horror, sci-fi and thriller. This one had a much more post-apocalyptic look than in extinction and has amazing special & visual effects in just in a $60 million budget. The monsters were just like in Resident Evil 5, e.g. the zombies look like the majini's with their predator like mouth, the executioner and the dogs that split their heads open with teeth inside it. So it was fascinating to see that.<br/><br/>The cast was great, Milla needs no introduction & is fantastic just like always and she is improving in acting, stunts and she doesn't struggle to get the job done because she can do it. Shawn Roberts was a much better Albert Wesker than Jason O'Mara in Extinction.<br/><br/>Overall it's not an Oscar winning kind movie & it doesn't need to be. It's a movie for the fans not for critics so ignore their negative reviews but I had a really good time watching it since I am a fan and check it out if you're looking for an entertaining movie and it's a must see if you are a Resident Evil fan."
"cruise01","8","3","3","10 April 2020"," Action packed, loud, and an awesome fourth installment.
","Resident Evil: Afterlife (4 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>The fourth film does deliver a lot of action, visuals, and an awesome music score by Tomandandy. The story continues after the third movie. With Alice attacking an Umbrella lab. With an exciting explosive sequence. The film has a lot of action to make this entertaining. With faster mutated zombies. A monster called Axeman. Which had an awesome sequence with Alice and Claire fighting the axeman. And Wesker being the main villain was a fun add on. Fans of the game will see a similiar fight scene from one of the games.<br/><br/>The movie is fast paced. Loud. And non stop exciting. And intense with the music score. I did find the movie script to be cheesy with dialogue and some action scenes. There is a lot of slow mo action scenes which was trying to deliver an awesome 3D experience. The cinematography is great. Paul Anderson did a great job in delivering the action sequences. And i cant wait to see where it goes next. The ending ends in a cliffhanger. And a fun cameo in a mid credit scene."

","Alice was her usual badass in this installment in the resident evil franchise. The objective should never be to go in with high expectations, it's all about over the top action with a sprinkling of plot. This fits the bill. The storyline was a bit disappointing because it doesn't have much of a beginning or end, it all just kind of happens. Overall decent acting, good cinematography and zombie action.

","I saw Resident Evil when it got out back in 2002, and was impressed by the tension and action and, by Milla Jovovich, of course.Although flawed, the second installment of the franchise found more room to expand to than i could've ever imagined.And though it was logical, the third one provided the goods as well with more action and a bigger picture, as well.<br/><br/>Now, visiting a pre-screening of ""a movie"", everything would've been perfect, if the movie was one of Zack Snyder's upcoming efforts, or Milla/Anderson's new Resident Evil.And boy, was i happy to know it was one of my most anticipated movies this year.<br/><br/>Now, Alice is back, once again.I wasn't sure what to expect, because the series were strong and solid so far, but it isn't easy to keep up the good pace.So, at first, i thought it wasn't going to be easy to match the prequels, especially the scale of the last installment.<br/><br/>But then, the news about the 3D came around, and followed by the fusion system technology announcement, the infamous Cameron creation, that will be used almost ruthlessly often in the future, it was all clear.I saw it getting better and better, the development of the movie was incredible lately and, though the trailer wasn't saying much, i was kind of hoping to cover the best parts, and i luckily hoped right and this was the best part-i wasn't expecting even half of the action and battle sequences i saw.<br/><br/>And i must say, that the cast is the best, that could've been assembled.Ali Larter is great, she's grown so much to the series, that fits her perfectly well.Wenthwort Miller is cool, a little bit Scofield-like, but that's normal.After all, he was great as a con.The only thing i missed was Oded Fehr, who has portrayed a very likable and convincing character in the 2-nd and 3-rd installments.<br/><br/>And, surprisingly, the script had more incommon with the videogames than the prequels had.I mean, that's a fresh take, and the 3D makes it better.This is probably the best 3D since How to Train Your Dragon was around, and as a horror/action movie-the best of it's kind.Just to compare, the technology was way better than the 3D, used in the last ""Destination"" installment and, as well, better then ""Valentine's Day"" remake.And those movies made a lot of profits at the Box Office.<br/><br/>And to add something up-i red a review, claiming that the movie is a ""Matrix"" rip-off.So my advice is this-don't listen to those claims-first of all, there were some stunts, looking very similar to a couple, featured in ""The Matrix"", but the script led very logically to them, and this isn't a trademark for ""The Matrix"".People dodging bullets or walking on walls-wow i've seen this somewhere else-oh yes, in, at least 2 or 3 movies.Second of all, those scenes are very sane and surely not even looking close to those, in the Wachovski movie, instead being shot in an entirely different style.It's like claiming that a car, plane or train explosion is a trademark for some movie.And those people should admit, that The Matrix is also copying a couple of movies.And those movies are Alex Proyas's ""Dark City"" and Germany's ""Welt am Draht"".So don't give the audience false infos.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing was the way Anderson shot the movie-in entirely different style from the previous ones.This new moves are definitely a change in direction for Anderson as a director, a fresh and surely an epic one.<br/><br/>So expect ""Afterlife"" to surpass the domestic achievements of its predecessors, because, aside from the fusion tech and the hype surrounding it's release, the movie has something the above-mentioned movies don't-a convincing lead.Because Milla Jovovich sets the mark for lead female characters in all movies to come, and she's fantastic-Alice's return and the role that fits Milla Jovovich the most.<br/><br/>Fantastic movie for fans, a real peak in it's genre.<br/><br/>And one of the best movies of its kind this year.<br/><br/>My rate:A deserved 10/10 for Milla & co."

They introduce a new star cast who were familiar from TV shows etc. and they also did a great job. Also don't storm out of theaters right after the credits, stay for few minutes and see a MAJOR clue. Milla Jovovich yet again surprises us with her charismatic hardcore action. I cannot imagine anyone else for the role of Alice besides her. Ali Larter didn't had a major role but she also kicked butt! And offcourse if you like Zombies, this one has more than the previous parts. The soundtracks of the movie were breath-taking. They literally gave me goosebumps! I'm just not happy that it wasn't long enough. I was hoping for it to be at least 120mins but it was instead 90mins but I guess they are saving it for the next chapter. And yes believe me there will be a next one!

","where did it all go wrong? This was not the best game adaption to begin with, for me silent hill is still the closest game to movie effort.

Maybe that was the problem, expectation.<br/><br/>I have read some other reviews on this site and I am puzzled, maybe I missed the point or I'm being to hard on the film? But for me the games and the previous 3 films had all being about atmosphere: this has none at all. It just rambled along until the next ""slow-motion just for the sake of it"" scene, of which there are a lot (id guess 20mins of the film is slow motion).<br/><br/>I just don't know what happened to the series, as I said I am a huge fan of both the games and the films, barred this one of course, and can't understand how people can be so happy with this poor rip off of a film. There are so many direct rip off bits from the matrix, the obvious ones being the trinity style jump out the window from the trailer and even Wesker looks and moves like an agent.<br/><br/>But this said, the easiest job in the world is being a critic.

But that doesn't mean I want to see an exact replica of the games. There's no suspense, you know who's going to live and die. I mean if I wanted an exact shot-for-shot Resident Evil adaptation, I would play the game! Is this film dumb? Yes. It's a guilty pleasure. And I'm fine with that. I love seeing gorgeous women kick ass, I love seeing ridiculous gore, I love being smart enough to see that this movie is NOT supposed to be Oscar-worthy. If anything this film was more fun than the previous installments, there was humor, great action, and hot chicks. Seriously folks, you should have figured this whole film series out after the second one. Don't come in with high expectations. Go with a group of friends and have a good time.

"Troy_Campbell","6","29","55","23 October 2010"," Mindless fun.
","This fourth Resident Evil instalment was only ever going to be worth seeing if it featured lots of amusing gore and entertaining action scenes that utilised the third dimension successfully. Evidently, director Anderson must've known this too, because nary a second is wasted on anything else. From the get go we're embroiled in a mass raid on Umbrella's high-tech underground headquarters by dozens of Alice replicates. It's Matrix-y slick, features a massive body count and is a great way to kick off proceedings, even if the CGI is occasionally substandard.<br/><br/>The remainder of the film becomes grubbier once it relocates to an abandoned maximum security prison surrounded by thousands of the ""infected"". Alice, and the ragtag bunch of Los Angeleno's she meets in the jail, encounter blood-thirsty zombies left, right and centre with murderous glee. The finest sequence on offer comes thanks to the inexplicably nonsensical inclusion of an unnamed 10ft creature with a mammoth axe-like weapon, who was apparently only introduced so we could witness its gruesome demise. With rain-drenched slow motion and heart pounding music, watching Alice and Claire despatch of this demented beast is a thrill.<br/><br/>To mention other dispensable elements of this movie – you know, acting, character development, dialogue, plot plausibility, etc – would be redundant for two reasons, (a) because your enjoyment of Afterlife can be measured wholly on your reaction to the above couple of paragraphs and (b) we all know that the aforementioned filmic elements will be close to non-existent anyhow.<br/><br/>Mindless fun.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"
"evilresident097","6","18","33","9 August 2011"," Eh, it's got its moments.
","Plot: As Alice (Milla Jovovich) continues her fight against the nefarious Umbrella Corporation, she meets up with a group of survivors in Los Angeles, who are trying to reach the safe haven known as Arcadia.<br/><br/>So far, here's how the series has done, in my opinion: the first was great, the second was horrible, and the third, though somewhat laughable, was still entertaining. After seeing this one though, I think the series is starting to go downhill again. The movie delivers basically what you could expect: tons of zombie-killing action, some cardboard cutout characters, and a useless story. Afterlife succeeds in all of this.<br/><br/>Aside from the lead performance by Jovovich, I could hardly care less for any of the other actors. One of the unfortunately bad performances actually goes to Wentworth Miller, who played an agonizingly hollow Chris Redfield. And the story needed a complete re-do, because it was almost pointless. One example is the use of the Executioner from the game series. Though I thought his fight with Alice and Claire was cool, I was completely puzzled as to what his purpose in the movie was.<br/><br/>It does do well in the action sequences, including an awesome, though short, standoff on a rooftop. But some of the action is overdrawn thanks to the ridiculously large amount of slow-motion. If they ran the movie without slow-mo, I bet the movie would lose half of its running time. XD I also liked the soundtrack by media boys tomandandy and the film's use of 3D really helped during some of the more intense moments.<br/><br/>Overall it does have its perks and the 3D's good, but this is nothing more than a one-trick pony. Believe me; I'm a big fan of the games, and even I was disappointed."
"wacjam","1","31","62","13 September 2010"," Where were the Zombies???
","For me personally this movie was a major disappointment. I consider myself a fan of all things Zombie. Being such I believe Zombie movies should include ""Zombies"" as a main part of the film. Unfortunately in this movie the Zombies were used basically as a morbid backdrop at best.<br/><br/>Resident Evil Afterlife was more about Annie's ongoing battle with the Umbrella Corporation and its waves and waves of armed guards. It began looking like a cheap rip-off of the Matrix trilogy from years gone by. Even their new Umbrella Corp. ""bad guy"" seems to be invincible like the Agents in the Matrix.<br/><br/>The Zombies themselves (although true to the game) have taken on a new squid faced appearance turning their looks into something more like a bastard child of Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean) apposed to a traditional Zombie.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a true representation of the video game you'll probably be pleased with this movie, but if you are looking for a great Zombie flick you just might end up being as disappointed as I was.<br/><br/>I guess I'll have to wait for World War Z for my next Zombie fix... I just hope it turns out better than Afterlife did."
"WerewolfWinters","1","31","62","11 September 2010"," From a Resident Evil Gamer's Point of View...
","Don't waste your money. It's a good movie ONLY if you haven't played the games. Here's why it angered me;<br/><br/>They messed up Wesker's virus. They claim he's infected by the T-virus and than make him have ""symptoms"" from the Majini parasite from RE5 game. And even then, it's wrong. His virus is the Progenitor virus - which isn't the same as the T-virus or the parasite that make the Majini. Not only that, the Plagas that is used to make the Majini often spurts out of the infected one's mouth, which they had Wesker do TWICE. They also had him crazy enough to foolishly believe that if he ""ingested"" Alice's flesh (who was the only one to perfectly bond with the T-virus) he would gain control over his own virus. Wesker is crazy- smart, but he's not crazy enough to go cannibal (though he is crazy enough to believe he is God).<br/><br/>The Cerberus are also infected by the same parasite that make the Majini (Type 2 or Type 3 Plagas). This is not correct - as the Cerberus enemy are T-virus infected dogs - not Plagas-infected dogs.<br/><br/>Alice was turned back into a human by Wesker injecting antibodies to the T-virus into her and she's still Super-God moder throughout the movie. (But her clones were all killed within the first 10 minutes, so that made me happy).<br/><br/>Claire gets one AWEsome fight scene in the entire movie, and than Alice usurps her by finishing off the Executioner.<br/><br/>They stole a scene DIRECTLY OUT OF RE5 and replaced Sheva with Claire. Here's that scene (minus the conversation - starting from 0:17-1:20): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNs0pF5iCVo And it should be noted, that while that scene was going on, Alice was just STANDING THERE, afraid of the two Cerberus, even though in the first movie she managed to kick one in the face LONG BEFORE SHE WAS EVEN INFECTED.<br/><br/>They also made the P30 devices, used to control people, on K-mart and Claire ridiculously easy to tear off while in RE5 it takes forever to rip it off of Jill. Not to mention they added ""memory loss"" as a symptom of that device - which is also incorrect.<br/><br/>Also, the zombies from previous installments of this movie franchise have suddenly evolved into the Majini from RE5. Zombies are beings infected by a VIRUS while Majini are beings that host a PARASITE. The virus does not mutate or evolve into a parasite, thus this is incorrect as well.<br/><br/>I can't say anything on the 3D, since I tend to avoid them because I can't get contacts in my eyes and I ENJOY seeing the movie clearly.... and it's hard as high heck to get the 3D glasses over prescription glasses anyways...<br/><br/>The soundtrack was iffy to me, I liked the music but not for the movie and the action scenes. Not to mention the needless amount of slow motion scenes that were, as I've seen posted around here, used only to further show off the 3D effects. Speaking of action scenes there were only a handful of them and when a character died it was often too quick to see much gore or it was off-screen, which does not make for a good horror genre film like the Resident Evil movies are SUPPOSED to be.<br/><br/>Many of the video game characters that were copied over from the games weren't played through right. There was an emotional distance between Chris and his sister Claire even though in the games, Claire was caught in Raccoon City because she was searching for her brother Chris, while Chris went running off to Antarctica to save his little sister when she needed it (though Claire had amnesia at the time, so her being emotionally distant is understandable). Albert Wesker's name was never once mentioned, either - so only those who are familiar with Resident Evil's big bad via video games would instantly know who he is.<br/><br/>In fact, I'm convinced the only reason they added Wesker into the movie was so they did not have to create a big bad villain of their own, as Wesker is one of the most notable villains of all time, even ranking in Game Informer's Top 10 Most Notable Villains in the past. This shows lack of thinking and creativity on their part - not to mention all the flaws and mistakes with the information that come directly out of the game's franchise (as noted above) - which leads me to believe that Paul W.S. Anderson was lying when he claimed to be a Resident Evil fan.... or they just had some random intern with an IQ of 10 play the games and take notes for them...<br/><br/>It would just be easier and a much happier time for everyone to buy all the Resident Evil games and make a night out of it. Get the Playstations/XBOX 360 and GameCube/Wii hooked up and go to town on some zombies. While the games themselves have flaws it's much easier to understand than that plot-less movie that is Afterlife not to mention I've played each game several times through and some parts STILL make me jump."

","I wouldn't given this movie a 10 by myself but since some people harshly give this a 1 or a 2, I'm giving it 10 to balance out.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that this movie doesn't deserve a 1 or 2-star rating from some air heads. Yes, the story didn't make much sense but it's plausible and it's probably the best Paul can make out of his previous films (unless he wants to head in a new direction with no Alice which wouldn't be so Resident Evil anymore). Watch it for its 3D action without paying much attention to the story itself. Maybe you need to be a ""guy"" who plays RE games to enjoy this movie Lol. If you haven't watched the previous films, there's no point in seeing this one.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie was its score. Tomandandy did such a great job. It was very very Resident Evil. From the start of the intro score, I was hooked. I bought the soundtrack as soon as I got home. ""Tokyo"", ""Los Angeles"", and ""Flying"" are my favorite tracks.<br/><br/>Original Resident Evil is still the best. Afterlife is a lot better than Apocalypse and Extinction though. I agree there isn't so much to the story itself or anybody who isn't familiar with the series will enjoy this movie. But it shouldn't be all the reasons to give this movie a 1 star rating. That is just wrong. By the way, it is implied that this movie is a sequel to its previous films. $%@# those people who gave it a 1 because they don't get the story.<br/><br/>There are movies I enjoy watching for story and there are movies I watch for pure ""cool"" action. This movie is meant for action and 3D graphics and, man, you get the best of em! Milla was so worn out in Extinction. I can't believe how she managed to get her hotness back in this movie. Shawn Robert was probably my favorite character although he has too unusual ""evil"" powers. I didn't see the point of the dogs splitting up but it was cool! The dude with the big hammer was cool but unusually big to be a usual zombie. I'm pretty sure there isn't a person that big. like 15 feet? what the hell?

","Before I begin I'd like to preface this review with some background on my taste in movies. It isn't sophisticated, it isn't special, it's actually pretty average. I enjoy action films just as much as the next guy. Sit me down in front of a mediocre action film like Wanted, Ninja Assassin, Death Race, or Crank 2 and I'll enjoy killing a couple of hours without a single complaint. Do they have flaws? Sure. Do they have occasional stereotypes? Of course. Are the stories that great? Of course not. But that's all beside the point, the movies are all meant to be enjoyed for the carnage that people enjoy in any action film.<br/><br/>Having said that, I'd like to talk about Resident Evil: Afterlife. This movie absorbs every bad stereotype from every bad action movie ever and mashes it all together into one. Scenes that make no sense (a totally normal human being walking away from a plane crashing into a mountain at hundreds of miles an hour), fighting that blatantly rips off other movies (the opening fight scene looked like a recreation of the lobby fight in The Matrix), and insanely stupid transitions between scenes (Claire magically has showered, put on makeup, and found clothing before they get in the plane?).<br/><br/>There is so much wrong with this movie I cant even fully explain it words.

The creators used slow motion and made RE:A look like Matrix in some scenes.<br/><br/>All the actors tried their best to make characters believable.<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich proves one more time that the role of Alice fits her the most and establishes herself as one of the biggest female action stars.<br/><br/>Ali Larter plays Claire Redfield again and Wentworth Miller is her big brother Chris Redfield. I wish there had been more of them in the movie but the game fans will be pleased anyway to see them in action.<br/><br/>However, the brightest star of this movie is Shawn Roberts. Every time he shows up on the screen as the main antagonist Albert Wesker he steals the scene. Wesker is sexy as hell and totally bad-ass, I can't think of anyone who could have played this character better.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this movie 9 is a bit disappointing ending - it leaves guessing what's going to happen next. On the other hand, it suggests that there will be fifth part and we can hope it's going to be even better than the fourth.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a candy for both RE and action fans. The fight scenes will leave you amused. If you're going to see this film, do yourself a favor and see it in theater in 3D - that's the way it's meant to be seen.

If you have not seen previous instalments, it may be a little confusing, but will still enjoy it as the start explains the story very shortly."

","I recently got a chance to watch Resident Evil: Afterlife with a couple of friends at a local theatre. The first three movies didn't give me that much to expect for the fourth installment, either way, I was very excited. I came out completely blown away. It was high octane thrilling action at its best.<br/><br/>Some movies (e.g. Airbender) used the magic of 3D to great waste. But to tell you, Resident Evil 4 was absolutely amazing in 3D and surround sound. Never before had I got to witness Milla Jovovich blowing zombies away in 3D. It was a whole new experience and the first of its genre to be in 3D. I thought it was used amazingly.<br/><br/>There were many jump scares which I didn't mind, the 4 mouthed zombie's looked awesome and the normal zombie's look also very freaky in 3D as well as the Axeman whose feet shaked the very floor of the theater. But the best scene for me was definitely the final battle with Wesker, complete with suspenseful rock music accompanied in which accompanied the epic battle. We've been waiting for almost 3 movies to see his head blown out into bits by Jovovich. I'll leave you to see yourself if he makes it out alive.<br/><br/>Overall it was a great movie, not for kids, so do yourself a wonderful favour, run to your local theater and buy yourself a ticket for Resident Evil: Afterlife in 3D.<br/><br/>P.S. Stay a few minutes into the credits. Video game fans wont be disappointed"
"Ziya90","1","26","54","10 September 2010"," An unconfirmed joke
","Resident Evil Afterlife is a 3D holiday ride, but it suffers from some serious problems especially like Apocalypse. Firstly, the battle between zombies and Alice's team is not the center of the story (we see them in two three scenes maximum) Secondly, I had not expected Shakespearan dialogs, character studies, a Kubrick-like direction or Tarantino-like camera work, but like the other sequels, cinematically, all we have are showy shots and showy slow motions. Really doesn't entertainment cinema need masterful story telling? artistic styles? developed characters and powerful scripts? If you expect more than entertainment (for example a well written script or well direction), keep your expectations very low. Paul W.S. Anderson has potential, he can do much more! (despite he disappointed some of his fans by Alien vs. Predator) In the fourth sequel, he takes the helm, he is back as the director, but this time, he is not different from the directors of the previous sequels. Thirdly, haven't the trend of The Matrix passed already? The opening sequence is like an imitation of The Matrix trilogy and there is even a Agent Smith like guy with sun glasses who is able to dodge the bullets which leave trace in the air! Can there be a bigger joke than this? By the way, more than one Alice was not a good idea, if you ask me, but the movie leaves that at the beginning luckily. This is not a R rated zombie movie (7+), so it is mildly bloody and mildly violent. May be that's why the movie's focus is not zombie human combat, instead, we watch some Matrix-like action! It is weird that the first movie is not liked even by some fans, but The first Resident Evil was subtle, simple and solid (direction and script both) Some scenes were unforgettable, remarkable, the atmosphere and make up were effective, but Anderson does not do it again. The main villain is like another ridiculous joke, in fact, it was like one of the things (difficulties) that confronts Alice rather than a real villain. Were the mutant dogs again necessary?, what was the point of those experimental people? In all the sequels, there is a guy who turns into a disgusting monster etc. The best scene of the movie personally was the scene with the giant hatchet, but also it was the most meaningless scene of the movie, who is that executioner-like thing? he works for who? what is the aim of him? Except the opening sequence, almost till the second half, I can say that there is no action, but this does not mean boring. It is a great pleasure to see Milla Jovovich as Alice on the screen again, one of my favorite actresses, I am not a 3D expert, but 3D was completely satisfying (despite I closed my eyes at the attacking dog moments) but no more than that, but it seems that children, some teens and the incorrigible fans will love this movie too."
"raqoon","10","25","52","13 September 2010"," If you go and watch this movie, you should already be expecting what you're going to get.
","By now people should already know that when you go see a resident evil movie there is going to be shooting, some major ass kicking, glorious explosions (especially the Tokyo one in Afterlife stands out), monsters, zombies, cheesy dialog (which in my opinion only ads to greatness of this series) and of course, the gorgeous miss Jovovich. Also in this movie franchise.. a lot of times we are shown stuff that is explained a lot later.. maybe even two movies later. Like the Majinis and the Executioner, who show up in L.A. for no reason.. Maybe we'll find out in the fifth installment.<br/><br/>Let me just say that i am a BIG fan of the RE games, especially 4 and 5, which have taken another direction with the storyline (for the better), but i also like the movies. I'm that kind of a person who enjoys all aspects of movies, music, art and almost everything else in life. I look at, listen to and watch any genre you throw at me, as long as the product is good in its own way. If you are like me, you're going to enjoy this movie even if you aren't an action fan.. oh and definitely see it in 3D.<br/><br/>GL"
"frogpole70","1","13","24","16 September 2010"," Anderson plumbs new directing depths!
","I have to admit that I didn't expect much out of this movie; it had two outstanding marks against it before the film even started to roll: it was based on a video game (and such films are rarely good) and the director is well known for shoddy work!<br/><br/>This is a film of competitions. The script and story compete to be the most unbelievable, erratic and most non-existent while the actors compete to see who can deliver the few words they have in the blandest, most monotone way. Seriously - in many scenes the actors stare off into the distance (often in different directions) delivering stilted and cringe-worthy speeches in hoarse whispers.<br/><br/>But the film isn't just that! Oh no, we also have some shockingly bad fight sequences which pause many, many, many times so that something can fly at the screen in slow motion or so we can fully appreciate these low quality, clichÃ©d ""Matrix"" effects. The overall feel is that the fights have been created by a art student who has seen The Matrix too many times, but has only had three days to film, edit and market the whole thing! For me, this film had no redeeming qualities at all."
"p-vent87","1","16","31","19 September 2010"," Paul Anderson shows again he can turn Pure Gold into Feces!
","The so called Resident Evil movies are mislabeled, they're not Resident Evil, they're just generic zombie movies with Resident Evil slapped across the title, I still don't understand how Capcom allowed the movies to carry the popular Resident Evil name, they never stick to the story, it has an amazing number of errors which include 98% of the movie being not true to the actual story found in the games.<br/><br/>In a Nutshell, disappointing. The movie was made into a damn action film all over, there's no suspense just incredibly cheesy action scenes and weak tension, this is where I say Paul Anderson is an absolute idiot.<br/><br/>The people who like the movie series have obviously never played the game or they have played the game but never got around knowing the story well, if you did you wouldn't be asking yourself throughout the movie ""what the hell am I watching?!"" I give it a 1/10 mainly because it doesn't stick to the real story AT ALL, there's ZERO suspense, too many cheesy action and effects **I can't emphasize more how cheesy this movie is** and last but not least it's not a survival horror movie, it's just a stupid action movie with zombies in it... quite frankly Night of the Living Dead deserves more to be called Resident Evil."
"xpunk_rock_poetx","3","16","31","11 September 2010"," The worst movie I've seen in 2010 so far...
","I'm not sure where to start when it comes to ""Resident Evil : Afterlife"", I went into this film totally unaware what it was about beyond it was the next Resident Evil film, I had avoided trailers and spoilers and sneak peeks successfully hoping that it would be a solid addition to the franchise, but at the same time was worried it would be more of what the third one served up, to my surprise the situation was much more dire as this is hands down the worse movie of the franchise thus far.<br/><br/>""Resident Evil : Afterlife"" moves at such a slow and uninteresting pace that by the time you even see a ""zombie"" you are half asleep and wondering if you have been duped into a zombie less world. Don't fret this is not the case there are in fact billions and billions of flesh eating horde roaming the streets of the world, but you won't get to see many of them because the only time their interjected into the main story arch is when they need to dispose of a unneeded character, always in a sudden and unimaginative fashion and to the shock of myself with very little gore, but I will go into that later on in this review.<br/><br/>The story felt thrown together and just void of any effort, with so many cases of ""six months later"","" 2 years later"" etc it's hard to figure out the time-line during the first watch. And the ending felt so tacked on I started to have flashbacks from the ""House of The Dead"" film as quality comparison.<br/><br/>Where the f*#k was the gore? Honestly the only real gore you see is when it comes to dispatching various umbrella baddies, most of the time when anything interesting occurs the camera cuts away and you are thrown away from the action into a new scene, very disappointing for any zombie fans out there hoping to see some people get eaten and such. The movie has a few nice special FX moments but not nearly enough to warrant seeing it, and to be fair some pretty awesome 3D scenes.<br/><br/>The over use of slow-mo, freeze frame, and bullet time made the movie feel like it would of been a better 45 minute short to be released as fan service, I honestly felt like I had been tossed into a time machine and transported to when ""The Matrix"" was first released and everyone and their mom was using the bullet time and slow-mo gimmick in their action flicks.<br/><br/>Over all I really disliked this film, from the bad use of outdated gimmicks, to the uninteresting disposable characters that felt like they were added in just so they could justify killing someone, to the sporadic time line the film attempts to create , it was all in all just a bad movie. My score on behalf of The Liberal Dead is a very weak and below average 3 out of 10 and award for most occurrences of ""jumping the shark"" I have witnessed in a single film to date.<br/><br/><ul><li>Ted Brown ""liberaldead.com""</li></ul>"
"kyle_kar23","10","28","60","9 September 2010"," ***Best Movie of 2010 So Far***
","WOW...where do I begin? I was extremely lucky to attend the premiere of Resident Evil: Afterlife in Tokyo, Japan, and let me just say, it was nothing short of amazing. Before the premiere, Avatar (NOT that Airbender crap)has been my all-time favorite movie. But now that has changed, mainly for the fact that there is literally NON-STOP ACTION in Resident Evil: Afterlife. This was the most entertaining movie I've ever experienced. It grabs onto you and doesn't let you go, which is very rare for movies to do these days. I wasn't a big fan of any of the previous Resident Evil installments, but I feel Afterlife is almost Oscar-worthy simply for the fact that the director knows how to make great action sequences with fantastic special effects. Not to mention that the 3D was phenomenal, and really made you feel like you were in the movie's world. I don't want to give anything away, but I must warn that there are some VERY scary,gory, and disturbing scenes in Afterlife. I can't believe that it's only given an R rating. In my honest opinion, this film is slightly a higher level of maturity than R. Nevertheless, this is the best movie you're going to see in a long, long time. If you're in the mood to get sucked into the most intense and violent movie yet in cinema to date, Resident Evil: Afterlife is for you. A flawless 10/10"

","I cant even begin to explain how crap this movie is, don't waste your money...hell don't even waste your bandwidth downloading it the movie is utter crap. I've played the games (no super fan) so kinda know the story but you have nothing to worry about if you don't because this movie has no story so even the random person walking in the theater has just as much knowledge as the avid gamer who's like WTF is going on? Good thing this director doesn't write books because he'd be cited for plagiarism with how many scenes were stolen. All I can say is that I've been using IMDb for like 8-10 years now and haven't reviewed anything but this movie was so crap-house I couldn't help myself. IMDb reviews on movies are horrible 7.2 out of 10 my god the reviewers on this site are used to garbage, either that or the ""reviewers"" are people who work for the movie it self and have to try and bump a movie so hopefully they can screw a few out of some cash. Its time to start using rottentomatoes for getting reviews."

","I just can't understand why people give such a good reviews, because I went to the movie yesterday and I laughed out of disappointment mostly. The script is just awful. Mistakes everywhere. Zombies and ...people pop out of nowhere and everywhere. Shooting but leaving no dead corpses around. In the beginning Milla actually becomes normal human again but still survives jet explosion somehow. Peaple i beg you not to go to see this movie and support such a bad ekranization of really good game series. Do yourself a favor and try the game. The game makes a lot more sense and the plot is much better. I give this movie 1/10 because it actually worths just 1.

","The third installment in the resident evil franchise brings more zombie action and even bigger stunts for leading lady Alice. The plot takes place years after the second, which is a good choice, allowing new characters like Clair and K-Mart to be introduced. The storyline is well developed, the characters well acted, and the zombie action suitably amped up. Overall an enjoyable movie!"

","I am amazed by this sequel and movie. Although it was more extreme in some things it is still overall same in rating like previous sequels. I am amazed by the two actors from Prison Break tv series and their role being almost same as in that movie (engineer, prisoner, betraying person), and by graphics especially of that large monster, its axe/hammer and buildings, new abilities of umbrella and zombies. But it is too extreme that it just makes it more unreal and not convincing. This sequel tells us that there might be more positive and problem resolving sequels, like light at the end of the tunnel. There were also feelings of hope and excitement with bit of fear. The feelings are somewhat from the above mentioned 3 movies."

"trnjamesbond","2","14","27","21 September 2010"," Do 3D effects sacrifice the story
","I went to this movie with my girlfriend. I must say, putting up with the idiot teenagers behind me checking their vibrating phones seeing their lighted displays in the corner of my 3D glasses. I still wanted to see this film, I put the rhetoric behind me. The opening of the film was the narration of Alice, once again telling the fans of this series what we already know. It was without a doubt, boring hearing the story already known to us. But i think that the directors wanted to play the people that have never seen the film, only heard about it through gossip. The writers of this film, from what I see just wanted to make a 3D movie with the title called Resident Evil. The first three movies were really good. I know video game goers will knock me on this critique. But as a film buff and not a video game expert. I must say the directors and writers did an excellent job at making the first three films by making video game to movie history. They couldn't of done this without what George A. Romero did back in 1968. Because of technology, and video games, this genre has taken the next step.<br/><br/>But I feel the first 8 minutes of this film were great, however, after this, it's just a lost weak version of it's original self, made just to sell some more 3D televisions. <br/><br/>Ask yourself, if this movie you seen in 2D as you watched in 3D, is there a story here? Does this film feel like the rest of the series? Or is it just a popular pop phenomenon? Or just to go see a movie, and ask yourself is this just a film made to dazzle our senses with new technology. I must admit that this movie did do all of that. But I must ask again where is the story? That I can't answer. I think that Hollywood is taking us for a ride, so that the new generation will go to the movie theatre, to buy into a monster that is already dead. And that is all they want us to do. Spend money to fill in the years of lack luster entertainment. You see these days the film industry is dying, so now with new technology they have grasp the human race to go see the next new gimmick, just to see the next version of what movies are. Well, with this falsehood in mind, I will say this movie is a pathetic attempt to make money on the original franchise.<br/><br/>How sad is this? <br/><br/>Alice to me didn't feel like her own-self. With the plagiarist visual effects, and with the ending looking like Terminator verses the Matrix. <br/><br/>To me and even the goofy teenagers sitting behind me agreed upon this one thought, where was the story. I listened to them saying, ""that sucked the other movies were way better."" It's pretty sad, even though I'm 33 years old that the 15 year old kids behind me think the same thing.<br/><br/>And what was with the crazy zombie carrying the big, huge hammer/axe? Where did he come from? Why is he there? Is he just some lost relic of the S.T.A.R.S.program? I really don't know. All I have to say is where was the story line and why did I feel the ""MEAT"" or the middle part of the film drag on too long? I found that the beginning action sequences were good.The middle part did nothing for me except for a few scares. And then the already done MATRIX/TERMINATOR ending. How disappointing.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, I was disappointed from watching this film. Hollywood has obviously played a huge prank on us calling this Resident Evil. They paid too much attention to new 3D technology and the story suffered by trying to distract all of us through this 3D effect.<br/><br/>Stay far away from this movie, and go home and watch the original films to shake the bugs off, of this disgrace in the story of Resident Evil 4.<br/><br/>Also I must add, movies are hard to make. We fans are all critics on how things should be filmed. But these directors ,writers, and all the people that make films come together have been bought out by the newest technology, and they will keep playing this role until it dries up the money train. They have already done this in the past through the mass production of VHS, DVD, and Blueray Disc, which is the same form of DVD except ""They"" claim, it's clearer. Hey, kids and movie goers out there, a real movie is something that makes us inspired, not by commercialized effects,but by the story. Real directors take written stories and put that on a visual canvas to make us see what they see. But the films made today are just all about selling the next 3d television. And who do you think owns the rights to these companies? Yes, you guessed it the production companies themselves. <br/><br/>A film is, what it is, and nothing more. But when we put money before the true form of film, it suffers. It shouldn't matter what type of television we buy. The film you are watching should present itself as it is. We as a society have been brainwashed by the corporate empire to make us believe that 3D makes a better and more compelling story. But this is false there has to be a story before we use technology to enhance that aspect."

","The Bad: When I say improbabilities, I mean improbabilities. There's a part about fifteen minutes in when Alice and Wesker crash a plane headfirst into a mountain and minutes later she walks out of the wreckage mildly burned with a limp. Now, Wesker has powers now so I can accept him surviving. She's human. If you can buy that, the sky's the limit. Other problems include Wentworth Miller, who was doing his best Christian Bale impression the whole time and the guy who played Wesker was pretty bad, too. I could see that guy being a memorable villain, but it was kind of ruined by the performance and an anticlimactic, but cool looking, end fight.<br/><br/>The Good: This series is very much one of those that, while it is very different to the game, they are still fun movies. For that, I put this series up with some of the better video game movies that we have, not that that's saying much. I mean, look what it's going up against. And for those of you who want these things to be more faithful to the games, this is the most faithful one so far. The action scenes, while indeed stealing heavily in some parts, are really fun and the rest of the acting isn't as bad as it could have been. I've read some reviews where the critic was bothered by the sudden and unexplained appearance of the Executioner/Axe Man. This is different from the video games and previous movies how? It's the Resident Evil movie. You kill these bosses and you just move on from there. I don't want a whole back story on a guy who only appears for about fifteen-twenty minutes.<br/><br/>Now, if you like the other three films, go ahead and see this one. If you didn't, I don't even know why you're reading this review because this most certainly is not going to redeem it.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Decent movie, but in my opinion the worst of the series. It didn't really serve a purpose. It didn't really do anything for the series and nothing is explained. It starts off great but as the movie progresses it becomes clear that this movie has no story whatsoever. Nothing important happens. I loved the action sequence...s, special effects, and the acting by Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. But Wentworth Miller and Shawn Roberts who plays Albert Wesker are just awful. Spencer Locke(Couger Town, Resident Evil 3) just doesn't have enough screen time to show her potential. It's nice to finally see Boris Kodjoe on the big screen instead of a straight to DVD movie like StarShip Troopers 3. He was the best actor in ST3. Out of all Paul W.S. Anderson's movies this is his worst. This movie had potential to be good but I know there are a lot of people out there who hate is movies, but I personally enjoyed Event Horizon and Aliens Vs Predator. All in all I was excited to see this and had high hopes for it but it left me disappointed. I don't want to spoil anything but there will be a sequel which I HOPE will be better and actually have a story."

I bet you the only bit of the game he got was walking past some family members who was playing the game; stopped and was like ""Ooh that's cool! I'm gonna put that in my movie, DERP!"" I'm happy that Capcom switched things up with Resident Evil 4 and 5 with the whole Las Plagas thing and stopped with the whole T-Virus bull crap that's been done over to death by Anderson. And why was The Executioner from Resident Evil 5 in the game? As cool as he looked...I just did not understand it. And the Majini. They made them into...tunneling zombies. WHAT THE FLIP.<br/><br/>Crappy 3-D. Even when using James Cameron's new 3-D cameras; it doesn't reach the caliber of Avatar. You need to give those cameras to someone who can do it better. Another gripe was the never ending bullet time! The Matrix was how many years ago? And guess what Anderson? The Wachowski Brothers still do it better. Even Zack Snyder does it better.<br/><br/>Also Milla Jovovich. I know you can act. I seen you in the movie Dummy and loved you! Just because Anderson is your husband doesn't mean you have to be his cash-cow. Please go back to indie films and movies that have meaning or you can go back to making music. Anything but shitty movies. PLEASE.<br/><br/>*sighs heavily* If you want a true Resident Evil experience...Get Resident Evil 0-5...and pull an all-nighter. Seriously. Get the depends and the mountain dew, order some pizza, turn off the lights and go for it.

The 3d version was awesome. They really utilized 3d technology. Unfortunately, when you watch the non 3d version it does not seem to be nearly as entertaining. It is an action packed film as are the other Resident Evil movies. (The 1st Resident Evil is still the best) There were some worthless characters in this movie such as the basketball player. I can't recall his name. Unfortunately, they are bringing his character back in the next film which is a mistake. Chris Redfield was slightly disappointing. The actor didn't match the video game character. Clare and Alice were both great as usual. The fight scene between the character with the axe in the prison was amazing in 3d however once again in the non 3d version it did not carry over well at all. It was not nearly as entertaining.

This movie is regurgitated Resident Evil 5. There are some parts that are literally taken from that game word for word and several sequences identical to the game. I spent almost the entire movie waiting for something exciting to happen and it never came. I suppose someone must've given them an infinite ammo code too. How many times did Alice fire her S&W 500 revolvers (a five shot revolver) without reloading? Maybe I'm being overly critical because I know a thing or two about guns and the people who made this film obviously knew NOTHING . . . I could go on and on about why I say that but I'll spare you.

Now if you are remotely expecting any of those, what-so-ever make note, any sense of ""horror"" is completely non-existent, the action scenes you can count on 3 fingers, and lastly the way he completely makes a farce of game tie-ins will make every single RE fan explode with nerd rage.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the trailer already, I would highly suggest watching it, just for Milla Jovovich, and her horribly acted and edited in ""clones"". It's like the director told her before filming ""No Milla, you only get paid once, your clones don't get paid as well"" since her disappointment and willingness to act certainly shows.<br/><br/>In closing, I can only highly suggest skipping this, saving your money, and hoping Paul Anderson stops making horrible game to movie tie-ins."
"PatrickSamuel","5","22","48","10 September 2010"," The most immersive 3D film you'll see so far, but once you're there, there's not much to keep it going.
","Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson and starring Milla Jovovich, Ali Larter, Kim Coates, Wentworth Miller and Shawn Roberts and filmed with the James Cameron and Vince Pace 3D Fusion Camera System developed for Avatar, the fourth part of the Resident Evil series arrives in cinemas this week.<br/><br/>This new chapter sees our heroine Alice (Jovovich) continuing her journey to find human survivors and lead them to Arcadia, a place free of infection. Meeting up once again with her friend Claire (Larter) and a band of other survivors, they find the city of angels is now the city of the undead. Alice's battle with the Umbrella Corporation and Albert Wesker (Roberts) climbs a new level as they search for thousands of survivors who were supposed to have reached Arcadia. A mysterious ship sailing down the ocean may hold the clues. But are they walking into a trap? The 3D aspect of Resident Evil: Afterlife is a stunning mix of creativity and technological advancement. From the slow building opening sequence which takes place in Tokyo as rain cascades down onto the titles, hitting them and splashing off, to more complex scenes incorporating slow motion action sequences with fast moving elements such as a hoards of the undead, it's a visual treat. The depth of each scene is magnified to a level which I've never seen before in 3D cinema. One of the best scenes in the movie takes place in a prison bathroom as the Axeman and Claire go head to head. I guarantee you will duck as the axe comes toward you and you will certainly feel the effect of the blood splatter as it hurtles at you.<br/><br/>Director Paul W.S. Anderson spoke about Afterlife's 3D offering an immersive experience, drawing the audience into the story. This is certainly true, the 3D does pull you into the movie but once you are there you will find the story is rather thin and poorly executed. Rather like the Saw franchise, Resident Evil seems to have run out of steam and is unsure of what to do with its lead characters. It builds us up with the expectation of a payoff at the end, but this never arrives and is by far one of the weakest endings I have seen in a movie this year.<br/><br/>In terms of the kills in the movie, they are unfulfilling. Characters are mostly pulled off-screen to their deaths and as a horror-movie fan, this is not what I want. I want to see whatever it is the undead are doing to them and not just look at the other characters faces as they see what is happening. If it's an immersive experience you want the audience to have, then the filmmakers should have gone the full distance with Afterlife as the kills seem rather restrained and unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Backed by a thumping, industrial and electric guitar driven score produced by Tomanandy (The Mothman Prophecies, The Hills Have Eyes) it adds much ""oomph"" to the power kicks, explosions and transitions between slow and fast segments. Together with the 3D, the score is the 2nd thing I enjoyed most about the movie. However, Wentworth Miller left me with a feeling of déjà vu. We first meet him in a prison cell. I didn't find him believable at all, especially not in relation to his connection with Claire which I found unnecessary and is one of the points where the movie took a downturn story-wise.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Afterlife is the most immersive 3D film you'll see so far, but once you're there, there's not much to keep it going in terms of character development and story driven elements."
"tamir007-1","1","16","33","10 September 2010"," A total waste of money
","A terrible movie... There was no storyline, and not enough Zombie fighting to cover for it. Usually when making Zombie Movies, its either a good plot or lots of zombie killing, the plot was boring and there was only one good zombie fight. It seems as if the writers of this movie thought they could make another mediocre movie using the 3D experience and plenty of effects, they used too much slow motion if you ask me. <br/><br/>And about the 3D experience I have no Idea how they make it... if it is a different technology in every film or whatever... But the feeling of Depth was not as good as Avatar, or Alice.<br/><br/>I really hope they stop at this movie and not make another sequel"

","Resident Evil: Afterlife is the 4th instalment of the Resident Evil series. Milla Jovovich goes back to do what she does best: kick ass.<br/><br/>With a new villain, new location and a big man with a big axe, RE4 sees Alice trying to find Arcadia, the so called last safe haven for survivors of the T-virus. She finds her old ally Claire from the 3rd film, who has lost her memory, and together they meet up with a new group of survivors trying to get to Arcadia. Easier said than done when they're all surrounded by the undead.<br/><br/>Jovovich and Ali Larter do well as the leading ladies of action, but Shawn Roberts is basically just channeling The Matrix's Agent Smith as the villain Wesker, from the voice right down to the sunglasses. He comes off looking like a video game character all right. Prison Break's Wentworth Miller does alright as Claire's brother Chris, but still sounds like Michael Scofield, as always.<br/><br/>Roberts isn't the only thing here that reminds me of The Matrix, all the slow mo action sequences just screams of it too. But you know, it just works very well. To his credit, Paul W.S. Anderson doesn't pretend to make a cerebral action horror flick, he just gives what his audiences want: a bloody good time. You want blood, gore, monsters and Alice looking awesome? They're all here.<br/><br/>The familiarity of it all might annoy you at first, but after a while you'll feel comfy and end up getting a real kick out of this.<br/><br/>Bring on RE5!"
"OneRingToRuleThemAll13","8","13","26","5 January 2011"," The best film for fans of the games and over the top gore :D
","You will enjoy this movie greatly if you're a fan of the games that inspired the films. This movie offers TONS of fan service for RE game fans.<br/><br/>The movie portrays the adventures the adventures of Alice and her quest to find survivors and fight against ''The Umbrella Corporation'', a pharmaceutical company that unleashed the viral outbreak that turns defenseless humans into flesh-eating zombies. Along the way, she encounters MANY characters from the games (including Chris Redfield, who makes his first ever appearance in the films).<br/><br/>The special effects and makeup are pretty good (specially in 3-D). The blood looks fantastic. The girls look FANTASTIC. Can't say the same for the zombies, who look as RIDICULOUS as ever. Apart from that, though, they are good.<br/><br/>As many reviewers have stated, there is practically NO plot (as in most horror films). But this is the least plot-driven installment in the series. This is a pity, as I've always liked the films' story.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it is STELLAR. The best performance is given by Milla Jovovich (who portrays Alice), as she comes back to the role that fits her the best. Shawn Roberts replaces Jason O' Mara as Wesker, who gives a much better performance than the latter. The rest of the cast gives pretty good performances, too.<br/><br/>The audio is this one is good. Gunshots, zombie screams, and the soundtrack will BLOW you away, as always (specially the theme song, which I have still stuck in my head even though I watched this a long time ago).<br/><br/>Overall the film is good, except for the plot and zombie makeup. There is lots of fan service in this one. And, also, I recommend you see this in 3D, as the action, gore, and special effects look MUCH better. Well, that's my review for ''Resident Evil: Afterlife''. Hope you found it helpful :)"
"Aaron1375","9","17","36","2 January 2011"," This set of films plays out more like a comic book than most comic book movies.
","I really enjoy the Resident Evil films and this one is no exception. Sure, you really have to suspend your disbelief for some of the stuff, but it is akin to suspending your disbelief in any comic book or fantasy film. These films are telling an interesting story and they do a lot better from one film to another than other big budget movies. Alice continues to wage her war on the Umbrella corporation leading an assault on their headquarters in Japan. Her troops, the many clones of herself. Unfortunately, though she is able to exact a bit of revenge, she also loses her powers thanks to the villain Wesker. Though she rather prefers to be human I think she would be better off with her powers. Well she ends up trying to find those she saw flying off to a safe haven in Alaska, she makes it there only to find a field of planes and no sign of humans other than Claire Redfield who has some strange device on her. Well they end up holed up in a maximum security prison and it becomes overrun and then a big dude comes and chaos ensues. Great action, Milla is probably my favorite heroine in film right now. Well I would say scratch the probably, she is. The film also does really good at making the film look like a 200 million dollar blockbuster on a 60 million dollar budget. The end most certainly suggests another film and I am most certainly up for another go around. I just enjoy the films, they are fun and fast and usually have good action and zombies. They may not be works of art, but they keep me entertained and I applaud this series for that, as I also applaud them for keeping the story intact and not completely ignoring stuff from the previous movies."
"lewiskendell","6","7","12","3 January 2011"," How much more ridiculous can these movies get?
","Let me be clear, despite my slightly positive rating, Resident Evil: Afterlife is in no way a ""good"" movie. But it is entertaining, in a ridiculous, inexplicable way.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of this series, even though that admission would probably cause some people to doubt any and all of my credibility when it comes to movies. The last three RE flicks were just dumb, fun action movies with zombies, and I could appreciate them for what they were. No, they don't follow the games very closely, and no they weren't scary in the slightest, but I still liked them (to varying degrees). Milla Jovovich is a credible and likable action star and seeing her jumping through the air, kicking and shooting things in the face never really got old, for me. Plus, this series has a habit of including some pretty hot actresses in each installment (including this one), which I heartily approve of. <br/><br/>Afterlife, to be quite honest, is a train-wreck. But, it's like a train-wreck where no one gets injured, and the train cars do some crazy flips in slow motion and there are tons of explosions and everyone who happened to see it had a pretty good time watching it. Writer and director Paul W.S. Anderson has completely (and wisely) given up on trying to make these movies make sense in the slightest way, and let all logic fall right off the B- movie cliff. There's just so many cheesy, absurd things going on at any given moment that it's almost an overload. The almost constant slow motion, the AWFUL acting, the absurd dialogue, the concrete-tunneling zombies, the guarantee that exactly every 3 minutes, a zombie or monster was going to magically appear behind a character and kill/almost kill them, the random elements from the games strewn about haphazardly...it's all just so ridiculous.<br/><br/>This truly awful movie appealed to me in a perverse way. It certainly didn't bore me, that's for sure. But, you should be very wary if your tolerance (and maybe even fondness?) for a disaster isn't equal to mine. Resident Evil: Afterlife destroys the limits of absurdity like one of Alice's shotguns to the face. And yet, after the extra scene during the credits, I actually felt eager to see the next Resident Evil movie. Maybe I'm the one who's absurd."
"yasin23","7","16","34","15 September 2010"," Good film but still left you wanting more
","The storyline was good and although it was not engaging and complete compared to the last film RE:Extinction.<br/><br/>The film contains cool fight scenes with slow mo thrown in often, what make the film is Milla Jovovich's acting and stunt skills. Ali Later as Claire is decent her but character is not developed, and importantly I think Wentworth Miller was not used properly to portray Chris other than make indirect reference to his character in prison break.<br/><br/>I found myself asking when Milla is in the plane she get injected with a antidote for the T-Virus by Albert Wesker she thanks him for making her Human, now does she have her Super-Human strength or not that is never answered in the letter part of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall good film better in 3D yet at the end makes you question: IS THAT IT?"
"estebangonzalez10","6","16","34","13 September 2010"," Resident Evil fans won't be disappointed
","¨Five years ago... A virus escaped, and everybody died. ¨ It has been three years since the last Resident Evil movie came out. Afterlife is the fourth of the franchise and lives up to the expectations most fans of the series had although it isn't as good as the first movie. This is my favorite franchise based on a video game and in my opinion the series has worked because of Milla Jovovich. She is great in her role as Alice and has become a huge action star. Paul W.S. Anderson directed the first film of the series and now he came back to direct the fourth one, although he has written the screenplay for all four films so he has been involved with the entire process. The effects are great and if you are a fan of the franchise I recommend you see this in 3D, but if you didn't like the other films or aren't familiar with them I wouldn't recommend them since you might find yourself lost in the midst of the plot. I have to admit I never played the video games or know anything about them so I can't say how true to the game the story is, but considering all the video games that have been turned into movies this is by far the best series. The thing I liked least about this movie was the opening 15 minutes in Tokyo, but I understand they served to connect the end of Resident Evil Extinction with Afterlife. After Tokyo the movie really picks up and I found myself engaged in the story. This is not a movie you will enjoy for the acting, dialogue, or intelligent script, but it is an action packed movie with cool visuals, good fight scenes, and a very hot Milla Jovovich doing what she does best: killing zombies.<br/><br/>The movie begins right where Resident Evil Extinction left us. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is trying to destroy the Umbrella Corporation using her newly discovered clones and goes deep inside Umbrella Head Quarters in Tokyo to kill Wesker (Shawn Roberts). After a face-off with several soldiers, Wesker escapes in an aircraft and the base is destroyed. Alice's clones have all been exterminated in the explosion, but she managed to get to the aircraft in time and just when she is about to kill Wesker he injects her with a serum that neutralizes the T-virus in her blood. She losses her superpowers and becomes human and thanks him for that right before they crash in the mountains. Alice survives and decides to go search for any survivors left in the apocalyptic world. She travels to Alaska in search of Arcadia where her friends had parted in the third film. Once in Alaska she finds the helicopter her friends where in, but there is no sign of survivors, the place is deserted. Right when she is about to lose hope she is attacked by Claire (Ali Larter) who has no memory of who she is because her memory has been erased by an Umbrella device. Alice frees her from the device and tries to help her get her memory back, while in the meantime they travel together on a two-man plane to Hollywood in search of more survivors. Here they find the city infected with zombies, but there are a few survivors in the rooftop of a prison cell. They make a forceful landing and meet some of the survivors who think she is here to rescue them. Luther (Boris Kodjoe), Crystal (Kasey Barnfield), Kim (Norman Yeung), and Wendell (Fulvio Cecere) are some of the survivors who tell Alice what Arcadia actually is and together they have to try to get there before the zombies find a way in the prison walls.<br/><br/>Wentworth Miller was a good addition in this film as he plays Chris Redfield, Claire's brother, but due to her memory loss she can't recognize him. Alice and Claire are back from the third film and they have a lot of screen time as usual. Miller and Kodjoe give good supporting male roles, but we all know that the Resident Evil franchise is about girls who can kick zombie butts. In the first film it was Jovovich with Michelle Rodriguez, then she teamed up with Sienna Guillory in the second one, and now in the third and fourth films Jovovich and Larter are the true stars of the film. There are some very memorable scenes with great Matrix like effects. The 3D visuals are cool, and I especially liked the scene where Alice and Claire battled the Axeman in the bathroom. This is a popcorn action movie and probably not for everyone. If you didn't like the other Resident Evil movies then there is no reason why you should go see this, but if you liked those films then you will probably enjoy this one as well.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"klam0500","5","16","34","10 September 2010"," Very disappointing ending!
","The film starts off impressively with a great battle scene, however the films pace slows down considerably after the opening battle scene.<br/><br/>The prison fortress that Mila lands on takes up most of the meat of the film, but very little seems to happen in here. And the dialogue is well....... here's an example from one of the main protagonists:<br/><br/>""What the hell is that thing!""<br/><br/>The abandoned prison also houses Chris Redfield played by Wentworth Earl Miller III of ""Prison break"" fame...... Chris Redfield, his sister Clare and Alice & co all escape from this abandoned prison. Was the selection of Wentworth Miller because of great casting....or was it because he gets to ""break out"" of prison......and his inclusion is nothing more than a wink/in joke to Prison Break!<br/><br/>The ending is pretty poor and very anticlimactic, there is a a sequel on the way as the ending makes clear but I would have preferred not to have to wait another year or 2 just to see part 2 of this movie!<br/><br/>It could have been much much better!"
"bmrao1980","3","17","37","13 September 2010"," Does little more than exploit the new 3D scene.
","I can understand why the critics hate it. I can also understand why fans of the game would love it. But, i am at a loss as to what someone who isn't an avid gamer would make of this movie. For such a person (me), even if the person has followed the movie franchise to its fourth iteration, this movie was pointless in terms of taking the story forward.<br/><br/>It seems to me that all of the movie-maker's attention was on the 3D technology rather than anything resembling a plot, storyline, pace, acting, etc. Even the zombies took a backstage here.<br/><br/>What i liked about the first three movies was all absent here. Sure, we got to see the freeze-frame, slow-mo action bits, and they were no doubt awesome when seen in 3D. Like the freeze-frame when Alice has just lost her superhuman powers and her plane is about to crash. The detail was astounding and what a suspense it built - i almost broke into a sweat thinking how awesome it would be to see the remainder of the impact in full 3D slow-mo. But then i was presented a scene where the 'human' Alice walks out of such a horrendous plane crash.<br/><br/>Then there is the scene where a few survivors are holed up in a prison complex. And surrounding the prison, waving their arms through the fence are the zombies - just like the previous RE-Extinction movie.<br/><br/>And on the point of the zombies, what escapes me is why they were reduced to mere background noise! What bothers me is why they did not even act like zombies. First, they bore through the sewers in order to reach the humans inside. They also launch a stealth-attack on the people who go down to the armory to retrieve weapons. This shows active thinking, which they shouldn't be capable of doing. Second, they looked like the same make-up team from MJ's Thriller video was employed. Third, they ran and attacked like humans - this was quite obvious in the scene on the prison rooftop.<br/><br/>The biggest sin though was the way the Axeman character was handled. Why was he there? How did he get to be what he is (all the monsters introduced in the previous movies have had their origin explained)? Why did he decide to break down the prison gate? And why on earth was he so easily defeated? Now, in spite of all these and more flaws, if the pace was good enough (outside the freeze-frames and slow-mo) and the time-lines and dialog made sense, and the 'big reveal' handled better, then this would have been a much better movie. Unfortunately, it fails there too.<br/><br/>This movie ought to be taken as a lesson in the pitfalls of 3D. This is what happens when the movie-makers concentrate only on the technology they are using and ditch everything else.<br/><br/>Still, made me await even more 3D movies. They are surely the future."

"John-Athens","4","13","27","11 September 2010"," I Don't Believe in This Afterlife
","Paul W.S. Anderson claims to be a ""big fan"" of the Resident Evil games, however like a father encouraging his son to live his life while he constantly undermines everything he does, his actions betray his words. I'm sure his intentions are good, but as they say, the road to hell is paved in good intentions. Apologists for his Resident Evil movies will say ""lighten up, it's based on a video game, it doesn't have to be smart."" I'm so tired of that argument. Just because a movie's based on a video game, doesn't mean it has to be mindless action with no coherent plot. Roger Ebert once said video games will never be art. That may be true, but most of them do have a story to tell. And if these stories are to be given any justice on the big screen, filmmakers can't disregard the source material. The worst thing about this is that I had to pay 3D prices to see this movie (it's not being shown in a regular format). So am I going to have to buy a 3D TV to watch this when it comes out on Blu-ray? Not likely, because I'm never going to watch this movie again.<br/><br/>Alice (Milla Jovovich), the main character of the previous installments returns in this one looking prettier than ever. She has ruby-red lipstick, makes a ""duck-face"" when she fights, and wears a designer pilot outfit. In a post-apocalyptic world infested with zombies, who has time to get dressed specifically to fly a plane? Even her clones all have matching outfits, hairdos, and flawless skin. We get it Paul Anderson, your wife is hot, can we move along with the movie please? Anyway, the beginning of the movie takes place in Japan. The Alice clones infiltrate Umbrella's underground facility in an attempt to enact their revenge on one Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts). What's not clear is what is Wesker's position in Umbrella's corporate structure? We don't know, but the clones need someone to blame. They wreck havoc on the facility, and kill the guards using guns, throwing stars, psychic abilities, and slow-motion. These clones treat their lives with reckless abandon; jumping backwards out of a window while shooting at nothing, and detonating explosives in close proximity to themselves. When one dies, another takes it's place. It's okay, because all know clones have no soul. Once the kamikaze clones do their job, we're conveniently left with one Alice to follow. Somehow, she makes it to Alaska on a single engine plane and while there she meets up with an old friend, Claire Redfield (Ali Larter). However, something has happened to Claire that prevents the two of them from catching up on old times. Good, because who wants the character's gap between ""Extinction"" and ""Afterlife"" to be bridged with needless dialog? In any event, after this non-reunion, and without refueling, they fly to LA in search of the fabled safe haven known as ""Arcadia.""<br/><br/>While in LA, they ""crash"" land on the roof of a building, and meet up with a group of survivors. This group includes a Hollywood producer (Kim Coates), a struggling actress (Kacey Barnfield), and a famous athlete (Boris Kodjoe) to name a few. Apparently LA is filled with cliché archetypes. They use an unnecessarily 30-story high prison as a place of refuge from the zombies, and the interior of this prison has like 100 torches scattered about. At the bottom of the prison, locked in a cage, is Chris Redfield (Prison Break's Wentworth Miller). Oh I get it; Wentworth Miller played a character known for breaking out prisons and Chris... Forget it. Chris and Claire are siblings, but you wouldn't know it by the way they act. At least Claire has a reason for being emotionally distant. The group finds the location of Acadia, and have to fight their way through hordes of zombies, and a curiously placed hooded axeman, known as the ""Executioner"" in the games, to make it there. Wait, why is there an axeman in the middle of LA in the first place?<br/><br/>That's what this movie does, it treats the game like a bargain bin and takes the elements deemed ""cool"" and shoehorns them in without any explanation, or context. Nothing is explained; I know what they mean because I played and beat EVERY GAME in the series. Paul Anderson, who only directed this and the first installment, but who has written the screenplay for every single one makes these movies stand-alone. Meaning, each movie feels self-contained and doesn't carry on from the previous installment. Any connection between the movies is tenuous at best. Characters are just empty shells being used as nothing but props in the action scenes. Alice is the only consistent character, and she's as lifeless as the zombies shes killing. She herself is a killing machine; she only gets more powerful with every movie (even though she became 'human' early in the movie). And any gamer would agree it's no fun playing a game that provides no challenge, likewise, its no fun watching a movie in which the hero/heroine go unchallenged. The Resident Evil games pioneered the survival-horror genre. In the older games, the ammo was scarce, the healing items where few and far between, and the enemies were powerful. It put you in a constant state of danger and unease. Hell, in order to conserve your ammo you couldn't kill everything you saw, sometimes you just had to run... That is unless you cheat. And that's what Alice is, a cheat. Instead of a main character that's fragile, and can be overwhelmed at any time we're given one that does the overwhelming. That would be okay if this movie wasn't called RESIDENT EVIL. If you take away everything that's ""Resident Evil"" about these movies, aside from a few terms, nothing will have changed. And that's when you know something is wrong."
"MosHr","10","16","35","9 September 2010"," The first great video game movie
","Resident Evil Afterlife manages the rare feat of seamlessly tying together a wide breath of movie styles; the zombie horror genre mixed with the monster movie genre to the slickness of the Matrix style environments and shootouts all encased in a disaster movie shell and characters. And, it's in 3d and if you've played resident evil 4 video game, there are a lot of derivations from the game that's sure to bring a few giddy moments. Best of all, every second is a total surprise and you'll have no idea where the movie is going and what is going to happen next. It never falls flat or meanders at any time. It is solid and punchy at every second. Even the soundtrack sounds like it's tearing the speakers right off the wall.<br/><br/>This is a triumphant action horror movie that oozes with style that resident evil movies have made their own. The 3d aspect is also quite impressive but used mostly subtly rather than having things constantly hurled at your face. The zombies never leap at you or spring their tendrils at you but every scene with 3d has a subtle vibrancy to it and 3D effects are applied in the set piece fights very well. The plot probably has a few holes but the movie moves so fast that you barely have time to think about it or register it. Characters aren't that well flushed out but I suppose every second of character development is one less zombie killed.<br/><br/>This is a great action horror movie and really recommended for people who found something to like in the older resident evil movies."

Umbrella's bigwigs survive in high-tech underground bunkers, but they're not safe from the vengeful wrath of Alice (Milla Jovovich), a former experimental subject of theirs who has developed something akin to superpowers because they injected her with something that sends her T-cells into overdrive.<br/><br/>As this 4th installment of the franchise opens, multiple clones of Alice take out several platoons of Umbrella security goons (faceless in body armor and helmets) in a highly fortified lair under Tokyo, then she engages in some snarly repartee with Umbrella's head honcho before he blows the whole place up, taking out all of the clones in the process. Shortly thereafter, Alice gets hit with an injection that neutralizes her superhuman strength and speed. The same guy who did this could easily have used the opportunity to stick a knife instead of a needle into her throat, but that would have (a) made sense and (b) ended the movie after only about 20 minutes.<br/><br/>From there it's north to Alaska, where Alice collects Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), a fellow rebel from the previous movie, now living like a wild animal due to amnesia.

It costs more, but is worth it.<br/><br/>I have seen Avatar twice in 3D, and now Resident Evil, and this movie blows Avatar away like only Alice can do. There aren't many movies that have made me want to write a review as soon as I got home from it, but this one is so good I needed to write something, just to express how much I liked it.<br/><br/>I am not going to give any kind of spoiler, but if you liked the other 3 movies you will love this one just as much or more. Maybe the 3D experience adds to the fun, but the movie was great in itself too. Lots of action and explosions. And Milla is hot!!<br/><br/>So, if you must search through your couch for a few extra Quarters, it is well worth the time and money to see this movie."
"Film_Junkie68","5","14","30","12 September 2010"," Resident Evil Afterlife...Save your Money!
","Matinée Madness! Resident Evil Afterlife, okay so this movie had been hyped up for years ever since the success of RE: Extinction, which ended roughly with a cliffhanger, we all knew Alice was going to come back to wage war with the Umbrella Company, stating she was ""Bringing a few of her friends"". We all knew Wesker had to be the villain in the next movie, we even knew that Ali Larter was going to return as Claire Redfield...what we didn't know was that this MOVIE was going to be shot in 3D! Using the same fusion camera system that James Cameron used in AVATAR, everybody probably figured ""Hey, this movie's going to be awesome, it's shot in 3D!"" Well sorry to disappoint folks, BUT that's all this movie has going for it!!! Now I'm a big fan of RE, I played the 1,2, Code Veronica, 4th, and half of the 3rd game. I knew what to expect when I went in to see this movie, Zombie's getting their asses blown away by gorgeous babes (or Chris Redfield and Leon Kennedy). Knowing this and seeing the incredibly awesome trailer I went in hoping to witness the greatest RE Movie ever! Instead this was what I got: Milla Jovovich as NEO (or the ONE in case you didn't watch ""The Matrix""), Blasting her way through hundreds of soldiers, undead zombies, and mutated dogs....just to go on a cruise ship?! Okay some of that sounded a bit harsh, but that's the plot in a nutshell. I'm serious, there's nothing much else in between except for some poor acting, laughable dialog, and useless freeze-frames(Done just for the 3D aspect of the film). Look, let me tell you something I was looking forward to seeing this movie, so much so, I even watched scenes from the RE5 video game on you-tube just to get in the feel of things, and you know what? When the movie was finished and I walked out those theater doors, I found myself cursing the NAME Paul W.S. Anderson!(The guy is one of my favorite directors of all time! This guy brought us Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil 1, Death Race, and Event Horizon, Come On Paul!) In this film he was just lazy. The only thing the director wanted to concentrate on was the action scenes and the whole 3D hype, and like the first three movies there were only some references made by the video games: The Zombies being one, Claire Redfield, Jill Valentine, Carlos Olivera, and even monsters such as The Licker, Nemisis, and The Tyrant have come into play, but the plots are just not the same. Instead we follow this Character Alice, who is NOT in the games whatsoever! So in this film we got Chris Redfield, Albert Wesker, and the monster everybody was looking forward to...""The Executioner!"" (Big Applause!) to appear in this one. Chris Redfield portrayed by Wentworth Miller really had no purpose in this movie except to just to be in it so fans of the game can say ""Hey It's Chris!...Bout Time!"" I won't go into the acting Wentworth Miller put into his character, because there isn't any, but I can tell you this, The man can sure hold his breath forever. There is a scene in here, among countless others, where Chris and so and so have to go under water and hold their breath for about 5-10 minutes, and then they come out of the water guns blazing! I found this to be somewhat laughable, If I had to swim underwater and hold my breath for ten minutes, I would die no joke.<br/><br/>Also Shawn Roberts who portrayed Albert Wesker in this film had only 2 cameos in this film, TWO! The Beginning and the End, His character is so card-board thin you could practically cut him in half with a box cutter. So Albert Wesker the bad ass who always wears sunglasses, had this awesome fight scene with Claire, Chris, and Alice taking him on all at once, and it's the EXACT same fight scene they showed in RE5, exactly the same! Here they had an opportunity to do so much more with this fight scene and instead they (as in Paul W.S. Anderson) chose to copy it right out of the game? STUPID! Also Wesker's Demise was so F**King dumb I found myself saying ""Seriously!?....that's it!?"" Needless to say, I found myself saying that exact line when Chris and Claire reunited. I wished there were more scenes between the two characters because they are really close in the game (Brother and Sister duh!) but in here they didn't have much screen time together.<br/><br/>Now onto the 3D aspect of the film, as I stated above the only thing this movie had going for it was the 3D, and if you have to watch it, watch it specifically in 3D. I mean we got artillery shells flying at you, Axes heaved out of frame, shattered glass exploding everywhere, even the tentacles from the zombie's faces come out at you. This is what the director envisioned when he thought of the 4th RE movie. I mean most of these scenes are great, the battle between Claire, Alice, and The Executioner should ONLY be seen in 3D. Yeah sure there are some action sequences taken out of the Matrix, but hey it's in 3D right? The Matrix isn't even in 3D and yet I found myself enjoying every moment of on-screen violence, no matter how ripped off it maybe.<br/><br/>My Rating as it may be stands at a Very High Rental, or 5 stars (The 3D aspect making all 5 stars or this film watchable). My sympathy goes out to all the RE fans out there hoping and wishing this was a great film, we're all going to have to wait sadly for the next movie, OH and there is going to be another movie...(cliffhanger!) so let's all cross our fingers and hope they make this one BETTER."
"tequila101","8","8","15","7 June 2012"," Nearly the Best in the Series!
","Before anyone judges me on this review, I have a very deep point to make about RE: Afterlife. It had silly stuff, it didn't make sense and yes there was an overdose of CGI, Even though those elements didn't work, it was still an excellent sequel. Probably the best sequel alongside the first entry from 2002.<br/><br/>I have heard so much negativity be thrown at this film. And for what? Come on, there are far worse Horror films than this. Surprinsgly, to me, it was one of the best Sci-Fi/Action/Horrors I have ever seen in a long time. I loved Apocalypse and Extinction, but this one just pushed it a little bit more.<br/><br/>The thing I want to defend the film on is the cramming in of characters from the game. Yes, maybe it is a little bit over the top, but it is not a game. It was freakin 2010. Horror films made for this generation are not going to become classics anytime soon! The RE (or Biohazard) games are what they are. The films, (especially this one, since we are up to entry 4 now) are what they are. Sure the adaptations are different but they are not lame. I think the films are actually a lot better than the games.<br/><br/>I am so sick of hearing people say, this doesn't work and zombies can't swim or dig. Once again, get with the generation of this age! It is not ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) or ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978), even though I love those films. This is Resident Evil! Not old time zombie films.<br/><br/>By this stage, it was bound that the Resident Evil franchise would go over the top with everything and anything.<br/><br/>There is something to me that makes this Resident Evil sequel more special than the previous 2. I thought after watching Exticntion (which I thought was fantastic) Afterlife was not gonna have a chance in hell of beating this one. Surprinslgy, it actually beats the two sequels! Afterlife is awesome. The violence and action is chaotic and full of more mayhem. I love many of the characters because of their different personalities, the environment and look of the film which is set in a modernized today environment which is ruined because of the Apocalypse w/ the jail setting was an excellent idea to set these characters in. It was more creepier because they could not escape, they were trapped in one place instead of moving around everywhere, like the other films. The area they're stuck in leaves them in total dread and peril. Not to mention the Axeman/Executioner was disturbing looking! They made him look good here. Even though he didn't get much screen time, I still like it. It's good how they brig big menaces back to the series (like Apocalypse had done before) was a cool twist to things! The only slight few problems I would say (mentioning above) is the film is unrealistic and there is too much use of CGI happening.<br/><br/>Overall, Resident Evil Afterlife was the most kickass sequel, siding along with the first entry.<br/><br/>It deserves 7.5/10"
"Uriah43","5","3","4","20 January 2013"," The Same Thing Over and Over Again
","I'm not sure the director (Paul S. Anderson) knows exactly where he wants to go artistically or how to handle this movie. The film begins with a great opening sequence in Tokyo but rather than delving deep into what could have been something very intriguing, he decides to shift to action, stunts, and CGI and continues until a certain scene involving a plane crash. Now, as if all of the action and unrealistic stunts weren't enough, it seems that both passengers also manage to survive. Apparently plausibility or any sense of realism doesn't matter as long as there is plenty of action. And that's been part of the problem since ""Resident Evil-Apocalypse"" two films earlier. Rather than taking what he has and utilizing it in a sober manner he constantly chooses to go overboard in the mistaken assumption that ""more is better"" regardless of how absurd it eventually gets to be. As a result, we get dozens of clones of ""Alice"" (Milla Jovovich) along with the original Alice possessing telekinetic superpowers. It's simply all too much. Fortunately, he realized this and took care of both of those problems at the very beginning of the movie. But then he turns around and does what could be the exact same thing again at the very end. I don't know, maybe it's just me but it seems like the same thing over and over again. Lots of action and CGI with a couple of pretty faces thrown in for good measure. Anything to distract the viewer from realizing that this film has no real thought or creativity behind it. Now don't get me wrong, I like the inclusion of ""Claire Redfield"" (Ali Larter) and ""K-Mart"" (Spencer Locke). But rather than have them just thrashing around looking pretty I would have preferred that they be given meatier roles with more character development. After all, it seemed to work in the last film (""Resident Evil-Extermination"") pretty well and to great effect. But failing any great effort on the director's part, I guess we will have to settle for lots of action in its place. And that's a shame because this movie should have been much better."
"siobhanmckibbin","5","3","4","18 February 2012"," Alice lives to fight Umbrella once again!
","Resident Evil: Afterlife is the forth instalment in this sequence of films which were created in line with the video games. Whilst there is nothing new and original to this one, it is still action packed and overall entertaining.<br/><br/>Alice is back and in multiple carbon copies. Her prime target once again is the Umbrealla Corporation. Alice returns to the states in search of her friends who left for sanctuary in Alaska, only when she gets there she discovers they have disappeared in what may be mysterious circumstances. After taken flight again she discovers a group of survivors who want to relocate to the unharmed safe haven known only as Arcadia.<br/><br/>The film starts off on a strong note, especially the opening credits. It presents a rainy Tokyo street scene, where a girl is standing alone without an umbrella amongst a crowd. This scene presents tension and mystery and utilises the intensity of colours. It is fair to say that after this the pacing slows down considerably. Overall it is a moderate action movie.<br/><br/>This visuals are definitely what makes this film. The sets used both virtual and not are of a high standard. The plot and the characters are simplistic. The main focus seems to be on the action sequences, which at times are one after the other. Still there is never a dull moment.<br/><br/>The one thing that did irritate me about this movie, was the fact that they decided to imitate The Matrix with slow effect action sequences and highlighting certain moves through this effect as well. Whilst i feel this works well, it appeared to be happening too frequently within the narrative, and actually took away from some of the action.<br/><br/>Although the forth instalment in this series does not have an in-depth storyline, it is sill enjoyable and the gore certainly does not disappoint."

","I have never written a movie review before but this movie is sooo bad I felt compelled to take 10 minutes from my weekend to warn others I'm not expecting an Oscar wining movie when I go in to see a zombie flick. The plot is so straight forward a 2 year old could understand it. Wait, I think ONLY a 3 year old could understand it. With its MANY gaping plot holes and ridiculous decisions that the character make the movie seems more like a dimwit mixed guns, slow motion effects and then added ""3D"" to the title. And this is coming from a guy that likes machete and predator.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of zombie movies but being a movie that is based on a zombie game this movie has the characters fighting zombies for a few minutes and the rest of the movie is the main character fighting soldiers dressed in swat uniforms.<br/><br/>The movie does not advance the plot in any way. When the last movie ended her new target is the leader of umbrella, when the movie ends she has not managed to kill him and the only difference is that she does not have super human powers but the head of umbrella does.<br/><br/>AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS. MOST POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN PAID OFF."
"jonnyhavey","2","10","20","17 September 2010"," REAL 3D Falls Short
","Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D Wait For DVD My Critical Perspective: D Personal Perspective: C- 20/100<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Afterlife is the fourth installment in the film series Resident Evil based on the popular Video Game series with the same name. Similar to many sequels that have been released recently, Resident Evil director Paul W.S. Anderson decides to film it in 3D. For those who have not followed the film series or the video game, the following is a brief history of Resident Evil. The main character in the film series is a woman named Alice, played by Milla Jovovich. Alice used to be a security operative for a corrupt company called the Umbrella Corporation (a corporation developed both the T Virus and G Virus and perform various lab experiments) based in Raccoon City. Basically the company releases a deadly virus (T Virus) that spreads rapidly around the world and turns infected people into zombies. Therefore, Alice's overall goal is to destroy the Umbrella Corporation and prevent further infection to the world population. In Resident Evil: After Life Alice teams up with Claire Redfield (Played by Ali Larter) who at the end of the third film (Resident Evil Extinction) Travels to a ""so called"" safe zone known as Arcadia, but has lost her memory. Together they lead a small group in a quest to discover the secrets behind Arcadia and continue to hunt the Umbrella Corporation.<br/><br/>The Good: First off, the film had the highest grossing opening weekend box office out of the four films in the series making 27,700,000 dollars. Second, Milla Jovovich is back with her portrayal of Alice and stays true to her character as she has throughout the series. Alice along with Claire and their fellow survivors provide the audience with some very entertaining mindless zombie killing action that has been seen throughout the series. The best part of the film is the opening credits. They are able to utilize 3D technology the best in the film with a sequence where the camera pans around various characters as the credits are revealed on the screen. This opening scene gives an overview of the atmosphere of the film without any dialogue and in a very simple way.<br/><br/>The Bad: The time between each action sequence is very boring and lacks substance, good acting, a thoughtful dialogue and well thought out plot. The screenplay comes off as being forced together and put together in a rush. (Example: If the group of survivors needs a swimmer of course they have a high school swimming all-star.) The story is all over the place and is very confusing even if this isn't the first film you have seen in the series. Also, besides the 3D in the opening scene/credits the 3D is unnecessary and does not add to the movie at all. One example of this is a scene shown in the previews where the leader of the Umbrella Corporation takes his sunglasses off and throws them at the audience via 3D for no apparent reason at all<br/><br/>Final Thought: The subpar acting of Milla Jovovich along with various entertaining action sequences does not outweigh the poor scriptwriting, or the horrible acting of the supporting cast of this film. This film is just another sequel that was made for the sole reason of making money and is not worth the 3D ticket prices to see it in the theatres. Even Resident Evil fans should Wait For DVD to see this film."
"Robert_duder","9","15","33","15 September 2010"," Resident Evil continues once again to bring mind blowing action and Zombie to the very top of the pile
","I guess, although I don't think of it often, the entire Resident Evil Series must be considered one of my favourite series of films of all time. I haven't scored one of them less than a 9 and this is no exception. Its even more mind blowing to think this is based off of a video game series that long before this film series I thought could make a great movie series but no one would ever do it properly but that just isn't so. The entire series packs science fiction, horror, action, thriller into one perfect conglomeration. The story carries throughout and they tie all the ends together while still creating a solid individual story for this film. Resident Evil Afterlife isn't pure artistic brilliance (shocker I know) but it is cold hard entertainment and sometimes that is the best film you can walk into. <br/><br/>Milla Jovovich reprises her role as one of the best action heroes to ever grace the screen. Alice has gone through so many different evolutions (no pun intended) since the very first film and she continues to prove she is the hero of the story. Jovoich has had good roles and bad but she certainly sinks her teeth into a story and really tries to make it come to life. No one could replace her in this series. Ali Larter also returns to her role as video game hero Claire Redfield. Similar to her previous performance in Extinction she does well but seems to slip into the background when compared to Jovovich. Where Jovovich gets to really kick butt Larter is more the sex symbol although she has an incredible battle against the Axeman. Shawn Roberts takes over as Albert Wesker and does an awesome job. While the character might seem a little campy at times he still makes for a true kick butt villain that must come back!! Roberts looks the part and it would be great to see him come back. Newcomer to the cast is Wentworth Miller, someone I have come to know and love through Prison Break and had a lot of expectations for him. The unfortunate part is I think he could have done a lot better. I don't think they gave Chris Redfield a lot of depth or purpose in this film which is unfortunate because I think the character and Miller could really knock it out of the park. Kim Coates, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Spencer Locke, Boris Kodjoe, Kacey Barnfield, and Norman Yeung make up the supporting cast that are okay in their roles but mostly fodder necessary for the gore and action.<br/><br/>Say what you will about director, writer and producer Paul Anderson but he really does care about entertaining. Some professional reviewers say he has too many ideas and doesn't know how to make them happen and I can see where they get that but the simple fact is Afterlife and the previous Resident Evil films are simply entertaining beginning to end making it the best action, the best horror, and the best science fiction film series in years. There are a few key elements to Afterlife. First of all this is probably most likely the film that is most based on the video game series, or at least has the most references...Wesker, Redfields, Jill, the dogs, the Executioner (or the Axeman as he is known), and even the twist at the end...I'm probably leaving something out but there is plenty for game fans (especially of Resident Evil 5) to notice. The second thing is of course the 3D. I am simply not a fan of this latest insane craze of 3D films. I think its cheesy and takes away from losing yourself in a film. That being said the 3D in Afterlife was done very well and while I don't think it adds anything whatsoever to the film...its fun to watch. Do yourself a favour right now and see the first three films and then rush out to see Afterlife because if you love any of the genre of films I mentioned you will be blown away by Afterlife beginning to end. I said in the very first review that if they could do as well as the first one I would come back as many times to as many sequels as they could make...now a fifth instalment is one of my most anticipated films of all time. 9/10"
"TelBoy88","10","15","33","11 September 2010"," Another 3 year wait why? but in a good way
","This film is the best instalment to the trilogy, i went in with major high expectations for this films, it was that bad i was running away from people who have already seen the film before they could even breath a single word to me, also staying away from the reviews on here so i don't find anything out which was really frustrating.<br/><br/>But in all fair play this film definitely delivered my taste to this amazing storyline, the writer/director is doing a fantastic job on keeping this films as close to the game as possible. Mean like resident evil 1 is based on 1 with Alice being involved which doesn't happen in the game but o well scratch that shall we, number two has a mix with number 2 and 3, extinction i felt went in its own path showing a different aspect to these sorta films being based all in daylight shooting which you rarely see in zombie films.<br/><br/>Now this instalment to the films has its own way on playing but has sticked to the new resident evil 5 (my favourite in the series)besides being shot in south Africa. But keeping u with the new infected zombies and also adding the person behind everything with umbrella.<br/><br/>I felt they chucked in a lot of off different aspects to this part, with it being shot in a costophobic way and also being shot in day and night. The action involved here as well was crystal nothing too over the top besides a bit too much slow-mo but hey we can all deal with that. More scarier and more jump scenes as well which i can come to terms no other resident evil has every chucked so many into.<br/><br/>all in all i loved this chapter to this series.<br/><br/>the only downside to me was the ending for one being as i was waiting through out the whole film see the return off Jill valentine and when i did i was like why why why. knowing i love the films i think it could off ended on this one because the director better do the 5 instalment and he has to really pull all the stops out to over do this one. Also the last thing is i felt it was a bit too long (longert then the last three i felt) but thats my only complaint."

Would you like to be in a theater and see someone have a fit and ruin the movie for you? I didn't think so. This 3D craze has ruined the theater experience for me, and my husband and I go to the theater often. I have seen 3D movies in 2D and the quality is terrible.

","Foremost, I like Milla very very much. Also I like the Resident Evil movie series.<br/><br/>Coming to this movie,<br/><br/>1. The 3D is very very neat. (Probably because they didn't converted it from 2D to 3D in post production). 2. For the 2nd & 3rd movies of the series, you may say the story was poor. But here you can't even say the story was pathetic because how can we use an adjective to describe something which is non-existent. If you ever wondered how can anyone make a movie without a story, watch this. 3. The fights and gore are less compared to the previous movies. 4. It feels more like watching someone play Resident Evil game rather than watching a movie. 5. The fans of the game would enjoy this immensely because the movie has some of the game's creatures. But if you didn't play the games & only like the movies, then this will be a definite disappointment. 6. There are a few good scares. A 30-something guy who sat beside me jumped at 2 or 3 occasions. 7. Milla is looking hot & younger as each movie progresses. 8. Overall acting & writing are not very stupid but the lack of story really hurts.<br/><br/>On a final note, 1. If you like the Resident Evil game series, you may like the movie. 2. If you never played the games, but like the Resident Evil movie series, this movie will slightly disappoint you. 3. If you don't fall in the above 2 categories & if you don't like Milla Jovovich, please don't watch the movie."
"triniblu-1","9","13","28","27 September 2010"," Resident Evil: Afterlife + Trilogy before it......
","Many people can agree that the Resident Evil Movies don't follow the games exactly, but they do have elements of the game in the story. What people need to understand is that the movies are taking the franchise to a new level, it would be pointless to make a live action movie that follows the game in every way. The movie versions are an adaptation of the games and twists things to fit into a theatrical format. Resident Evil: Afterlife does that well, by turning Alice back into the character in the first movie, she kicks ass and keeps it human, rather than super-human. The 3D was a new take on the series and I think it was nice, but it would have been fine without it too. It seems that the craze right now in movies is 3D, but some movies should go without it and let the story bring in the audience not the gimmicks of 3D. The 3D in RE:A was exceptional, but sometimes no surprise, like the Axe man throwing the ax towards the screen. The movie takes place after RE:E which is good that the movies follow close behind each other. The story is basically Alice trying to find life after the world goes to hell. Yes, there is zombies, but the focus of this movie is ending the Umbrella Corporation. Many elements of this movie takes scenes from the RE Games 4 & 5. Out of all the RE movies made this had more similarities to the game than the previous films. People should remember that these filmmakers make these films to entertain, so other people that have negative things to say about this movie or any other movie for that matter should shut up and enjoy the movie rather than analyzing every little thing."
"BondFan88","10","13","28","15 September 2010"," This one's for the game fans
","I've seen this movie twice already and going to see it a third time. I've enjoyed the series thus far but this one just takes the cake, and it's much better than Extinction. At the beginning of the movie, Alice loses her powers in a fight with Wesker. For good. So now she's as normal as all of the other characters. Claire returns for this movie, as well as Chris and someone else, which I won't spoil. Just stay for the credits is all I'm going to say. She survives and finds Claire, and the both of them fly to Los Angeles to look for more survivors. They do find some, who are holed up in a maximum security prison and want to get to a nearby safe haven. Alice joins up with them and they plan their escape, which will be tough given the number of zombies and monsters surrounding the prison.<br/><br/>The 3D effects are simply amazing and the action is great as well. Just because Alice is normal doesn't mean she can't kick some serious butt, and the video game characters do just as well, and in most cases better than she does. Again, the video game characters get tons more representation in this film then they have in the past. It's definitely worth seeing and I can't wait to take it home once it's released in stores.<br/><br/>Another thing worth noting is the excellent soundtrack, which is available on iTunes. I haven't enjoyed an RE movie soundtrack this much since the first movie. They really did an excellent job with this movie overall and I hope to see a part 5!"
"Cinema_Fan","2","13","28","14 September 2010"," A subject that moves forward but steps back in mind, body and soul.
","The problem I find with this fourth instalment of the Resident Evil franchise is that it seems to have by-passed any form of depth, while not expecting too much in the way of a story at least, this Afterlife addition has solely concentrated on its 3D gimmick to sell its point.<br/><br/>There seems to be a trend of the visual over any hardcore narrative. What we have here is 3D overdrive enhancing the form and actions of Ms. Milla Jovovich, and it's as basic as that.<br/><br/>The characters are the average one-dimensional throwaways that are placed on screen as walking clichés, adding too, that when it comes to any threat from this franchise's walking dead themselves they are no longer required to project tension or threat. These poor souls, too, no longer require top billing and it is they who are reliant on this latest technology rather than the 3-D needing the horror of the undead to keep the gravy train rolling.<br/><br/>This, again, is not about the old days of walking dead horror but Alice's new image as 3D dolly bird and her quest to do slow-mo action and the old chestnut of bullet-time once again raises its ugly head. With this latest fad comes old ideas to exploit and it's all so tiring. <br/><br/>All this and the nondescript script, too, that makes the fourth instalment a seemingly pointless exercise in the life of Alice and her wonderland. Her part in the franchise of the new technology of three-dimensional theatre is ever evident when the visual dimension supersedes the dimension of the three fundamental traits that make a good film: script, plot and narrative."

","I was lucky I was invited to the premiere in 3D and boy I loved it!! The whole movie is full of very fast action sequences which are largely enhanced by the 3D feature. In terms of the storyline, it keeps moving further away from the video game series but that is not a problem, both are similar stories and many people are fans of both the films and the video-games. Mila J. rocks as Alice (as usual ;) and the other characters are awesome (specially Ali Larter as Claire and the guy from Prison Break as Chris). There are way more zombies but less zombie-action but that doesn't mean the survivors weren't busy...<br/><br/>Wesker looks and acts a lot like his video game self, so that is a plus for the gamers who go see it. Now, here is the important bit of this review: If you haven't seen the other three films, do yourself a favor and watch'em before watching this one; otherwise you'll be lost from the first action sequence up to half the movie at least...

","Being a fan of the Resident Evil franchise since the original game released, I have been following Paul Andersons's films very closely. While all three films thus far (excluding Apoclapse which followed the resident evil 3 plot line very loosely) were hardly connected to the resident evil plot line, I still enjoyed them for what they were: good zombie films with lots of action. Knowing this I still had high expectations for the forth film as Anderson never fails to deliver an exciting movie and the addition of 3D and a plot containing core elements of resident evil 5 seemed very promising. And let me tell you, the forth film blew my mind in every possible aspect. Simply put, it was amazing! <br/><br/>Without giving too much away, Alice takes the fight right to Umbrella's doorstep (and includes many of her clones discovered in the end of the third film.) While searching for survivors, she stumbles across Claire and teams up with a group of survivors in LA all the while attempting to survive against a never ending wave of zombies(many of which are similar to the Majini in resident evil 5), a massive Axe wielding giant and the one and only Wesker himself. Anderson succeeded completely with this film which included action, suspense, lots of gore and even some comedy! <br/><br/>Milla Jovovich performed amazingly as Alice and has really developed her character as you will see in this film. Ali Larter also was a knockout as Claire and even gave Milla a run for her money as the tough female star. The supporting cast was amazing and were casted perfectly. Finally the addition of Wentworth Miller as Chris Redfield and Shawn Roberts as Wesker produced potentially the greatest face-of ever seen in a movie (just wait till the fight with Alice, Claire and Chris vs Wesker and you will nearly die of excitement.) Paul Anderson has given us a film that is so much more then ever expected from anyone, taking a popular video game franchise and creating it's very own plot that takes the series to a whole new level. This film will gave any fan of the resident evil series a fangasm without fail. And to those who are not fans of the films, games or even zombies in general you should still consider seeing it as at it's core it is still a near limitless action thrill ride that you don't want to miss.<br/><br/>As a warning, don't listen to major critics for reviews for this film. They over analyze it and fail to see the film for its true geniusness. Trust me when I tell you that you will enjoy the movie be it in 2D 3D or even Imax, its just that damn good. Oh and stick around after the credits as it presents a sneak peak at the fifth film which will certainly made as the film has currently made over 73 million dollars in just 3 days compared to it's 60 million budget (check wikipedia if you don't believe me). Check it out, you have nothing to lose and you will be glad you did."

","I liked previous Resident Evil movies especially the first one. With great enthusiasm I went to theater, hoping to have a fun Friday night. But instead of that I ended up here and writing my first review for this unbelievably bad movie.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Afterlife doesn't have a bad opening scene, but after that this movie show everyone how a movie doesn't has to be. First this movie doesn't have a prologue nor a conclusion. All fight scenes are unrealistic, not looks good, and don't have spirit. Musics are terrible, they are all alike and only head bang you and ruin atmosphere. Acting is bad, really bad, I don't want to be so negative but they don't give me anything good to write here, sorry. Sense of humor can make you vomit. All scary scenes are cliché zombie boo scenes. Almost every visual effect makes you say ""that so much looks like computer made, this too, this too also,..."", come on modern games have better visual effects at these days... and if you look carefully you can see too many illogical things, but I don't want to write here and give spoilers. I kept directing to last, I can clearly say this, that was the worst directing I have ever seen in my life, I don't know whether the director did this on purpose or producers forced him but he ruined movie to take benefits of 3D experience. I think main idea must be ""lets make a good movie, then lets make it 3D"", not ""lets make something in 3D, OK lets make something like movie"", you understand my point I think.<br/><br/>I'm really sad and disappointed for this movie, it is even worse than Alien vs. Predator 2 for me. I'm sure you can find something better to spend your money and time. If you are not really obsessed with 3D, I recommend you to stay away from this movie. (I gave it 2/10, minimum point is 1 and +1 for 3D.)"
"BA_Harrison","7","7","13","7 July 2012"," More of the same... so I'm happy.
","Having sat it out for parts two and three, Paul W.S. Anderson returns to the director's chair for Afterlife, the fourth film in the Resident Evil series; rather unsurprisingly, his film is another slick, effects packed horror/sci-fi hybrid with the emphasis on glossy 3D action set-pieces rather than character development or plot progression. As such, the film is unlikely to alter the opinions of those who haven't enjoyed the series thus far, but the rest should have a blast...<br/><br/>Anderson occasionally goes a bit over the top with his Matrix-style visuals, particularly in the film's opening scene, which utilises an excess of bullet-time effects and gravity defying acrobatics, but for the most part his handling of the action is pretty impressive. There are loads of effective scares, the slow motion gives Jovovich and Larter fans plenty of time to appreciate the stars' physical form, and what the film lacks in originality, it sure makes up for in energy.<br/><br/>The film might owe a lot to other genre classics for inspiration, but once the action kicks in, Afterlife proves to be a very entertaining time-waster indeed. Not all of it makes sense, but with survivors of the zombie apocalypse seemingly comprising of at least 50% hot women capable of kicking major butt (check out that shower room scene with the massive monster vs Alice and Claire for sheer awesomeness) this proves to be another satisfying entry in a consistently fun franchise."
"kels-errific","5","12","26","12 September 2010"," Pretty, yet bad. Pretty bad.
","Yes its a movie about fighting zombies. Yes gravity in this movie is like a yo yo and can be manipulated. Yes its fanciful, but the minute a movie's main hero is able to survive an explosive plane crash, and not really indicate how it was accomplished, you lost me. Alice after being made human through the beginning of the first act, is sent careening, in bullet B U L L E T b - u - l - l - e - t time through an exploding window, and is able to walk away from the debris. Boo, Hollywood, boo. I figured I was in trouble after that, and for the most part I was right. The action was OK, but far from the things I thought I was in store for. The script, horrible. Really bad. I sense the actors care about this movie, and it sucks that they are some of the most two dimensional characters I've seen in a movie, ever. The 3-d was pretty, but it was not enough for me. The movie was poorly conceived. Every now and then, they'd throw things at the resident evil gamers, like a clumsy wink: look gamers, Claire is back! Note her red hair, and vest, you remember her from the games? And Chris! That's her brother, wink wink. But then the movie doesn't really do anything with it. It's like, OK I've got your attention, now get ready for them to act completely opposite of their characters. Chris is kinda creepy, and Claire is actually kind of a b*tch in the movie. The only one who was spot on was the executioner. Alice sees some growth but the rest of the cast is pretty painful, as nothing happens to them. Wesker was all right, but he is basically left to be chewed up and spat out by the horrible lines he has to say. Sometimes, like when the survivors are making their way through burrowed caves, I felt immersed in the film and claustrophobic. Could this train wreck be turned around? Nope, false call. Just potential for something better. The best part of the movie, was the ending cameo from Jill Valentine. She delivered acting that didn't make me cringe, looked hot doing it, and kind of saved the film from getting a three from me, not joking. I feel Paul the writer and director has lost what grip he had on the franchise from the first film. Flirting with a fan boy with greatness to deliver crap is pretty dangerous. This film felt rushed, unpolished and just ugh. Yup, ugh. There will be a fifth film, so I feel more weary of that idea than ever. 5/10"
"kngkvn","10","12","26","10 September 2010"," Simply Amazing
","I have just arrived home back from the theatres and I must say I was VERY impressed with the movie! The 3D special effects were fantastic and really gave you a sense of depth. The lighting was also perfect for this post-apocalyptic style of movie and really added to create and mood to the scene. The plot, in my opinion, was fantastic. I was not a fan of the way Resident Evil: Extinction left off with Tokyo, and I was also not a fan of Alice's supernatural destroy everything power. However, this movie was able to create a logical solution to fix the problem, and continue the flow uninterrupted.<br/><br/>I was nearly jumping out of my seat when I saw Wesker, (and for anybody who thinks Wesker was taken from the Matrix please at least look at the games first) and Chris Redfield appeared. I am also a large fan of the games, and the personalities of the characters matched up perfect between the two.<br/><br/>This is EXACTLY what I was hoping for from a Resident Evil movie. I was satisfied by the first three movies but this one went well above and beyond all my expectations. Fans of the games will also be fans of the movie."
"helmutty","8","12","26","10 September 2010"," A fun 3D movie.
","3D Movies like this are hard to come by this year. This is another movie which used 3D camera to film. The previous movie is Step Up 3D which the 3D is good too. I think only three live-action movies used 3D camera, Resident Evil Afterlife, Step Up 3D and the highly anticipated Tron Legacy. The rest are lazy 3D; notable ones are Clash of the Titans and The Last Airbender. Anyway, the 3D for this is good, I could see at least the effort to bother to get 3D camera to film it. As the usual in recent 3D movies, this does not really contain pop-out images but it brings us to the world where we are like standing next to them; watching the bloody battle between man and zombies.<br/><br/>The story: It is as dead straight as a zombie walking. Alice still survives...and takes revenge on the Umbrella Corps in Japan. And she survives and saves some survivors. Yadayada...I could go on but is there a need to? It is as straight forward as the other three movies; if you can get the story of the other three movies, why not this? Plus this is a familiar video game adaption. The action is there with some cool slow-motion. But the climax is somewhat disappointing. As usual as the other three movies, this has annoying and cheap shock scenes. The director says ""Let's make it scarier by having shock scenes in 3D, people will be screaming!"" Acting wise is the usual, Milla is cool. As usual in zombie movies, there is one annoying character that i couldn't care. Music is good and brings out the atmosphere but sometimes, the pop music is not needed.<br/><br/>Overall: It is a fun 3D movie. You get to see man fighting zombies in 3D. The 3D and the action just immersed me into their horrible world unlike the recent video game adaption. The King of Fighter which makes me a little bored. Since this movie ends with a cliffhanger, I better expect a sequel."

","After destroying the Umbrella Corporation's Headquarter in Tokyo, Alice (Milla Jovovich) heads to Arcadia, in Alaska, seeking for survivors and following the broadcast message that offers security, safety, shelter, food and no epidemics. However, the place has no one but Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) that wears a strange device on her chest and has no recollections. Alice withdraws the electronic device and flies with Claire to Los Angeles, where she sees a group of survivors on the roof of a prison asking for help and under siege of the undead. They land on the roof and they learn with their leader Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) that Arcadia is actually a ship anchored nearby the harbor that has stopped broadcasting the message a couple of days before. Alice and Claire team up with the survivors and they decide to move to the vessel since the crowd of zombies is menacing their fortress. But first they release Claire's brother Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller) that is imprisoned in a cell. But in their journey to Arcadia, they have to fight against the legion of undead and also against a treacherous survivor.<br/><br/>""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" is a pleasant full of action adventure, with two lovely heroines performed by Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter and a cool good guy, Wentworth Miller, in his first feature after ""Prison Break"". Despite the gross continuity mistake when Alice is ready to take a bath and depending on the angle, the shower is spraying water or not, the film is highly entertaining and supported by a good story and great special effects. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Resident Evil 4: Recomeço"" (""Resident Evil: Restart"")<br/><br/>Note: On 01 February 2017, I saw this film again (My vote is seven)."

There is nothing great about the plot and is basic as it can get, no character developments and its not really scary even though there were parts that made me jump.

"jackie-351","4","10","21","12 September 2010"," At least it's improved from the third...
","So after the third film I walked into the theatre at my friend's request with no expectations. It was an endless barrage of violence and it lacks the charm I've found in the games, but it has improved solidly from Extinction which made me wish I could have crawled in a hole and hid. Jovovich clearly lacks talent, either to act or choose roles and films I can't decide, she does well for the part though as a void feminine character to kick ass, because let's face it the movie does kick ass. The characters are clichéd, but the effects are decent and the film does manage to keep you entertained if you shut your brain off and involves more than a bunch of crows and that awful Las Vegas attack scene of the third and Alice (FINALLY) loses those crazy powers that made the third film completely irritating to me. The only thing that bugs me about the franchise aside from that it WON'T die is that Resident Evil has so much potential to be a movie... eerie mansions, genetic mutations, the whole meticulously detailed past of the Umbrella Corporation, it's practically a formula for success... so keep trying Jovovich and crew... maybe you'll get it right someday."
"greenhourfilms2","3","6","11","17 September 2012"," Not as good as the rest but not bad
","Resident Evil: Afterlife is the fourth film in the video game based franchise. This one is just as action-packed as the rest but my only gripe is the plot. While the Resident Evil film series is generally not seen as the most plot heavy series, this one makes the plots of the other entries in the series look complex. Besides that, its a great flick. To me this one reminds me the most of the video games and at certain points, I'm reminded of when I played Resident Evil 4 on the Gamecube. If you loved the other ones, you'll like this one. It's got hot babes in black, zombies, swords, guns, and action. What more could you ask for? (Jill Valentine)"
"politehere","7","6","11","18 April 2012"," Could've been better
","I was watching Resident Evil: Afterlife for the 2nd time on DVD. I'd seen it a long time ago and needed to refresh my memory. I decided to read the reviews on IMDb and I noticed that most of the one-star reviews came first. They're so misleading for such a high-budget movie and probably come from rival movie directors. <br/><br/>I agree that the fourth RE is too pretentious, hollow and a Matrix copy-cat, but none of this justifies giving it only one star, because it does have its moments; cool fight scenes, a fantastic protagonist, lots of cool mindless action, and a cliffhanger type ending. Clair wasn't bad either; especially her battle with the Monster was really awesome. I'd say it's one of the most memorable fight scenes in the franchise.<br/><br/>The change of style in the movie is a tad hard to get used to. I'd like them to go back to the original style; no slow-motion, lots of scares and gory scenes, some suspense, which is lacking because the movie jumps from one location to another before you begin to develop a feel into the atmosphere of the location; from a futuristic base to sky, from there it cuts to snowy mountains, then quickly to some sort of desert, the beach, the sky, the plane, the prison, the ship. Maybe if they had slowed things down a little and made the duration a bit longer and had spent some time on character development, we would've got a far more enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about this movie was that there was no blood. Alice dips knives into the enemies' heads and they don't even seem to feel any pain. There's no emotional element in the movie. The survivors are as good as dead. Most of the characters are useless. You can't even connect with the villain. Nothing makes any sense. I hope they'll fix these problems in RE5, which I cannot wait to see."

","This is a big improvement on my last two horror nights at the multiplex: PIRANHA and THE LAST EXORCISM. That said, it's pretty formulaic. A handful of survivors of the killer virus are holed up in a Los Angeles fortress prison surrounded by thousands of hungry zombies.<br/><br/>Zombies are getting savvier with each successive movie appearance. They manage to tunnel and smash their way in - predictably. Also fairly predictable is who's going to make it to the final reel and who's destined to be zombie snacks. The plot leapfrogs from scene to scene with huge how-did-they-get-here gaps, but series super-heroine Milla Jovovich is in great shape and there's a splendidly hiss-able uber-baddie head of the Umbrella Corp. The 3-D is good and not too 'intrusive'. The zombie attacks are visceral without being too gross. There are some great sets and eye-boggling stunts.<br/><br/>As video-game adaptations go, this pushes all the right buttons."

I couldn't help but notice certain zombie movie cliché's here but they were laughable and I doubt anyone will hold the director for that. Alice is looking kick-ass and she does a lot of dead-ass kicking. With respect to the 3D i think they did a good job.

"gregsrants","7","9","19","17 October 2010"," A worthy addition to the franchise
","It's hard to review a 3-D film when your screener is in two dimensions. I am not talking about the Clash of the Titans or The Last Airbender type 3-D where they tried to convert the film after production. I am referring to a movie that was meant to be in 3-D and was filmed with the proper cameras and style to appreciate the genre. I am referring to Resident Evil: Afterlife.<br/><br/>This, the fourth entry in the franchise, picks up immediately after Resident Evil: Extinction with Alice (Milla Jovovich) continuing to travel the world in search of human survivors after the virus unleashed by the Umbrella Corporation has turned most of the world's population into ultra-violent zombies.<br/><br/>The film opens in a blaze of gunfire as Alice(s) invade the underground lair of the Asian Umbrella Corporation. It is here, she confronts her arch nemesis Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara) for the first time in the series. This confrontation leaves Alice human (do your homework) and almost dead after their getaway transport crashes in the mountains.<br/><br/>Alice then begins her search for other humans. A search that will eventually reunite Alice with fellow kick-asser Claire Redfield (Ari Larter) who was last seen looking for human life herself in Resident Evil: Extinction. The two will travel to Los Angeles where they will band together with a small group of human survivors that include Luther (Boris Kodjoe), Bennet (Kim Coates) and Claire's incarcerated brother, Chris (Wentworth Miller).<br/><br/>With the gang all working together to fight the encroaching undeads, the normal shoot-outs and fisticuffs will ensue – mostly in exaggerated physical sequences that are accompanied by a musical score that almost had my sub-woofer beating through the basement floor.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Afterlife is written and directed by W.S. Anderson, the director of the original Resident Evil, Aliens vs. Predator and Death Race. Anderson is up to his usual tricks in Afterlife. He is good (sometimes real good) at action sequences, but character development and dialogue are trailing behind in all the action. A terrible voice over to introduce the film sets the tone and you get the feeling that Anderson doesn't push his actors (particularly the pivotal character of Albert) into multiple takes until the final product is delivered in the appropriate tone.<br/><br/>When it does come down to the action, Anderson does the franchise proud. There was a great scene involving a wide angle show of a single engine plane leaving a blood streak as it chopped through hundreds of zombie onlookers and another scene of Alice jumping off a building and the zombie faithful following her to their second deaths. Other gun fights and muscle flexings seem to continue far longer than is necessary, however, we do realize that this is what the fan base clamors for.<br/><br/>There are plenty of scenes that look like they would project well in the 3-D format. From sunglasses being flung to a plane crash. Unfortunately in the 2-D format, we can only imagine the difference.<br/><br/>The concluding chapters to Resident Evil: Afterlife were a bit of a letdown. After Alice seems to find a large contingent of human life, she again must confront Wesker who has become pretty much invincible. Their final battle scene might have looked good in three dimensions, but it lacked the great climax we were hoping.<br/><br/>The final scene in Resident Evil: Afterlife strongly suggests a sequel, and why not? The film garnished $59 million of its $60 million budget domestically. But internationally, Resident Evil: Afterlife brought in $200 million more. And with those kind of returns, you can guarantee that the franchise is dead and kicking.<br/><br/>www.killerreviews.com"
"cbryanaw","8","10","22","18 September 2010"," This zombie movie is up and running
","This movie only got a 19% approval rating on some website I'd like to throw rotten tomatoes at. But of course the aforementioned website only has ""professional"" critics writing their reviews. The ""professionals"" are usually sitting on one thumbs while pinching their noses with the other hand when it comes to pure action movies like this.<br/><br/>I'm not going to waste your time with a long synopsis. If you're a fan of the series or this genre, you already know the basic plot; there's zombies and humans, lots of zombies die, lots of humans die. This movie pretty much picks up where the last one left off.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of zombie movies, this is a pretty good one and the best since the original. I'll make this easy for you and break it down into its separate components.<br/><br/>Let's get the bad news out of the way. There's no character development, most performances are limited because of this, and the dialog is unimaginative. But, despite all that, who cares, it's a zombie movie.<br/><br/>Actors (worth mentioning) <br/><br/>Milla Jehovah (Alice) - She's always been very easy on the eyes, still is, and looks great in leather. I think what has kept this series alive is her personality, sex appeal, and stage presence. No, she won't win any Oscars for this performance (the Oscars are BS anyway), but she manages to project all of the previously mentioned qualities just fine. I give her an eight out of ten.<br/><br/>Kim Coates (Bennett) - I always like Kim Coates. He's got the sleazy, wormy, bad guy thing down pat. He did well with what he was given, which wasn't much, but he turned in a pretty good performance. You'll enjoy his wormy behavior in this movie and enjoy it when his character gets what's coming to him.<br/><br/>Ali Larter (Claire Redfield) - She was scorching hot. She did real well with the physically demanding parts of her role and even better with her performance. I think with a little more training, she could turn into a great female action star. I think she would do well with a Laura Croft role or even (if she dyed her hair) a Supergirl part. I give her an eight also.<br/><br/>Wentworth Miller (Chris Redfield) - I never liked this guy, he sucks. Let's move on.<br/><br/>Things I liked: <br/><br/>1) The 3D is totally worth the price of admission. The director (Paul W.S. Anderson), the cinematographer, and special effects people really did a nice job of delivering some very nice shots.<br/><br/>2) Bam, Bam, Bam, the pace was excellent, it moved right along. People criticize it for little or no character development, but in an action movie, (especially one with a history), is it really necessary? I liked the way it moved along WITHOUT a bunch of meaningless chitchat, the less talking, the more action. Besides, most of the new comers don't last that long to care about anyway.<br/><br/>3) Explosions, blood, guts, scream, and shout that's what a zombie movie is all about. What it lacked in tension, it made up with some great action. There were several really great fight scenes, a couple of great explosions, and lots of brains flying every which way.nice.<br/><br/>Look, it's a ZOMBIE movie, you know what to expect. I don't understand why all the ""professionals"" think Shakespeare should be consulted. I like zombie movies and I thought this was a darn good one. So, mister or misses snob, you don't like zombie movies, up your nose with a rubber hose.go see something else and quit ragging on Jovovich."
"HeliosZg","8","10","22","11 September 2010"," The movie was pretty damn good and had some surprises, but due to the thin plot and some weird decisions it didn't quite live up to my expectations...
","First of all, I must warn you: If you're expecting Apocalypse all over again, don't! When I first saw the trailers I was looking forward to Apocalypse (which is still my favorite part) on steroids and ended getting a movie with much less super powered characters and Matrix action. If you think realistically, it was a smart move to make the RE movies more survival horror again, but I'm a huge action movie fan and expected more action and crazy stunts from this 3D movie:/... There's still plenty of action, don't get me wrong, but you can clearly see that most of the 60 million dollar budget was spent on the first and last big fight and influenced the script a lot. The special effects are veeeeeeeeeeeeery good, but frankly if you've seen the trailers and clips, you've seen it all... I would have loved to see more action like there was in the first 15 minutes or so. They kinda wiped all the sci-fi away and we were left with a not so scary survival horror movie with great backgrounds and effects and slightly above average action scenes. And you'll be shocked to see what they did to poor Alice to make her ''more human'' :rolleyes:... But all that aside, the plot is fairly simple, kinda like a RE game back in the days when graphics and character voicing weren't that developed, so they had to keep a simple story. So you could say that this movie truly is the best RE game port to the movies, but it's kinda not enough for the big screen movies when you only look at the plot itself... But hey, we've seen much worse! The acting wasn't anything special either, but frankly you can't expect more from a survival horror... Still, the actors do deliver... Especially Milla, oh I love her so much!:D And many may say they don't like the soundtrack, I love it! It packs so much adrenaline or a sense of no hope... I'm interested to see what they'll do in the next one cause this one is clearly just and introduction to something new and doesn't bring a lot of story with it, plus they've really brewed some stuff together that I have no idea how the characters are going to get away after from, you'll understand me once you see the ''ending''XD... To conclude, you should go watch this movie, but don't expect it to be like in the trailer or in the first 15 minutes... I'd still like to comment on some decisions in the movie that I find questionable, but I'd start posting spoilers then, so no..."

It didn't have any effect on me at all. Why are all the people top models? Why is everyone wearing make-up when they've struggled to survive for years? Why is everyone tightly shaved, all the time? Why do gun's never go empty? The dialog is amazingly bad, full of cliché's like: ""Aahh a family reunion, how very touching"". Come on, you can't do that anymore. This is not the movie to whine about stuff being unrealistic, but it wasn't even tried. At some points I even felt the special effects were bad and completely fake-looking.<br/><br/>The only reason I remember the movie after watching it, was because I felt disappointed in Paul W. Anderson creating such a bad action flick."

","I wasn't a big fan of the first film, and the second film was pretty entertaining with Nemesis, and the third film is my favourite. But man oh man is this film a slap in the face. This film can only be described as dribble for the brain-dead viewer, or painful for fans of Resident evil in general. The new characters were just plain bad, but I did like the inclusion of the Redfields. But they end up vanishing in Retribution, so thats a slap in the face for me. The only thing I enjoyed in this film was the executioner, he was cool as s**t. You know what would be cool, him versus Pyramid head, I'd pay to see that. Well time to get into the flaws. The biggest being the slow-motion. There was so much of it I was laughing in frustration. It completely ruined the action scenes. The Wesker fight scene was disappointing, he is clearly more powerful than Alice. But he loses because he very slowly walks toward her with his mouth open, which allows her to shoot him, it was just stupid. And where did the Los plagues come from, like seriously. And in RE-extinction didn't they say the world dried up, along with the water, but here there is plenty of water. Don't quote me on that I'm still not 100 percent sure on it. This film ended up making nearly 300 million at the box office, which in the directors mind means let's put as little time and effort into making Retribution. If you are looking for a dumb movie, with nothing intriguing, watch it, if not you have been warned."

","If there is an afterlife, and I come back as a snail it will be significantly better than this!<br/><br/>I can honestly say with my hand securely fixed over my shell that this is possibly one of the worst movies ever made. Don't get me wrong there are some terrible movies out there, but this was such a waste of money, time and effort. The story is utterly pathetic, there's no continuity from scene to scene leaving the viewers completely lost. It tries to use the sophistication of the matrix with an awful matrix rip-off style bady. Hello??? How many times will the Matrix be copied. Bad guys with sun glasses have been done to death. The matrix is fantastic but with the constant advances of modern movie making it's actually starting to look slightly dated, why copy it again? There's even a clever pun on prison break in this movie with the introduction of Wentworth Miller, Oh! How ironic because he's locked up inside a cage, inside a prison and this time he can't escape. Guys you just kill me with this cr@p. Surely a monkey with half a brain can write a better story than this. I have never walked out of the cinema and I've been forced to watch some shockers in my time (random dates / girly flicks) but after 10 mins, yes! 10 mins I shuffled in my seat and really considered leaving. I love sci-fi, action films, any good film! I must ask why the money is still being provided to make these productions and why after four movies they still can't find a good writer and director. All in all, don't see this movie, don't fund it! Don't watch, don't even download it! And hopefully they will stop making them. I actually walked out of this movie and said to my wife, ""Baby, lets not come to the cinema for a while now"" I think I need some time away; I daren't now even buy a bag of popcorn. I await Scott pilgrim which has yet to be released here in Thailand. Scott, please come save my world of cinema now!"

","'RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Video game adaptations are almost never successful at the box-office but studios have been working out the kinks to their problems over the last several years (I really liked 'PRINCE OF PERSIA') and they're actually planning many more, realizing that there's a higher built in fan-base for them than even comic book films. The 'RESIDENT EVIL' franchise is one of the few exceptions; it's already kicking out a 4th installment, that killed at the box-office opening day, and it doesn't look like it's the last (It's rare for any franchise to go beyond two sequels). The fans, for the most part, seem overwhelmingly pleased (as of this writing, on it's 2nd day of release) the film has an average IMDb user rating of 7.8 out of 10, from 2,503 votes, and 62.5% of those are a perfect 10! This is a much higher rating than any of the previous three installments and I've heard it's due to the movie's killer 3D effects (which it's only the second film to be made using the state of art 3D effects that 'AVATAR' did, as opposed to converting the movie to 3D after filming) and also the fact that this chapter is supposedly more faithful to the video games (I wouldn't know, I've never played any of them). Writer / director Paul W.S. Anderson (who many consider to be a hack, but just as many also love) once again directs this fourth chapter, after only previously directing the first (although he wrote and produced all four films).<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich returns to her signature role of Alice (a character that isn't from the video games, I know because I read a lot of movie talk). This film takes place right where the last one left off and Alice is leading a team of her clones in an attack on the Umbrella Corporation, the evil big business (representing 'the man') that unleashed a deadly virus on the world, in the first film, which turned most of the world's population into zombies. Alice is the only person that has been successfully combined with the virus (known as the 'T' virus), which gives her super telepathic abilities as well as inhuman speed and strength. After her big attack on the corporation a new deadly villain (played by Shawn Roberts), who's also been linked with the virus to different results, strips her of the virus and makes her human again. She then meets up with an old friend named Claire (once again played by Ali Larter, and she is a lead character from the game) who has amnesia and doesn't know who she is. The two follow a signal, promising a safe haven from the virus, to Los Angeles and meet up with another random group of strangers trying to escape a building surrounded by zombies. The problem is Alice's plane only holds two. So, with the help of a mysterious prisoner there (played by 'PRISON BREAK's Wentworth Miller), they try to find an escape route to safety and the radio signal, coming from a ship, promising it.<br/><br/>The movie does have amazing 3D visuals, which is how I saw it, if not for them I might have gone a half a star lower. Some of the stylized action seems played out and repetitive but for the most part it's entertaining. I wish there would have been more use of the zombies and other creature elements (which it still has it's fare share of) but for the most part it gives the genre fans what they want. I don't know how well it lives up to the video games but I like how each installment has a different feel to it; this one feels more like a traditional zombie movie to me, event though the zombies are in it less. Milla is once again a great action heroine and the supporting cast delivers what you'd expect from this type of film, although Shawn Roberts as the bad guy is too cheesy for me and not in a good way. The movie as a whole is about at the same level as the other three installments, with the second being a little lower and the original being a little higher. I think it's everything it was meant to be and just that.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxjYiwLUko"

","This installment has probably ended the Resident Evil series for good. There is absolutely nothing original or suspenseful here. The cast has no substance, and the most interesting part about Alice's character is removed in the beginning of the movie. Every turn in the movie is expected, and any intended excitement is directed at the wrong audience. Anderson basically took The Matrix, The Island and Resident Evil and combined them into one movie. I did however, love the use of A Perfect Circle's The Outsider remix for this movie. Oh man, it could have been so much better. Shawn Roberts and Milla Jovovich were very cool on the screen, but everyone else and the poor writing killed every scene. Oh, and if you are planning to see this movie in 3D, don't! The 3D glasses make it difficult to see, as most of the scenes are without much light, and the 3D effects are less than amazing. When the movie ended, I felt like I just watched a 10 minute commercial for the actual movie, and the only ones who seemed happy with it were fans of Boris Kodjoe.

The whole movie is great in 3D but the fight scenes will blow you away. The Executioner ""AXE MAN"" is wild. I love all the main players in this movie. Milla is great again.

","Hey it's TVGuy3, and sadly this is the only movie I'll be reviewing this week, since my cousin said the Virginity Hit is a big steaming pile of trash. Anyway, I was a big fan of the Resident Evil franchise ever since it came out on PlayStation. The first movie was a great shocker, the second almost rivaling the first, and the third was showing signs of decline. Now with Afterlife, the fourth installment, I was just looking for a popcorn movie. And it is. But the first three all also functioned as real horror movies. This one is just slashing and shooting. Don't get me wrong, it's a really capable slashing and shooting and Milla Jovovich gives a great performance, but this movie honestly needed more plot. Or a new director. Paul W.S. Anderson is not a good director. Let's just get that out of the way. The thing the first three movies were lacking was good direction. Luckily, the script and the acting were good enough to scare us. But like I said before, the script and acting is just slashing and shooting, which makes the bad direction even more visible. If you're not a fan of the franchise, this is a good horror flick. But if you're a fan of the first three, don't waste your money and be disappointed. If you want slashing and shooting with a real plot, go see Machete. Not this."

","Well, maybe not on the edge of my seat because I was laying in bed but that is not the point. A lot of reviews really bash all the resident evil sequels for being mindless or lacking any enjoyable aspect. I completely disagree. The characters may not be the most developed ones ever but they meet the needs of the movie. You don't really need to know the whole story of every character. The lack of development also adds to the surprise because you don't know them well enough to predict their every movement which is actually refreshing. The continuing action never allows for you to catch your breath. If you turn away for more than a second you will miss something. You have to keep watching. Most movies involving the undead bore me. I don't usually find them very entertaining and I almost never find them scary. Actually I find very few horror movies scary at all but even I wanted to pull the covers over my head a couple times. The only disappointment for me was the ending. I was really hoping for something else. I expected something different from what I was hoping for and from what happened. I guess that is a good thing though. If it ended how I hoped then there would be no point in making anymore movies. If it ended how I expected, there would be nothing to make more movies with. I just feel bad for the characters who are left to endure more of this awful hell. I'm glad I'm not them."

","Easily it will be ridiculous to expect 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' to be anything more than the other films in terms of quality. Here the zombies have mutated into nameless monsters and our heroine, Alice (Milla Jovovich) once again finds herself as a sole warrior battling them until she finds Claire (Ali Larter) in circumstances different from when she last saw her. Together the two find a few other survivors but the zombie population has expanded exponentially and there is only one escape. I enjoyed Resident Evil: Afterlife' more than the third one. The fight sequences are fun to watch (even though they're nothing new) and the mutated monsters are a refreshing addition. Jovovich is obviously very comfortable playing Alice and she is supported well by Ali Larter. I'm not saying they gave phenomenal performance but rather they do the best one could do with such roles in such films. The special effects are good and this one has more energy than its prequels. It's popcorn fun and I can imagine it's more entertaining in 3D."

","Paul W.S. Anderson returns to direct this fourth installment of the incredibly popular franchise. Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter reprise their roles as Alice and Claire. Kim Coates is offered up as our resident ""jerk"", a part he has played so well in so many films. And hats off to Shawn Roberts, who is the best villain of the series so far. While this film is far more expository that the first three, the level of zombie terror is maintained with the addition of mutated zombies who have grown mandibles similar to the Reaper strain in Blade 2. Overall, this film is less satisfying than the previous three, but does resolve some plot issues and returns Alice to humanity. Boris Kodjoe is excellent as the even tempered former basketball star who is trying to keep the small group alive in their fortress, and while Spencer Locke is in the film, her role is so small it barely merits credits. For the adrenaline junkies among us, the opening scenes of the film make the best use of the Alice clones, and the action there is excellent, although brief. The mutated baddie known only as the Axeman is an interesting contrivance, yet too easily done in by Larter and Jovovich. Consider this film a bridge between Extinction and Retribution, which is accented by the brief but ominous appearance of Sienna Guillory (hint: Don't skip the end credits). Rated R for violence and language, like Extinction, if you have them, you have to have this one for the collection."

","In the words of the Beatles, ""Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about"" in the lyrics from ""Strawberry Fields Forever."" And that is an appropriate description of this movie, a continuation of the others, inspired by the video game. Nothing is real, it is all fiction, it doesn't matter if any of it can happen or not. We watch it and appreciate it for the two female action heroes.<br/><br/>As the last one ends we see the hero heading for Alaska, where it is believed that the area is safe, virus-free. They receive periodic radio transmissions from Arcadia. <br/><br/>Milla Jovovich (now married to the writer/director Anderson) returns as Alice, super fighter and able to survive any situation. She gets a plane and flies to the coordinates in Alaska, only to find many other abandoned planes but no settlement, no 'Arcadia.' So she flies south along the coast, past Vancouver, past San Francisco, but she comes upon something in Los Angeles, a 'HELP' sign painted on the roof of a tall building. With a bit of ingenuity she lands the small plane on the roof, barely avoiding going over the edge, down to the masses of undead zombies. Congratulated on her landing she replies, ""That was a crash.""<br/><br/>Her female sidekick Ali Larter returns as Claire Redfield. She really looks like an action hero, with her nice shoulders and athletic build. Also in it are two of my favorites, Wentworth Miller as Chris Redfield and Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine.<br/><br/>They eventually find that the 'Arcadia' is a ship, and it is moored offshore in Southern California, so the climax of the action happens there, after a very narrow escape from the zombies.<br/><br/>There is no end in sight to the series, Jovovich and Anderson can retire making ""Resident Evil"" movies and live very comfortably from residuals."

(Including the way he talks and body language) and many more. Terrible rip-off! Thiz game adaptation is a sequel of three previous movies, chronologically are ""Resident Evil"" (2002), ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" (2004) and ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" (2007). Paul W. S. Anderson takes back his command as Director. In my observation, Anderson is another ""Michael Bay"" type of mindless popcorn Director, who always delivers mind-blowing action with extra excessive situation and seems fully unrealistic, just like what he had shown before in ""Mortal Kombat"" (1995), ""AVP: Alien Vs. Predator"" (2004) and ""Death Race"" (2008).The brainless storyline follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) who continues to fight against Umbrella Corporation, which is now turning the world into zombieland. Like the tagline on the poster says, ""She's back and she's bringing a few of her friends"", the movie is featuring all of the original characters of game version such as Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller) and Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) although she only appears as a Cameo in the ending scene. There is no such a thing called character development in thiz movie, everything is flat. It is 97 minutes with a series of slow motion sequences!

The plot is clear and present for anyone who is paying half attention to the movie they just shelled out $10 to see. I have read several reviews complaining about the lack of zombies or the thin plot or even the fact that the bad guy wears sunglasses, most of these reviews don't even get the lead characters name right despite the fact it is given a dozen times during the film. Yes, Afterlife is not as zombie heavy as the first movie, but not all of the games in the series focus solely on zombies. Why should they when there are so many interesting creatures in the Resident Evil universe? The most important thing to remember is that this is a action movie based off a video game staring a super model! I mean that is awesome, come on.

"blanknamedstuff","8","7","15","24 September 2010"," Great action movie
","I just saw this movie in the cinema today. I know the first thing everyone wants to know will be ""is the 3D really worth the extra cost?"". In a word - yes. I had some trouble adjusting to it (the way I view colors is slightly different from 'normal' vision) but about 20 minutes in I had my focus and thoroughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>There are a fair amount of the cheesy 'traditional' 3D effects (oh look - yet another bullet/shell casing/knife/sword/whatever was thrown directly at the screen for no apparent reason...) in the movie. But what really tips the scales is how much of the normal stuff is in 3D. Every scene in the movie (even the opening credits!) has some 3D element to it, and the backgrounds are simply amazing. Most of the time I felt like I was actually on the other side of the screen watching the story unfold.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the story. Fans of the video games already know; the movies are a universe unto themselves, keeping some characters and locales but creating an entirely new storyline. Anyone who hasn't played the games will be left wondering what's going on from time to time. The executioner is one such character who adds nothing to the plot of the movie, but fans will appreciate the nod in our direction.<br/><br/>In general the story is predictable as it follows the same pattern as the first three but it's relatively good. Before the second half you already know who will survive and who is zombie fodder. There is some good character development with the main pro/antagonists, a little less with the supporting characters, and none with the zombie fodder. But, you already know who they are so you don't really care.<br/><br/>The graphics are great. It's all been done before but it's still visually appealing. The airplane-exploding-in-slow-motion scene is brilliant; one of my favorites next to the beach scene. Again, the 3D is well worth the price and in these cases required to fully appreciate the beauty of the filming. The gore wasn't too over-the-top but I definitely understand the R rating. Older teens (or anyone who has played the games) will be able to handle it though.<br/><br/>If you liked the first three movies you will definitely like this one.

When you sit down to watch this movie just expect to see more slow mo than real time, just the tossing of a gun with no true time urgency in the ""plot"" or getting up off the ground is granted a 30 second slow mo scene. Every scare and action move, or set up I have seen a thousand times before and filmed in much better ways, this might as well have been shot like sin city with as much CGI is hurled into the viewers eyes, and it doesn't look good anyway. I've watched almost all the 3D movies that have come out but this one hurt my eyes. Every time a ""plot twist"" or a ""cool"" line was said I was thinking ""Really?

Claire's fight with the big monster (which I thought first it was Nemesis) made me concentrate on the move even more.. Besides these, I saw that zombies had some modifications :) This movie had more tense scenes comparing to previous ones, which actually made it more exciting for me...

The movie may make you jump a couple of times but nothing too scary or disgusting quite simply put it's Action all the way. The movie has it's draw backs there is 0 character development and you are expected to know who Alice is going in. The other characters are really just there for Alice to have someone to interact with and for the zombies to have someone to kill. Unless you've played the game you won't realize that Shawn Roberts is supposed to be Albert Wesker, who by the way, looks EXACTLY like Albert Weker from the game. This will leave you wondering as to who this man and your left assuming that Alice simply has a personal issue with Umbrella which he is part of. I'd see the 1st 3 installments before seeing this movie. But even if you don't you'll have fun it's not that intricate of a plot where you'll even really care. By the way you'll see a part where Ali Later is all dirty then suddenly she appears on the plane gorgeous with make up and lipstick. Honestly while her character development is very weak she does compliment Mila Jovovich. The characters of Clair Redfield, Alice K-Mart and Luther West all compliment each other well could have done without Mr. Prison Breaks character, Chris Redfield, who always seems to play the same character nonetheless it's a really good movie worth seeing."

","Resident Evil- Afterlife is full of action,horror and some thrilling scenes .The Axeman fight is really a fantastic experience to be watched.

"miggy2929","2","8","18","12 September 2010"," The story starts multiple times but never ends.
","I got a chance to see this movie at a midnight show on opening day in IMAX. The movie look and sounded amazing in Imax. The enormous theater was sold out and many people had to go watch in a non Imax 3d screening playing next door. When the movie started there was a huge applaud and the excitement was felt everywhere. However, during the movie it felt like the audience had just fallen asleep. There were no sounds except at the end when people where whispering stuff like ""what just happened"", ""They ruined it"". Even my girlfriend said she fell asleep for a short amount of time. <br/><br/>Here is the problem. The movie starts and doesn't change the pace. There is no climax, no wow affects, no twists in the story,...just the starting and no ending. They also made it more confusing by trying too many different things instead of keeping the story much simpler like part 1,2and3. This is not a spoiler at all but it seemed to me that they also tried to copy Matrix a little bit. Yes i know, its impossible because they are very different films but apparently someone screwed up. You'll know what i am talking about when/if you see it. <br/><br/>Its hard to write a review without giving away anything so i hope you understand why i am being so vague. All in all this is a 'DVD' movie. I gave it 2 stars for the good implementation of the IMAX and i strongly feel that most reviewers who have given high marks to this film is also for the same reason but the movie 'sucked'. If you are expecting more of part 1, 2 and 3 you will not get it."
"Johnny_086","8","8","18","12 September 2010"," The best of the Resident Evil Saga
","I've seen all Resident Evil movies but not because I'm a RE fan, it's more because I'm a Milla Jovovich fan. I loved the previous ones especially the first one but I think this one is the greatest and show us what is coming next is going to be awesome. Milla is again Alice and she's the best of this film, I fall in love with bad-ass girls and she's the perfect one. The second thing great about this film is the great and awesome action sequences in 3D which is, in my opinion, better than Avatar and any other 3D movie. It's true that the movie doesn't have the greatest plot but it's quite good for what the movie is. Maybe some people will not like the many slow-motion action scenes ""Matrix-Style"", but it shows you the beauty of the 3D can do in a great action movie. <br/><br/>8/10 = The best from the saga, and wait for the next one, I'm sure it will be even better than this one!"

"white_fire4","6","8","18","10 September 2010"," Resident Slow Motion
","Much like the two other sequels, this fourth installment in the great movie adaptation of the popular gaming franchise is different than the ones before it.<br/><br/>Picking up after the third movie, Alice is seeking revenge on Umbrella's Tokyo Underground Base, specifically Wesker, and as she promised, she brings a few friends along. The beginning is a very clear sign of just how much slow motion is in this film, as we watch what is assumed to be the first zombie outbreak in Tokyo, painfully slow as the camera crawls up along a woman standing in the rain as people walk past her, during which the credits flash about. Finally, as expected, she attacks someone, lights go out across Tokyo, Japan, and the whole world as the camera pans way back, skipping ahead four years to where the third movie left off, and slowly going back down again.<br/><br/>We are treated to Alice's invasion of the underground lab, and in a nod to the first film, 3D wire frames of the immensely massive building are used constantly throughout the opener to this movie. As she goes after Wesker, we are shown that is in fact her clones from the end of the third movie attacking, using the powers that apparently, all her clones share and that were shown in the previous two sequels.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, they strip these powers away, via Wesker injecting the real Alice with antibodies that destroy the T Virus within her. Which brings up about the only really confusing part of the movie, as she literally right after survives a helicopter crash and walks out pretty much unharmed.<br/><br/>Skipping six months ahead, she seeks out Claire and K-Mart in Alaska, and thus begins the actual movie itself. As she searches for everyone, mysteries pop up, and she meets new people, yet again, including Claire's brother, Chris (who unfortunately has no real point in being in the movie) and your typical group of people (Black guy, Asian guy, dickhead guy, hot lady who dies about 10 minutes after we meet her, perv guy) Arcadia turns out to be a ploy by Umbrella to gather survivors, to keep testing the virus on them. Why, you never really know, it doesn't seem like there would be much point, since the impression is that the world is pretty much destroyed. Once they find this out, it's time for revenge on none other than Wesker, who as was hinted at at the beginning, is infused with the virus as well, much like Alice.<br/><br/>Not an overly complicated story, and aside from the why of it all, it works. It is, of course, left open ended once again, with a surprise cameo from Sienna Guillory, which incorporates plot elements from the recent Resident Evil 5, which was nice to see. And it does leave you wanting more.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, slow motion is used to the point of you sitting there and going ""Why?"" There is more bullet time in this movie than the previous three combined, there is even a freeze frame shot of the helicopter crash in the beginning with Wesker and Alice, which as far as I could tell, served no real purpose. It's neat looking, yes, but....doesn't really have anything to do with how she survives it, or him for that matter. There's slow motion of Alice jumping off buildings, jumping off ropes, throwing stars, jumping through glass, falling down a shaft, shooting zombies in the head, there's a ~seriously~ stretched out fight between Claire and a hooded hulk of a zombie with an axe to match his size, where quite literally at least an entire minute and a half is them running, looking at each other, looking at the gun on the ground, and running towards each other, before Claire finally ducks under him and shoots him while sliding along the floor...in slow motion.<br/><br/>I was sitting there thinking they did this on purpose just to make the movie longer, and also wishing they would just hurry up already.<br/><br/>When they do finally fight Wesker, slow motion goes into over drive, as does the bullet time, with the movie finally incorporating the awesome fight scenes we've seen in the games with Wesker essentially beating the living hell out of everyone, and it is quite awesome and fun to watch. Unfortunately, since they did so much slow motion before that point, it's a bit anti climatic.<br/><br/>And then unfortunately, Wesker gets stupid villain disease and is dispatched of incredibly easily. If you're a fan of the games at all, you will be cringing at the end when you see what happens to him.<br/><br/>Once again, the music is also completely different from the others, and the awesome tunes from the first one do not make a return, although some of the sound track is very interesting to listen to.<br/><br/>The acting is great, the story is decent, and the graphics are amazing. Way too much slow motion makes what few fight scenes there are tedious, and underwhelming, and since the ending is basically just a set up for a fifth movie, it leaves you a bit disappointed, once again."
"moleman-10","10","9","21","16 September 2010"," Alice is back
","OK, I love this movie series and have super duper HQ extended versions that I can watch over and over. File this alongside those. BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO BE F*****G KIDDING ME! This is the movie series that ""will not die"" as in we'll never have any resolution to it. Just when you're ready to say, ""Whew! It's ovah!"", they ""kinda"" intimate at the end that this isn't the end--guess as long as Milla lives there'll be another one (and maybe when she gets too old to do this they'll just drop in a holographic version of her) (no offense to Milla intended--I'll take a forever Milla/Alice in a heartbeat). Because it is based on a comic/video game and comics/video games never die (unless they're so bad that no one reads or plays them) I shouldn't have been surprised. What a naif I's am. If you loved the first three (and are looking forward to 5-?), you'll have a ball with this movie over and over.<br/><br/>Alice is one of the great characters male or female in movie history, and Milla has been a rare treat to enjoy as she's fleshed out the role for four (more to come!) continually evolving movies in this series. Kudos to the director and all who brought this to life. It is rare for me to say it, but this is one movie I will buy."
"DarkVulcan29","5","10","24","13 September 2010"," a standard uninteresting film
","I've never played the video games, and the films I was a little entertained, except part 2 <br/><br/>Mila Jovavich is amusing as Alice, so was Ali Larter as Claire. But the rest of the characters are just so uninteresting, we have seen these types of people before in other types of horror flicks. It does have one or two scares, and the effects and action are what keep this film above ground. But there are characters who are never explained too well, they throw them in, they figure that fans of the game don't need an explanation, but what about people who never played the game.<br/><br/>Only good for the effects and action, other than that it's a standard uninteresting zombie film."
"montera_iulian","4","5","10","6 October 2010"," I just lol'd my pants watching this nonsense...
","Where to begin? I just laughed at the ratings for this movie. I think this movie, is the most non-resident evil movie from all. When I went to see this movie I thought I'll see what the trailer first offered me. Great visuals, amazing 3D but nonetheless non-stop action (that means a lot of killings) and a logical story to continue the series but what I witnessed was terrible.<br/><br/>The story is that ridiculous I won't even comment on it. It has no logic, and it's simply written just to add stupid escapes and stupid action scenes that most part of the usual audience will find ""awesome"". Well it's not because it's dumb. The first resident evil movie was good so was the second but then they started to get more annoying than anything. Now they came up with this movie which doesn't even deliver what most of the resident evil fans want. You don't get enough killings but you get a lot of pointless monologues and pointless remarks. The twists are so obvious they might give you a headache. As far as being concerned about the acting... well... guess what... that was terrible too.<br/><br/>The visual style the movie was so and so. And here's why. Technically the 3D was pretty good because it had some scenes that requested the 3D technology but besides that there's nothing else. I mean, the visual effects are above average. You see that behind the actors is a green screen most of the time and that airplane scene where Milla landed on that building is the proof of that not to mention it's another proof for how stupid this movie is. The cinematography was very good but the special effects just ruined the whole thing to me. The editing was so bad as far as the sound goes. I just felt this movie was rushed because you can't have that bad of an editing unless you need to send the movie and it's not ready yet so you rush things up. The soundtrack or the score or whatever you wanna call it started to be catchy but ended up being dull and boring.<br/><br/>Another thing I hated in this movie was those slow-motion scenes and the action-scenes that rip-off The Matrix or Blade. You get one slow motion scenes each 10 minutes for every bullet that gets shot. That was hilarious and so irritating. This movie is just pathetic and not original at all and judging by the ending there will be a Resident Evil 6 which looks even more stupid than this one. I just can't stand when you take a good idea and you ruin everything. You don't have enough action and the action scenes you have are dumb, you don't have any logic, you don't deliver any interest in the characters in the movie, you don't deliver any atmosphere and when you have that music which is a good choice but the effect is zero then things are pretty sad.<br/><br/>This movie deserves ""a big f**king fail"" and I just lost 5 minutes of my life to type this short-review."
"RyanEberhart","10","6","13","1 September 2013"," Awesome!
","Again, I love these movies! Milla Yovovich is back and better than ever, especially when the movie starts with multiple Milla Yovovich's in the character of Alice as clones of the real Alice.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Afterlife tells the story of the last of the human population that remains after the undead takes over planet Earth. It's not a story of defeating the enemy, it is the story of surviving. Some survive longer than others.<br/><br/>Because this is the fourth movie of five, with a sixth one in the works, the fight scenes have to be more elaborate, the story has to be more involved, and the rest of the movie has to be action packed with little breathing room... and that's what we get in Resident Evil: Afterlife.<br/><br/>Alice is back and she has a few friends, at least at the beginning. Alice brings several clones with her to attack the base for Umbrella in China. They are successful in gaining entrance to the facility and killing at least a hundred or two of Umbrella's Chinese contingent, but their main objective is the chairman of Umbrella himself, Albert Wesker. Wesker, played by Shawn Roberts, escapes the facility, setting off a cleansing explosion to rid him of the Alice clones and hoping that Alice herself is among them. Unfortunately, or fortunately, whichever way you decide to see it, Alice lives. She attacks Wesker as he is trying to escape, but Wesker has a surprise. Wesker injects Alice with a serum that neutralizes the T-Virus and reverts Alice back to being JUST human. Alice thanks Wesker. The plane they are in crashes and we see only Alice has apparently survived. Of course this is my first favorite scene, but you knew that.<br/><br/>My second favorite scene is a short one. It's the scene where Alice and Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) are in the Yakovlev Yak-52, a Russian aircraft, and they are attempting to land on the roof of a prison in Los Angeles. They are successful, but just barely. Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) helps by running across the prison roof in time to jump up and grab the tail of the plane pulling it back down before the plane topples over the edge of the roof. Pretty good scene.<br/><br/>The third of my favorite scenes is when Alice and Chris Redfield, Claire's brother, go to the armory of the prison. To do this they have to swim down two floors and over several yards because the sump pumps need electricity to work and the electricity has been out for a long time. They are joined by Crystal, played by Kacey Barnfield, and make it through the water. Before they can get away from the water too far, Crystal is attacked and taken. Alice and Chris (Wentworth Miller) make it to the armory; Alice is impressed.<br/><br/>Since my second favorite is a short scene, I'll give a bonus favorite. My fourth favorite scene is the fight scene between Alice and Wesker, along with Claire, Chris, Bennett, and two infected dogs that Wesker seems to be able to control. Alice ends up knocking Bennett (Kim Coates) out and kills both dogs. One of the dogs is killed when Alice kicks a large piece of falling glass towards the dog who has jumped towards Alice. The glass impales the dog, killing it instantly. Alice then defeats Wesker, and leaves with Claire and Chris, leaving Bennett locked in the room with a seemingly defeated Wesker.<br/><br/>A short bonus favorite scene is when we see Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) for the first time since the second movie. However, she is only in the final scene of the movie. Jill is the commander of a strike force sent to the ship Arcadia to recapture all those on board, especially Alice.<br/><br/>I give this movie 10 stars out of 10. I loved it! I thought it was the best one yet. How could it get better? Read the next review on Resident Evil: Retribution to find out.<br/><br/>Oh, I forgot to mention the scene with the eight foot tall mutant. It takes place in the shower. At some point the mutant knocks some water pipes out and water is flying everywhere. This scene is awesome because Claire and Alice are now fighting the mutant in skin tight wet clothes. AWESOME! Hey, what can I say, I'm a guy. Get over it!"
"s264445","5","8","19","12 September 2010"," Could have been could great
","I am a fan of the Resident Evil series despite(not yet anyway) not playing the games. I know the games and movies are different and I hear complaints about that, but that is actually a good thing. The movies took elements from the games and made the movies. If the movies follow the game exactly, well then, it would be boring. Might as well play the game.<br/><br/>Anyway, about this movie. The movie was being advertised as 3D (which is overrated to begin with) and they may have done more harm then good to the movie. In the action parts of the movie they really played with the effects way to much using slow motion and close ups and it really ruined the action. The more I watched it, especially the beginning, it was like the writers wanted to show what the Matrix or 300 would have looked like in 3D.<br/><br/>The movie itself had a good storyline despite what other critics have said. It is continuing from the previous movie so if you haven't seen the other 3 then this one would be boring. The movie also had a Dawn of the Dead feel, just like the 3rd one had a Road Warrior feel. It had action in the beginning, the characters staying refuge in the middle, then escaping in the end. The best part was the part in the middle, where they were in the prison, didn't last long like the whole mall part in Dawn of the Dead did, so the movie didn't drag too much.<br/><br/>The movie overall was good and it could have been great if they wouldn't have played with the 3D so much. All the slow motion in the beginning and the end was pointless. Also, there are some other parts I hated, like, they (Claire and Alice) meet some survivors and here we are in the end of the world, no malls, no hot water, etc., but yet they are clean and done in makeup and what not. And after Alice runs into Claire, Claire is a mess. She gets tied up but in the plane she is in makeup and looks hot. Be real here, 5 years after the end of mankind people wouldn't be looking like they are going for a photo shoot here. The people taking refuge in the prison have to be told of the armor vehicle. I don't know about you, but if I am stuck somewhere having to survive then I would search every square inch of that place. Those reasons made this movie a potential 8 to a 6. I gave it a 5 (almost a 4) because of the ending. As much as I like the series, I kind of wanted to see it end. The find survivors on the ship, and they kill the head guy of Umbrella, now just end they movie. All they are going to do now is start the growth of mankind again and we don't need to see that. Instead a bunch of planes start coming and they are under attack. Now is the time to end it.<br/><br/>Anyway, overall, good, could have been great if some certain, little aspects were changed, and it is now time to end the series."
"JoeSkoal","3","8","19","11 September 2010"," Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) POOR Storyline
","The 3D was good but not great. Very little zombie killing which was a disappointment. All the good stuff was pretty much what I watched in the trailers. This movie basically played on the idea that the first 3 movies were hits to fans so they add 3D and a poor storyline. I went with all 4 of my boys and we all agreed that the villain acted more like a poor impersonation of Agent Smith (Matrix) less the Carl Sagan voice.<br/><br/>Yes, this is based on a video game but the storyline missed the mark for a 4th movie following 3 epic movies for Resident Evil fans.<br/><br/>It is very hard to review this movie without spoilers, so I will leave it alone and just say I would not see number 5 if it comes out. Yes, this movie will leave you guessing at the end.<br/><br/>This movie does not qualify as a followup to the plots of the first 3 and if you never saw the movie series you will still be disappointed."

","The visual effect was pretty good, I really enjoyed! There were a lot of idea from Resident Evil 5 (video game) like the characters, the huge zombie with the blade-hammer, and Albert Wesker was the same as we saw him in the game (abilities, clothes, skin). But the screen-play was awful, the plots just putted together without any concept. It's a pity because this film could be a very good one, but not this way. I have no idea why don't use the game storyline in this movie... And Mr. Scofield as Chris Redfield, well it was funny to me:)<br/><br/>So the visual effect was good, but the 3D was nothing extraordinary... The story was lame, the screenplay was awful... What a pity..."
"dvc5159","3","7","16","25 September 2010"," I'm sorry, but exploiting 3D does not make entertainment.
","We live in a time where entertainment can be mindless fun. So as long as they do not try to be what they can't. Then it's good fun. ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" is not good fun. Why? Some say repetitive, others say it's boring, flat, dull and dark. Only when the action comes do we get some real ""cool"" entertainment but that's it.<br/><br/>Heavily inspired by ""The Matrix"" the action sequences show no mercy in assaulting the senses. It's all there: slo-mo, bullet time, black sunglasses, lots and lots of bullets and slo-mo explosions, everything. Just add a few zombies to make sure they (the filmmakers) look like they're not ripping fans of the original games and film trilogy, and make it part of the franchise. Apparently they DO rip off the audience, there's very few zombie butt-kicking than in the previous three; save for that big brutal monster with the giant axe in the middle of the film which gives the film one of its pluses.<br/><br/>There's virtually no story to speak of, just brief introductions to the next action sequence (and at the ending, an inevitable sequel to keep this dead horse running). Milla Jovovich looks good but she starting to look bored. Ali Larter, Boris Kodjoe and Wentworth Miller don't even bother about characterization apart from the fact that they look fit and hot. The cinematography, production design and visual effects are solid but the complementing music by Tomandandy is just too electronic and distracting. It's as if they're trying too hard to be hip.<br/><br/>Speaking of trying too hard to be hip, the Matrix-inspired action has 3D to make it look even better. I'll admit, director Paul W.S. Anderson really jumped on the 3D bandwagon and put it to good use. The 3D is solid, with the bullets and blood and that giant axe all flying toward the screen and towards the audiences' faces.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the question: why bother? 3D is meant for fantasy/sci-fi films with out-of-this-world situations. It does not fit in any action/horror film, and it is NOT supposed to be used as a gimmick. People don't go to the movies to see the 3D as advertised; rather they go to the movies to watch a story and get into a fantastical world. 3D can be used as a tool to get them immersed into that world (e.g. ""Avatar"", ""How To Train Your Dragon""), not as a tool to show off and be proud of itself. And that is exactly what happened to ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"". The film's action sequences in 3D is merely exploiting the format and is equivalent to an outdated old man wearing hip-hop clothes and screaming ""Hey, look at me! I'm hip! I'm fresh!"". This kills the film and makes it look desperate and lame.<br/><br/>I apologize to those who reject my review. There will always be lovers as well as haters. These are just merely my thoughts, and who's to stop you from going to see the movie. But this 3D film is absolutely pointless to watch in my humble opinion, with no standing out qualities (apart from the pointless but well-made 3D). I'd rather not watch this one again.<br/><br/>Overall value: 34/100"
"shreeshabhat","1","7","16","23 September 2010"," 3D is not a substitute for a plot.
","There is no doubt that 3D technology has taken the whole movie- watching experience to an entirely new level. Directors like James Cameron proved themselves to be masters of 3D, taking us to an incredible universe with Avatar. But there are also directors like Paul Anderson, who seem to believe that 3D is a tool to cover up a complete absence of any vestige of a plot.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of the Resident Evil franchise or the video game, and I have not watched all the previous movies. But a movie should be made for everybody and not for one set of fans. Resident Evil: Afterlife falls flat on all counts: the plot is thinner than the cross- section of a human hair, the performances are plastic, the action sequences are poorly choreographed and in some cases look like straight rip-offs from The Matrix. <br/><br/>There have been numerous movies on the same theme: a virus destroys most of humanity, and there's a small group of survivors trapped among the zombies, and they have to get to a safe house. This theme was brilliantly explored in movies such as I am Legend, adorned with Will Smith's masterpiece of a performance. But the Resident Evil series goes through it over and over again, offering nothing new. Then there are some pointless flashback scenes just to give an impression that this movie is part of some magnificent franchise. And on top of everything else, there are the added superpowers which the evil guy acquires, and the closing scene in which thousands of helicopters close in on the survivors' ship, paving the way for another sequel. Which i'm definitely not watching, nor recommending.<br/><br/>The only bright spot of the movie is the presence of Wentworth Miller, if you're a Prison Break fan. Apart from that, the needless slow- motion stunts laced with an overdose of CGI (all in 3D) do not add up to anything resembling a movie."

There should be a battle against the despair of a world falling apart and the clinging to hope. I didn't see any of this in this movie.<br/><br/>I don't want to say too much about what actually happens in the movie as I'm sure there are plenty out there that want to see the movie despite negative reviews like mine but.... WHERE ARE THE ZOMBIES???? There is soooo little action with the zombies it doesn't feel like a zombie movie when it should.<br/><br/>Finally i want to talk about the 3D effects i saw in the cinema, outside of an IMAX theatre this was the first time i have seen a ""3D"" movie. I was very disappointed i cannot believe that this was shot with 3D cameras it just didn't feel right at all, i have a feeling that it was shot on 2D and then re-engineered into 3D. i found the 3d effects very off-putting and didn't really see how they added to the movie and it a lot of ways they distracted me from the movie as i was internally groaning at the effects instead of watching the ""action movie""(lets not call this a zombie movie every again).<br/><br/>Having said that the opening shot was awesome, it really builds the suspense and the music and visual effects had me gasping for breath, but it was all downhill after that.<br/><br/>I am really disappointed."
"Timstuff","1","7","16","17 September 2010"," It's trash, but you should know better by now.
","This movie was not worse than I expected. However, it wasn't really much better, either. I'm not going to nitpick apart all the places where it failed to do justice to the games it (falsely) claims to draw inspiration from, and frankly there's plenty of other stuff wrong with this movie to warrant a bad review. Pretty mucht 90% of the movie is shot in slow motion, and Milla Jovovich is still just as obnoxious of a female protagonist as she's ever been. Not only is she doing the female equivalent of Christian Bale's Batman voice for the whole thing, but now she makes video blogs throughout the film to convey exposition, which adds an extra layer of tedium to the film's already tedious first half. Secondary characters for the most part only occupy space (BTW, is it just me, or does Ali Larter's face constantly look like it needs to be slapped?), Shawn Roberts eats the scenery like he's in a fan film playing Agent Smith from The Matrix, and there's YET ANOTHER ridiculous amnesia plot device thrown in to conveniently prevent Paul W.S. Anderson from having to write convincing relationships between his characters.<br/><br/>This game does borrow a few elements from the games, but for the most part it borrows from Resident Evil 5 which is unfortunate since that's one of my least favorite in the series-- especially the scarabs, which IMO were a lazy plot device and they're used just as lazily in this film as they were in the game. Again, I don't want to overemphasize what was changed from the games, because even though these things are frustrating to me as a fan they are not ultimately what makes this movie bad. It's Anderson's ridiculously overwrought sense of ""style,"" the brain-dead script, the acting which ranges from lethargic to mustachio-twirling levels of ham, and the overall goofiness of the whole thing. I can't say I was disappointed though. It was not any worse than what I expected, and honestly anyone ought to be able to tell what kind of movies these are just by looking at the posters. They're essentially Paul Anderson's multi-million dollar birthday presents for his wife, who happens to play the main character.<br/><br/>Also, I must mention the 3D, which is of mixed quality despite it's claims of ""using the technology behind James Cameron's Avatar."" The 3D is just as spotty and obnoxious as the rest of the film, and when things aren't flying in your face, they're either too blurry and distorted to make out or just plain 2D looking. However, the extra $3-5 that it adds to the ticket prices has helped ensure that this will be the most profitable movie in the series and that Paul WS Anderson won't stop making them any time soon. My patience for the medium is fast dwindling, and I think next time I see a movie I'll save a few dollars and ask for 2D."

The special effects was fantastic, new important characters from the games come in the distribution (Albert Wesker and Chris Redfield), more monsters (like the game Resident Evil 5) and at the end after in the credits we saw Jill Valentine doing some action for another Resident Evil movie... But i saw the movie in french and i really disliked the Albert Wesker voice and i thought in the introduction of Chris Redfield, we do a mistake because, it not mentioned he came from the S.T.A.R.S.Finally, like i said before i like the movie and i'm pretty sure Leon S.

"galahad58-1","7","7","16","11 September 2010"," Not Bad
","Resident Evil: Afterlife is not going to be considered one of the greatest movies of our time, nor would it be considered very good. RE is an average film that has been made more palatable by the 3D camera. While the acting, the story and the direction are all equivalent to a straight to DVD movie, the 3D effects make is surprisingly entertaining to watch in the theater. The story is so full of holes and bad dialog that you have to be able to ignore all of that and allow yourself to be engrossed into the 3D effects upon the screen. The 3D looks marvelous and the camera makes the film come to life. One thing that is highly irritating about the entire Resident Evil series is the consistent effort by one corporation to destroy all of mankind. Let us be real folks--people want power to have women (or men), money, to enjoy and have things others do not have, to have the finer things in life and to have control over others. If the world is gone--if everyone is dead---if there is no money--then every single survivor in essence is in power--but power that is not desired. That consistent drive to kill everyone by Umbrella is just stupid and annoying."

","The beginning despite being ""inspired"" from Matrix promised a lot. Though all good things come to end but it should not be this quick. The movie loses pace and viewers' interest as well. One does not expect acting skills in movie based on a game and in this you should not expect a ""script"" either. Characters come in abruptly and have no defined role in the movie. Jovovich does what she does best but nothing even close to special or jaw-dropping. Miller & Larter are the biggest waste. But can't blame the actors when they have no script to display their talents.<br/><br/>The few positives: 3D, background score and screenplay. Afterlife is one of the better 3D movies. Very well shot with appropriate camera angles, the screenplay is as per the requirement and the background score when the action begins is impressive.<br/><br/>Go watch only if you are Resident Evil fan or have nothing else to kill time."

","About time. GOD! i've been waiting for this movie since last year. <br/><br/>I am a huge fan of the RE games and played em all. I know that a lot of fans weren't happy with the movies and the creation of Alice. I think it's amazing. Paul's done an amazing job. The first RE was pretty different from the game yet so entertaining and scary! It would've been a lil boring to watch an RE movie almost identical to the game. Alice is such an amazing character. Her evolution... pure awesomeness!<br/><br/>Resident Evil Afterlife was pure fun with kick-ass action sequences. The first 15 min were like 'OMG moments' the clones breaching Umbrella HQ, the explosion and what not! Shawn Roberts was definitely an amazing Wesker. Milla Jovovich looked hot like always. The movie was a lil darker than the previous 3. The post-apocalyptic/special effects were too good. Although i felt the movie could've been a lot better, the emotional element which has always been a huge part of the RE series was missing. The reunion between Claire and Chris was dry. The fight sequence btwn Wesker and Claire with Chris was out of the world. It was as if it's been taken direct from Resident Evil 5 itself. The best part was that they actually included elements from Resident Evil 5. The Executioner, the majinis with tentacles coming out of their mouth. The plagas infected dogs.. added a spark to this sequel. Oh and how can we forget the POST-CREDITS SCENE where we... umm, for that you'll have to find out yourself! (I literally screamed 'hell yeeeah')<br/><br/>The movie is not the best RE movie (Extinction was better) but definitely a kick-ass sequel. I've seen it once and i've got the tickets for tomorrow AGAIN, 3D this time. Critics have been really mean to the movie, they're always. SO IGNORE the CRITICS! And watch it. CRITICS suck. Trust me you wont be disappointed."

None of that have been good by movie standards, none of them have been good by fanboy standards. Resident Evil is one of the only things I have ever really been a fanboy of. And, of course, fanboys are never pleased. That's just what it is. The games have even been steadily declining. The movies are just plain awful. I won't lie, the first movie wasn't too bad. It was alright because it was general. They made a new story line and were going with it. Cool. But then, they started to try to intertwine the game stories and the movie's story, and it just makes no damn sense. There are two kinds of people who like the RE franchise. Those who like the games and movies because it's about zombies, and that's enough for you. Cool, it's general, there's zombies, and there's blood. Awesome. But, I am a fan of the franchise because of it's in-depth storyline, and its character development. And the movies have none of that. And, putting aside the fact that this is a remake of a video game, it was just a bad movie in general. It was short, I couldn't find a real storyline, and there was way to much slow motion. And hell, the antagonist was in only two scenes of the movie. That's just unacceptable."

They should act more zombie blasting in the movie at least. The final showdown between the bad guy and Alice also not exciting and not interesting, the only fighting scene interesting is when the scene where Alice battle the zombie at the root top, and running shooting the zombie in slowmov.<br/><br/>is very obvious they don't know how to move the story from the previous episode, so they just kill all con Alice's and also Alice's power at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>if not for Milla, i think this is a cheap B rate movie just try to ride on the 3d bandwagon to make some quick buck.<br/><br/>for the audience, there's a shot in the middle of the credit roll, so don't leave too early."

Alice was the only person that successfully bonded with the t-virus, the point of afterlife was for umbrella to capture her. As in the second one it states very well. The only thing that was bad with this movie was they focused too much on the 3d and not the character development. IF they would of developed more on that, it would of been an outstanding movie. Leon ( a popular resident evil game/in resident evil: degeneration) is going to be in the next one and i already can call it that people are going to bitch about not knowing anything about Leon and the character development sucks.

","I'm a big fan of zombie movies and especially Resident Evil, so I'm sad to write this review.<br/><br/>I honestly don't fully comprehend what I just saw. It feels like the only thing that the director wrote down in his notepad for executing this movie was; lots and lots of macho music and action ---> clever before-fight line from an actor ---> more macho music and action on slow motion. <br/><br/>The characters of this movie were dull and had no personality. You can't feel any sympathy for them or relate to them in any way. At least I couldn't. In the earlier Resident Evil movies the main point was to follow how people react to mass destruction and it was all about survival. Or at least thats how I saw it. The Umbrella stuff was always there but in Afterlife the ""plot"" is all about the fight between umbrella and normal people in middle of zombieland. <br/><br/>And talk about errors.. When Claire was fighting with the Axe guy I was happily surprised when she blinked her eyes every time she fired her gun. But in the end when Chris and Claire are shooting Wesker, she has a stone cold face and doesn't blink even once.<br/><br/>This newest Resident Evil is missing all the fun, all the excitement, all that made sense and all the compassionate characters. It just feels like it's trying to bring all the characters from the games in the middle of a big messy pile of matrix in slow-mo that you call Resident Evil: Afterlife."

","After 4 years of the so called evil corporation ""Umbrella"", we still haven't gotten tired of this particular franchise. As entertaining as it may seems, we might be getting a little tired of Mila Jovovich being undefeatable (even though she doesn't have any powers in this film) by the undead zombies. The plot is simple and straight forward. Alice (Jovovich) continues her journey on trying to destroy the whole Umbrella Corporation. Joining her this time is Ali Larter (Heroes), Wentworth Miller (Prison Break), and Boris Kodjoe (Undercovers). Not that this cast is any better than its previous instalment. Though it may be in 3D, but few scenes actually worked in 3D. Paul W.S. Anderson's (directed the first Resident Evil) directing is as bad as it can be. The camera angles weren't right and he just doesn't know what to do with the material on his hands. Resident Evil: Afterlife may serve as a treat for fans, but critics find this bad for your teeth."

","Tokyo slow-mo opening scene was amazing.<br/><br/>Soundtrack is out of this world, it felt authentic but at the same time brought back good old MM feel from original RE. I re-watched the movie and almost every time I heard a track on background it felt as if it was taken from some other movie (except the opening). Honestly, RE:A doesn't deserve it just because they are on completely different levels but it saves the movie for me, plus the pacing of it.<br/><br/>It's a super cheese fest, sometimes I even felt as if watching a Bollywood movie - on a brink of a laugh. At the very least I had a grin.<br/><br/>Performances. Well, Jovovich is good but best performance goes to Kim Coates, even being as small as it is. And Wentworth Miller is so Prison Break... seems like he adapts one attitude to everything, no diversity.<br/><br/>Besides that I don't like movies which change cameras for some of scenes, they feel out of place, the well known FPS is different and it just destroys that momentary believability you have, if you can have one for RE:A at all.<br/><br/>Yet I think it's a good evening entertainment watch and if you have a keen ear then the OST should become one of your favorites."

When this movie makes it to DVD and BluRay it needs to be released in 3D or again it will look stupid with all the stuff being put in your face.

The originals director/writer Paul W.S. Anderson thankfully returns the reigns and puts the series on track, especially by making our heroine more human and like the character of Resident Evil (2002).<br/><br/>Milla is made for the role of Alice and looks particularly in shape and focused in this action orientated continuation of the Capcom game adaptation, as too is Ali Larter as Claire Redfield, although she is underutilised.<br/><br/>Gamer fans will be pleased with appearance of game baddies and Chris Redfield played by Wentworth Miller. Boris Kodjoe is has a lot of screen presence, however, his and many of the other characters are not fleshed out or have enough dialogue nor time to make an impact. Afterlife lacks the depth and foreboding atmosphere of the first film but is more fun than Apocalypse and Extinction despite the hammy acting and overuse of slow-mo.<br/><br/>The Redfield bother sister relationship is left unexplored and there appears to be a lot of missed opportunities. That said, these threads may turn up in future squeals, however, you can't help feel a little short changed as the plot feels to just scratch the surface.<br/><br/>There's still a lot to like, zombies, guns, sword-play and explosions. Fantastic stunts, great sets, costumes, special effects and a pumping score. Sienna Gilroy's cameo sets it up for another tantalising sequel, however, every instalment in the series has done the same, let's just hope RE5 delivers in all departments.<br/><br/>Overall, Resident Evil: Afterlife is immense sci-fi fun, but alas chooses style over substance."

An episode in which only one thing of great import happens, but it was something we knew would happen, something we wanted to happen.

","Though this series of Resident Evil did not hit the theaters, it's still watchable by all means. Umbrella is at it again with their schemes. The place called Arcadia was supposed to be a safe haven turned out to be a trap by Umbrella. Alice (Milla Jovovich) first takes on Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), who would later rob her of her powers, and later crash land and find an amnesiac Claire (Ali Larter). The duo would later go to Los Angeles, ravaged. And would land in prison. With no guards, or inmates they and other survivors try their best to survive against the undead. One of them is a director would betray the bunch and head out to Arcadia: A large cargo ship which happens to be a front for Umbrella. In that ship, they would find survivors who ended up to be guinea pigs. Despite being neutralized by Wesker, Alice can still pack a punch. No one can really bring her down. This movie still can be hit, and not all sequels should be shown in the theaters. The action was not lost one single bit. Very subtle though, which kind of makes it home viewing wise. I didn't find anything wrong with film. 2.5 out of 5 stars"

I unfortunately have only seen this on the small screen, which was not even 3D. I imagine this is one movie that does benefit from 3D so will be looking to see it again when the chance arises.<br/><br/>If you are looking for highly intellectual stuff, cunning twists and misdirection, this is not the film for you. If you're looking for action, stunning visuals, an escape, then this is great. While I enjoy movies that require focus to follow the story line and leave me thinking it over once done, I also enjoy movies which need nothing but to sit back and let it take you along for the journey, like a roller-coaster. That is how I watched this movie and the score I've given reflect how much I enjoyed the ride. I feel it holds very well with the first 3 Resident Evil movies, somehow the flavour seems consistent.<br/><br/>This may not be the best movie of its genre but I don't feel I have to have watched the best to be satisfied.

"ryanlion101192","9","8","21","11 September 2010"," Resident Evil: Afterlife IS Thrill and Ride of A Lifetime.
","This film flew with colors and detail. Other than the past RE films it didn't put you in a situation where you were left waiting for the action. From start to finish it is a fun and entertaining thrill ride. The acting was awesome and the humor included seemed to be in the right places at the right time. For a smaller budget and a smaller series I could definitively tell they put everything into the film with what everything they had. It was entertaining and the story seemed to suck you in from start to finish. I LOVED the introduction. The Alice Clones were KICK-ASS!! Go see it when you have the chance PLEASE!!! First of all I would like to state that this IS a Resident Evil film. Soo many people in the past have been negated and hating on a series that is entertaining and trying to be original all on its' own taking. If its not about similarities towards the games its about people hating some cheesy or corny action scenes and dialouge that people bring up or hate against or maybe seem to not even be in the film at all. I find that people tend to want to negate the RE film series rather than make positive statements.<br/><br/>1. ONLY see it if you are at all familiar with the series of movies or the video games. If you haven't seen the movies or played the games don't be surprised if your confused and disappointed. A lot of people tend to make this mistake and then make crappy reviews because it was their fault they weren't familiar with the Resident Evil genre from the beginning. Don't criticize on Afterlife if you haven't seen the last 3 movies or played any of the games. Its not the movies or games fault, its yours.<br/><br/>2. Its critical to recognize this is a Resident Evil movie, so what you got out of the last three in terms of acting and scares will probably be around the same level of realism in this one. Although in Afterlife the acting and the support in terms of scares totally upgraded and the humor and realistic acting seemed to dwell within this film. The acting was really attractive in this continuation of the series and that was one of the many things that I liked about it.<br/><br/>3. I saw Afterlife in 3-D and 2-D. Let me tell you the quality is 50 million times better in 3D. In 2D everything was not as crisp and clear and the life the film was trying to convey in 3D can ONLY be seen in 3D...At least in the theaters anyways. So if you get a chance to see it in theaters I highly advise seeing it in 3D. Its DEFINITIVELY worth the money and time. You won't be disspointed with your purchase.<br/><br/>4. Lastly, Enjoy Resident Evil: Afterlife for what it is. Take the film and series on its own and try not to compare or negate things because let me tell you. If you don't like the movies why would you continue seeing them and if you didn't like the story why would you bother even wanting to see any sequels of a story you hated. This film is for the FANS NOT THE CRITICS. So please don't criticize. Thank You! And have a Fun and Entertaining time watching Resident Evil: Afterlife."

Along the way she runs into old friend Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), a multiethnic – and therefore mostly doomed – group of survivors (including Chris Redfield, played by Wentworth Miller), and superpowered Umbrella Corp chairman Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts, who at least appears to be having fun in his supremely hammy role). <br/><br/>At this point, I'm fairly sure that the minds behind the Resident Evil films have just given up. The film jumps erratically from slo-mo fight scene to slow-mo fight scene, seldom deigning to exposit or flesh out its characters; several seemingly important plot points are introduced and then never mentioned again. The film attempts to throw game fans a bone with the inclusion of Wesker and the Redfield siblings, but none of these characters are given any significant development or purpose other than to facilitate even more slo-mo fight scenes; viewers unfamiliar with the game series are likely to be confused about why these characters are in the film at all. The only real praise I can give this film is that it's occasionally entertainingly terrible (keep an eye out for digging, swimming zombies!) instead of just boring-terrible like Apocalypse and Extinction.<br/><br/>Still: If you're a fan of action-horror films, check out Predators when it comes out on DVD. If you're a fan of the games, wait for Resident Evil 6. If you're a fan of kick-ass women in movies, rent Salt. Afterlife is a soulless, headache-inducing product without enough brains to satisfy the most desperate zombie."

","I have not to see the movie yet, but from what I've heard the critics say they aren't really good critics or thinkers.. I mean can we all see the movie first dang. With the simple mind that people have now a days before seeing the movie the critics would steal the shine when they are simply viewers like everyone else and not a clue to what they are criticizing on. Yeah they've said the movie looks like 3 different plot scenes meshed into 1, but even I know of the reason why and Im not even a critic. A smart person would know because they are all n 3 different locations. The clones are in Japan while Alice is in Los Angeles duh. There was also mention of the Axe man thrown in the mix without a reason. On duh resident Evil 5 (the game) it was the same way the guy just showed up without explanation. So why criticize the movie wen the games just the same. We'll I can't speak for everyone else, but this movie is a sure must see on my list simply because its entertaining and a awesome movie. I say go see the movie for yourself the viewers always disappointment and always bashing a good movie. They've got to see it now its our turn And thats all he wrote."
"nickhuber1","10","5","12","28 September 2010"," Good Movie
","I gave Resident Evil: Afterlife a 10/10 because it was everything I expected it to be. It was nothing but action, suspense, and guns. I went to the movie theatre expecting a sequel of a motif that's beaten over and over again; zombies and guns. Though, Iwas surprised that the movie had played a little different from all of the other RE's. In this film, the main antagonist, Wesker, was confronted a lot. In fact, he was killed about 3 times in the movie. The only part of the film I didn't agree with was how he got away each time. He would somehow get in a big helicopter and fly off. It was kind of depressing , seeing as how the director couldn't think of a more creative way for him to escape. In the Resident Evil games, Wesker is portrayed as an extremely cunning individual and can often get out of trouble while still making it suspenseful or interesting. Often, the story would kind of lose its place at times. Scenes would jump from one another and you wouldn't understand what's going on. The movie didn't explain itself that well, but that's why it's a sequel, they expect you to know where they're coming from. Its obvious that the same people who create the game and those who make the movie are two totally different people. As for the special effects, there is a completely different story. The parts of the film that were shot in slow-mo were amazing. They timed it perfectly too. Usually, when things were getting blown up, the slow- mo aspect would jump in, making everything vivid and suspenseful. I think the important thing that the movie enforced was that there was going to be another sequel. Everything was pretty much left in question. No books were closed and that's what I expected. This film was not intended for an Emmy but more to provide us with some traditional RE action and suspense. One other aspect of the movie that I liked were the small clips that were put in from the video game. For those who play RE, they helped clarify or relate to what we understand and tied the plot a little tighter. Again, the reason I gave this film a 10/10 was because it was everything I expected. I wasn't surprised at all with the ending, but, like I said before, that's what I wanted in this particular movie. After all, it was created after a game that's been out for quite a while now."

","""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" is the only film which has 3D version worth to be experienced since 2009's ""Avatar"". After ""Avatar"", the other 3D films didn't have satisfying 3D effects on them such as ""Clash of the Titans"" and ""The Last Airbender"". The 3D effects were just not visible at all like it's the same as 2D only with higher price. The animated films however did have better 3D effects but were still average. But, ""Afterlife"" is different and the 3D is really real. I have to tell you, ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" has to be experienced in 3D.<br/><br/>Don't expect award-winning acting performances and a great storyline. Just expect some fighting actions with great 3D effects. If you set your expectations in an average level, you'll be surprised, but don't put expectations too high like what you'll put for ""Inception"" or something. If it hadn't been released in 3D, I wouldn't be bothering to watch it so 3D is the main reason why I went to see this movie.<br/><br/>The story is very simple for this movie. It's just Alice trying to find uninfected humans who have survived in the whole world. So, the story is just plain. Nothing to be proud of.<br/><br/>So, if the story sucked, why did it receive a score of 7 stars?<br/><br/>The 3D rocked. Bullets shot really went out of the screen and made the movie looked spectacular. With many action scenes, the movie becomes enjoyable and truly, a memorable 3D film. I know the previous films were awful but this one is just damn great. Just cool.<br/><br/>Tips if you want to enjoy this film: 1. Don't think about the story, the script or the acting. 2. Don't take your 3D glasses off. 3. Experience the Action Scenes in Amazing 3D!<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor in watching the first real 3D experience in theaters since ""Avatar"". Even though it looks horrible, trust me, it's not as bad as it looks. 7 stars for the combination of breathtaking action scenes and great 3D effects. Just follow the 3 simple tips above and you'll have a fun time watching this."
"nconstab","1","5","12","24 September 2010"," Resident Evil: Afterthought
","Most everything about this sequel was poorly executed and unplanned. To begin with, the story had some major flaws with lots of forced conveniences. Doors automatically opened for the characters to then suddenly slam shut and lock behind them when necessary. An all-controlling I-pad like device was found conveniently lying around in a large empty ship hull for Alice to access. Somehow she knew exactly how to operate it (without mistrial) to free the frozen captives from below her! Clair somehow received an extreme make-over from being dirty, grungy and non-recognizable to drop-dead gorgeous in full makeup and hair all while being held hostage by Alice and tied inside of the two-seater red airplane that never seemed to run out of gas which flew a long journey from Canada to Los Angeles. How did Alice really know if there was enough food or any food at all on the Acadia when she broad-casted over the entire Western seaboard for any more survivors to come for food and shelter on the ship of already 100 or so passengers? The Actors obviously lacked any inkling of dramatic direction. Maybe the Director was more interested in Actors hitting their marks in front of the green screen. Now for the 3D aspect There was no point for this picture to be filmed in 3D because nothing except for the opening credits lent itself for 3-D in the first place. The lighting choices were always dark or severely contrasted against sunlight. Flashlights constantly pointing at the camera in 3D never work and end up annoying the audience. Sets, props and costuming mainly consisted of surfaces and colors (or lack of) that don't work in 3D. Inaccurate framing with very little stereo depth and no off-screen effects deadened the 3D as well. The sad thing is that anytime something could have come out of the screen, it cut away to something else and the final smack in the face as far 3D goes was a blood splatter that could have worked, but ended up on some unknown invisible glass window that was never there to begin with. I want my money back because it seems that no one of authority actually cared to make an effort to have the script corrected and they obviously didn't hire (or listen to) a seasoned stereoscopic supervisor, as no one had any idea what they were doing in 3D or basic screen writing. What a shame and a huge let down. F-."

","Well i have always loved the resident evil game series. The first three movies were good but this was awesome. But sadly i didn't get to see it in 3D. The action sequences, zombies , the axeman ,the sets were all up to the mark.The story also attracted me coz it differed from the game . Then why i didn't give it a 10 ??? My only disappointment was that my favourite villain ALBERT WESKER had very little time to show off his superhuman abilities. The director could have added more of his fight sequences with ALICE. Also the ending rung the bells in my mind as if asking ""WHAT??? MORE IS YET TO COME"". ALL IN ALL a good entertainer a must watch in 3D."

","Overall entertaining. I've watched all the other installments and in preference: [1] apocalypse, [2] afterlife, [3] resident evil, [4] extinction. Milla is stunning as usual, really dig her 'moves'. Watched it in 2D & 3D for a comparison. 3D is the ultimate choice, don't miss it or you gonna regret it. Credits to the scene where Alice swept down the building with hordes of zombies on her heels is real cool. Hoping in RE5 Alice still have remnants of the T-virus and causing more havoc. Wish Wesker has more scenes with Alice though, kinda abrupt when they both met. Luther is great and so is Claire and is that 'jill valentine' at the end? RE5-bring it on! And more face time for ALICE please. More mutations yet to come I hope. TQ!"
"tedg","Null","5","12","22 September 2010"," Love Conquers
","Of course the story is vapid. That's what kids demand. But this has two things that appeal to me.<br/><br/>One is the dimensionality of the thing. I saw it in three D and was very impressed. There is nothing new in terms of the effects. We have your zooming and your stuff coming out of the screen. We have slomo, bullet time and an impressive freeze and pan in the midst of a plane crash. Nothing new but extremely competent. The best equipment must have been used. <br/><br/>Some sense was given to depth in the back. For instance, Milla lands a plane in Alaska and we see the foreground crisply and the plane out of focus in the distance. There are many scenes like this where even the CG is appropriately blurred or unfocused. It was thrill and competent. (A water scene must have been largely cut, because it seems unnecessary.) <br/><br/>All the situations are ridiculous until you imagine that they must have been that way in order to have the sets and effects.<br/><br/>The second thing that just makes me melt is when you have a filmmaker who is filming his lover. There is a tenderness and familiarity to this. Milla knows how to appear appealing, but Anderson does some particularly affecting cinematic caresses. Consider just the opening action scene where multiple Alices, all with superpowers, are attacking the evil group. (They call it a corporation, but there is no indication of corporate qualities.)<br/><br/>Her gymnastics are more than what we need for kickass woman action; they are created out of imaginary Millas and imposed on her to make her seem more alluringly graceful than she really is. Some subtle changes in her shape are visible in the CG Alice, especially that superAlice we meet initially. Interestingly, Anderson teases us with his very first sequence where we see a woman's legs. We think they must be those of the starlet. They are — we later know — a quite different shape than Milla's legs, but identical to the ones we see on the simulacrum that follows. Those legs dance, made so by how her lover imagines they would.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","The undead won't be denied in this fourth installment of the Resident Evil series. The world as mankind once knew it no longer exists, and with the exception of a few resilient survivors all humans have mutated into deadly, flesh-eating zombies. Alice is a resourceful survivor and hardened warrior who battles against the reprehensible Umbrella Corporation, but before she can lead a definitive strike she has to locate the remaining survivors and Earth's last bit of infection-free haven. The series formula is strained, to say the least, but the film makes effective use of its violent, in-your-face 3-D action scenes, anchored by the scrappy, always reliable Jovovich in the lead. Offers some fun when you don't think about it too much, there just isn't much of a story to tell. A good way to pass the time for series fans, others needn't bother. **"
"StGaffer","4","5","12","13 September 2010"," A decent movie that ultimately falls flat
","Great Video Game based movies are hard to come by. There are those who fail instantly e.g. Street Fighter *cringe* , while there are also those who start well but ultimately fall flat e.g. Prince Of Persia. The Resident Evil Series is a curious case, as even though they aren't the perfect example of Good Video Game based movie, they have managed to do what many others fail to do. Be quite profitable.<br/><br/>In Resident Evil Afterlife, Milla Jovovich returns as the powered up Alice (complete with clones), while Ali Larter returns as Claire Redfield with newcomer Wentworth Miller as brother Chris Redfield (pre massive bulk up of RE 5) as they face Resident Evil main protagonist Albert Wesker played by Shawn Roberts. Paul W.S. Anderson returns to helm the film.<br/><br/>First to note is that despite the use of the Fusion Camera created by James Cameron and used in his film Avatar, the effects in Resident Evil Afterlife is not worth noting down . While it is far better than the 3D trash that is Clash Of The Titans, the effects does not change viewer experience.<br/><br/>One of the main criticism in regards to the movie is the director himself. A self-proclaimed No.1 fan of major directors such as James Cameron and Ridley Scott, Anderson continually tries to imitate the styles of those directors. And it shows, Resident Evil Afterlife feels as if it is mix up between The Matrix with a pinch of Die Hard and The Terminator. He does not try to develop his own style and make RE unique as opposed to the other video game based movies. A perfect example of director putting his own style is Zac Snyder, a director who has this particular style that even as you watch his film, you instantly know it is directed from Zac Snyder. Even his use of slow-mo is unique as seen in 300.<br/><br/>Anderson is also responsible for the, quite frankly, poor script, while some fans of the game might enjoy the many references to the game (Wesker's glowing eyes and the throwing of his sunglasses remind anyone of RE 5?) it is quite cringe worthy actually seeing it. The length of the film also makes it quite boring at times.<br/><br/>Acting wise Milla Jovovich excels in her role as Alice, in contrast, Ali Larter and Wentworth Miller while decent, both fail to rise up. One of the major disappointments of the film is that it fails to go deeper into the relationship between the siblings Chris and Claire (one of the most interesting relationships in the games). As opposed to the games where their relationship is dealt deeply, the film differs, and it seems both Chris and Claire are siblings only because their last names are similar.<br/><br/>Overall Resident Evil Afterlife will cater to the fans of the games, but for those who are looking for more will be disappointed. While not as awful as Resident Evil 2, it is a movie that isn't too spectacular and doesn't fulfill the potential that the series definitely has."
"fluster84","4","5","12","12 September 2010"," If you don't care for the previous RE movies, don't bother with this one.
","The use of 3D makes this movie watchable. I am sure fans of the previous RE films won't be disappointed. The zombies look good, there are big guns, great sound effects, and lots of scenes with people flying through the air in slow motion. I would recommend watching this movie if you love a good old fashioned frag fest on screen, but please do not expect anything more. This is a typical CGI blessed action flick and in my opinion its better than the 2nd and 3rd RE movies (which isn't saying a lot really). <br/><br/>In conclusion - If you never see this movie, you aren't missing anything. I would strongly recommend it for die hard RE fans but for others, this one is nothing special. <br/><br/>P.S. If you managed to sit through the entire movie, maybe you should stick around a little longer till the end of the credits. Its worth it."
"wizzysteeve","4","5","12","12 September 2010"," A sad time for resident evil fans...
","OK I'm not going to lie when I say I was looking forward to this instalment of the resident evil series. However I must stress this point, that all writers and producers have lost there imagination when it comes to film nowadays. Its sad nobody can actually come up with a brand new film, nearly all aspects are taken from other things. An example being resident evil afterlife, I do understand it is heavily based on the game series but that does not mean, you can just copy every little aspect that made the game series cool. For example resident evil afterlife took the executioner from resident evil 5 (the game).The four pronged mouthy people, from resident evil 5, and the dogs that kind of split into two from (yeah you guessed) resident evil 5. Talk about unimaginative, but the thing that annoyed me the most about this new film was, as I'm sure fans are aware Jill valentine is in the film at the end (clip during credits), in resident evil apocalypse she is brunette, in the early resident evil games she is brunette also, but in resident evil 5 she goes blonde, then in resident evil afterlife she is blonde. This sounds like a weak argument I know but! at the end of the film I heard people in the cinema going ""Whos that?"" now if hardcore fans of the film do not recognise Jill Valentine who has been in the game series since the beginning and has been a major character throughout the whole of resident evil games and films. Something has gone wrong<br/><br/>Other irritating things were the never ending slow motion shots to show off the power of the so called ""impressive 3D graphics"" but the developers got so immersed they forgot to write a script that made sense. Leaving huge plot wholes like how Wesker and Alice could both survive a head long crash into a mountain, (and yes they are super humans) but even so very stupid idea. Also the never ending cliché lines and shots of the characters throwing guns in slow motion, and Wesker having is little gloat before he does anything even remotely evil, just annoyed me to the point of where I wanted to take my 3D glasses off and pretend I was watching the first resident evil film again. I was interested in how they were going to make a new story without making it terrible after ending the 3rd film with an clone army of Alices, but it seems they didn't even attempt to, all the Alice clones are killed off within the first 30mins of the film, so they could start the plot from scratch without it getting to ridiculous.<br/><br/>My next comment isn't strictly to do with the film but actually the adverts before hand. Having seen the endless comments of films coming out soon and after everyone, hearing 3D 3D 3D 3D I just got annoyed. Producers and writers of the world especially you! James Cameron listen up! stop getting excited about 3D! Maybe for young children's films its OK but for hardcore film fans like myself, who are very critical about which films we watch, its terrible! just come up with a good plot at the moment only one producer seems to be able to do this and that is Quentin Tarantino, inglorious bastards was the last exceptionally good film I had seen in recent years. I was so angry when his film didn't get much credit during the BAFTA awards because his film was apparently over- shadowed by avatar which was tremendously overrated because of the endless praise for 3D. Has film really got to the point where producers end up comparing who has the best graphics. Rather than sitting down and thinking of a good film! I remember the old days where people ended films because they didn't want to spoil the series. Nowadays its all money money money a fourth terminator which wasn't needed! A remake to predator which also wasn't needed! and now a fourth resident evil film. Just stop please!!"
"trayz18","7","5","12","12 September 2010"," Worth Seeing In 3D!!!
","Well!!! Most big budget movies these days are using 3D technology to trick people into forgetting about the story and focus on the effects. Although I absolutely love the effects in this film, the story could do with a lot more work in terms of the characters, but let's face it, we watch these kind of films purely for the action, which is what you get from Afterlife.<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich is back as Alice in this fourth installment in the Resident Evil series. Milla does a great job as a feminine gun totting action hero.<br/><br/>The story centers around Alice (Milla) trying to find other humans, which she eventually finds locked within a prison surrounded by zillions of zombies. Most of the characters in this film are present just for the zombies to chow down on which isn't a spoiler for anyone ( I hope). There really isn't much else to say about the story without spoiling it.<br/><br/>Afterlife is definitely worth seeing in 3D, this is proved within the first 10 minutes of the film. The director Paul W.S. Anderson wrote and directed this film, so kudos to him for not making a complete mess of the film. His wife Milla is what sells this film in my opinion, she's a natural when it comes to action films because of her on-screen presence.<br/><br/>The film doesn't follow truthfully to the video game its based off of, these Resident Evil films are more like adaptations of the video game franchise. The problem i had with this film was the character called Wesker. In the video game he kicks major ass but in this movie he does do a bit of ass-kicking but not efficiently like in the game. Only people who have played Resident Evil games would know exactly what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Resident Evil Afterlife is a leap forward from the previous Resident Evil Extinction, definitely recommend anyone to watch it in 3D because of the high quality effects which is to be expected from a $60 million budget film. Honestly though this film didn't need the 3D effects to sell it, but it definitely is a well appreciated option to watch the film."
"jonography","7","5","12","11 September 2010"," Good from a normal movie viewer perspective.
","Before I start, let me say that I am a fan of the Resident Evil games. I may not have played them all, but I've played quite a few. I'm not writing a review as someone who is so obsessed with the games, that they want them to be completely like the games, or they completely suck. I'm writing this as both someone who's played the game, but also as a movie watcher.<br/><br/>Firstly I'll comment on the 3D. The 3D was nice, but caused some of the cinematics to suffer in turn. To show off the 3D technology, a lot of scenes were put in slow motion, but some were not for this cause. Slow motion was just completely overused. It's an action movie. Half of the action in every scene shouldn't be slow motion. The time that takes up can EASILY be filled in with more choreographed fighting. Other than this, the 3D was tolerable.<br/><br/>As for the general directing of the movie, the scenes were all filmed at perfect angles and camera movements were right on the dot. Everything was positioned so you can see the action and the progression of the storyline from the best perspectives.<br/><br/>The acting on the most part was exceptional or better. Jovovich and Larter pulled off their characters well. I was pleased that Larter finally got more action than she did in Extinction where all she did was constantly shoot things. In my opinion, Miller didn't pull of Chris Redfield as good as expected. He sounded like he was constantly muttering, so at some points it was hard to understand him. Roberts as Albert Wesker shared in some of the disappointment I had with Chris. They weren't believable as they should have been.<br/><br/>The overall storyline was fairly weak. It never really had a concrete plot the entire way through. Other than the characters from the game, or characters from previous movies, all died pathetically. They were almost, if not all off-screen, and barely anything was shown. It's a ZOMBIE MOVIE. That's part of what people go to see! A lot of things happened that definitely should have been explained, although the explanation wouldn't add to the movie, just help people watching the movie understand what happened and what was currently happening. The ending of the movie came abruptly, and at least a half hour earlier than it really should have. There should have been much more continuing, so that the fifth movie (which will happen if Afterlife is successful enough in theatres) would have a much better kick-off place, without steering away from the main storyline so that it could finish the general storyline in Afterlife first.<br/><br/>*** Spoilers *** As a fan of the games, these are some things that annoyed me, or that I found related to the games.<br/><br/>All the zombies were Majini infected with the Plagas from Resident Evil 5, with no explanation or anything. WHY? I know they're trying to keep it relatively modern, but really? At least give some explanations! The T-Virus doesn't even evolve into the Las Plagas. / The entire movie's visual filter was darker, trying to give it more of the feel that RE5 has when playing through it on it's normal filter. / Chris Redfield's outfit was bad. It was much too baggy. It mentioned he was in the military, so why wouldn't they give him an outfit more like his BSAA one from RE5? / Costume for Claire Redfield was a lot better than extinction. Much more relative to her character in the games. Wesker's outfit was dead on with RE5. / The P30 device was introduced in the movie, but how they used it was ridiculous. They put it on Claire, K-Mart and basically like 40 million other people :/ AND In the movie it was really easy to get off. They should have made it at least a bit more of a challenge for the characters to remove. The devices actual intentions were never explained, and they randomly added memory loss as a side effect to it. In my opinion, it was a completely pointless addition to the movie. / Scene from RE5 was taken right from the game and placed in the movie, except replacing Sheva Alomar with Claire Redfield. / Jill Valentine makes an appearance at the end, with her original actress Guillory, if her outfit and appearance from RE5, with one of the P30 devices on her chest, ordering umbrella soldiers. This at least showed some amount of promise for the fifth movie if it ends up being made. Due to no explanation to her absence from the third movie, or how she came to be a commanding power in Umbrella, this'll take a bit out of the fifth installment to explain what happened.<br/><br/>Finally two last things I'll comment on. The first is how they gave Spencer Locke such a pathetic role in this movie. I loved her as K-Mart in Extinction, and by the end of the movie she was slowly starting to show promise in possibly becoming a fighter, but instead, she gets like 5 minutes of screen time, and does absolutely nothing. She should have been in the movie from the start when Claire attack Alice because of the P30 device, fighting alongside Claire, and then continuing from there. I really hope they give her a better role in the next movie.<br/><br/>The second thing is how even though they tried to put a lot of things based on Resident Evil 5, they should have introduced Sheva into the movie, instead of one of the stupid Hollywood people they introduced.<br/><br/>My advice to any fans of the game series watching the movie, don't judge it based on the games, seeing as it's clear that they are separate from them, so don't judge it in comparison to the games.<br/><br/>In summation, I'd give the movie a 7 out of 10."
"digital821","3","5","12","11 September 2010"," I feel bad for die hard fans
","This film was a POS. <br/><br/>There is no denying that simple and plain fact. This film has barley any cohesiveness as far as plot and character development go. The characters are two-dimensional and have no arcs or changes what-so-ever, unless you count being controlled by a ruby scarab beetle mind control injection device which causes memory loss where at the beginning of the film your character knows nothing and at the end they remember everything...<br/><br/>I don't need a direct game to film adaptation. I understand as a filmmaker myself that it serves no purpose to try and condense a 20 hour+ game into a 2 hour story. It mainly wont work and the basic actions the game character preforms would be tedious in a film. What you want to translate over from the game is story, character depth, goals, believability. Afterbirth has none of these things. We jump into a fun action sequence that serves a very small purpose on story and a huge tech demo for 3D. It does nothing other than setup the tone for the film, which is what you want your opening to do. Unless of course you open your movie with an insane amount of CGI bullet dodging, sword deaths, and gun play; then proceed to have your main character lose all their powers and survive a high impact plane crash into a mountain...<br/><br/>I could really flay this crap pile but I only have 1000 words."

A blatant and cheap looking way to save money on the special effects.<br/><br/>Also, other than food and water it is obvious the ruby red lipstick and hairspray abound as Milla never looks the slightest bit disheveled. I am a fan of a hot, gun-toting babe looking her finest, nut a lack of lipstick and the occasional smudge would be more realistic.<br/><br/>Up next is the aircraft graveyard when Alice goes to Alaska to search for Arcadia. The final two craft are helicopters parked underneath trees. This does not make sense since I have it on good authority that after their 1985-1987 border skirmish trees and helicopter rotors do not get along to this day.<br/><br/>And did I mention the lipstick? Ali Larter's Claire character is introduced looking much more normal considering the circumstances and probably badly craves some lipstick. We are shown a device that Alice removes from her cute little tummy that may be important to the plot. Natch no mention is made of it again unless it was film that ended up on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>The feral Claire is tied up and thrown into the back of the plane that is powered by he same automatically fuel reloading technology as the ammo.<br/><br/>Did I mention the lipstick? After a particularly unbelievable on the roof plane landing we proceed to the main setting, a prison that a small group of survivors has holed up in. One of the few things that makes sense, Fortified prison walls would be more zombie proof. This prison comes complete with the same magic technology as it still has running water. Miracuously Claire's brother has survived and is being held prisoner in the prison - yet not in a prison cell. By the time of their reunion Claire has cleaned up nicely and has the requisite magic lip coating.<br/><br/>In order to get the action going we have the introduction of one huge axe wielding boss zombie. Can't have those pesky survivors stay holed up where it's safe.<br/><br/>In a last ditch attempt to improve their chances versus the impending released by Mr. huge axe zombie a failed attempt at procurement of a huge armored vehicle the group and removal of the plane as an option (from the roof that is obviously too small of a runway by the resident evil sleazebag human) the group is forced to take to the sewers to reach Arcadia. By now we know this is a ship that has acquired Time Lord technology and is much larger on the inside than the outside.<br/><br/>Resident evil human sleazebag has miraculously survived crashing the plane onto the Arcadia and has teamed up with the over the top uber-villain from the initial Alice clone attack at the beginning.<br/><br/>Long story short - good triumphs over evil because it's nicer in one final magic ammunition display and a ""Whoa, I never saw that planting the bomb in the uber villain.s plane"" Yes, this is sarcastic.<br/><br/>Numerically the rating I give is basically a 1 out of 10. Add another point for Milla just because she's hot. Add another half point for the Ed Woodian laughter and another half point for the, ""Oh well, did you really expect high art?"" factor."

","Or something. I don't know. Something needs to be done. That's two bad Resident Evil movies in a row.<br/><br/>There's something about these last two Resident Evil movies that are lacking. There's this weird sense of bland, hollowness as you're watching it. Nothing about it engages you, it leaves you feeling like a distant spectator. I was bored out of my mind.<br/><br/>There's just no feeling of purpose or goal. The characters are just wandering from scene to scene, with some vague sense of some nebulous destination in the near future, but it just doesn't feel significant. The relationships between the characters are never fully explored, such as between Chris and Claire Redfield, and you just generally don't care about anything that's going on, you're just ""watching."" <br/><br/>I like the inclusion of Michael Scofield, and his being ""broken out of prison."" Nice nod to the Prison Break series, of which only the first two seasons count, as everything after that are just abominations to mankind in its purest form."
"dickchimney","7","4","9","9 October 2010"," Should only watch if you are a fan of the series
","I am a fan of the video games series, and I really enjoy watching this movie. Most of the enjoyment, however, comes from the anticipation and seeing how elements in the games are incorporated into the scenes, and I am very satisfied in this aspect, except for Wesker. I also like the dark, mansion-like, claustrophobic feel that was the first twenty minutes or so of the film, which brought back some good memory of playing the playstation classics.<br/><br/>But if you are not a fan of the series, game or movie, then this movie is not worth the $15 ticket. First of all, this is an action movie, not a horror movie. There are zombies/monsters, but other than some suspenseful moments at the beginning, there aren't no scares at all, and the actions are quite dull.<br/><br/>The fighting scenes are mediocre, and while there is lots of shootings, there is not enough variety of guns/firepower, which should be expected from a Resident Evil title, especially that which has a lots of elements from the game RE5. I'm also quite disappointed to see supposedly powerful bio-engineered monsters taken down with only a few shots from conventional weapons.<br/><br/>Plotwise, this movie has no plot, and no character development. Chris Redfield seems to appear out of nowhere, with no apparent role in the plot, probably just to please the fans. I also find this movie racist toward the Asians."
"paul_haakonsen","3","4","9","6 October 2010"," A terrible blow to the name of the ""Resident Evil"" legacy
","One word comes to mind: WOW. And not in a good way.<br/><br/>Paul W. S. Anderson successfully managed to bring the ""Resident Evil"" franchise to its knees and kill it off. This is the worst thing that ever have been spawned in this franchise. I had looked forward to this movie, but had started to doubt since reading the first reviews. And my worst fears about the movie were realized when I sat down to watch the movie myself.<br/><br/>The huge 'Axeman', what was up with that character? Stolen directly out of the ""Silent Hill"" universe. Yeah, lets steal 'Pyramidhead' and put a clone of him in our movies, yeah, Resident Evil fans will totally love that.<br/><br/>""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" has a very weak storyline and plot. This movie is all about the action and 3D effects. Let's just milk the ""Resident Evil"" name for all it is worth.<br/><br/>The zombies are no longer a major part in the movie. Heck, they are not even secondary in this particular movie. You see them only a couple of times, and they have very little impact in the movie. That was a huge disappointment. Sure, the ones that you do see have cool make-up and effects, but not enough to carry any part of the movie by a long shot.<br/><br/>The zombie dogs were cool, as always. Well, that is up until they broke into two and became the flapping maws with teeth. What the... That was just downright stupid and painful to watch.<br/><br/>Also, Wesker injected Alice with this chemical that removed her super strength, speed, accelerated healing, and so forth in the first part of the movie, but she didn't seem affected by that at all. She still ran as fast as before, took poundings that would otherwise kill elephants, kicked butt like there was no tomorrow. No, no, no... Had Anderson totally forgotten that he had made Wesker administer this into Alice? That was so bad, such an epic fail.<br/><br/>One of the bright moments in the movie was when Chris Redfield was introduced, but mark my words, that thrill was short-lived. Mainly because of the actor they had cast to portray Chris Redfield - Wentworth Miller. He failed to deliver any credibility to the part of Chris, and his acting was horrible. So, that was indeed a short-lived thrill of seeing Chris Redfield finally introduced in the movie versions of Resident Evil.<br/><br/>And Wesker, no matter how enigmatic and mysterious he was in the games, he is portrayed so badly in this movie. In the previous movies he had that touch of mystery and bad-guy-feel to him that you know from the games. But in ""Afterlife"" he is downright annoying, and comes off like a mocking silhouette of a typical villain straight out of the ""Hollywood Book of How to be a Villain"". It sucked!<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich (playing Alice) and Ali Larter (playing Claire Redfield) carried this movie, with good help from Boris Kodjoe (playing Luther). However, I am starting to feel worn out watching Jovovich in the role of this super-human-butt-kicking-femme-fatale. It has been hyped up to the point where it is no longer fun.<br/><br/>If they decide to make another installment to the ""Resident Evil"" franchise, I hope they go with another approach to it. Bring it back to the classic first and second ""Resident Evil"" games, and also back at the level of the first movie. The ""Resident Evil"" movies now is nothing but a hollow-action-fest-shell. It lacks appeal and has gone way out of tune with what ""Resident Evil"" is truly about - survival horror. Not a glam-fest with heaps of over-the-edge 3D effects and nothing but mindless action. You might as well just sit down and play Counter-Strike, it is about the same crap now.<br/><br/>I suppose this movie will be right up your alley if you are an adrenalin-hooked action lover, but if you (like me) love the original ""Resident Evil"" games and enjoy the survival horror genre, then you will be sorely disappointed with ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"". The first ""Resident Evil"" movie was good, the second movie ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" was adequate, while the third movie ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" was already starting to halt and limb with its plot line, but ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" is truly a slap in the face of the ""Resident Evil"" name.<br/><br/>Anderson, just hand the ""Resident Evil"" movie making over to someone more capable. You have truly managed to destroy all that it was about! This is a sad moment in zombie-history."
"Michael-d-duncan","5","4","9","3 October 2010"," And now for something completely different
","First off I am a fan of the franchise and I loved playing the games. The Good, Bad.<br/><br/>First the Bad<br/><br/>The previous movies had really left the writers in a strange place so the first twenty minutes of this film was them trying to recapture the storyline and the audience (which probably didn't bother to rent other films) really suffers for lack of a unified story. This makes my first beef with this film. Second, the movie didn't have zombies! It was about 90% action movie and 10% zombie movie, the other films did a much better job of balancing that out. Third, the previous two films did a good job of setting up the villain with an unction / drive, this one really drops the bomb on that. The head villain, (if you're familiar with RE3) is not new but he has no back story and his murderous, cold blooded, i-wear-my-sun-glasses-at-night persona is just kinda random and stressed. The other villain, that freaky lookin' ax dude from the preview just shows up out of nowhere also!<br/><br/>Now the Good: The film is entertaining, not worth the premium for 3d and not worth the IMAX price, but certainly worth a rent and a bowl of popcorn. Second: the writers feel free to experiment and manipulate the zombie genre; too often Zflilms are the same recycled plot dipped in a bucket of red corn syrup. Even if I would have liked a few more zombie scenes, I can respect the importance of branching out and expanding the genre. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: If you enjoyed the other films, don't miss it. Don't go dropping $15 bucks for a ticket but it's a good show with some nice action. All in all pretty fun."

","I know this is based on the video game series, and so there is more to it than we've seen so far, but the movies for RE have jumped the shark. It's getting tired, it's done. I may or may not watch one more of their movies (I hope there's just one more).<br/><br/>Early on, Alice should have died. That killed the rest of the movie for me. Not a scratch, better off than Wesker (who still had his powers). If she really lost her powers, why is she so ass-kicky? How can she survive the axe man (what the hell was the axe man anyway?), and go toe to toe with Wesker? The 3D seemed like it would be cool, but they teased the audience with one good throwing star and the rest was practically unrecognizable as 3D.<br/><br/>""This is a trap"" - why not leave the ship instead of going through an armoured door...deeper into the trap? Umbrella is sickeningly omnipotent and manipulative, even though there are so few people left to manipulate. One wonders what the point of their activities ultimately is. I guess it's just showing an extreme control-freak mindset.<br/><br/>A few cheap scares, some comments on human nature, obligatory overly beautiful and healthy-looking people somehow maintaining their looks in an insanely desperate and stressful world (they really have the food to allow for muscle-building exercise, the makeup is still plentiful, shaving's a priority, there's enough water for lengthy showers...?) I'd be happy simply reading ""...this is what Umbrella was up to all along_____...this is who lived/died_____...here is how far the mutations went___"" without another movie."

"ajs-10","Null","3","6","24 July 2011"," Lots of action... But ultimately disappointing...
","I quite enjoyed the first two films of this series, I found them entertaining as well as having a relatively decent plot line. The third one fell a bit short of the mark and this one, well, let's say you can tell it was made for the 3D market. It unfortunately has a 15 certificate here in the UK, which is a shame because my 13 year-old nephew would love this kind of thing. To give the film its due, it does do what it says on the tin, and it does it over and over again But more of my thoughts after this brief summary.<br/><br/>We begin in Tokyo at the headquarters of The Umbrella Corporation. It is under attack, not from the many zombies they have inflicted on the world, but from multiple copies, clones, of Alice. Showing no mercy she dispatches all that get in her way until she comes face to face with Albert Wesker, the head of the company. He escapes in a plane, only to find the original Alice aboard. The plane crashes and Alice escapes the wreckage. Taking another plane, she heads north, hoping to find 'Arcadia', a place that has been transmitting on the radio, advertising itself as a haven. She had sent her friends there at the end of the previous film. She arrives to find nothing no town, no community, just a field and a beach. A movement catches her eye and she tracks it down, it's Claire Redfield, one of the people she had sent there. Claire is suffering from memory loss due to a device attached to her chest. Alice removes it and they fly off down the coast. Eventually they find a prison surrounded by thousands of zombies where some survivors are holed up. They include a former basketball star, Luther West, a film producer, Bennett and his intern, Kim Yong and Claire's brother, Chris. They discover that 'Arcadia' is a ship anchored off shore, but how to get there past all those zombies. And when they do, what's awaiting them? Well, as usual, I'm not going to tell you here I've probably given away too much already and those Spoiler Police will be tracking my movements by satellite as I type.<br/><br/>This is very much an action flick, with a heavy emphasis on the action. The plot, well, that's just a device to get us to the next action sequence, right? As far as performances go, well, it's quite a physically demanding film and they all coped pretty well with that, acting-wise, well nobody was really stretched, but I will give a few honourable mentions. I love Milla Jovovich as Alice, it's a role she's made her own over the years, but I don't think it's doing her any favours now. Ali Larter did a decent job as Claire Redfield and Kim Coates played the villainous Bennett very well, I just wish he had more screen time. It was nice to see Wentworth Miller breaking out of prison again, this time as Chris Redfield and Shawn Roberts was suitably sinister as Albert Wesker.<br/><br/>As I said at the beginning, you can tell this was made for the 3D market. There are far too many slow-motion seg-ways in the action sequences. This was done back in the day of 'The Matrix' and it's been done to death since! No reason for it here. It seems the director got all his 3D toys out and totally forgot about making a properly scripted and plotted film. It looked like a collection of set-pieces loosely linked together by a rather weak narrative. Unfortunately it's left wide open for another sequel and I hope they forget about 3D and concentrate on the story for a change. Over all, apart from the annoying slow-motion bits, the action sequences are very well done, as is, for the most part, the CGI. I just wish I could say the same for the plot and the dialogue Not recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 4.6/10"

"cadillac20","6","6","16","10 September 2010"," Big, Stupid, Action Packed Zombie Movie
","Now, don't take my review title the wrong way. Big and stupid aren't necessarily bad things if you find that entertaining. I happen to find some big, stupid movies entertaining. This was one of em. Once again directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, this film is the second best in the series right behind the first film (possibly even the best), if only because the action was so kick ass. <br/><br/>The film once again picks up where we left off. Alice is still hunting down Umbrella, while Claire has gone off to find the source of the signal heard in Resident Evil: Extinction. However, not everything is as it seems, and it seems Umbrella still has a plan of action.<br/><br/>At this point in the series, if you're expecting anything more than an action packed, dumb zombie film devoid of scares, you've either stopped watching the film or are fairly low in the intelligence department yourself. This film is full plot holes, questions, and coincidences. Overall, the film is pretty ho-hum. The story is straight forward and of little consequence, and the disappointing ending once again leaves the series open, doing away with the promise for the film series' finale. But, with all that said, I regret nothing. The action was highly entertaining, the acting was actually pretty good (as far as this series goes anyway), and the RE fan service will bring a smile to RE fans faces. <br/><br/>The 3D is actually pretty good here, with some notably impressive effects, including a bunch of water effects. The shower room scene is simply fantastic in 3D. Anderson brings his Mortal Kombat A-game here with the action scenes being very well shot and a blast to watch. I won't lie and tell you that this film really goes any farther beyond that. For those that have seen ever RE movie in theaters, this is the film that we had hoped the sequel to the original would have been. Suffice to say, Anderson really is the only one who can handle it the way it should have been done after the first one. The music here is also fairly decent, with a nice soundtrack I will definitely have to track down. It doesn't always work, but when it does, it is pretty cool.<br/><br/>Obviously, this film isn't a great one. It's the fourth film in a series that has degraded in quality over its course. Heck, it never really won anyone over to begin with. However, my expectations were pretty low to begin with. The prospect of Anderson returning, this being the final film in the series, and the impressive trailers all encouraged me to see this one final RE film. I can certainly say I wasn't disappointed, as I got just a little more than what I expected. I probably won't be seeing the film again (except maybe on TV), but, for what I saw, I can say that I don't regret seeing it in theater. And if you're going to watch the movie to begin with, you really do have to see it in 3D. It's surprisingly some of the best 3D I have seen yet (and no wonder, with them using Jim Cameron's 3D camera technology. No post conversion doo- doo here)."
"zardoz-13","8","5","13","18 September 2010"," Milla Keeps On Kicking Ass!!!
","Spectacular 3-D visual effects, larger-than-life action situations, and audacious characters make the fifth entry in the ""Resident Evil"" franchise a lot of fun. Virtually everybody is referring to ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" as the fourth entry. Basically, with some justification, each is ignoring director Makoto Kamiya's ""Resident Evil: Degeneration."" Mind you, ""Resident Evil: Degeneration"" was an animated epic without Alice as the chief protagonist, and it went straight-to-video when Sony released it back in 2008. As far as I'm considered, Sony scraped the bottom of the biohazard barrel with ""Resident Evil: Degeneration."" Nothing about it was remotely memorable. Meanwhile, ""Death Race"" director Paul W.S. Anderson returns to the helm with the latest entry ""Resident Evil: Afterlife."" For the record, Anderson directed the original ""Resident Evil"" (2002) and has penned all four of the live-action features as well as served as producer. ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" qualifies as a crisp, invigorating, 97-minute actioneer never wears out its welcome. The digital 3-D prints are scintillating to see. When the butt-kicking heroic babe charges the camera and hurls those ninja throwing stars, you want to dodge them. Meaning, Sony Pictures produced the movie in 3-D. Lately, some studios have simply converted a 2-D movie into 3-D, and the movie looks terrible. This is not the case with ""Resident Evil: Afterlife."" <br/><br/>This action-packed post-apocalyptic zombie flick unfolds in Tokyo. An outbreak of the T-virus devastates the capital city of Japan. By the time that practically everybody is dead, the Umbrella Corporation posts snipers to pick off wandering zombies. Without warning, the Umbrella snipers begin to die. Of course, Alice with her samurai sword is at work and she brings multiple clones of herself armed with Heckler and Koch MP-5 submachine guns. Initially, she kills close to 500 soldiers at the Umbrella Corporation's underground headquarters and targets the evil Umbrella Corporation Chairman Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts of ""Edge of Darkness"") who manages to escape in a twin-engine helicopter with wings. The real Alice sneaks aboard to kill him and he drains her of the mutant resources that the T-virus instilled in her. Basically, Alice goes back to being a mortal. Wesker, who has been infected by the virus, is struggling to control the effects of the T-virus and he needs what has been rolling around in Alice's system. Suddenly, the hover chopper jet that Wesker escaped in from the Tokyo Headquarters crashes on a mountainside. Miraculously, Alice survives. She sets off to find her friends, Claire Redfield (Ali Larter of ""Final Destination"") and K-Mart (Spencer Locke of ""Spanglish""), who flew off in helicopters to Alaska to find safety at a place called Arcadia. The catch is that Arcadia is a super tanker operated by the Umbrella Corporation and they capture everybody who left the desert in the previous film ""Resident Evil: Extinction."" The Umbrella henchmen slap a ruby red spider like contraption onto their chests that robs them of their thinking. Claire managed to escape, but K-Mart and over two thousand others were imprisoned to be used in more Umbrella experiments. Alice commandeers a propeller-driven plane, flies to Alaska, and finds Claire. The ruby red spider like device on Claire's chest has wiped out her memory, and she tries to kill Alice when they first met.<br/><br/>Together Alice and Claire wind up flying to Los Angeles. The city of Angels stands in cinders and only seven people have survived. They are holed up in a skyscraper prison, and zombies had laid siege to the building. Alice wings her way in and lands on the prison roof. By now, Claire has regained her memory. They meet a sleazy movie producer Bennett (Kim Coates of ""Waterworld""), Bennett's intern Kim Yong (newcomer Norman Yeung), basketball superstar Luther West (Boris Kodjoe of ""Surrogates""), Angel Ortiz (Sergio Peris-Mencheta of ""Love Ranch""), aspiring actress Crystal (Kacey Barnfield of ""Popcorn""), and Wendell (Fulvio Cecere of ""Watchmen""). Initially, they believe Alice and Claire have come to fly them to the supertanker Arcadia. The ship is visible from the top of the prison, and they've heard the radio station about safety and food. Of course, Alice has to disappoint them. Nevertheless, Alice is intrigued about the ship. Claire meets her older brother Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller of ABC-TV's ""Prison Break"") who has been mistaken for a killer and locked by Bennett and his people. Chris has a way that they can escape from the prison and make it to the coast where they can get transportation to the Arcadia. Eventually, the zombies break into the prison after a Goliath dragging a gigantic hammer smashes his way through the locked gates and comes after Alice. As our heroes struggle to escape from the zombies, they are whittled down by the opposition.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the flaw that afflicts ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" and all the ""Resident Evil"" sequels is story. The Umbrella Corporation manufactured viral weapons and an industrial spy broke into the corporation's Raccoon City complex and unleashed it. Everybody died but they did not stay dead. They came back from the dead as flesh eating zombies. Not only did the men and women come back as zombies, but also the laboratory animals and mutant laboratory experiments. Since ""Resident Evil,"" Alice (Milla Jovovich) has been destroying zombies as well as Umbrella executives who want to carry on business as usual. Anderson hasn't altered that serviceable narrative very much. You can only do so much with zombies unless you are cult filmmaker George Romeo, and Romeo changed zombies in ""Land of the Dead."" Nevertheless, aside from the deadly familiarity that the franchise suffers from, everything else in ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" looks fantastic. Jovovich's gravity-defying antics, the exotic settings, the mandible-spreading zombies, the glossy production values, the George Washington quarters as shotgun ammo, a high body count, and the thumping tomandandy soundtrack make this adaptation of the Capcom survival horror video game a blast to watch."

Did I mention this movie is a bunch of nonsense? Of course, every scene and concept in it is utterly derivative, too. This writer/director, who is now forever barred from earning the tiniest smidgeon of respect from me, has achieved total suspension of belief. It is anti-art. Horrid, awful and contemptible in every way that matters. Absolutely the worst of the worst of meaningless commercial sewage. Crapdrivel.<br/><br/>1 out of 10."

","Let me start off saying that I'm a big fan of the movies and games. Afterlife starts off with an amazing opening full of energy and was pretty intense. Then it continues on with Alice and her clones trying to put an end to Umbrella. While the action is very good and always gives us something new, afterlife kind of fails in character development in which brings us new characters like Chris Redfield, Wesker and other new zombie creatures like the Axeman for an instance. The Axeman had no story whatsoever and I like that Paul through in creatures and characters from the games but he also needs to give some kind of explanation regarding their origin. Well, thing is when I saw this super zombie appeared and saw him through out the film I supposed that the creature was an experiment that Umbrella created to kill Alice. That was my theory but other people wont know a thing and will be like what is that thing? Chris was a good add on to the movie but having him as a secondary character shooting pistols is just wrong and besides there was like no development regarding the brother to sister relationship(Chris, Clarie). I saw this film in 3D and its the best 3D I've seen, ill give credit for that. Finally, loved the sweet action, effects ,cinematography, the new creatures and characters but lacks of a good script, character development, lack of gore and please for the next film a longer run time at least 2 hours. Anyway good addition to the series. Still give it a 10 cause Im so fanatic."
"inflamator","9","4","10","23 October 2010"," Afterlife keeps it up
","Well, I'm a very fan of game series, though I haven't finished any, excluding RE 3: Nemesis, by myself. I admit, that I just enjoyed to watch my friends playing RE. When first part of movie appeared, I was really amazed. It just did everything, that I needed. Second was not even a step behind and so was third. I wondered, when will they screw up (experienced by e.g. Alien, which fourth part was just silly). When I saw on IMDb, that Afterlife is going to release, I just waited for the date. I didn't see a trailer (I hate trailers). What I say about fourth RE is in the subject of this review. It's just awesome! Milla is outstanding and I even enjoy miss Larter, who lately is becoming a very talented actress for me. And it's Claire Redfield's fight against huge boss in the shower room, which amazed me most. This scene is 10 on 10 for me. So why no 10? One minus is similarity of Wesker to agents in matrix (I noticed it too). The second is for water-adapted zombies (exagerrated). Fight against Wesker is a little weak for me too. At first, he's much faster, than Alice, and later, somehow, he's too slow. And if we compare to the fight with this boss, I mentioned, then this fight is just weak. But whole movie is great. I can't wait for fifth part. Hope it will still be in the line with others. Oh, and about 3d. It was fine, but I was hoping, it will be in the IMAX technology. Simple 3d was a little disturbance for me. When I saw, that IMAX is not available, I was trying to watch film in simple 2d, but it wasn't available, either :D So I watched 3d. 3d effects are just so-so."

It's also funny that some people who don't like the film give one or two stars! C'mon! There are also four and five stars available which also means the movie wasn't good. I'm fun of the games and I think this movie was more faithful to the games than any previous movie. Two previous ones were just awful crap. This one was far better. I also liked the idea it was in 3D. I like Ali Larter and she fit as Claire perfectly. One thing I liked about this movie that females were sexy without having big boobs! I also think Wentworth Miller was good Chris.Shawn Roberts was good Wesker. What I would hoped is more time for Chris and Claire. I hope they get more time in next movie. I also was disappointed how little time Sienna Guillory had. She only appeared at the very end. There's no need to look deeper meaning for this movie. It was pure entertainment and worked that way."

","Such for me happens for the first time, the fourth part of a film has appeared better three previous together taken. It is the second of my favorit games (the first Silent Hill) and on it I was in earnest about films, though they not especially pleased me, before games by it was very far. All three parts of a film are good, but in them always something yes lacked and consequently they were on firm «4/5». And here the fourth part has surpassed all my expectations, it has appeared not worse the first games of a series (it already not that resident that earlier, have transformed it into a simple and banal action which too is quite good, but it already other kind of game).I would tell that time on a film now has come to make game and it it would appear better 4 and 5 parts of games. The plot, atmosphere and music underneath are ingenious. The actor's structure is magnificent, it was very pleasant to see in Ventvort Miller's film (the actor of my favorit serial ""Prison Break""), also has pleased a set of the best characters of a series of games, Albert Vesker was on the ball, it was such as it have shown in game Code Veronica, Kler and Chris Redfildy are remarkable. It was shaking, I as though have returned to the childhood and have felt that pleasant chill which felt playing old and kind first three parts plus Veronica on PS 2. A spoiler: the character from my favorit game of Sajlent Hill, has been successfully borrowed by Piramidhead, here it has been a little modified, but similarity was obvious also I was glad it to see (when thus that or is borrowed, it only on advantage), a remarkable course and bravo to Paul W.S. Anderson!!! We wait continuation, very much I hope that it will be in style of the fourth part."
"saharso","2","4","10","4 October 2010"," Disappointing
","I have been waiting for this movie to come out for about 2 years. Expecting a thrilling action-filled zombie flick like its predecessors, all I could find was one of the most boring, unthought-of and painfully predictable films I had the misfortune of seeing. The action scenes were scarce, too short and not particularly interesting; the special effects were shallow, almost amateurish, and not innovating in any way; and the plot was practically nonexistent. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen that would justify my expectations, only to be disappointed again and again with every passing minute. The only climax in the movie was the opening scene. But even that was not much more than a pale imitation of one ""the matrix'"" fight scenes.<br/><br/>To sum up: you already watched all the interesting parts in the trailer. Don't bother with the rest."

","We can expect more from the guy who directed Event Horizon. When I watch movies, I take them in for what they are, so I'm not going to compare Resident Evil to American Beauty or Mystic River. However, I can compare it to The Dark Knight, Doomsday, and Kickass, which are decent action movies with really well done action sequences and imagination. The Action in Resident Evil is really exaggerated; as in they try to make a whole lot of nothing into something. Like when Wesker is dodging bullets, hes just kind of standing there making retarded faces. My friend expected this to be a bad Resident Evil movie which most fans(those who loved the first three games, and Code Veronica) will expect, but this was just a bad movie. Nothing was explained, just shown to look bad ass. The characters are bullshit and cliché, and Chris's situation when you are introduced to him doesn't make any sense. Finally the most disappointing aspect of the movie was the action, they don't even really shoot them in the head anymore to kill the zombies, it's just shooting, and looking bad ass. Also the hand to hand fighting wasn't impressive, The Matrix, which was created over a decade ago, Kickass, Doomsday, Batman, Spiderman, Watchmen, V for Vendetta, THE EXPENDABLES, and every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie(Including Jingle all the way) have more enticing action scenes. However, the helicopters do look really bad ass, which is why I give this a 2 out of 10 instead of a 1 out of 10."
"Legendary_Badass","5","6","18","10 September 2010"," Almost a teenage gamer's dream come true
","Series star Milla Jovovich returns as Alice for this 4th installment in the Resident Evil film franchise, based on the video game series that won't stay dead. Also returning is her hubby Paul W.S. Anderson, director of Resident Evil (2002). Alice is accompanied by game protagonist Claire Redfield (Ali Larter). The two search the Earth for survivors from a worldwide zombie infestation and find some people atop a Hollywood prison. The plan is to get them to a rumored sanctuary known as Arcadia. But trying to stop them is the evil Umbrella Corporation boss Wesker (Shawn Roberts doing a really good Hugo Weaving impression) who started the plague, and of course a variety of walking, er running dead. <br/><br/>The Resident Evil film series is supposed to be taking place in the ""universe"" created by the games. Newsflash, this isn't Star Trek. Focusing on anyone outside of the central conflict isn't very interesting. That explains why Alice is at the head of everything, which conflicts with the story told in the games and confuses the heck out of fans of the game series.<br/><br/>From start to finish Resident Evil: Afterlife is a mess of unexplainable scenes. I'd say it was confusing, but that word implies a lack of understanding on my part. No, I'm certain that had I seen the first and second sequels that there would still be no way to make sense of this movie. Plot holes, contrivances, and silliness come at you in full force. Since I can't remember all the offenders, I hope to be forgiven for the ones I miss. There's Alice's HD camcorder that is set to record in only white, black, and red. There's the ""Executioner"" who appears in the middle of the city without provocation. Another strike for his ridiculous weapon, an axe chained to an anvil—a sign that what makes a fun game opponent doesn't necessarily make for a believable film character. This same game logic translates to the stupefying nature of the ""zombies"" featured this time around who are able to burrow and open their faces as though they are mandibles. This goes unexplained in the film, but it's a nod to the direction the game franchise went as it moved away from the confinements of the zombie definition and toward new outlandish territory. Lastly, my favorite gaff involves the look of shock in the faces of survivors when Alice attempts to land her plane on their building just after they were disappointed that she may fly off without them, raising questions over what they wanted in the first place.<br/><br/>Knowledge of the game series is vital since carryover characters did all their developing in the games. Characters created for the film are either soon to be dead or stoic. A girl by the name of K-Mart (Spencer Locke) is mentioned on occasion, and when the team finds her she manages to go the entire film without a line. The central antagonist is known in games as Wesker though I don't recall his name being said even once in the film and a cameo at the credits requires, you guessed it, knowledge of the games and previous films.<br/><br/>Not all is lost. Resident Evil: Afterlife is surprisingly attractive. Since Avatar launched 3D as a high-profit concept to escalate ticket prices, many films have tried to capture the same magic. Some resorted to adding the 3D effects in post-production. This film, like Avatar, does it in the camera. The difference in noticeable even if you rarely catch a 3D film at the cinema. Anderson shows this off by taking every opportunity to throw and point a variety of objects at the audience. Alice may have as many guns as her frame can carry, but that doesn't stop fellow survivors from tossing her a pistol or submachine gun. Even baddie Wesker gets into the act, needlessly tossing his sunglasses at Chris (Wentworth Miller). All of this is done in slow motion and all too often stealing the ""bullet time"" effect from The Matrix. Many Anderson vets have seen his movies because he got his hands on a franchise they care about, and they are often times disappointed at the numerous opportunities he takes to slow down the speed of the action, almost as though the goal is to bore the audience or stretch the runtime to meet a quota. Oddly, his pioneering efforts may have finally achieved notoriety thanks to the nature of 3D, because the slowed action provides audience members the time needed to admire the view. The crowning moment is the entirely slowmo fight with the Executioner in the prison shower. Water is flying in all directions, blood splatters on the lens of the camera, a giant axe is hurled at the crowd (making you consider ducking), every element plays on the 3D gimmick and to this date I have not seen a better sequence to showcase the technology.<br/><br/>Aside from the poetic nature used to hand justice to the bad guy, little if anything good can be said about the writing. Too often I was begging a character to make a quip and realize just how over-the-top the situation has become. There are worse zombie movies, and there are better. What saves Afterlife is an apparent dedication to production values, even over producing the film with some lavish sets, effects, and makeup (good to see that the girls found concealer in the midst of the chaos). It never comes across as second-rate and its knee-jerk pacing keeps you on edge. Almost a teenage gamer's dream come true. **"
"Leofwine_draca","2","3","7","13 May 2015"," Execrable nonsense
","RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE is the fourth RESIDENT EVIL movie I've watched and by far the worst of the lot. It's an execrable piece of nonsense, possibly the nadir of Paul W. S. Anderson's career, and that's saying something given the amount of dross this guy has turned out. It's clear that the only idea behind this sequel was to make more money from a semi-successful brand, because there's an entire dearth of ideas and imagination.<br/><br/>Once again, the wooden and unlikeable Milla Jovovich plays Alice, a dull cartoon character who goes around shooting zombies in the head and performing various wirework-assisted stunts. The story is very slight, involving her teaming up with a group of survivors trying to get to safety, but when they find themselves trapped inside a building under siege it's predictable zombie film time. Things get sillier and sillier until the ridiculous climax, which has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>Everything's poor about this film: the writing, the acting, the lunk-headed characters, that dialogue. The CGI effects are noticeably cheap-looking, and I'm glad I didn't see this in 3D as the effects looked poor too. Half the film seems to be ripped off from other stuff: those PREDATOR-mouthed monsters from BLADE 2, that giant axe-swinging guy from SILENT HILL. Needless to say this is a waste of time, even worse than the previous instalments."

It's like Troll 2, Anaconda, Battlefield Earth, The Room - you name it. It's a movie so interestingly stupid and bad, you just have to see it to believe it.<br/><br/>To mention some of the stupid things: * Alice is still the only one who's allowed to the important things here. * Alice uses coins in her shotguns disregarding the fact that she has lots of bullets in store - because it's her ""hobby"". * (spoiler) All the Alice clones dies in the opening scene, and they die way too easy; and they don't seem to know how to properly use their mental powers the last movie established she did perfectly well know how to properly use. * There's a guy in jail who's supposed to act cool. But think of him like this - he acts ""cool"" in the way a 6-8 year old kid would act like if you told them to act ""cool"". It's hilarious. * Alice picks up a signal of where she herself ASSUMES a safe haven from all zombies is located, goes over there to see it's abandoned, and then she ""knows"" the safe haven is abandoned. Later, some other people tells her the place is right in front of them as they stand on a skyscraper, and sees a boat with the name of that safe haven right outside of the city in the water (obviously). * Those zombies with tentacle mouths AND The Executioner from Resident Evil 5 are randomly added in here with NO explanation whatsoever.<br/><br/>So this is a really stupid movie, yes... but it's entertaining as hell if you can watch and laugh at it. We all know Paul isn't a good director (even though Death Race and Mortal Kombat are okay) - but this movie is almost down in level with Uwe Boll. But really; watch this movie. It's incredibly stupid, and really entertaining."

Mila too fails to deliver an effective performance. She seems to be in hurry to complete the movie and move to the next story. Also, her kick ass scenes are becoming boring and repetitive.

Token pieces of furniture were projected 3d so it looked like the actors were in a drama studio with a backdrop and a couple of props stage front.<br/><br/>About a third of the film is shot using compound camera trickery.

After finding Claire Redfield (a survivor she was with in Nevada), they make their way to L.A. where they find another small band of survivors who've taken refuge in a maximum security prison. Working together, they try to find refuge in Arcadia. However, all is not as it seems regarding Arcadia, and with the zombies continuing to surround the prison, it soon becomes a race against time to get to safety.<br/><br/>OK, the first three movies were decent....thin on story, granted (apart from really the 1st one), but they had good action & suspense. Unfortunately Resident Evil: Afterlife is messy. It starts out in Japan, where we see the start of the zombie attacks, then 4 years later where Alice and her ""friends"" try to break into the Umbrella Corporation there, then 6 months later she's hundreds of miles away in Alaska, so it's pretty confusing to follow to start with.<br/><br/>The story is, well, to say it's thin would be an understatement. Action is the main reliant, which isn't too bad, however this is basically a Matrix movie with a Resident Evil title. The slow motion action (which were obviously done for the 3D) is pretty cool in a good few scenes, but there's just a bit too many. It's a bit like a John Woo film on crack.<br/><br/>Also, this film copies so many other movies as well....Wesker dodging bullets (Neo from The Matrix); bullet time (Max Payne); Axeman character (Pyramid Head from Silent Hill); zombies mouths stretching open (vampires in Blade 2). So really nothing is that original.<br/><br/>The acting by Wentworth Miller (who played Chris Redfield) and Shawn Roberts (who played Albert Wesker) was just awful as well, so add that to other mediocre scenes and you have a very lackluster installment to the series. Some very cool action scenes but that's about it for this one really."

","Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) <br/><br/>* 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Alice (Milla Jovovich) leaves Alaska in a plane and ends up at Arcadia, a supposed safe haven but soon the remaining survivors there are wanting out when they realize something isn't quite right. The fourth film in the series had the original film's director Paul W.S. Anderson returning to the chair and bringing with him that incredibly annoying style that rips off THE MATRIX. It's clear that this style just isn't for me because I just don't feel a movie should be looking like a video game. The slow motion shots of seeing bullets fly through the air or 360 shots of a round kick to a zombie's head is nothing more than distracting to me. I understand Anderson has a good following but to me it just doesn't work and the opening sequence here just had me shaking my head and growing frustrated. The story to this entry isn't all that bad, although like the previous films it starts to run out of ideas and the finale really drags as we get into standard ""B"" movie action stuff. I thought the zombie designs were much better in this episode and we got some inventive kill scenes but this certainly didn't make up for the weak parts. As in the previous films, Jovovich is in fine form as she's very believable in the lead role. The supporting cast is also quite good but it's a shame no one involved got much to work with. RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE will probably entertain fans of the series but those such as myself will see it as another bad entry in a pretty weak series."

The plot holes in this film are ridiculous, you'll find yourself attempting to piece together parts of the story whilst the movie races from scene to scene.<br/><br/>The characters are lifeless and boring. I was only interested in Milla, for all the obvious reasons. Even so, I found Jovovich to be less than impressive. I enjoyed the first three movies but Resident Evil: Afterlife is no match for its predecessors.<br/><br/>To sum it up: It's a slow-mo pumped, plot less bore fest. HARDLY ANY ZOMBIE ACTION!"
"superal1966","6","2","4","25 September 2010"," Doesn't quite live up to Alice's promise
","*Contains minor spoilers*<br/><br/>I'll start by saying that I definitely feel I need to watch Resident Evil Afterlife again to pass proper judgement. I loved the first three films, especially Extinction and I think I expected too much from it and was quite disappoint that Alice, at least it seems so, lost her powers early on.<br/><br/>Added to this I must be one of the few people on the planet who doesn't like 3D films (I don't like wearing two pairs of glasses for two hours), I'm probably reviewing this with a slightly negative bias.<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich again plays the part very well and I thought Ali Larter likewise, although I'm not sure why Wentworth Miller was there, he was good in Prison Break but that's it.<br/><br/>Again my expectations let me down in that after Extinction I expected the entire fourth film to be about what was covered in ten minutes, but all in all I thought it was a weak plot. <br/><br/>I though there was a fair bit of unexplained randomness, like the dude with the axe/hammer. What was he all about and how did he become like that, I'm sure things would be different if there were more of his kind about. I like the concept of Arcadia but I'm pretty sure it was a thousand times bigger on the inside that it looked from the outside.<br/><br/>Again, we weren't really given any form of explanation as to what the device was on Claire's chest at the start of the film beyond it seemed to be mind controlling; and for a planet where there are next to no remaining survivors, more and more seem to appear for the sake of the plot. I feel the more people that are thrown into the mix the more it just becomes Alice against Umbrella rather than about the struggle of living in a desolate world.<br/><br/>I suppose I will have to comment on the 3D which was impressive, but I wouldn't recommend viewing this purely because it showcases 3D.<br/><br/>I loved the first three films and obviously this was a continuation, but I'd rather think of it as a film by itself as it doesn't do the promise at the end of the third film justice.<br/><br/>I hope Alice's story will continue if only to do justice to what has become an overall entertaining series of films (the ending was so open I can't imagine there not being one).<br/><br/>I don't really know what score to give this as I want to see it again when it comes out on DVD, but for now I'll go with my gut and give it a 6"

","Resident Evil: Afterlife is the fourth entry in the live action franchise based upon the Japanese video game series that started in the mid-nineties. The story revolves around the urban legend of a safe haven called Arcadia that seems to be located in Alaska. Former private security operative Alice attacks the headquarters of her former employer in Tokyo before heading for Alaska where she expects to join the group of survivors she had met eighteen months earlier. However, there is no safe haven to be found and Alice even gets attacked by a former companion who seems to have lost her memory and acts erratically. Alice manages to calm her former friend down and they travel south to Los Angeles to find out what happened to the group of survivors and unveil the secret behind the urban legend. The duo meets a group of survivors hiding in a maximum security prison that is surrounded by undead victims of the infamous T-Virus. Alice learns that Arcadia isn't a fixed place but a cargo tanker that is now situated in the port of Los Angeles. She tries to get on board to find out what happened to the survivors but realizes too late that the ship is a trap.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the new characters Alice encounters in Los Angeles are overall quite diversified, quirky and unique which leads to a few emotional scenes. The locations in and around the abandoned prison are quite haunting. The action scenes are particularly intense and are truly impressive in the film's middle section and ending. The special effects are fluidly crafted and blend in very well. The showdown on the ship is truly gripping but also ends on a cliffhanger leading to the fifth installment.<br/><br/>On the negative side, the transition between the third film and the fourth movie isn't exactly fluid as there is a gap of twelve months between the third film's last scene and the fourth movie's first scene. Furthermore, there is another gap of six months after the opening sequence. The scenes in Alaska are rather disappointing and basically only consist of a fight between Alice and the lone survivor who attacks her. The story is simplistic and unrealistic, even by the franchise's low standards. Some side characters such as the one played by Norman Yeung are rather exchangeable while former intriguing characters such as the one played by Spencer Locke only have cameo appearances here.<br/><br/>In the end, Resident Evil: Afterlife is pretty much on the same level as its predecessor. It's a slightly above average science-fiction movie with impressive effects and stunts, a healthy dose of creepy atmosphere and intriguing lead characters while it's suffering from a lack of fluidity, a ridiculous plot and boring side characters. Fans of the live action franchise can watch this film without any regrets but this is neither a good movie to discover the franchise nor a film that will change your mind if you have never managed to get into this particular franchise in the first place. At the end of the day, this movie is solid and entertaining but fails to innovate or leave a lasting impression."

"Tweekums","6","0","0","1 October 2016"," Alice returns for a fourth film in the series
","This, the fourth instalment in the ongoing 'Resident Evil' franchise, opens in Tokyo as Alice launches an attack on an Umbrella Corporation facility to be more accurate several Alices. With superhuman skill they illuminate the facility's guards but its director, Albert Wesker, escapes in a plane. As he takes off he detonates the facility's self-destruct mechanism entirely destroying it. The Original Alice manages to survive as she got aboard Wesker's plane; she confronts him but he injects her with something that neutralises the T-Virus in her, removing her superhuman abilities. The plane crashes shortly afterwards.<br/><br/>Alice then makes her way to Alaska where she hopes to find the village of 'Arcadia'; a last outpost of humanity. What she finds is an apparently deserted settlement. It soon becomes clear that one person is still there; Claire Redfield although she has lost all memories due to a strange device on her chest. Once the device is removed the two fly south along the coast. When they get to Los Angeles they find a small group of survivors living in an abandoned prison. They think she has been sent from Arcadia to rescue them it turns out that Arcadia wasn't a village at all but a ship that is now anchored off LA. It won't be easy to get to it though; the prison is surrounded by hordes of zombies and they are starting to breach its defences. Even when those who survive get to the ship their troubles are far from over and Alice must confront an old foe.<br/><br/>After the enjoyable third part this was a bit of a disappointment; the story contains few surprises I doubt many people will be surprised by the reveal regarding what has been going on aboard the Arcadia and who is behind it. There is lots of action, some of it pretty good, unfortunately some of it was also fairly obvious CGI. This might have looked good when watched in 3D at the cinema but wasn't too impressive on DVD. Milla Jovovich does a decent enough job as Alice and the rest of the 'good guys' are okay if a little cliché. Shawn Roberts had clearly been told to act as if he was Agent Smith from 'The Matrix' as much of his action and even gestures are clearly ripped off from that film. Overall I'd only recommend this if you are a fan of the series; if you equate zombies with horror and hope to be scared you'll probably be disappointed but if you want an hour and a half of fairly mindless action you could do worse.<br/><br/>The ending is clearly a set-up for the fifth film in the franchise; let's just hope it is a bit better than this one."
"thesanchez12","8","4","12","10 September 2010"," Very visually pleasing, but still missing something
","Okay, first off, I am a die hard RE fan for both the video games and for the movies. At first I was dissatisfied with the movies because they didn't go along with the games at all. Then i opened my mind to the concept and I can appreciate the direction they went in. However, I do have some problems with the character portrayals and with some of the tactical effects. But don't get me wrong, I have some props for this film as well.<br/><br/>First the good: The movie was very visually entertaining. I enjoyed the blood and gore, though less than the previous movies. The zombies looked great and the introduction of the zombies resembling the Las Plagas from the RE 4 and 5 games was refreshing. The axe wielding Brute was also a welcome adaptation and had an awesome fight scene. I also loved the fight scene and conflict with Wesker. FINALLY!! WELL DONE!<br/><br/>Now the bad: Though the reuniting of Claire and Chris was a much anticipated moment that just about every true fan was waiting for, something fell through. Chris was not accurately portrayed. If the writers are going to stray away from the video game stories, at least keep the character personas accurate, otherwise it is no longer Resident Evil- but something else entirely. Chris is a highly trained member of the RPD STARS unit, and later in the games (RE5) he is a government operative. They failed to portray this. His actions in the movie were sloppy and almost like a civilian picked up a gun and started shooting. This lack of precision disturbs me because i know that the film crew is capable of this. In RE Apocalypse, Carlos and Nikolai demonstrated this precision. One shot kills, and their movements were tight. They weren't spraying bullets everywhere. This is what Chris's character should have been. The writers need to play RE 1, Code Veronica, and 5 through and understand the character of Chris Redfield. To bring such a huge character from the game into the movie and have him just..... punked is such an injustice.<br/><br/>Now some questions: Is this really the last movie? There is such a cliffhanger- Wesker possibly survives (Parachute in the background after the plane explosion) and Umbrella is closing in on the ship. Who is the chick on the incoming plane in the closing scene? Seems very reminiscent of the Presidents daughter (Ashley i believe) from the RE 4 video game, Which leaves it open to a possible Leon Kennedy adaptation. So why end the movies here? The movie was great overall... just missing some things."

","Paul W.S. Anderson, we know him, we love him, we worship him. He is the eye behind Death Race,Alien Vs. Predator and Pandorum. He is the human entity responsible for the Resident Evil franchise. Part one was great, and part 3 was the supremely painted masterpiece. And dudes, let's just admit it, we love, love love Milla Jovovich. And if we are honest with ourselves, this is why we compulsively pay 12.50 at the theater whenever another crappy Resident Evil chop-shop sequel comes out. We love her buns, her rack, her model-like features, her deep sexy confidence and her barely restrained libido. I speak the truth, and this truth was well known by the producers and even Milla herself. Moving forward with this truth we are now in a position to criticize the most recent addition, which is truly an atrocious aberration of movie making. Just stick with parts 1 and 3, which I give ten stars easily."
"lethalweapon","7","3","8","25 October 2010"," Evidently Feeble... But I still loved it.
","The Resident Evil series is about Alice, a survivor in a world infested by zombies, created by the evil Umbrella Corporation who is trying to experiment with weapons of war. In the first three movies, she was hunted down by the corporation, experimented on, given superpowers, and cloned several times until she becomes an all-powerful nature-controlling rapid-healing super-freak Rick James could have been proud of.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Afterlife starts with the Alice clones storming an Umbrella facility in Japan. In a brief, but spectacular action sequence, the clones manage to destroy the facility. By the end of this sequence, the clones are all killed and Alice's superpowers are taken away, making her 'human again'. Naturally, this is immediately followed by a plane crash.<br/><br/>Now there are established rules on how a Hollywood action movie can show a plane crash where the central characters are directly involved. This is where the hero heroically tries to rescue the villain despite their oh-so-many differences out of the goodness of his heart, and the maniacal villain succumbs to the crash with a look of hopeless despair whereas the hero jumps out with some nicks and cuts on his right arm and left cheek.<br/><br/>The rules are rigid. The hero may be replaced by a heroine and the villain may sport a maniacal sneer instead of a look of hopeless despair, but with this the flexibility ends. This movie, however, proves to be a maverick here. As a plot device, it served the same purpose as an eraser After the crash, the newly humanized Alice shows up walking in the desert armed with nothing but a sneer, two silver revolvers, and a bagful of makeup.<br/><br/>During her travels she stumbles upon Claire Redfield, last seen flying off in a helicopter to parts unknown in the last installment. Claire is now suffering from temporary amnesia, and running around wild, with dirt encrusting significant portions of her face, clothes and hair. She attacks Alice for a brief minute before she gets knocked down cold. In the next scene, she is shown tied up as a prisoner in the plane's backseat. What got ME interested, however, were the events between these scenes. Because the Claire who was tied in the backseat had gotten a complete makeover. She had her hair done, face washed, clothes cleaned, and had apparently gone through an entire beauty treatment package. Apparently, Alice is a stickler for appearance. After she punched Claire's lights out, she washed her and her clothes, did her hair, and even applied lipstick. So the good news is that even though we can expect the future to be a grim host for undead zombies, prisoners are probably going to be treated quite well. Maybe the Geneva Convention gets stricter.<br/><br/>But while she looks gorgeous and fulfills the horror movie hot girls quota, Claire is still plagued by her memory loss throughout the movie. The only thing she seems to remember from the previous movies is that during slow motion shots, she needs to heave her chest up and down in as exaggerated a fashion as possible, without looking downright asthmatic.<br/><br/>The movie then proceeds to invent excuses for other action sequences a rooftop plane crash, a survivor's fortress, an invincible ax-wielding monster, a brief underwater chase, and an impromptu bungee jump, all enhanced by the VFX team. The zombies themselves were well trained, clearly well versed with the Hollywood zombie rules They walk with their arms outstretched, they never nip at each other, move as slowly as possible while hovering around the background, trying to peck at new victims, but move VERY fast if a chase seen is in the horizon. They never nip at each other, and for the heroine, they either graciously move aside for her to pass by running, or place their faces directly in front of her flying bullets.<br/><br/>Pretty soon, Alice and her gang of survivors get to a ship called Arcadia supposedly a sanctuary for renegade survivors, but soon uncovered to be a front for the Umbrella corporation who were just abducting and experimenting on people Alice walks in to Umbrella's top secret floating facility and stares at the pristine, well maintained all-white laboratory-like space in the ship, markedly different from its gruff exterior, and moves on to see the villain smiling, seated, and waiting for her entry. Once again, what got ME interested, were the events before this scene. Apparently, the super-villain's concern for personal appearance was no less rigid than Alice's own. To be at the perfect seated location as Alice walks in, he must have practiced his poise and adjusted the lighting to get the perfect effect. It wasn't like he was seated behind a desk making notes/ drawing diabolical schematics for Acme products. He was seated waiting. That's dedication. Also, consider the pristine condition of the facility, and the fact that the impeccable white walls and floors hadn't so much as gathered dust. Add to it the fact that Albert was the lone mobile person in the craft. It tickles me pink to think that before Alice comes in for the climactic showdown, the megalomaniac super-villain must probably have spent his time dusting and scrubbing the floors.<br/><br/>I like to think that he still had his apron on and brooms in hand as he saw Alice board the ship on some video monitor. Presumably, he then hurriedly hid the cleaning tools, changed to his super-villain clothes, and staged his sitting position in the nick of time.<br/><br/>So with her humorlessly timed entrance, Alice engages the villain in hand to hand to bullet to dog combat. She apparently kills Albert in the end, but I wouldn't be surprised if he pops in for the next installment. All in all, I will put in a solid 4 zombie thumbs up for the movie, as long as you leave your brain behind. Not in an undead kind of way, though."

Jovovich is game as always in the movie. While Larter, Miller and Kodjoe are fine in their roles. While Roberts certainly having fun with his role. This time, Writer and Director:Anderson certainly takes his premise more seriously this time around. Although it doesn't stop Anderson increasing his visual style by giving tribute to ""The Matrix"" and two John Carpenter films like ""Escape from New York"" (Which for some reason an few of the prison sequences reminded me a lot of that movie) and ""The Thing"".<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Anderson is planning ""Resident Evil 5"" and probably ""Resident Evil 6"". Hopefully, if Anderson has an few more tricks up his sleeve. For sure, the future sequels of ""Resident Evil"" should be good. I seen this movie only on the regular 2-D version. The movie looked good, despite some very obvious 3-D moments. ""Resident Evil:Afterlife"" is certainly an improvement over the semi-lame/mess ""Resident Evil:Apocalyspe"" and reasonably entertaining ""Resident Evil:Extinction"". Perphas not much Zombie action for some tastes. If you enjoy the games or better yet, the ""RE"" series, you will be entertained.

"kreisikutsu","7","3","8","3 October 2010"," Enjoyed it more that RE2 and RE3
","First off, to those who claim 3D was blurry or whatnot: Choose a good theater and have your glasses replaced as soon as you see that something is off, because I watched it on digital screen and the 3D was absolutely perfect and really crisp in our theater, I could make out tiniest details in every scene, so I really do not understand those complaints (maybe it's from cast of a rivaling 3D movie or something? :D).<br/><br/>And now, to the point:<br/><br/>I liked this movie a lot more than RE2 and even RE3 in some ways.<br/><br/>I had to forgive it a few cheesy moments (bullets flying slower than they should in few scenes) and some a bit over-emotional acting on Jovovich part (especially the cam bits). That said, I am yet to see an actor make a good ""Imma gonna record myself on the cam now and be all emotional about my long lost friends and stuff"" footage. Any cam recording in any movie just seems unrealistic to me.<br/><br/>Great over-all atmosphere, a few nice jump-scares, nice 3D and action (maybe a bit clichéd sometimes, but I personally had never seen those scenes in 3D, and it was fun to see the dust flying off the walls and empty shells and rubble fly towards you etc.) Sometimes it reminded me of the first movie. They even used a song from the second, which made me feel a bit nostalgic, since I really like the RE2 soundtrack (not the movie itself as much). Part 3 was just too ""wastelandy"" to me and it was good to see RE in it's natural habitat once again: a big city, lot's of zombies. Plus ""the stuff"": mutants, dogs, and a nice surprise (I cannot recall if it was shown in the trailers so I won't spoil him, but very nice fight scene).<br/><br/>Tl,dr: 3D was ""Let me pull that knife out of my forehead and wipe that blood off my glasses... wow, look at those raindrops fall on her feet!"" perfect. Acting and story could be better, but I liked it in many ways more than parts 2 and even 3.<br/><br/>Conclusion: For a RE fan - must see, especially if you liked the first one and did not like where parts 2 and 3 were going."

","OK I didn't see this in 3D so maybe seeing it in 3D would have given the film a bit of an edge. But I judge films based on their plot and entertainment and I can enjoy a film even if it isn't in 3D - I think that it is mainly just an incentive for you to like it even more. In my opinion, if a movie is horrible and its in 3D - it is simply that. A movie that is bad and in 3D.<br/><br/>Now afterlife isn't a horrible movie. I enjoyed the first three, in particular the third, which I think the is the best of the three. Afterlife is simply more the same excuse to have big special effects and continue a plot that simply seems will never end with Umbrella continuing on forever in the next 'afterlife'.<br/><br/>The monsters in this movie were good, but I think the zombies don't really play much of a part in the horror and are simply there just to add to the atmosphere. Also, I felt that near the end, it borrows too much from the Matrix and is really nothing original.<br/><br/>I was also expecting more from the characters who appeared in the third film and they really aren't given much to do. Milla Jovovich is fine in her role but she simply is given the same mission over and over in all the films - save people and get them to safety. Honestly, how many times do you have to see this done in each Resident Evil movie? I'm not saying this isn't entertaining nor is it visually nice, but I think if they keep doing this over and over, it's gonna wear thin pretty soon. I'd wait for the DVD."

"Dragonsouls","7","3","8","17 September 2010"," Review from a die-hard Resident Evil fan...
","Of the video games! I played every Resident Evil game, and more than once. I can honestly say that the reason I score this film so high is because I saw it in 3D. I was totally blown away by the technological aspects of this film! But; 3D aside, it was still a large production, and larger than all three films preceding it.<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich is one of the best female action hero's ever. She is born for these roles, and also can act! Ali Larter was not as gripping and emotional in this film, but they still make a good team. I really think they are friends off=camera.<br/><br/>Lets face it, the Resident Evil films were nothing like the video games. RE2 was probably the closest, because it was more of a horror film than Sci-fi. The games were like that, closer to horror with a touch of Sci-fi. Instead, the movies are the opposite, not excluding this 4th installment. I wonder...what does Resident evil have to do with the Matrix? or Equilibrium? Nothing if you ask me, but still, a rather impressive film nonetheless. Afterlife makes the effects in the Matrix feel like yesteryear. I actually had to take off my 3D glasses at times! Still, I would trade it all away for the nostalgia of the games, the Gothic and creepy sets; the Mystery; Umbrealla Corp and their motives; The scarcity of ammo; the psychological aspects of the Zombies, reading about what they were going through during transforming; and finally the soundtrack. I loved the Electronica soundtrack in this film but would gladly trade it away for the excellent creepy soundtracks of the video games.<br/><br/>Fans of the games won't be too disappointed. I was a little, since it had no plot at all. It was just eye candy to me, but some pretty sweet candy at that! So if you like roller-coasters, then you will like Resident Evil : Afterlife."

I was disappointed with the treatment of his character Chris Redfield who by the way is the main protagonist in the game.

Within the opening minutes, Alice and clones stage a daring incursion into the Tokyo facility of Umbrella corporation, causing chaos and ultimately facing down the T-virus powered chairman, Wesker. The writer, also Paul WS Anderson, must have known by now how quickly the movie would be over since Alice could just pop the guy's head like she did in Resident evil Apocalypse. So through some stupidly convenient plot device, Alice is superhuman no more and all her clones are gone. Now on the run, she proceeds to Alaska in the hopes of reaching the last safe haven where her friends fled to, a place named ""Arcadia"".<br/><br/>The mystery thickens when all she discovers is an empty landing field and a deranged Claire Redfield (Ali Karter) under the control of some weird biomechanical device. After saving Claire, the duo proceed to Los Angeles where they encounter another group of survivors holed up in a prison. With zombies all around and a new dangerous giant axe/hammer wielding threat heading their way, Alice, Claire and the survivors must find a way out ASAP. Their last hope may rest with a prisoner named Chris.<br/><br/>It all sounds a lot better than it turned out. Story-wise, it is a very standard action movie narrative with maybe only one good twist. Though the resident evil films have always been light on story, this one is possible the lightest. The characters are the main problem. Anyone who is not Alice is relegated to being a one-dimensional stock character common in zombie apocalypse movies. You have a conniving a55-hole in a business suit, the damsel, the rough-n-tough soldier, the big strong African American guy and a token Asian dude with no attempt made to make the audience care whether they live or die. Claire Redfield takes over the role of amnesiac from Alice's initial appearance in the first movie, who slowly regains her memory and conveniently reveals the plot. None of them are given any development at all. Even the main character of Alice manages to be both uninteresting and underdeveloped; getting no emotional closure after four movies.<br/><br/>Paul WS Anderson, the baby with the 3D, must have spent so much time making his wife look good on screen that he forgot not only to write a good story but to direct good action. He blatantly rips off The Matrix trilogy, Dawn of the Dead, and possibly Ninja Assassin. And by ""blatantly"" it means lifting whole scenes to the point where it should usually be considered a copyright violation. Almost 90% of the combat scenes are in slow motion, easily reminding one of Uwe Boll's ""House of the Dead"", complete with painful over usage of 360 degree panning and other matrix bullet time effects. As a resident evil movie, Afterlife commits the worse crime possible by having little Zombie killing action. The very sci/fi-ish set up, the CGI cityscapes, lack of Zombies and Milla Jovovich doing Gun Kata makes this feel more like ""Ultraviolet 2"" than a Resident Evil film. <br/><br/>Perhaps the one redeeming factors is how the franchise is trying its damnedest to move back on track with the games. There are numerous references especially to Resident Evil 5 and Code Veronica; the Executioner, Wesker's appearance, even that P30 bug thing just to name a few. Alice no longer dominates the screen as Game characters like Chris and Claire get their fair amount of time to shine. No doubt the fan-boys might be more pleased than usual about this. Oh yes, and there is Avatar-style 3D which just shows how weak the movie would be without this gimmick.<br/><br/>Like a shambling zombie in the movie, Resident evil Afterlife now plods through the underworld. A sad Frankenstein's-monster pastiche of past action films with an erratic pace and a lack of good action. It has become Paul WS Anderson's vehicle to showcase his pretty little wife and his latest gimmick 3D toy to the world. Among the Resident evil movies, this one is has the least substance but the most style. No doubt the slick 3D action would please the millions of simple-minded adrenaline junkies. It would find warm reception too perhaps from fans who desire something closer to that of the games (compared to past movies), and maybe existing fans of the Resident evil movie franchise who know what to expect.<br/><br/>With the promise of a sequel, one wonders how much lower can the franchise go now that its already all gone to hell. Well, At least it is a nice looking and entertaining Hell."

","Paul W.S. Anderson directs what are essentially the world's most expensive fan films. A juvenile genre-meister, he indulges likeminded audiences to the best of his meager ability. He may have better intentions than a Michael Bay, or less pretension than a Zack Snyder, but he has none of either's cinematic audacity, and that's even worse. He has grandiose ideas, but not the slightest clue how to achieve them.<br/><br/>So instead, he swills a bland pastiche that passes from the eyes directly to the cerebral outbox. Sitting through ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" evokes an atmosphere of weightless detachment, especially from his characters, who are human beings only in the physiological sense of the term. You also feel a sort of sleepy sympathy for Anderson himself, who's trying too hard to be cool, and stretching himself beyond his means in the process.<br/><br/>But my sympathy for the man dead-ends there; ""Afterlife"" is plain bad. When you get to the fourth film in a franchise like ""Resident Evil,"" inspiration has less to do with innovative story than it does untapped locations. ""Where in the World is Milla Jovovich?"" more or less describes the creative process, and this week she's in a jail and on a boat along the California coastline, where she meets yet another readymade team of post-apocalyptic survivors, and uncovers yet another marginal scientific abomination from the Umbrella Corporation.<br/><br/>I don't know. Maybe I'm biased. In the interest of full disclosure, I haven't seen either of the middle two ""Resident Evils,"" but the hate-sandwich formed by parts one and four make me more than a little suspicious of what's in between. Mostly, however, I take issue with Anderson because as a fan of the video games, I know exactly what he had to work with, and exactly where he came up short: everywhere. He doesn't get it; the influence of ""Night of the Living Dead"" on the games of is obvious, yet his adaptations bear more resemblance to ""The Matrix"" than anything. He might as well have remade ""Silent Hill"" as a musical.<br/><br/>However, like me, the studio granted him another opportunity based on two measly characters: ""3D."" In a ceaselessly underwhelming film, one of the biggest disappointments of all is how underwhelming the use of said technology is. Anderson employs it as neither an over-the-top spectacle nor for subtle immersion. The effect is merely there, underutilized and as quickly forgotten as the images themselves.<br/><br/>And Anderson is just warming up in the disappointment department. What quickly becomes apparent in ""Afterlife"" is that he's incapable of or uninterested in self-improvement. In fact, if anything, my distant memory of his original film outshines this unnecessary addition to the over-dead franchise. Each of his lame action sequences is still gaudily accentuated by the usual suspects of technical gimmickry: slow-motion acrobatics, bullet-time, and of course, plenty of emo-rock accompaniment. And that's brilliant in comparison to the clunky, ugly, lifeless expository scenes that divide them. He's a filmmaker I can't even advise to play to his strengths.<br/><br/>Still, I have no doubt that Anderson has a genuine passion for the properties he ruins. Flourishes from the latest ""Resident Evil"" video game in ""Afterlife"" are proof that the writer/director is first and foremost a fan—And that's exactly his problem. Anderson is delivering disposable fan service, a hodgepodge of inarticulate regurgitation, rather than a proper adaptation. With complete disregard for the intents of the original artists, he flagrantly reappropriates their work for his own silly operas.<br/><br/>That stuff may fly at comic con, where everybody knows you did it in your basement with a couple buddies—But when a major studio sinks sixty million dollars on it, it just seems like a waste of money and everybody's time."

","More K-Mart. More K-Mart. MORE K-MART! <br/><br/>I know: one model-slash-actress should be enough. Three female slashies plus four slashie guys verges on overkill. Watching skinny women (even adults) flip, flop and fly in leggings of their own design is great fun. But you throw in a teenager toward the end, and I get nostalgic for the days when Milla Jovovich wasn't quite so grown up. It's awful of me to say since, in her mid-thirties, she looks fabulous. Except she doesn't look twenty. <br/><br/>Should I hate myself for admitting my opinion? Hey, it cuts both ways. I don't look as good as I used to either. And I never looked as good as Milla. But I digress.<br/><br/>For what it is, a 4th-installment video-game spin-off 3D spectacle with less story, plot, or character than the slimmest of its forebears, it's a fine effort. Lots of shooting, stabbing, cutting, biting, crashing, yeah, yeah, yeah. ""Afterlife"" destroys Tokyo better than most Godzilla movies do. And while I think it's a mistake to top-load a Milla movie with multiple Millas and then spiral down to one, there are compensations. Watching people get blown apart with coin-loaded shotguns is better than, say, not watching that.<br/><br/>To be fair, these movies do have one character, and (usually; definitely in this case) one actor who deserves the title. Milla's better than any other single factor in these things, though this time she has fewer opportunities to act than in the previous three; but that's okay, because the combined presence of Ali Larter and Wentworth Miller is nearly enough to stop me from paying to see any slashie act again, ever."

","I'll be short and to the point. The title of this review pretty much sums up this rubbish. I've watched and liked previous Resident Evils but this one isn't like them. That's not because of numerous plot holes or bad scripting but simply because of such terrible, god awful directing. <br/><br/>I will be short and to the point. This film is at no point scary, funny or dramatic - this is mostly due to overuse of 3D effects and overuse of high speed camera. Dogs are extremely obvious 3D animations. For a lot of people this is enough of a reason to skip this mess. There's nothing worse than a ""scary monster"" that looks awkward rather than scary.<br/><br/>A rule of thumb is if you can't do CG right don't do it at all. Already at 300 milliseconds of seeing those dogs one realizes they're fake. Even actors are often CG. There were movies where actual actors and animals have been 3D rendered and you couldn't tell a difference, this one is not such movie. Add a constant and excruciating use of slow motion effect to that and you get a very awkward looking scene where you're basically forced to nit pick details because of sheer boredom. I loved the role of dogs in previous movies, they were truly terrifying because they felt real and natural... no need for slow-mo-3D fiesta.<br/><br/>The whole atmosphere feels fake too. At no point is there an illusion that any of this is real. It feels more like a bad commercial that you can't wait to end. Put it simply, it's boring and an insult to your senses.<br/><br/>As for the town burning even after 5 years, bad guys wearing glasses inside, Milla surviving at impossible odds - it's part of the series and kind of intentional. However, a perfectly trimmed beard? This Resident Evil brings a metroxeual male supermodel as its main protagonist now right next to Milla."

We're led to believe at the end of Extinction that there might be a colony in Alaska that's still functional... you'll have to get through the first 30 minutes of contrived CG before that even gets addressed. There is actually a scene where Milla Jovovich asks ""do you know who I am?"" This is not ""The Matrix"" and Milla/Alice is not ""The One."" And it goes downhill from there.<br/><br/>I mean seriously, who wrote this, Michael Bay? It's bad. It ruins me for the whole franchise.

There's a loose and random weave about survivors looking for hope in a world now long beyond saving who through a variety of convenient plot points find themselves in peril repeatedly.<br/><br/>As if the unanswered questions from the third installment still going unanswered wasn't enough - We have yet more fuel for the fire with ""WTF"" moments, random slow motion (designed no doubt to build tension in moments that are already laughable!) and scenes installed to wow the crowds who forked out the extra for the 3D seats.<br/><br/>The return of a few old characters and introduction of new, doesn't really help the plot go anywhere. The extra characters are with us so briefly that we aren't given anytime to care whether they live or die. In fact the returning heroins characters development stalls at the opening credits and by the end of the movie I didn't care if Milla survived or not.<br/><br/>Borrowing far to heavily from Resident Evil 5, villains, characters, scene for scene remakes proves how lazy the movie writers have actually become. Unexplainable situations arise if only to insert a game moment that will have 12 years old jumping up and down with excitement. The movie itself carries a 15 certificate which seems highly inflated since its target audience is in fact the 12 year old life blood that keeps movies like this alive.<br/><br/>The same 12 year olds who littered the front row at the cinema will be glad to know the unavoidable cash hungry sequel will be on our screens in 2015 apparently - Leaving just enough time for Capcom to pen the game sequel Anderson can rip off to use as the basis of Resident Evil:Retribution.<br/><br/>I'm a long time fan of the Resident Evil series, just because I'm 28 doesn't mean I cant enjoy what is clearly a popcorn movie. What I don't enjoy is seeing what had serious potential reduced to laughable proportions epic in scale.<br/><br/>Sitting opposite Skyline as one of the worst movies this decade, Resident Evil:Afterlife proves that Milla will never live up to her potential as an actress, Paul Anderson will never win an Oscar and that a successful game to movie transition remains just out of reach again."

"diegoavilarodriguez","1","2","5","7 March 2011"," Total disappointment :(
","So when the first RE film came out, I was happy. It did everything a film based on a video game like Resident evil should do; it created a new storyline with new characters, it introduced a new audience that had not heard of said game without making the gamers repeat a story the already saw, it gave cool nods to the franchise that us fan boys can smile about, it entertained us, scared us a bit, it didn't try to add characters from the franchise into its storyline solely for fan service (a mistake later made by its 3 sequels), and most importantly, it made itself seem like it was part of the same canon of the video game and fitting just fine (My geek out moment was when they said ""Take him to the Nemesis Program"") :D<br/><br/>So as the series went along, it became clear that not only were films not part of the same canon as the video games, but the film series seemed to distance itself from their source material.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was excited with what Afterlife might bring to table, especially after the ending in Extinction, with Alice starring at dozens of her own clones. But then the clones get killed off before the first act of the films is even half way through, so I felt cheated. But what mostly bothered me was how much the film seemed to borrow from Resident Evil 5; to the point things don't even make sense. I mean, where did the Axe guy come from? Did Wesker send him? Was he the result of a previous Umbrella experiment that just happened to break loose during the outbreak? Of all the places, why is it in L.A? The licker in RE 1 had reason for being there, Nemesis also had a reason and Dr. Isaac also had its reason for why he became the way he did. But where does this guy come into play? I know he isn't the final villain but regardless he is simply an unexplained plot device used to move them from point A to point B and he is also there because he was in RE 5. Why does it borrow so much from RE 5? Now I understand it is a film adaptation and my problem isn't that they use too much or that it shouldn't, it's that after having their last 2 films fall so far away from the video games' set storyline, they start borrowing ideas for its plot? Why? I thought heading further away from what the games did worked for it, in fact, the other reason I disliked the film is because the story of RE5 wasn't even that great, or interesting. The mind control devices, Jill Valentine at the end (with the same look and everything), the Axe monster, the new zombies with huge mouth, Wesker, I mean come on. <br/><br/>And there were also things I hated about it that have nothing to do with what it borrowed:<br/><br/>1. Alice loses her powers, yet still manages to survive a helicopter crash. 2. The clones die too early (I know I already mentioned this) 3.It's good to know that even though the world is taken over by zombies, women will still use a lot of make up 4. If Alice survived the helicopter crash and was able to walk out of there, why didn't Wesker do the same and manage to capture her then and there? 5. Alice just stands there while Chris and Claire fight against Wesker, oh and so do Wesker's hounds. 6. What's with the coin bullet thing? I would make sense if this had been added in Extinction but they don't even explain why she does it exactly. I mean where did this idea come from? 7. Who better to play Chris Redfield than Wentworth Miller (the guy from Prison Break) especially because he knows to get out of the prison! 8. The athlete guy jumping, grabbing the end of an airplane and manages to balance it out before it falls off a building. (Dunno if this is physically possible, but the scene just bothers me because it makes him look too super powered, although if the scene is possible then I don't care.) 9. Wentworth Miller isn't a good Chris and neither is the Chris in this movie. 10. Also, Alice loses her powers, and later in the film she gets stabbed in the arm, and she genuinely seems to feel pain, but then she uses that arm just fine, and apparently she must have contracted Wolverine's healing factor because the wound isn't even there anymore nor is it even acknowledged that ever happened. What the hell? Did she lose her powers or not?! Did she retain some bits of her powers? I don't care what the explanation is, I just need one.<br/><br/>Most of the things they did were simply done because of the success of RE5 and because they wanted to cash off the success of 3D. It's that simple, the plot isn't there because they don't care about it, and they were just looking to cash in on the success of something else. Sure they were doing that before, but it at least made money for its own merit and not so much from what it borrowed. It wasn't trying to cash off the success of the RE games, otherwise it wouldn't have distanced itself from it at first. To me this is makes the makers of the franchise seem either hypocritical or just plain greedy, or maybe both. <br/><br/>This is coming from someone who has been enjoying the franchise so far. Sadly I must give Resident evil Afterlife 1/10 stars. There was no pay off, too many plot holes and unexplained plot devices, the characters seemed too powerful to be human and too much was borrowed for its own good."
"tburke85","5","2","5","2 January 2011"," Resident Evil AfterLife Is Okay But Not The Greatest
","Resident Evil Afrerlife is okay but not the greatest that has flaws which I'll get into later from writer/director Paul Anderson. It's the fourth film in the Resident Evil series.<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich reprises her role as Alice the unstoppable killing machine heroine and she's perfect as the character who can still kick some serious ass while looking beautiful doing it. I just wish they had given her more to do -acting wise- than just killing countless undead zombies and various monsters (includine one with a giant axe) most likely created by the Umbrella Corporation. <br/><br/>Ali Larter also returns as Claire Redfield from the third film who joins Alice once again in her quest to find survivors. Larter does what her role requires and she gets a decent action scene near the end.<br/><br/>Wentworth Miller plays Claire's brother Chris who unfortunately doesn't really serve any real purpose except as a nod to die Resident Evil game fans. Miller's performance isn't that bad it's just his character isn't really developed or his relationship with Claire.<br/><br/>Shawn Roberts seemed to be doing his best Agent Smith from the Matrix impression as the villain Albert Wesker unless thats how his character acts in the games. He gets two scenes the beginning and the end so for somebody who's supposed to be the main villain he's not in that much at all. His fight at the end between Claire and Chris felt anti-climatic. Not to mention it doesn't last very long either. A third act that had the same problem some other films (Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Transformers 2 to name a few) did as well when the main bad guy is easily defeated within a few minutes.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast including Kim Coates, Boris Kodjoe, and a brief cameo by Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine are okay but none of them are given any development, substance, or depth.<br/><br/>The action sequences are okay but nothing we haven't seen before and there's no tension or suspense. The fact that there's no humor didn't help either. The zombies are all right despite not getting half as much screen time as they did in the previous three films. The monster with the huge Axe was decent despite just showing up with no explanation something a lot of the creatures do.<br/><br/>And what was the purpose of taking away Alice's powers early on if it doesn't have any effect at all besides turning her human again? Because a minute later she somehow survives a plane crash in the mountains and apparently walks away without a scratch. This just didn't make a whole lot of sense like many other things. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief when it comes to movies but only to a point. <br/><br/>The ending was predictable and a cameo by a certain character during the credits seemed a little pointless expect to set up for another sequel. At 97 minutes Resident Evil Afterlife wasn't that bad it just suffers from the sequel curse by cramming too much into one movie. The film seemed to be made purely for the action which may please some but I like to have a compelling story with well developed character, drama, emotion, suspense, and humor to go along with the spectacle."

","As a fan of the RE film franchise, I was hoping that after the way things were left with Extinction, we were in for an interesting movie with Afterlife. Alas, it was merely elaborate set pieces to show off the 3D special effects and everything else was merely filler in between fights with various foe in different states of mutation. And who exactly were the baddies? Nothing was explained so I'm assuming you had to have played the game to know who they were.<br/><br/>With no explanation, the new baddies look like rip offs from other horror franchises - The Executioner looks like Pyramid Head from Silent Hill and the zombies who's entire faces open up to reveal internal suckers look like the Reapers from Blade II. Are we to assume that these are all creations of the Umbrella corporation or subsequent mutations of the T-virus? Surely there could have been just a teeny bit of explanation as to where all these new villains actually materialised from?! All the new characters served no purpose apart from being appetisers for a zombie buffet and there is still no character development whatsoever. What is the purpose of Chris and Clare Redfield in the films? Why bother paying Spencer Locke and Sienna Guillory to reprise roles that lasted all of two minutes? Is something going to actually HAPPEN in RE5? Because nothing whatsoever happened in RE4. All of the best action and major plot points were in the trailer - nothing new was added during the film.<br/><br/>All the guff at the end of Extinction where the White Queen talked about 'Alice's blood being the key to curing the T-virus' and she was in possession of 'all the equipment she would need to synthesise the cure'. What happened to all of that? We see loads of Alice clones attacking the Umbrella facility in Japan - so was that Alice's only objective? To have revenge and kill Wesker? Again, nothing was explained. Did ALL the Alice clones die in the explosion in Japan? Who IS Wesker? What exactly is his function and what are Umbrella actually up to? Questions, questions and not one iota of information from RE4 explains any of that. I am scratching my head to understand what the point of it all was as all the major plot points could have been summed up in about 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Disappointingsuch potential to create an interesting story arc wasted on 97 minutes of incoherent drivel."

","Alice is back again but she could have stayed away. She returns to kick more zombie butt, too bad she does in it such an old, been-there-done-that fashion. Tired effects from 1999 were used way too much in the movie. What happened? Did somebody see the original Matrix and think, ""Ooo let's let Alice run wild with these cool effects?"" It would have been coolat the turn of the century. Now, it's just plain boring. How many times have you seen the effect where the subject is frozen and the camera swings around them? Or how about the slow motion bullet dodge. That effect has been used in everything from commercials to Stewie and Lois on the family guy.<br/><br/>When it comes to the scare factor and gore, the scare factor was weak. Again the producers used a warmed over effect, the peeled open face thing from the Blade series. It would have been better to see Alice and company kill zombies the old fashioned way, with wired acrobatic martial arts moves, knives, swords, guns and bombs.<br/><br/>The gore factor was mild, no arterial blood squirting in 3D or anything. Speaking of that, why is the movie in 3D? It adds absolutely nothing to the experience or the story. O.k. Hollywood it's been a couple of years now of having America sit in theaters with plastic glasses on, enough is enough.<br/><br/>The movie company already has a Resident Evil 5 in the works. Boy, they do know how to beat a dead horse. (Spoiler alert) Trecia Helfer (6 from Battlestar Galactica) is great but do you really want to pay full price to see her in future zombie flick #5?

","It's a 3rd rate movie, with none existent story that all manages to do is combining some music with some stolen characters from other movies like Silent Hill and Matrix and fully destroying the Resident Evil franchise once and for all.<br/><br/>Dude, it was not suppose to be a MTV video clip or commercial. Write a story first, then shoot the scenes. It's funny that after this mess, they had the nerve to open the door for the next part too!<br/><br/>Although I didn't watch the 3D version of the movie, I must say: Very disappointing experience... Not recommended to the fans. It dissolves any good memory that may be left from previous episodes!"
"fe_scolfaro","3","2","5","16 November 2010"," Biggest Matrix spoof this side of Revolutions...
","Firstly, i'd like to explain why i rated this movie at 3 stars and not ZERO: 'cause it's really visually impressive, credit where credit's due. Just eye candy, from first to last minute. HOWEVER, that's all there is to it, as with many sci-fi wannabe hit movies, but with a sinister twist to it: absolutely no cohesion (visual progression/sets and general story-telling included).<br/><br/>This movie would have generated 20 or 30 good trailers, as long as 2-3 min snippets were kept separate and no one actually watched the movie.<br/><br/>Lastly, this is the movie that most boldly assumes the Matrix Trilogy has been either forgotten or remained unwatched by a younger generation. While i applaud the liberty taken to re-shoot bullet dodging scenes and ""bullet time"", maybe as an attempt to break the monopoly of the famed -now classic- Trilogy over it, it deeply disgusts me that even the wardrobe is spoofed. Wardrobe, some superpowers, some character development, camera angles and general scene perspective, CGI, the pace of the action, excessive similarity of quite a few scenes (!?), fight-scenes and concepts, self-cloning characters, and even a non-neutral hue throughout most of the movie which gets situationally changed (as in The Trilogy and its greenish hue).<br/><br/>So, this movie isn't really a collection of clichés as some reviewers have said. It's one single giant Matrix-spoof-turned-part-of-a-franchise thing. Really, no one has ever copied it so boldly (or with such a straight face) before. Too bad that being uncreative and sleazily plagiarizing does not a good movie make."

","Sixty million dollars. This is more money than 99.99% of the world's population will ever see in their lives, probably. And the producers don't even take the time to look at the episode in the ""saga"" that came before... Apparently this film is supposed to be a sequel to the last Resident Evil movie, and some things appear to build on that story... But if you look at ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" (much to the horror of the producers, some people may actually REMEMBER that one) especially the beginning of that movie, you will see that the people who made this boring and unoriginal sequel hold nothing but contempt for their audience.<br/><br/>I see it now... How this all came into being...<br/><br/>PRODUCER: We should open with... (takes drag from suspicious cigarette) a scene where Alice is flipping and flopping and taking out guards in swat gear. All in slow motion! And you should see pillars... Yeah; pillars at the end, all shot to pieces. Wow, I hope this place isn't bugged, because all this is so original someone might steal it.<br/><br/>DIRECTOR: I think that scene is from Matrix.<br/><br/>PRODUCER: And the bullets she shoots should make like, uhm... Cool traces in the air. In slow motion.<br/><br/>DIRECTOR: That may also be from Matrix. Look, why don't we take a couple of thousand and hire a script writer? <br/><br/>PRODUCER: What are you talking about? I'm having a stroke of genius right now! There should also be a mall, no a prison, or something, that is all surrounded by zombies... And the zombies are trying to get in.<br/><br/>DIRECTOR: That may be from Dawn of the Dead.<br/><br/>PRODUCER: What are you talking about you curmudgeon? This is all original thought right here! We don't need any script. Just take all this I'm saying and wing it... David Lynch never needs a script... Like, we should have this scene on a roof. And there are lots of zombies. And Milla, she catches a machine gun that is thrown to her. In slow motion.<br/><br/>DIRECTOR: Why!? <br/><br/>PRODUCER: Because can you think of anything cooler than Milla Jovovich catching a machine gun in slow motion? <br/><br/>DIRECTOR: (Sighs deeply) Maybe a huge zombie with a giant axe? <br/><br/>PRODUCER: You know I just thought of something.<br/><br/>DIRECTOR: What? <br/><br/>PRODUCER: You know I'm just free-wheeling right now. Shooting from the hip. Swimming with the flow. I'm just thinking, stop me if I'm out on a limb right now. I see a zombie. It MAY be really huge. Perhaps, just perhaps its within the realm of possibility... If it doesn't hurt the suspension of disbelief... that it has a giant axe. You have to put that in the film. That's it. A huge zombie with a giant axe. I think we've nailed it.<br/><br/>DIRECTOR: Also we could perhaps make it like a in-house joke that Milla has ammo clips that never run out? <br/><br/>PRODUCER: Nah. I don't like cynical references like that. Maybe we can just assume that the bullets in the clips are really, really small so a lot of them fit in there. Only you don't see that. Because the clips themselves are sort of opaque, so you CAN'T see through the metal."

","B"" Movie? Yes! Enjoyable? absolutely! I haven't seen any of the others in this series however now i plan to watch them . The Matrx really started a trend for fast paced slow stop motion features and this one is packed with loads of moving faster then the speed of light type dodging although we seem to see it as we did in the Matrix as being slow motion. Our heroin Alice (Mila Jovavich) is back once again looking for survivors from the Umbrella Corp's deadly unleashed Zombie virus. this time running into a few of her old friends she sent off to safety only to find out they never quite made it so Alice is racing once again against time to save Claire, K-mart and the others who survived the last episode. Loads of Zombie killing fun in yet another virus strand film. In this edition to the Saga we see their is a new strand virus unleashed that has the zombie's this time omitting a flower like thing from their mouths that snatches the victim into place. It's called Las Plagus and is 100 times more lethal then the original t-virus in the last films. Once again ""B"" movie fun!"

"east-emerald","4","2","5","19 September 2010"," Resident Evil lumbers toward a 5th film much like one of it's brain dead zombies
","I am a fan of simple and streamlined story telling; so I enjoyed the first movie in the Resident Evil franchise which came out in 2002. The story was easy to follow and enjoy - killer day at the office when all of the employees of the evil multi-national Umbrella Corporation are killed and turned into zombies by a super virus. Survivors and rescuers must fight their way out. I was totally there. I was not such a fan of the second movie and pretty much ignored the third except for a glimpse here and there on cable.<br/><br/>My desire to check out ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" was driven by being a sometimes but enthusiastic Milla Jovovich fan ever since first seeing her in the dazzling, hyper-kinetic, Jean- Paul Gautier drenched movie ""The Fifth Element"". For her fans I have some good news and bad news. You will see a lot of her in ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"", including, I counted, 11 clones in the opening scenes, but not much of her acting skill. My first big complaint is that she is nothing more than post-apocalyptic eye candy to fill the space between supposedly impressive 3D effects. I was hoping this movie would have the pre-requisite amount of zombie action sprinkled with dark humor and basically repeat the first movie because repetition is not always a bad thing. Nope. Instead there are 97 minutes of what feels like nothing except set up for a fifth movie. Sure there is a story (loosely) where Alice encounters a group of survivors but some of them are so expendable and clichéd they are a waste of time. It all moves too fast and there is never a connection.<br/><br/>I don't know what to say about the 3D, really. There was some stop action moments which if you took the time examine them were visually trippy and interesting but they were overshadowed by the multitude of slow motion fight sequences which were over wrought and boring. So much slow motion in fact that I began to wonder if someone had slipped a Valium into my blueberry slushy(?). Not to mention that this over used effect turned the big bad villain into a tired Agent Smith impersonation. In the end Alice and her cohorts are on a giant ship full of survivors who look like they work for an Apple store in 2020. An army of black clad Umbrella agents are on the way promising an overblown and empty showdown for the next movie. A funny note. Even though I am sure most of the audience, like myself, were heading to the restrooms, we all turned back to the screen like cattle for a super special bonus scene at the end. That's the last slight of the movie because I did not even know who the female villain reveal was until I got home and Googled it. Shame on them. Don't do that people who have to pee."

","I am a huge fan of the RE series. That's the only reason this one got a 5. RE: Afterlife is a big disappointment. While the action is sharp, the storyline is succinct and grossly underdeveloped. The zombies were, well, horrible; and not in the good sense. I read one review here that compared them to the Thriller variety. I totally agree. They looked like a bunch of people wearing K-Mart Halloween make-up. The big axe-wielding thing was a cool idea, but WTH!? What was it? And how the heck does it fit into the story? I hope the movie guys don't leave and otherwise awesome series burning in the ruble of this film. The clear emphasis was on the 3D tech, and not the art of storytelling. I should have waited for it to hit PPV."

If you want straight on straight action, this movie is for you. But if you want a plot and haven't seen the other movies, then you might as well skip out on this one. I loved how this movie incorporated some RE5 monsters like Wesker and the hammer guy.

Precise combat choreography. Ridiculous over-the-top action set pieces. Interesting editing, with creative transitions between scenes. Hot babes. Hordes of zombies. Lots of video game references, especially to Resident Evil 5.<br/><br/>The cons: Flimsy story, with more than a few glaring plot holes. One-dimensional characters. Some bad costume design choices, like the poorly-fitted Chris Redfield jumpsuit (shudder). Some boring set design, like the huge empty white room at the end. Flat meaningless dialog, typical of action films. Predictable ""all the main characters live"" movie ending.<br/><br/>Overall, I didn't expect much from Afterlife, but I was pleasantly surprised!

"revelinchaos","5","3","10","16 September 2010"," Resident Evil: of Zombies and Franchise Milking
","That is what the Resident Evil franchise appears to be down to after the second installment. This last one steers in that direction even more than its predecessor, Extinction. That third movie is where RE jumped the shark; where it showed that it had nothing more to say or show. Afterlife just stresses that even further and makes it clear that what the producers are after is just trying to squeeze the last bucks out of a withering copyright instead of trying to revitalize and relaunch it. <br/><br/>All that which appears in this movie feels old, overused, clichéd and, utterly predictable: the apocalypse theme; the cloning theme; the recycled bad guy; the same old zombie-Dobermans; the ludicrous resourcefulness and perseverance of the most infamous Umbrella corp.; the bad/half-bad turn-coating character; the wealth of irrelevant 'secondary' (more like nth-ary) characters; the matrix-like bullet time effects; etc. <br/><br/>Of course all those features wouldn't be such a grave issue if they actually contributed to the telling of an interesting and original story, but sadly this is not the case with RE4. I mean, I watched the entire movie and had not one single scare... just long sequences of boring and silly dialogs or boring and 'spectacular' action scenes of the kind that became old shortly after it was first introduced by the Matrix, more than a decade ago. What's more, I think that what really kills the mood is the total unlikeliness and absence of purpose that permeates the whole movie. Alice's clones just get slaughtered by the hundred while Alice herself flies around alone over the US and Canada looking for a bunch of survivors from the previous movie... and lo and behold!, not only does she find (some random) survivors, but none other than the brother of one of the characters from the previous movie that she just saved somewhere else... Oh boy, if that's not a lucky coincidence... <br/><br/>Then there's the usual decimation of the survivors proper of every 'survival horror', but rendered in an extremely uninteresting and trivial way, then the final battle with the 'end level boss', that is also very forgettable. The ending also suggests there's a chance a fifth Resident Evil will be shot... and, although I loved the first two, I hope the writers/director either get their act together or let it rest with a clean shot to the head.<br/><br/>Acting ranges from average to mildly crappy: Milla Jovovich seems to be trapped in a role that has become a caricature of the original Alice, the 'co-stars' Miller and Larter don't shine at all, and Wesker's blank facial expression makes him look more like a moving piece of furniture than a dangerous mutant evil bad-ass. <br/><br/>The wealth of cool CG effects and OK cinematography cannot, IMO, make up for all those flaws, and that's why I think this movie deserves a 5/10 (or something less)."
"chris_ksc","7","3","10","10 September 2010"," Afterlife: A fan service sequel.
","**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>'Afterlife' offers a bit more familiarity for fans of the video game series. While I enjoyed the previous three movies, I found myself disappointed with the few crossovers there were from the video games. I'm not implying that movies try to replicate what the games offer, but seeing familiar aspects strikes that sense of nostalgia that makes fans go, ""Nice, I remember fighting those creatures.""<br/><br/>The enemies are essentially the same as the ones from Resident Evil 5, namely the Majini, the Executioner, and of course Albert Wesker. I didn't mind that Anderson neglected to explain the origins of these 'elevated' monsters; the fact that they were included was a delight to see.<br/><br/>I was also excited to see Ali Larter resemble more closely to Claire Redfield, and to see her serve more of a purpose in combat. The one-on- one combat with the Executioner is definitely the one of the strong points. Wentworth Miller is fine as Chris Redfield, though I'm hoping his character will be developed further in the next instalment. (Yes, there will be another one!)<br/><br/>Aside from the visuals, everything else is still rather formulaic. The script is sub-par, and of course there are more characters to kill off, none of whom you would ever develop a connection with. Umbrella still proves to be an undying entity, continually and relentlessly hunting Alice and the humans. <br/><br/>However, my major complaint regards the tacky parasite devices they used as mind-controlling devices. Did they run out of money to produce more believable parasites? They honestly look like McDonald's Happy Meal toys. In the video game context, the Majini are humans infected with a mind- controlling parasite called the 'plaga'. The Majini lack rational thought, but they still retain human-level intelligence. Anderson transported the 'plaga' concept in such a ridiculous way, it's embarrassing.<br/><br/>For the casual viewer, I recommend attending on a cheap night. The 3D is a bonus, but I didn't feel it was necessary. 'Afterlife' is certainly more than just another zombie movie, but it will be the fans of the games who will have a greater appreciation of what the movie offers."

Slow-motion may be generic, but this film revolutionizes it. <br/><br/>Alice finds new survivors in Los Angeles, and Chris Redfield is the main course here. Also, I guess the film relies on location. First, in underground Raccoon, second is overland Raccoon, third is the Nevada Desert, and the fourth has more than one: Tokyo, Alaska, and Los Angeles. <br/><br/>The plot twists are very good and beyond predictions.

"Killa42","9","2","6","31 October 2010"," Likes and dislikes of this one
","Slight Spoilers, too minor to matter What I didn't like: In the beginning, Alice becomes normal, if I want a movie about a normal chick fighting zombies, I'll watch Strippers VS. Zombies a.k.a. Zombies, Zombies, Zombies or Zombieland or most other zombie movies that aren't this. I expect to see a superhuman Alice kickin' zombie butt with her normal buddies helping her out. Alas, she is now a normal human fighting zombies. I also felt like the middle was a little pointless and there are several inconsistencies such as one person retaining their memory right away while another takes throughout the film to retain their memory - and that among other things such as the predictable dialogue and all the ""it's been done moments"" those things made the film a little sloppy.<br/><br/>What I liked: Although she is normal, Alice can still kick butt. Only, she is clearly weaker. It is evident that they are going for a character who has flaws so that the viewer can relate and some girls can aspire to be like, while dudes aspire to shag. The dynamic between the other characters and their relationships were pretty believable, however, some moments were ha ha funny when they were meant to be cool: Claire stopping to pose in the middle of a fight for instance. I liked the addition of Chris too and the way he is introduced. There is also more mystery and bigger and stronger enemies.<br/><br/>Like the others: this is cheesy, has a well based, simple plot with likable characters. If you can get past the fact that the main bad guy in this one is basically Neo from the Matrix, and enjoyed the other films, you'll probably like this one too. I know that I rated it high, but that is because it had everything that I expected. I am looking forward to seeing RE5, which should happen, with how it ended."

","Alice is trying to track a broadcast from some place called ""Arcadia"" which promises shelter and sanctuary from the T-virus and the zombified. She believes there may be other survivors there. Her adventure while on this quest forms the essential body of the movie. Her main adversary is the head of the Umbrella Corporation in Tokyo. This is some guy so hopped up on T-virus that he's gone Matrix on everybody's ass. I swear, he acts like a refugee from the movie.<br/><br/>My Impression: The movie was entertaining with impressive sets and visuals. I was never bored.<br/><br/>Before I sign off I can't resist pointing out a curiosity about the shoes our heroine was wearing when she first makes her appearance (which was grand indeed). They kept alternating between heels and flats (I noticed 'cause I was giving her a good ogling). All I know is that pumps are a hindrance if you have some athletic ass-kicking to do since you need speed, balance, and coordination. It's as if the director couldn't decide whether or not our heroine should be sexy or practical. Practical means you have a brain in your head, so it's sexy. ---Or would you rather have a zombie?

","RESIDENT EVIL:AFTER LIFE – CATCH IT ( B+ ) I love Resident Evil:AFTERLIFE, I was on edge of my seat the whole time and watching Milla Jovovich as Alice reminds me off how much we love her. I still remember the Red Hot costume of hers in Resident Evil 1 and after that it's a history especially with this one, which has become the highest grossing movie among all the Resident Evil movies. So I thing the whole Gang will be coming back . Yahhhh . Mila Jovovich is the best female Action actress after Angelina Jolie though Angie has proved her Action Heroin Status in different Action movies where as Milla is stuck to Resident Evil franchise only, but that's okay we still love her. Ali Larter is the second most important essence to the Resident Evil franchise and I loved her in T.V show Heroes though I still think her role was never shaped up the way it should have. (who cares now as the show is canceled). Bravo for bringing WentWorth Miller, everyone love him and thanks God he is the part of the this franchise. Boris Kodjoe and Spencer Locke seems like permanent part of the franchise too, not bad at all. Shawn Roberts is really cool villein and I think he will be returning too next time, which is Awesome! Overall it was a great fun to watch them fight zombies and evils yet again, can't wait for them to fight again."

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","2","6","23 September 2010"," Dumb fun, with equal emphasis on both words
","Alice takes her army of clones to make Wesker pay. If you don't already know what that means, don't expect this film to tell you. Anyway, after that, she finds herself in the same situation as the last three times: Trapped in the middle of somewhere, wanting to save everyone there with her. No, really, that is it. As far as the plot(which is swiss cheese, what else is new?) goes, I mean(and don't expect it to hold up, make sense, or explain much of anything). This is rather entertaining and is, occasionally, effective in getting us excited and the like, in fact, in those aspects, it's the best of the four. Heck, in nearly all regards it is, really. Action is cool(as are a few of the sets) and surprisingly fitting in amount; there is the occasional awkward pose or sequence, and slow-motion, whilst not always bad, is severely overused. Anderson can come up with nifty ideas, but not all of them are as good as he seems to think they are. Again, par for the course. He is getting better(I keep watching his flicks hoping that that will happen, and trying to figure out why he is allowed to write or direct), using his own horrid(like faking us out by establishing something only to abandon it, having chaos erupt out of calm, false tension, etc.) clichés less(with that said, this has a couple of Hollywood ones) and balancing things a little. The music is more appropriate and less noisy than the others. Costumes are well-done(the Cronenbergs are a talented family), with the Umbrella troops being faceless stormtroopers and the unbelievably hot Jovovich's(who doesn't get naked in this one, breaking the trend) outfit being the least silly since the original(in spite of the cut-off sleeves, similar to the pants-legs of the last one). The ninja-thing is enjoyable, and in general, if you liked the trailer(as I did), and you know that these are stupid, you may very well get into this(as I did). While this is still centered on her, Larter gets actual screen-time here. Michael Scofield joins, adding nothing other than a face-palming ""joke""(care to take one guess where we first see him?) and scowling(worse than in that show). Guillory as Jill only has a cameo. So, Exctintion was one big set-up to this. Does it live up to that? Not story-wise. Our lead loses her powers(she just barely used them!) almost immediately, albeit without her becoming particularly vulnerable. As sad as that is, honestly, at this point, it's probably too late to do otherwise. Maybe this should be the last one. I understand this is the one most based on the games(I've barely played any of them); it doesn't get the mood of them right(why start now? The original was eerie, the second was clearly inspired by RE2 and 3(without getting stuff right), that's the closest they ever got). There is zero character development. We don't care about any of the new ones(not that the old ones put us on any emotional rollercoasters). About half of the one-liners are average(the rest are below). Dialog is poor. Wesker speaks and moves just like Agent Smith, and that's not the only clear Matrix reference. This is shot with the tech of Avatar, and the 3D does indeed look nice, and it's used well and not excessively(...well, a little is), and this is something that it is made for. FX are well-done, if not stunning. The humor is OK; this got unintended laughs, as well. There are jump scares, and they work. This got and kept my adrenaline pumping, without my ever forgetting that it was simplistic. As horror should have, there is a moderate amount of blood, gore, disturbing content and strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone fan of the movie series, forgiving lovers of the video-games, and anyone who wants something to turn their brain off to and just kick back with. 7/10"

","Alice (the eternal Mila Jovovich) is back and in multiple copies. Her prime target is the Umbrella Corporation and the now T-virus enhanced Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts). After a full frontal attack the Umbrella base is left destroyed, but the whole batch of Alice clones get blown sky-high, when Wesker manages to fly away unscathed and detonate the plant. Conveniently for the movie the original Alice survives unscathed as a castaway on-board the plane. During a skirmish with Wesker Alice gets injected with a antidote, that turns her back to being human (but somehow she still manages to survive a terrible plane crash unharmed and keeps her over-the-top fighting abilities largely intact). With Wesker dead and Umbrella disposed of Alice returns to the States to search of her friends, who left for sanctuary in Alaska, only to disappear in mysterious circumstances.<br/><br/>In general a much improved instalment of the series and if anything the whole series remains enjoyable, if uninventive. In this part Anderson actually outdoes himself and instead of thinking up something original he starts borrowing scenes from other movies. Wesker looks and fights like Neo's twin brother, the new zombies bring to mind ""Blade 2"", whilst The Executioner has a disturbing familiarity to Pyramid Head of the Silent Hill franchise.

"dormesher-21565","7","1","2","14 November 2018"," Fun movie...... Resident Evil Afterlife
","Resident Evil Afterlife another fun entry in the franchise based on the video game series.
This is a fun storyline like the rest of the movies with Alice once again being a bad ass.<br/><br/>However there are some things that bother me about this one.
I love the opening with all the Alice clones going after Wesker it's a very good action scene and is shot very well. But I feel like that should of been the whole movie or a good chunk of the move and not have all the clones killed in the first 10 minutes and considering there supposed to be really strong clones they die really easily.<br/><br/>Now the story we do get is very good with Alice once again meeting the rest of the survivors and finding Claire Redfield again was awesome and there all trying to get to Arcadia which is supposedly a safe haven for all survivors.
That's a really well done story and it's handled very well.<br/><br/>There are some great action scenes the opening like I said was awesome. The fight between the Axe man zombie was very cool and looked amazing.
And also the last fight with Wesker was very well done although it does feel like you're watching a matrix movie with all the slow motion.<br/><br/>Chris Redfield is introduced in this movie and he's my favourite character in the game series so seeing him is very cool. However I don't feel like Wentworth Miller suits this role I like him as an actor and he serves a good purpose in this movie I just feel he doesn't suit the role.
That's not to say I don't like Chris Redfield in this movie he's decent just not as cool as he is in the videogames and that's Abit of a let down for me.<br/><br/>Alice is always interesting she does lose her powers in this one which adds more to the story. And I really like this character I know she isn't in the games but she is such a good lead character in these and respect the director for creating this character.<br/><br/>Just a fun movie all round and it serves as a great sequel to the rest of the movies and a great follow on to Extinction in my opinion.
However it's not as good as Apocalypse or Extinction or even the first movie in my opinion but it's still very fun.<br/><br/>Verdict 7.9/10 not as good as the first 3 but a still very enjoyable and a great sequel."

","It works for me.<br/><br/>""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" (2010) is the 4th installment in the series, which started with 2004's ""Resident Evil"". These are the only two films I've seen in the series so I obviously don't consider them ""must see"" movies and, yet, I have to admit to being thoroughly entertained when I do. They're basically superhero vs. zombies flicks with loads of style and pizazz. You can't take 'em too seriously and, yet, the stories & characters are ironically dead-serious.<br/><br/>I call these ""superhero"" flicks because that's what Milla Jovovich is as Alice in a ""last people on earth"" scenario. She's dressed in a skintight black outfit with a weapons harness and looks stunning throughout. In this segment she meets up with Claire (Ali Larter) and they fly to a Los Angeles prison where a small group are holed-up against the legions of zombies. They seek to get to an offshore ship, a thought-to-be safehaven from the hordes.<br/><br/>Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson is an expert at making great-lookin' movies with a cool sense of style. In addition, the score and soundtrack are excellent.<br/><br/>Being based on a video game, which I've never played, there's loads of action, which gets cartoony at times (e.g. the giant with the axe).<br/><br/>The best part is the women. It's hard to choose who's better: Milla or Ali. They're both great, but Ali might have the edge. As magnificent as these two are, they throw in more, like the gorgeous Kacey Barnfield.<br/><br/>Taking it for what it is, ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" is a dang entertaining movie.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+"

When you compare Afterlife to the awesome original Resident Evil, it's just a big, big let down.

","This is my first review, I just had to write something. First off, I really love the resident evil story. The first movie is together with fight club and alien 2 the best movies I've ever seen. RE 2 was great and the third was offering more to the table of Alice and her powers. So I had high expectations. I shall never have high expectations again. It hurts.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't even try to have any kind of plot. There is not even a hint of there ever being 3 movies prior to this, part from some flashbacks of characters you never really cared about. The first 3 movies told a story, this one is just a low-budget random encounter action-scene patchwork. I find it hard to believe that the same guys behind the story or the directors on the previous movies had anything to do with this one, but it seems that this is the case. That being said, I have to say that I love the Alice character, Milla Jovovich does a great job lifting this movie so that it is viewable. Wentworth Miller also shines as among the few ones who actually can act without overacting and making everything feel fake and plastic. Too bad him and Milla didn't get a decent plot to work with, this is only damaging to their career.<br/><br/>There are so many illogical plot-lines that its funny, things burning 5 years later, ammo, fuel, food, clothes, makeup never runs out or wears out. 9 foot tall monsters sneaking unseen and unheard into a bathroom and backstabs people, superfast-moving-matrix-bullet-dodging boss suddenly tries to slowly eat his pray when the pray is aiming a badass gun to his face, weird looking wire-jumping (at the beginning when she cuts of 2 soldiers heads, soldiers who naturally don't fire when they should and if they do fire they try their best to only hit the wall in regular stupid action-movie style) and uneven quality of the special effects, where they apparently ran out of money for one of the last scenes, making it suddenly look sega megadrive. <br/><br/>The good things about this movie is: The music, just as enticing as the first movie, Milla Jovovich, without her stunts this would amount to nothing. <br/><br/>Next movie, and there will be another one because the movie forgot to give it an end (fair enough, it also forgot the beginning and the middle) please ask yourselves what the scenes has to do with each other and whether they tie to a story of some kind and if this story has anything to do with the previous movies or at least with the development of Alice, or at the very least telling some new information of the Umbrella corporation that makes sense. <br/><br/>Still, I give this movie 5/10 because: 1) Its still resident evil 2) Alice is still cool 3) Soundtrack and some visuals still kicks ass."
"Hawk6169","Null","1","2","28 December 2010"," not impressed anymore....
","i liked resident evil at the beginning, but now with this one, they got way out of the material in the other movies. in the other movies, to kill a zombie you had to shoot them in the head. now in this movie there killing zombies by shooting them in the body. they have also added content from the following movies it looks like.: the matrix and silent hill.... from the matrix they took the moves, where there's one guy in the movie that moves so fast that he can dodge bullets....just like in the matrix. and from silent hill, they took this big monster (in silent hill he had a huge sword) and they replaced his sword with a huge hammer/axe combo weapon. so basically what I'm saying is if they would have stayed with the type of content they put into the other resident evils, it would have been better. they changed it too much by trying to mix content from 2 other movies. and they ended this movie with the possibility of another one. oh great, that's all we need. final score of this movie is a 4 to 5 out of 10. also this is how i scored the other resident evil movies: Resident Evil (2002) 9/10 .....

","Okay, you all probably know the scenario now as Alice battles the undead and the Umbrella Corporation on a wasted post apocalypse earth. It starts out with a massive amount of CGI as Alice and clones storm the Tokyo HQ of U.C. The gals cut down swarms of Japanese guards with throwing stars, samurai swords, machine guns, bombs etc, all in state of the art CGI and 3 D with lot's of Matrix ripoff thrown in.<br/><br/>Then the head honcho of U.C., Albert Wexler, all T-virused out with red eyes, shoots Alice up with the cure with a hypo in her neck, so Alice becomes human again in his VTOL escape plane. She thanks him for that, just before the plane crashes into the side of a mountain, you'd think they would have a better autopilot than that. That crash was frozen in space as everything inside the fuselage continued forward ala Newton's Law, but since Alice is now human, one would think she would have been crushed and burned, along with super Wexler.<br/><br/>But in the next scene she is piloting a single engine plane over Alaska, no mean feat crossing the Pacific non stop, looking for Arcadia, the promised land from the last movie. No dice, instead of the promised land, she finds a runway full of empty planes and some doped up crazed Claire Redfield, almost a zombie due to some creepy mechanical spider full of some drug attached to her chest. So after Claire is subdued, they are back in that little plane, which seems to have unlimited range. and flying south to good old LA, which anyone would guess is the nexus of disaster as in every end of the world movie ever made. They land on top of an urban high rise prison full of various survivors in a daring rooftop, gravity & reality defying landing where they meet some fellow survivors.<br/><br/>Okay, Arcadia is not a town, it is a ship, some huge cargo one, which happens to be in L.A. harbor but there is a horde of zombies separating the ""prisoners"" from ""safety"" I won't go on too much more except to say there is the usual stunts and laws of Physics defying tricks by Alice & Claire. Even though supposedly Alice lost all her super abilities, you'd never guess by her endless super stunts. Or her matched sawed off double barrel shotguns that she loads coins, bigger than the bore, to make them super guns.<br/><br/>You get pretty much a bunch of cool special effects, the usual twists and characters you'd expect as well as an ending left open for the sequel.

","I won't summarize the story because that has been done many times already. If you haven't seen the others before watching this one, then be prepared to be confused. It would be like walking into another movie halfway through as this one continues a story established in the previous movies.<br/><br/>I love movies in general and I enjoy a wide variety of movies. I love mostly mindless gory action movies and love them even more if there are strange and terrifying monsters involved. Every once in a while I just want a little mindless entertainment and these types of movies provide it for me. If you want a thought provoking movie, then this movie is not for you.<br/><br/>Don't go to see this if you want a lot of character development, a deep moving plot or a bulletproof story. Prepare to suspend reality at the door, expect a lot of guts and gore, expect loud explosions, expect unbelievable fight sequences and expect creepy things to jump out of nowhere for no other reason than to try to give you a heart attack. If you don't like those things then don't watch it and don't complain if you do see it against my advice. There are some people that like these types of movies and they will continue to pay to see them which ensures that more will be made.<br/><br/>Here is what the movie did well. There was a lot of fighting, a lot of guns and explosions and a bunch of people and zombies dying. There were a couple of hot chicks if that's your thing and a couple of not unattractive guys if that's your thing. For once, there was a reasonable explanation for the excessive amount of guns and ammunition available to the main characters. The 3d made the creepy things jumping out towards you even more creepy. The movie planned on using 3d from the beginning which meant that the 3d was better executed than some of the 3d afterthoughts that have come out recently.<br/><br/>Here is what the movie did poorly and why I gave it a 5/10. It relied a little too heavily on the 3d. The entire time I was watching it, I thought to myself that if I was watching it in 2d it would be a rather unimpressive member of the movie franchise. It threw in elements from the games without ever explaining them. I am not a big gamer at all and so these were lost on me and I had to look them up after the movie. There was a lot of slow motion during the fight scenes, again to take advantage of the 3d I think. It made the fights seem even more unbelievable than they normally are because everything is exaggerated. It's readily apparent when the characters meet each other as to who is zombie fodder and who will be left standing at the end. I know I said mindless entertainment but a little suspense couldn't hurt.<br/><br/>Overall, I've seen much worse, but I've also seen better. If you like the Resident Evil movies in general for the good points I've listed above then you will enjoy this one. If you don't like the other Resident Evil movies then don't expect this to be any different. If you haven't seen the others yet, rent them first because you won't really understand what's going on. As always, it's a movie. What's more, it is a zombie movie which by definition requires some suspension of reality."

","I am a die hard fan of the Resident Evil video games. I still remember the first ever part of the game when i heard about it from my friends that a game has arrived which has totally changed the whole concept of gaming. Wow!! the opening sequence of it, the game play, mysteries and the real itching horror. I still do remember all that stuff upon the first ever release of Resident Evil video game. So far, till date all of these video games has surpassed the expectations of their fans. Yet am not sure whats wrong with the movies. Why they doesn't have a real story line of the Resident Evil which is it's identity? I was so excited once i heard about the first movie back in 2002. And i watched that movie with very high expectations but to my misery the first installment turned out to be a crap. Not even touching 5% of the real game. Many people would find all these movies very entertaining but those will be the people who never played the video game and who don't know what this whole thing is all about! but I am sure that for all those RE video game lovers these movies are disasters and pain in the a**. Who the hell is Alice on the mother earth of RE?? why the main characters are'nt in the lead roles? Jill, Claire or Chriss..huh?? Though I watched all the previous 3 movies with the same expectations every time but i left disappointed thinking why did i waste my time and ruined my imaginations towards the Resident Evil subject (Yeah! RE indeed is a whole subject). This time ! I wont watch it. Never."

","So...Where do I begin? The film received a lot of hype on this site due to it's 3-D nature. I read so many comments claiming that this was the best live-action film to utilise 3-D since James Cameron's Avatar. I personally thought the 3-D was poorly executed even though the director utilised the proper technology in order to shoot the film completely in 3-D. During the film I kept on lifting my 3-D glasses in order to see the difference, and apart from a very clear, crisp picture, I can't say that the 3-D added a significant amount of depth to any of the scenes. So, if you are thinking of going to the cinema to watch this one in 3-D, my advice would be to avoid it at all costs...<br/><br/>The plot? Well, it's pretty much in the same category with the other resident evil films, so if you are a big fan of the original on the psone then you are going to be disappointed yet again with this new instalment of the resident evil franchise. The acting is sub-par at best, too many slow-mo scenes which are badly executed and a general cheesiness to the whole of the film still exists.<br/><br/>If you are new to the Resident evil live action films, my advice would be for you to avoid it, as it will most likely feel like a waste of time."

","This movie is the worst Resident evil, it is so Cheesy, I just can't understand why people give such a good reviews, because I went to the movie yesterday and I laughed out of disappointment mostly. The script is just awful. Mistakes everywhere. Zombies and ...people pop out of nowhere and everywhere. Shooting but leaving no dead corpses around. In the beginning Milla actually becomes normal human again but still survives jet explosion somehow. People i beg you not to go to see this movie and support such a bad organization of really good game series. Do yourself a favor and try the game. The game makes a lot more sense and the plot is much better. I give this movie 1/10 because it actually worths just 1.

","Wow, directing a slick fx movie and putting your name to it is one thing, no shame in that but telling people you came up with this children's school play of dialog wouldn't seem to be a wise move. Embarrassingly bad dialog and shonky characters even for the cartoon nature of the show drag this juggernaut down down down. It didn't help that it was continuing the franchise of an instantly forgettable series and required you to remember who was what and why they were there from previous movies. I've seen them all and couldn't for the life of me remember a single thing about the last movie, it was that disposable.

"DICK STEEL","5","2","9","14 September 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Resident Evil: Afterlife
","Think Resident Evil the movies, and the first image that'll come to mind will be Milla Juvovich as Project Alice kicking zombie butt. It's been some 8 years since Juvovich became synonymous with the Resident Evil movie franchise, and personally, I still enjoyed the first one best, followed by Extinction, then Apocalypse for its really awful story. If I have to rate this one, I'll put it below the first and third films in that order, where once again it has its special effects, which is really an amalgamation of things seen before, to save the movie from its weak plot.<br/><br/>Paul W.S. Anderson goes back to the director's chair after giving up directing responsibilities for the sequels, assuming only producing and writing credits, and although it's widely touted as having used James Cameron's 3D technology, Afterlife hasn't actually benefited from that because of the way scenes were crafted that didn't exploit that technology fully like what Cameron did for Avatar. Either that, or we're already too tired with the gimmick, and this one doesn't offer anything new to provide any instance of Wow. We don't require any more depth in field please, at least some depth in plot rather than something that looked to have jumped straight out of Prison Break.<br/><br/>That's right, Prison Break, with the largest tongue-in-cheek joke being the casting of Wentworth Miller as Chris Redfield, brother of Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) who was introduced in the previous film. The first shot of Chris was within a prison cell within a prison, and the irony of it all is when he alone holds the key to everyone else's salvation from blood thirsty flesh lusting zombies trying to get past the high walls and heavy gates, which they eventually do to provide our ensemble human survivors, led by Alice, a fight sequence or two.<br/><br/>You may grumble that plot is secondary here so long as we get to see the hotness that is Milla Juvovich grace the big screen and doing what she does best in the franchise. True, Juvovich's Milla undergoes a glam facelift from the grungy look in the previous installment, but even her strikingly beautiful features can't save the film from slipping into the territory of bore. The prologue started off wonderfully though, with its moody atmospherics to canonize how the Umbrella Corporation's T-Virus got unleashed, and picked up from where the last film left off with the salivating promise of a whole bunch of Alice clones all waiting to be awoken to kick Umbrella's behind. Once the fight sequence is over, which included a nice way to get rid of Alice's invulnerability and god-like abilities, there's only so much one can stand on Alice flying around and lull you into a deep sleep with a lot of voice-over mumbo-jumbo.<br/><br/>Reuniting with Claire Redfield and trying to figure out the promise of a zombie-free land in Arcadia mentioned in Extinction, Afterlife fell prey to a bunch of movie clichés, that even you can guess who will bite the dust first amongst a group of survivors, who will survive, who will turncoat in loyalty, and so on. There's no real threat here offered by the villains, led by Umbrella head honcho Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) that he looked quite the typical egomaniac who can't just pull the trigger fast enough to get rid of his enemies. Other than that, the finale fight involves two CG rabid dogs that seriously, nobody will think will pose a threat to Alice, even in her vulnerable state. Plot loopholes are plentiful, but don't expect the CG effects to compensate for that. As already mentioned, the 3D here is nothing to shout about.<br/><br/>I was a tad disappointed as well with the fight scenes, which seem more like a rehash of what's on offer from the earlier films, with only Claire/Alice's battle with the Axeman (Ray Olubowale) the only fight sequence something worth mentioning. Otherwise for those who are still keen to sit through the end credits, you'll get a coda involving Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) that will only make sense to fans out there, who will celebrate in knowing that the 3D ticket sales had boosted numbers enough for another Resident Evil film to be added to the franchise."
"jtindahouse","5","1","3","25 January 2017"," The worst one yet
","Having really enjoyed (at least as far as this series goes) the third entry in the 'Resident Evil' set of films, I was quite disappointed to see them take a step backwards in this one. 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' is my least favourite entry in the series to date. Interesting, my two least favourites, the original and this one, were both directed by series writer/producer Paul W.S. Anderson. The second and third entries, which he lent out to other directors, were far superior in my opinion. This is a disappointing fact, because I have two films to go in the series and he has directed both of them.<br/><br/>The reasons I didn't enjoy this one as much were as follows. Firstly, this one is much slower than the other films in the series. At almost the halfway point in the run time the story is still being set up and characters are simply standing around introducing them self and discussing what to do. There are little hints of action here and there in the first half, but they are hardly anything worth mentioning. Secondly, it felt like this focused a lot more on style than actual substance. The opening scene is a prime example. Very very little actually happens in it, yet the whole thing is filmed in slow motion and with stylish camera angles to make us think this is a great scene. <br/><br/>Also, it would have to be said that this series is starting to feel a little stale after four entries. You find yourself asking what exactly am I getting in this edition that I haven't already seen or experienced. I would love to see Anderson think a little outside the box for the next two entries. Try something different to mix it up a bit. Otherwise I feel this series really can't justify six entries."

The director delivers his usual excellent pace and action set pieces, and the lead actress is always perfect in her icy, fists-on-hips compassion. But the story is a bit diffuse, with too many locations and characters, plus enough gaps in the logic to take you out of the story. Did it need the second strong female? The giant axe-wielding zombie? Nope.

"phubbs","6","1","3","16 February 2015"," Resident Evil: Afterlife
","With probably the most over the top, outlandish, in your face action sequence you've seen for sometime comes the fourth entry of the endless Resi Evil franchise. Now I REALLY am gonna try and not mention a certain Keanu Reeves sci-fi action film involving bullet time too much if possible but its gonna be hard.<br/><br/>This outrageously insane kamikaze opening sequence where all the clone Alice's storm the Umbrella Tokyo Headquarters is actually a guilty pleasure I must admit. Its so ridiculously stupid using every cliché in the action film textbook and rips every possible slick visual imagery you can think of from various other action/sc-fi films...yet its great fun. Jovovich/Alice is sleek, sexy and deadly as the clones tear the faceless Umbrella stormtroopers apart with machine guns and katanas. Bloody squibs bursting from the seams, bullet holes, hits to the head by Wesker on his own men at point blank range, beheadings...oh my!!<br/><br/>Only one question begs to be answered, where did all those Alice clones get all those identical figure hugging catsuits??<br/><br/>So the drudgery continues as Alice goes from one area to the next battling the undead and watching more and more of hers allies go down one by one. This time she lands her plane on a huge prison in LA, not too sure why she would quite clearly get herself stuck on this prison, let alone almost killing herself and Claire whilst trying to land on the roof. But she does because there are survivors there...but surely anyone would just fly by and find a more secure place? this prison is surrounded by millions of zombies! pfft your funeral.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is actually pretty cool in this, on the same page as the first film although not many famous names. Alongside Alice in this prison we have the token black guy who runs around in a vest so we can see his big muscles, at least he's well spoken. Standard fare sexy brunette who is British (at least she isn't a blonde), the excellent Kim Coates as a slimy film producer (nice touch Mr Anderson), a funny little oriental fellow, standard fare tough guy backup number two called Angel and Wentworth Miller who again is behind bars.<br/><br/>To be totally frank this fourth film is completely run of the mill, bog standard stuff in terms of plot. Its simply another setup for Alice to pile drive into with a new team of zombie fodder at her side. The thing is like the first film its still quite an enjoyable ride, its totally predictable, totally clichéd and pretty much rehashes the same stuff all over again but in a different location. But thanks to a quirky cast the film is pretty cool I think.  <br/><br/>There are still plot questions that hit me, especially as this is now the fourth film. Anyone notice that the Umbrella Company has so many underground bases? also they are VAST underground bases! How and when did they build them?? (under Tokyo??!!), how are Umbrella so rich n powerful? Where on earth do all the Umbrella henchmen come from? how come THEY are always safe? where do they get all their guns and ammo? how come they are so useless and why would they wanna do their evil job? why does Umbrella carry on playing with the dead when the human race is almost extinct?! and finally not being a game player...who was that huge axe wielding guy? where the heck did he come from?<br/><br/>I must also ask why the cities in this franchise are in ruins? the undead are eating everyone not blowing up buildings, so why are they all stripped down to their structures and burnt out? The other main question was why some zombies can now run and have tentacles coming out of their mouths just like the vamps in 'Blade II'. When did this evolution occur?<br/><br/>I can't delve deeper for obvious reasons, the film is what it is and we all know this, its Resi Evil, don't question that. The film does deliver in my opinion, it gives you what you expect with some decent visuals and good close quarter action. The finale against Wesker is just as insanely Matrix-like as the opening sequence and just as mind bogglingly daft, maybe more so. The rock soundtrack in the background means its officially cool, its official.<br/><br/>You do feel the tension in these films when the heat is on and its time to escape from somewhere. The fact Alice isn't a superhero this time boosts the film giving a sense of uncertainty for once, even though you know she still won't die, still helps.<br/><br/>6/10"

","This is a movie about zombies so don't't expect to watch heart breaking performance or life changing sorties. That being said this movie is based on the video games saga of the same name and many fans including myself expect to see that and being this the fourth installment we already know that's not what is going to happen. In the games AL was about terror, fear of what may be around the corner and be ruining out of bullets, in the movies (exept the first may be) this is completely lacking, they shoot like they own a bullets factory and is completely more action oriented than fear driving. Elements of the game are thrown in without even bothering to explain why or how. What makes this movie a disaster is also what makes it great, I mean is pure action from beginning to end and despite the fact that the character of Alice never existed in the games she is just adorable played by Milla Jovovich. I think there are a lot of potential in this saga if would change of director's hands but still makes it for a nice way to spent an hour and a half eating popcorn."

","After surprisingly enjoying the last instalment; ""Extinction"" which was directed by Russell Mulcahy. Filmmaker Paul W. Anderson would find his way back to the director's chair, not since helming the original film. He did however write the screenplay for all four. Now ""Afterlife"" continues on from ""Extinction"", but was somewhat a comedown and fairly underwhelming for me to put it down as being my least favourite of the lot so far. Done in 3D for its theatrical release, couldn't hide the fact it drew upon tired mechanisms. The special effects felt like it was taken out of the matrix, so therefore the action felt uninspired and sterile. Too bad because while it seems lazy the opening remains captivating in its execution of its searing action set-pieces and plot ties (the Alice clones being used to wipe out the Tokyo based Umbrella corporation facility). But after that promising start it loses its way by becoming bogged down, muddled and uninteresting in the direction it goes. This is when Alice discovers an old friend, where during a plane ride they end with a ragtag of survivors held up in a Los Angles prison and there she learns the truth about the safe haven of Arcadia. Anderson tries up the ante with showy techniques, by bombarding us with kinetic editing, slow motion activity, pounding heavy music and flashy computer effects in a repetitive parade of bloody carnage and smoking firepower. This focus seems like an attempt to cover up its thin narrative, stale script and minor characters, because it's all hot air in the way it goes about building-up plot progression. Really all it does it takes bit and pieces from the other entries and weakly puts it together in something of a long-running comic serial. The desert makes way for urban infrastructure. The prison setting makes it rather compact and drab, so are the characters that are included. Really it's about Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. Jovovich might not be a dominant as Alice like previous entries, but she still strongly carries it along. Larter was better than expected. The scene with them together battling the Axeman in the prison shower block is probably the only highlight in the latter half. Shawn Roberts milks it with aplomb as an Umbrella Corporation associate. Also in the cast are Kim Coates, Wentworth Millar, Boris Kodjoe and Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine makes a very brief appearance through the end credits. A forgettable fare, which is all dressed up but goes nowhere with it.<br/><br/>""This is a big mistake""."

AND why oh why is the executioner there.. honestly could not get over that pointless stupid retarded cameo that stole 15 minutes of my life!<br/><br/>I only became a RE fan after seeing the first film, so I only feel a fraction of the disappointment that actual ""since-day-one"" fans must be feeling.. but my god I can't stand how far this film strayed from the games, the original idea of a non canon character changing everything and having the abilities of Tyrants is SO good, it produced such opportunities to create an original storyline to one of the greatest and longest running game franchises of all time.. but every minute just provides more disappointment.<br/><br/>Before moving onto actual cinema comments.. why was Wesker in this and why oh why did he have the las plagas virus.. but anyway, fanboy stuff aside! every scene felt like it could be removed and maybe even the film would make more sense? even for an end of the world sci-fi zombie movie, the realism was just urinated on, throw out of the window, resuscitated and then urinated on again for good measure If you liked the first three films, relish in the ending of the third where the potential seems LIMITLESS, hundreds of alice clones is a decent idea, come up with your own ending to the series and i guarantee you it will be better than this"
"the_wolf_imdb","Null","1","3","14 August 2011"," Maybe best served in 3D, but I saw it in 2D
","I'm really surprised that so many people evaluate this movie as Great. They probably do refer the 3D version of it - slow motion sequences and lots of nonsense and illogical action indicate it was designed solely to impress in 3D. So basically this is meant to be a 3D Tech Demo.<br/><br/>I saw the movie in 2D and was not impressed at all. The Resident Evil series is not great, but first and third parts of the series are ""good enough"" and ""clever enough"" to be enjoyed on a lazy afternoon. This part begins nowhere (actually the begin is the ending of the previous part) and ends nowhere as well. The rest is slightly illogical way from start to end with some mostly irrelevant zombies and mess assembled from parts of better movies like Die Hard, Blade 2, Matrix, Pandorum and other favorite movies of the script writer. I think I saw even some parts of advertisements and music videos here and there. Is it enough to mix different scenes to create a ""great"" movie today? The Saw movie series was interconnected as well, but every part of it was reasonable stand alone story.<br/><br/>There is no need to describe silliness of the movie in detail - it has been done here multiple times. The problem I see is that the series is gradually changing from zombie apocalypse movie to something like Bourne series. The world may be in ashes with almost no survivors and no solution in sight, but Umbrella with its unlimited resources, choppers filled with fresh soldiers, always perfectly clean labs and really well dressed villains does not care. It is interested only in capturing Milla for some reason. It is not horror or apocalypse movie anymore.<br/><br/>Except for completely artificial action scenes the movie is illogical, uninteresting and boring. It is probably weakest part of series - worse that the second one and completely irrelevant. You may just skip this movie to the next one and you will not even notice it."

"Shosanna_Dreyfus83","4","1","3","7 January 2011"," Better action than Extinction and starts off well but that's about it
","I very much loved the first two Resident Evil movies. They had a good feel and they had very kick ass fight scenes (especially from Milla Jovovich) and editing. In the first film, Milla even wore a red dress like me (too bad she didn't burn down a cinema though - oh well!). Milla seemed born to play these kinds of kick ass action roles and was very much like the lone gunslinger archetype and I could easily imagine her in some kind of Sergio Leone western.<br/><br/>The third movie, Extinction was disappointing for me though. I'm not sure if it coincided with Milla's pregnancy but she was nowhere near as acrobatic or full of fight and the end battle with the mutated villain was pretty much over too quickly. That film did not have the same kind of oomph factor or feel to it, but it did grow on me a little with more viewings.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Afterlife starts out well enough and has much better action scenes in keeping with the first two movies (although there is very much over-reliance on slow motion scenes). I thought I was going to really enjoy it, but by the end of the movie, the whole thing felt pretty empty, pointless and lacking any real lasting substance. People may say ""What do you expect from this kind of movie?"" but because I loved the first two movies as superior popcorn flicks that very much won over many more hyped and budgeted movies for me, I would have liked a movie that delivered more. At least Ali Larter is a bit more involved in the action this time, but she has no connection to the Claire Redfield I remember from the Resident Evil: Codename Veronica game and doesn't really contribute anything as a character. I have liked Ali Larter in roles before and it is a shame that this franchise wastes her just as much as Heroes did after season one. The character of Albert Wesker is iconic from the video games and there must have been much anticipation for using this villain in the movies. But instead of delivering something special, the movie just has Wesker in a little bit at the beginning and then a little bit more at the end. Such a waste of plot potential. Worse, he is pretty much just lazily portrayed as a clone of Agent Smith from the Matrix movies (too bad he did not go so far as to refer to Milla as ""Mrs Anderson"" though tee hee!). The end villain battle may have been a little better than the one in Extinction but it still lacked any real excitement for me. One of the highlights of the film though was when Milla and Ali take on the execution style monster from the Resident Evil 5 game in the middle of the movie. Although slow motion dulls the action a little, it still manages to convey some power and dread.<br/><br/>Overall, if you hate these movies then I don't think this one will change your mind at all (and will probably just further confirm any criticisms you have - particularly about originality or resemblance to the actual games). If you've been pretty happy with all the movies so far, then you will probably also be content enough with this one. As someone who loved the first two movies and felt a little disappointed with the third, this one also lacked something for me. It started out with some potential and anticipation for the movie to come, became average zombie fare for much of the movie and ended up feeling empty and uninspired. Certainly for me it was nothing special and nothing that I think anyone particularly needs to go out of their way to see (although if you enjoyed it very much then I am happy for you). I am left wishing these movies would try to have better plots and try to be a bit more original but it is probably way too late for that now. At least it was good to see Milla being a bit more kick ass than in the previous entry though and I just wish she would get better material to utilize her action career while it is still there."

","HERE BE SPOILERS Wow.<br/><br/>I had totally made friends with the RE movie franchise: Not too good, taking quite a bit of liberties in regard to the source material, director really likes to shoot his wife in with high-speed cameras and play back in ho-hum bullet time... but all in all, harmless fun. There are films that actually hold some value in the fact that they are bad - they can be mindless fun, unintentionally humorous etc - and then there's just films that are bad. RE: Afterlife is one of the latter type.<br/><br/>Let's start with one of the film's main and (supposedly) high points - cinematography + visual effects. Sure, it's there and sure, it's been done with quite the craftsmanship. But I think we've come to a point in the surgical precision digital imagery for film that when done like in Afterlife, it tends to look just that - digital cutouts. And director Anderson's obvious worship for the slo-mo shots of Jovovich, CGI bullets etc manifests as this steaming turd with no substance past these things.<br/><br/>I won't touch the plot too deeply here, since it's sort of inseparable from the last film, but in this one it's clearly nothing but a shallow vessel for the director to ""show off"" (ho hum) the things mentioned in the last paragraph. In any case, my favourite part was right in the beginning. The last film's great cliffhanger undone in a matter of minutes. No exploration on dilemmas and complexities of having identical clones, better just to have them willingly kamikaze so we can get on with the other seemingly random plot elements that can be used to display more slo-mo VFX shots. Like a random guest star from Silent Hill with an impractically large axe. Did anyone notice Alice's magic powers were taken away? I didn't, not really.<br/><br/>BTW, while I usually totally miss most goofs, for a film so deeply based on visual exposition, it's rather interesting to see Alice follow a rather screamingly red trail of blood into the next random sci-fi chamber with pointless elements like green sleeping zombie guys, only to see that someone already wiped the floor clean in the next shot.<br/><br/>Both the script and direction obviously point to the fact that while Anderson's using similar elements to build his film as he did on the former RE films, he's become blind to how much shallow MTV exposition you can get away with without any actual content beneath. Also, while the RE films were never something that could be called horror flicks, the ""BOO!"" moments are especially lame this time round.<br/><br/>The acting's really not worth mentioning. The performances display cookie-cutter characters, but then again, I'm sure the script didn't give them too much to work with. I mean, how much more soul could Wentworth Miller pour into ""Where is everybody? I don't understand."" BTW, this film should get the award for most standard action/horror flick dialogue of 2010.<br/><br/>And what about that score? Can you get more mediocre with modern suspense/action soundtracks than this? You could probably get more emotionally stirring results by using stock music.<br/><br/>Man. Maybe I should watch RE1 again. Or Event Horizon, even."

The 1st film was good & suspenseful like a RE movie should be. The 2nd was tolerable and somewhat within the plot of RE. The 3rd was the beginning of an end.<br/><br/>I truly like some Anderson's work as a director ( Mortal Kombat, RE, Event Horizon ) but this was a terrible concoction.<br/><br/>Milla is a solid actress and on-screen performer, but did we really need to hear her sulk & pout about some plot that's completely irrelevant to the franchise? I mean it's bogus how conflicting the plots are to begin with.<br/><br/>As for the 3D graphics ( this is the 1st & only film I've seen in 3D in theatres ) I was utterly disappointed. Most notably when Alice throws some ninja star type weapons at the camera. I mean, Underworld: Evolution had an almost duplicate scene like that without any 3D and it blows the outcome away. The only 3D viewing I enjoyed from this movie was the Executioner Majini's wet-room fight.<br/><br/>You could say the film is unpredictable and will leave you on the edge of your seat, but it also makes you question it in every instance.<br/><br/>This film series would have been a tonne more appreciated & acclaimed if it had followed the video games more closely and not drifted off. I tolerated the 1st few with a completely made up main character / protagonist because I was elated to see the series come to films. But this film draws the line, sadly I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.<br/><br/>Let me put it this way; when Tomb Raider video games came to the big screen they only needed a babe ( Jolie ) to fill any void and do some action, because there's not much history or plot to the games, sheer action. But Resident Evil follows a strict timeline and maintains a pretty consistent synopsis throughout the main games ( RE,RE2,RE3NEMESIS,RECODEVERONICA,RE4,RE5. ) I don't understand how in the 3rd instalment of Anderson's films has the whole world gone deserted, left to an underground secret agency.<br/><br/>The biggest grudge about this movie itself ( and the series ) is Wesker is only introduced in Extinction... He's a vital part of the 1st video game and an evolving storyline. This film series may as well have been called something else, like Biolulzard. It goes from a serious film ( RE ) to a comical flick ( Apocalypse ) to a paranormal caravan ( Extinction ) and lastly a psycho drama ( After-Life. ) If there's another in the works, sure I'll watch it because Anderson is capable of quality, but this is a glaring example of misrepresentation. Capcom should not have let you go on with a 3rd and 4th movie. I sincerely hope Capcom allows a new team to interpret a new series of films/remakes."

","Resident Evil: Afterlife is one of the movies of 2010 that I have been quite intrigued in because, as well as wondering how the tedious series has yet again gotten another sequel, I actually started to wonder whether this could actually be the Resident Evil movie I've been waiting for. After watching a great trailer and some promising clips of the movie and then seeing the movie, I suggest you just stick with the clips and trailers because that way, you won't be disappointed. So taking off where Resident Evil: Extinction ended, Alice continues to fight against the Umbrella Corporation with the help of 'a few friends'. Following new information, she heads to Los Angeles to find a small group of survivors of the T-Virus outbreak. The survivors attempt to seek out more survivors, escape the zombie-infested city and bring down Umbrella once and for all. The first thing that sticks out like a sore thumb in Resident Evil: Afterlife is the story and how confusing it is at times. Luckily, I have seen Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Apocalypse and Resident Evil: Extinction but if you haven't seen those then you may not find it easy to follow the story. The flashbacks don't do the story any favours because, even though they're supposed to explain things, they just confuse matters and aren't really needed. Resident Evil: Afterlife is all action and even then, the action scenes aren't worth going to the cinema to watch as the best action scenes last about fifteen minutes (ten minutes if you take the slow-motion Matrix effect out, which I will talk about later in the review). <br/><br/>Granted that the Resident Evil movie series was more about action and less about story but at least the stories in the last three movies weren't confusing and looked like a bit of attention went into them. Resident Evil: Afterlife doesn't have that same attention and instead becomes a mess of all action and no story. The next thing the movie didn't have was hardly any character development or even characters, they were all written so badly. There are only two characters in the movie who have their own personality, Alice is obviously one of them as we see her fight zombies and monsters with a disadvantage and Wesker, fighting to make the T-Virus work for superhuman abilities shown in the previous movies. The other characters blend in with each other and you couldn't care about them at all, none of them stood out on their own and they were about as much use as a chocolate fireguard when it came to surviving against zombies but they did have their moments. Another thing about Resident Evil: Afterlife that isn't so great is the acting. Milla Jovovich and Shawn Roberts are great as Alice and Wesker but the same can not be said for the rest of the cast. Ali Larter plays Claire Redfield and she's very wooden throughout most of the movie and doesn't convince you of her character at all. Wentworth Miller plays Chris Redfield and has the same problem that Ali Larter has but his character isn't really given much to do, which is also another annoying thing about the movie. We're introduced to these characters and they're not given a proper story as to who they are and how they get there. They tell us about themselves in a sentence or two and we're supposed to understand the character straight away. The script feels so lazy and horrible and tries to answer questions only to have the opposite effect and raise more. The movie felt like it was three movies mixed into one: Alice bringing down Umbrella, Alice finding the survivors and trying to find Arcadia and the survivors battling Wesker and therefore didn't feel like I was watching an entire movie. <br/><br/>Read the rest of this review at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com and search for 'Resident Evil: Afterlife'<br/><br/>Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com"

","If After.... this fourth installment of the series, they make another one, I am surely to not watch this. As much as I enjoyed watching the first movie, and even the other two of the series, this one surely makes the worse of the four.<br/><br/>Shot specifically to sell out as a 3D movie (and especially in Greece where I live they have this bad habit of translating the movie titles in whatever they think suits them, so the title was changed to Resident Evil: three dimensional escape!!!!!!! ), it doesn't even succeed in that. Silly action scenes, to facilitate the use of 3D, many clichés and non-existent dialog is what makes this film a total rubbish.<br/><br/>There is so much exaggerating in this movie, that you just can't have any more. And there are times that it looks so bad, that it makes you wanna stop watching it.<br/><br/>Too bad, because they cold make so much more from this franchise, if they really out some effort in it. I wont go into details, it isn't worth it. But have in mind, that there are better movies out there to watch, than this piece of nothingness!!!!"

","With a good concept, decent actors and a strong budget, I had expected more. The action is great, even if the slow-mo is a bit excessive at times. The problem is what happens between the action, or rather, the lack of anything happening between the action.<br/><br/>This movie is just a series of action cutscenes edited together into some sort of a movie, but there is no storytelling going on at all. It feels like the director couldn't be bothered doing anything but the action scenes. There is nothing smart, no suspense and no thrill. Just action that looks like its copied straight from ""The Matrix"", but without the finesse, and that leaves you feeling indifferent and unimpressed.<br/><br/>This movie suffers from the usual sequel virus, symptoms are less smarts, less story, less atmosphere and more CGI to compensate. It's unnecessary, lazy and insulting to the fans that the Resident Evil Franchise does not try to keep a higher level of quality, especially when they have the actors and the money to do something really good.<br/><br/>Final verdict is that the movie is ""ok"" for a Resident Evil fan, but even for a fan this is pushing the lower quality limit. Personally I hope they get another director for the next movie, like Christopher Nolan or Ridley Scott, imagine that."

","I didn't see this in 3d but it wouldn't have mattered. The plot,action.characters are nothing new , most of the movie is spent with Milla hamming it up for the camera and slow motion bullet time like scenes. Done yrs ago in the Matrix when it was cool, its lame now and just adds to the boredom. A few nice additions of RE4 and RE5 monsters were interesting but they cant save this jumbled mess of a movie. Having Alice and a group of survivors trying to get to what looks like an oil tanker is an interesting premise however the writers/director don't flesh it out and it becomes one tired cliché after another , characters getting grabbed off screen - no gore which is what I like to watch in survival horror movies - a boss monster which is never explained ,in RE5 the executioner was not a 10 ft tall monster but rather a large hooded infected human that was genetically altered by the T-virus I think. Anyway , the ending is another shameless setup for a sequel. Lets hope they wrap it up in the 5th movie as its becoming more of a direct to DVD type franchise. The video games are getting tired too , if they make another one they need to wrap up the storyline. See you at the movies."

","Four films in and the series is already losing steam and begins to retcon some of the events from the preceding films.<br/><br/>And now it is in 3D. And yes the 3D effects were garbage. <br/><br/>Alice returns again to fight against Umbrella. And along the way she reunites with Claire Redfield. And we are also introduced to Claire's brother Chris Redfield. Whom as fans of the games would know, he is the most famous character of the games. Sadly he doesn't do anything worthwhile in the film and is pretty pointless. Don't get attached to him, as after this film he is never heard from again. That's right. No one mentions him. Not even his sister Claire. You never find out what happens to him. Way to go Paul W.S. Anderson to have the most famous character of the games in the movie, and literally do NOTHING with him.<br/><br/>Highlights from the film are the beginning fight sequence with Alice and her clones against Wesker. But after that nothing more is done with her clones. The ending of Extinction teased Alice was gonna cause some hell with her clones against Umbrella. But in this film it all ends really briefly in the first few minutes. But the action scenes were rather ok.<br/><br/>Wesker to me in the film is the standout character. Having been only seen a couple of times in the third movie, he makes his presence more known in this one. <br/><br/>The other highlight is during the end credits where we see a familiar character make her return. Which sets up for the sequel.<br/><br/>Other then that, to me this is the second worst film of the series. None of the other characters are memorable in the slightest and the action scenes are mostly done to utilise the 3D effects. And like I said above it looked garbage.

"onionbagel","6","1","4","30 January 2017"," A step in the wrong direction! :(
","Technically speaking, Resident Evil: Afterlife DOES pick up where the previous film left off, but literally only for the opening scene. Alice and her clones do go on an all-out assault against Umbrella HQ in Tokyo (as promised) (the virus has spread pretty far at this point), but then the movie goes downhill from there.<br/><br/>Alice travels the world in her plane in search of Arcadia (from the previous movie), and eventually runs into Claire (also from the previous movie); however, she has no memory of anything and has a metallic-bug-like device on her chest (compliments of Umbrella) and she tries to kill Alice.<br/><br/>Once Alice removes it, her and Claire come across a prison with survivors. They show Alice a ship off in the distance called the ""Arcadia"" and they think Alice was sent in her plane (that she could barely land on the prison roof) to rescue them.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie consists of everyone pretty much hanging out at the prison and doing nothing UNTIL zombies break in (I KNOW! SHOCKER!) and a large obviously-mutated-by-Umbrella man carrying an even larger axe/meat tenderizer. The fight between him and Alice & Claire is literally the best (and really only good part) of the movie.<br/><br/>There's a pretty lame Matrix-rip-off fight between the gang and Wesker, then the movie ends with Alice broadcasting that the ""Arcadia"" is now inhabited and indeed a safe haven for survivors.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Partially because this movie was coming off the heals of RE: Extinction (the best RE at this point in my opinion), and honestly just because nothing really happened, I deem this movie ""the worst Resident Evil"", hands-down. If you've never seen all of them (and you're gonna have a marathon), then sure, watch all of them, but as a stand-alone movie, i do NOT recommend this movie."

"MaximumMadness","6","1","4","11 January 2014"," The start of a much more episodic trend in the series, ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" lacks identity, but isn't without its charm and some very fun moments and set-pieces.
","There's something about the ""Resident Evil"" film franchise that keeps me watching. Despite its ups and downs (and those down points really are atrocious... just watch the second film if you want to see my point), the series has always maintained a degree of watchability, mainly pertaining to its high entertainment value as a glorified theme-part stunt-show on screen. It's clear that Paul W.S. Anderson, who launched the film series, wrote every entry and directed several (including this installment) isn't concerned with make a particularly deep or complex franchise. Nor is he very concerned with remaining true to the original game franchise that spawned the films. (Which still irks me to an extent, though by this point, I've decided to forgive this fact and try to enjoy the films for what they are.)<br/><br/>No, Anderson is more concerned with giving his audiences a hellish thrill-ride, full of over-the-top action set pieces, some admittedly fun horror beats and plenty of ridiculous and ludicrous eye-candy. And in that respect, ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" excels, being one of the better entries in the series.<br/><br/>Following a wildly fun opening 10-minute action set piece that is the highlight of the film, Alice (Milla Jovovich) is left in tatters. Her army of clones destroyed, and her powers taken from her, she is left all but dead. After discovering and re-teaming with former ally Claire (Ali Larter), whom suffers amnesia following the influence of a parasitic device from Umbrella, Alice resumes her travels, gains new allies (including Chris, Claire's brother, played by Wentworth Miller) and continues the search for the safety of ""Arcadia"" (revealed soon to not be a town as initially thought, but rather a constantly traveling sea barge).<br/><br/>The film has some decent acting, to be perfectly honest. As usual, Jovovich is fun as the butt-kicking lead, and this film does correct the mistake of the first three by humanizing her as a character more. She seems to cover much more emotion. Larter is also pretty good as Claire, although they didn't do much with her amnesia. Miller isn't very good as Chris, sadly. He's a bit too brooding and ""dark"", making him feel one dimensional. However, supporting actors like Boris Kodjoe, Spencer Locke and Kim Coates are all pretty good in their short but well-played roles.<br/><br/>The direction is actually quite nice for the most part. Anderson steps back in the director's chair after a 2-film absence and brings us what he does best- an over-the-top sound-and-light show. His direction is slick and capable. (Which goes without saying. No matter how bad some of his scripts are, he's a talented visual storyteller) My only slight complaint is the over-use of slow-motion in some sequences, and his over-use of characters throwing things towards the camera, which becomes distracting. (And was obviously put in for the benefit of the 3D effect. Unfortunately I cannot comment on the 3D, as I have only seen the 2D version, but for what it's worth, I wish I could have seen the 3D version, as it was clearly shot with 3D in mind.)<br/><br/>The script is not so good, though. I will give credit in saying that it's better written than the first two films, but it just doesn't quite live up to the promise that the prior film (""Extinction"", which I found the easily the most well-written entry).<br/><br/>The rest of the production is very good. The effects are stepped-up and look quite nice. The production design is top-class. (With the exception of some over-the-top Umbrella designs) The costumes are able to maintain a balance between realistic and stylized. And the music is serviceable.<br/><br/>The ""Resident Evil"" series has truly evolved into something of a mind- bender for me. As basic, under-written and clichéd as the films are, I can't help but admire Anderson's push to give us pure, escapist fun with each new entry. And I've gotta applaud that. I like dumb, under- written escapist popcorn flicks from time to time. And the ""Resident Evil"" movies fulfill that desire.<br/><br/>I give this a slightly above-average 6 out of 10. It won't win new fans, but it's a welcome entry full of carnage and fun."
"Vomitron_G","7","1","4","12 June 2012"," Packs about the same amount of punches as the other installments
","Paul W.S. Anderson is pretty much sticking to the formula here. It's the same zombie game, only on a different location. The two main locations this time being a towering building and a massive ship. And we get the usual adrenaline rushing zombie action. Somehow it feels a little less epic than the dusty, apocalyptic third installment, ""Extinction"" (2007), which is still my favorite in the series, closely followed by the first movie. So it's simple: If you you're a fan of the ""Resident Evil"" series, you'll have the same amount of fun with ""Afterlife"" as you did with the previous outings. Amongst the highlights this time are Mila Jovovich crash-landing a plane on top of a building and a cool & wet big zombie-mutant boss fight in the industrial showers. The whole series is up there with the more entertaining & better executed zombie movies we've had coming out in recent years. And we've had many of those. For a 4th installment, it ain't bad at all. So keep 'em coming as long as Mila Jovovich is game; I'll be watching 'em."

","Never did I imagine these movies to make it this long, but to my surprise they have and it looks like they will continue. I did like Extinction more than Apocalypse, but even I believed it was the end of the franchise. Then Afterlife comes and, although for me it is not as good as Extinction, it is quite entertaining and it blends a lot of elements and themes used in other zombie movies and media.<br/><br/>So Afterlife takes off where Extinction left our survivors on their search for Arcadia, the supposed haven located in Alaska. Alice, in an attempt to once and for all stop the evil Umbrella Corporation, gathers her clone army and attacks the Umbrella HQ in Japan. After losing all her clones in an Akira like nuclear explosion, Alice returns to Alaska in search for her friends and Arcadia, but she only manages to find Claire, which seems to be in a stage of amnesia and no Arcadia. Then she and Claire fly to LA where they find refuge in a large prison complex which is inhabited by other survivors. But outside the prison, there are thousands of zombies tirelessly trying to break in the prison. Alice and the survivor have to figure out a way to escape the prison and make their way to Arcadia before the prison is finally overrun by the living dead.<br/><br/>The Resident Evil movies are a far cry from the games or themselves. I did enjoy Afterlife prison idea and there's quite a good amount of zombie action and gore, but it falls flat in terms of story and screenplay. The characters seem too comic-book like and the story doesn't make much sense at times, but there's no denying that this movie is quite a ride and the zombies are ruthless, specially the one that carries a giant sledgehammer. Although Milla Jovovich character, Alice, is not from the game franchise, I think she carries these movies and they wouldn't be the same without her. To this point you can't compare the games and the movies, they are now two different entities that only share the same title. The F/Xs and visuals are great, the photography is excellent, and it has a killer soundtrack.<br/><br/>I recommend Resident Evil: Afterlife as what it is; a horror/action/pop-corn movie, nothing more, nothing less. So, if you love zombie movies or anything related to zombies, check it out."

"rparham","3","1","4","2 June 2011"," Looks good, does nothing
","At this point in the franchise, I have to ask, who is still watching the Resident Evil movies that actually enjoys them? Does anyone glean any excitement, interest or just plain, simple entertainment value from these films? Because, based on what is on display in Resident Evil: Afterlife, unless you are interested in watching a stream of unexciting action sequences with little or no grounding in reality, you will mostly likely walk away from the film with nothing but a feeling of derision.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Afterlife picks up where the last entry, Resident Evil: Extinction, ended, with Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her endless stream of clones assaulting the Japanese headquarters of the Umbrella Corporation, who have caused the majority of the world's population to be transformed into flesh eating zombies (I hate it when that happens). After bringing down the head of this particular unit, Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts, one of the worst actors I have seen in some time), Alice travels to Alaska to meet up with a group of survivors led by Claire (Ali Larter). However, she finds only Claire still there, and Claire's memories are gone and she has a device resembling a beetle attached to her chest that is causing both her memory loss and some rather anti-social behavior. Alice and Claire decide to fly down the coast in search of other survivors, finding a group holed up in a prison outside L.A., comprised, among others, of Luther (Boris Kodjoe), Hollywood producer Bennet (Kim Coates), and Claire's brother, Chris (Wentworth Miller). The group must try to escape the legions of the undead surrounding the prison and reach a large tanker ship off the coast that represents their only hope for survival.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Afterlife is a film that exists for one purpose and one purpose only: to string together fight after fight, shootout after shootout, all of them choreographed and photographed with various slick camera techniques that should, I suppose, raise your pulse. That is all the film even attempts to accomplish, because it doesn't really try to do anything else. The story, what there is of one, is both barely an afterthought and mostly cribbed from other zombie movies, such as Night of the Living Dead. Afterlife isn't even trying to be a horror film anymore, which its predecessors weren't really accomplished at, but gave a passing thought to the concept. This is an action movie, through and through, but since the characters are basically non-entities, there is nobody to root for, so all you are doing is watching bodies and objects in motion, with nothing to give any additional depth to any of the proceedings.<br/><br/>The acting is mostly a non-issue, because the people on screen are there simply to shoot guns or get knocked off in various zombie attacks. When any of the characters get killed, there isn't even a moment's thought as to their well-being; they are cardboard cutouts, not people. The film introduces Chris as Claire's brother, but that plot development is as pointless as any other in the film, because other than the briefest exchange of dialogue to establish this fact, it serves absolutely no purpose to the story or to the characters. The film does itself an even greater disservice by casting Roberts in the role of the villain, because you would swear they just plucked a random body off the street, not actually went through the process of hiring someone who claims to be an actor, as Robert's performance is akin to someone reading text off a teleprompter. How can the audience root against someone who is so lifeless, without even an iota of energy?<br/><br/>Are the action sequences cool looking? Sure, but nothing so impressive to make your forget films such as The Matrix where some of the techniques and images were obviously lifted from. And without any feeling to proceedings, there is nothing for you to invest in. There is no suspense, no excitement, no horror, no nothing to Afterlife. It just is, sitting there looking pretty, and isn't even afforded the decency of a real ending, just some scenes serving as a potential setup for yet another Resident Evil movie. And, as I started off this review, is there any audience that really wants another one? Is there someone waiting, clamoring for yet another Resident Evil film? I find it hard to believe."
"killswitch999","8","1","4","21 April 2011"," Great movie despite not following the resident evil game series
","This movie was great. I grew up playing resident evil and its my favorite video game franchise. With that being said, the resident evil movies do not follow the game very closely, but they honor the game by including its most memorable characters, and making them look bad ass on screen. A lot of people hated resident evil afterlife, because it didn't follow the resident evil games story lines, but there's something I think people should realize: the movies aren't trying to follow the games story. In my opinion the resident evil movies are made in honor of the games, kind of serving as spin offs of the original resident evil story, while containing memorable events and characters from the story. The resident evil afterlife movie takes place after extinction, in a world devoured by death and infested with zombies. Alice from the previous resident evils is trying to find some sort of life and does find some survivors of the apocalypse, in L.A. While Alice and the other characters including Claire and Chris Redfield(characters from the game series) are trying to hold up in a broken down building surrounded by zombies, all hell breaks loose and the survivors are forced to flee underground in an attempt to escape. After escaping the ravaged city, they travel by boat to a larger boat called Arcadia, which is supposed to be a save haven for survivors of the zombie apocalypse. The movie is very entertaining throughout and contains my favorite resident evil character Albert Wesker, who is the main antagonist in this movie. At the end of the day this movie is a classic for me because I love resident evil, and I would recommend this movie to any fan of the series who can put up with a change in the original story line, but who loves some of the main characters of the franchise such as Albert Wesker."

I am a fan of the video game which is why I was glad to see them create a version of the film that is as close to the way things occur in the game. The way Alice would go somewhere and suddenly spot someone and that person would begin to follow her around the game until their services are needed or revealed and their skills displayed etc. etc. I especially loved all the additional characters and the plot twists and the way this film ended like just as the next installment should begin. I really have nothing bad to say, I have only given it 9/10 instead of 10/10 because in some spots the editing seemed patchy, especially in the scenes before Alice went to look for Arcadia. But other than that the film was as close to the video game and as visually stunning thus far."
"basrutten","3","1","4","14 February 2011"," Yaaaaawn
","OK let me get this straight I've never been a big fan of the Resident Evil movies. But the third installment was actually pretty decent so I decided to give this movie a try. Big mistake.<br/><br/>Even when taken at face value, as mindless eye candy, this movie fails to deliver in nearly every way. I don't mind that there is next to no story or that the characters are flat as hell. I do mind that it's slow, ponderous, poorly made, and just plain dull.<br/><br/>One half of the movie seems to consist of slow and long shots of well..absolutely nothing. Empty rooms, empty ships, empty meadows full of planes..then a zombie pops up, eats somebody, and the whole thing starts all over. Even the death scenes, normally the highlights of this kind of movie, are so short and unremarkable that if you blink at the wrong time, you miss them.<br/><br/>In between there is some ""action"" which doesn't really live up to the name because it's nearly all in slow motion and so over-stylized that is takes away any kind of thrill or suspense. It looks good in stills but it's just not very interesting to watch and the effects are mediocre. All of this set to a the most generic industrial techno soundtrack in living history and all of it trying desperately hard to be ""cool""..except that this kind of stuff stopped being cool even before the Matrix sequels.<br/><br/>My advice: stick to the trailer. It contains all the cool shots and good lines, and you will save yourself 80 minutes of nonsensical and boring wanna-be coolness."
"TheTominator","7","1","4","28 January 2011"," Expect decent action scenes and you'll be fine.
","The Resident Evil movies are one of the greatest examples of a movies series that is consistently good, but always fails to achieve greatness. RE4 is no exception. The acting is worst than on the rest of the franchise, but the visuals are top-notch and the action is amazing.<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich is really disappointing in this, since she doesn't really have as much fighting scenes as i'd have liked, nothing comes even close to the awesome dog kick of the first movie. Spencer Locke had way too little to do here and Boris Kodjoe was a nice surprise.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty predictable, every scenario has everything you expect. The single survivor almost has an existential crisis (she should, but still). In the prison, there's The jerk who turns out to be a traitor, the girl who doesn't do much but ends up having some surprise quality that really helps (not really helps, but the swimmer had the right buildup) the mysterious guy who ends up saving everyone, and the newcomers who change the whole system in the prison.<br/><br/>But you can forget all that when the zombies show up and the shooting and fighting begins. Alice and Claire are as badass as usual, while Chris was a worthy addition and Luther was pretty meh. I have to say that while the fight choreography was decent, the big showdowns were really disappointing (The dogs, The Executioner, Alice vs. Wesker) And to finish, here's a heads up: If you think Snyder's films have way to much rampaging prepare for some really useless slow mos. It's really senseless since every scene in rampage mode fails to be badass and Executioner vs. Alice wasn't and was much better that way. Also, there were tons of fuel barrels in the prison, so why did no one blow them up when the zombies walked in"

","This movie may have a crappy story plot which is simple but it's still entertaining if your into this sort of genre , basically Alice's main objective in this movie is to get to Arcadia which continues from the 3rd Resident evil, The 3D FX in this movie is kinda blurry but still good, the music does a great job by making this movie more entertaining it perfectly describes the the whole mood of the movie.<br/><br/>The action scenes are fun to watch which is basically the only thing that this movie has going for it, the thing i hated though was how horrible the story plot was it wasn't really that interesting and it could have been Soooooooooooo much better there's so much potential for this movie to really be good and they could of made it longer too and if your un- familiar with the game you might not understand it as much since the plot does a bad job of explaining core story elements of the real games story line i know the movie is not meant to follow the game exactly but it left out some key things that are needed to explain the story properly.<br/><br/>Two really great things about this movies Milla and Ali look banging hot and yet have this dominating aura around them which doesn't make them too over sexualised which is awesome."
"Mr_Sensitive","6","1","4","10 October 2010"," It Was OK
","First thing first I'm a huge fan of the first movie Resident Evil; I like the style and everything. Sadly for me that change over the course of the follow-up which they decide to make it less suspense and more of the action base. Which make me happy to know that Paul W.S. Anderson came back in the director chair to make this movie – unfortunately for me that don't really help, I felt as if I was watching Dawn of the Dead with guns (though After Life is a Whole lot better than the 2nd and 3rd) .<br/><br/>Synopsis: Alice along with the few survivors trap themselves in an abandon High State Prison surrounded zillion zombies as they seek the way out to what they believe to be the last safe place known as Arcadia.<br/><br/>The story felt like a comic now that there are already four parts into it as we slowly follow each journey of Alice and it very much felt episodic, luckily we finally get the chance to see the guy behind Umbrella Corp. There isn't much to say about the story really but bewared don't get too much hope on it; just watch it for action sequences.<br/><br/>As for the casting, I thought it was so-so, with Milla look a hell lot better than in Extinction, lol. The castings of Welworth (Prison Break) do add a little status to this movie, though I hardly see his present really help this movie much. Shawn as Wesker has a lot of resemblance to the original but the bad part was doesn't really work out that great when in the movie Overall I don't really have nothing much to say about this movie, but I do enjoy it a whole lot better than Apocalypse and Extinction. The action part is pretty awesome especially the fight sequences between Axe Man (aka Executioner) though very very short. The heavy metal music work well in some parts. (Since I didn't watch it in 3D I can't say it has awesome effect). I say, hell just go and watch it when there is nothing on TV, you might enjoy it if you doesn't go too much on pin point the flaw ad loophole in the story.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Worth A Rental from your local DVD store.<br/><br/>Reason to Watch: You have been watching it the past three movies, just cont. watching it.<br/><br/>Reason not to: It never seems to end, is it? <br/><br/>Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C)"

","If you enjoyed the 1st 3 installments , you wont be disappointed on this one,At least they're consistent with the quality and the genre of the film which is a Popcorn action movie ( because honestly we will be all disappointed if we see zombies doing Shakespeare right?)<br/><br/>The original director is back, I don't expect much from Paul Anderson, although he is a good special effects and action director, his movies always jump from one scene to another (ex.Mortal Kombat)and plots are silly... but if you just keep an open mind when watching his movies, you'll actually get to enjoy it, at least his movies ain't boring.<br/><br/>I just wished they showed more of Alice's clones before killing them off, they kinda downplayed it on this one after a grand introduction of them from the last movie. Anyway, it was nice to finally see Chris Redfield .<br/><br/>The 4th installment in the Resident Evil movies is a cheesy but fun blockbuster, and I'm actually looking forward to the next because it will feature all of the characters in the previous films (and games)as is shown at the ending of this film....although I hope they make it the last one before they over welcome their stay."

","Someone give me a defibrillator! We need to turn this undead franchise back to life before my mind melts. Oh no wait, too late. This chapter famously turned the series into an action franchise. Who's to blame? Paul W.S. Anderson. Oh God, even his name just boils my blood. Alice believes she might just be the only survivor left, where she journeys to Arcadia to which has been broadcasting a signal out. Not is all as she hoped for, and soon flies back. Fuel is low, lands near a group of survivors, try to survive until the final act which teases the next film. We've seen it three times before, the exact same formula. Who thought a fourth time would be clever? Paul W.S. Anderson. Who was behind the genius idea of making nearly every scene part of a noticeable green screen and flood them with horrendous visual effects? Paul W.S. Anderson. Which mortal being conjured up the idea of writing a lifeless script, populating it with bland characters and dull dialogue? Well...quite a few screenwriters, but in this case Paul W.S. Anderson. Who is to blame for my sanity dissipating as I write this review? Paul W.S. Anderson. Words cannot describe how much of an amateur I think he is. Who keeps giving him money!? Stop it! Now! He is so obsessed with showcasing his wife in badass stunts, that he neglects everything else. Granted, Jovovich has fully evolved into the action star she's been progressing on and there are some enjoyable scenes, like the boss battle with the Executioner. But sweet Jesus Anderson just loves himself. I just laugh at how creative he tries to be with the camera, and it flops every time. ""Oh I know, let's put the camera behind those trees...yeah, that'll look sexy!"". Almost every element to this film looked cheap and lazy. The obvious wire stunts, the atrocious CGI, the gimmicky 3D abominations and the convoluted story to which I now don't care. Characters that you think are dead...aren't dead. I just...don't care. Eff you Anderson, Eff you!"

","Attempting to lead survivors to safety after becoming trapped in a prison overrun with the dead, Alice and her friends stumble upon the latest mutants sent by the corporation to take her down for exposing their past projects involving her.<br/><br/>This is just a lot of fun with a lot of good stuff going for it. Among the best aspects here is the insanely frantic pace here that runs throughout the film which comes from the impressive encounters here. From the opening attack on the headquarters that devolves into a vicious gun-battle across multiple floors and rows of armed guards as the clones rip through the building, to the vicious brawl with the drugged associate at the airfield and the later scene in the prison all come packed With tons of action, shoot-outs, explosions and much more which is a good time here. That sets up the later scenes here with the mutants and zombies overrunning the prison from the showers which causes the flurry of gun-fighting and barricading to hold them off, the battles in the armory as well as the need to keep the main fence up before showing the big, explosive battle on the roof-top which is a great battle full of fine stunts and action so prominent in the franchise. The battle with the behemoths in the shower is fun as well, though there's plenty of fun here in the finale as the scenes in the ship where the big battle occurs between the ravenous mutant dogs and the transformed agent all make for quite a great time overall fighting with plenty of high-quality action, lots of gore, a fairly inventive monster and much more throughout here that keeps this entertaining. As well, there's a lot to like here with all the different beings and creatures found here, as the zombies look fantastic with the addition of their new tentacle-lined mouths, the new masked, hulking monstrosity that towers over everything is a great addition to the franchise and the various mutants featured here provide this one with a really nice mix of monsters to fight off here which is quite enjoyable. The last positive going on here is the rather strong storyline about the need for safety and being duped into becoming part of their plans which would be a logical follow-through to the rest of the series and makes this a lot of fun. There's really only one problem area here, which comes from this one having a lot of lengthy time waiting around in the prison before the escape which puts a halt to the action for a long period of time before it gets going again being the only thing that really hurts this one. While the CGI for the 3D gags isn't all that great either, this one turns out to be another fine addition to the series.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language."

","I'm not huge fan of the series but I did think the other movies were okay. I never post anything on the web, at all, ever, but this movie is so ridiculously bad that I was compelled to write something. Luckily enough I didn't pay to see this at the theater or rent it. Just now streamed it on Netflix and was angered enough by what I saw in 5 minutes that I felt obliged to warn anyone who might read this before wasting their time. This is a B movie under the guise of a Blockbuster. I suspect the only reason it didn't go straight to DVD is because it was in 3D at the box office. I cannot stress this enough...this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If you waste your time with this movie you're a fool. Don't mean to offend. I'm a fool too because I wasted 5 minutes on it. To summarize...NEVER watch this movie."

The only thing that was bad was the story, which in my opinion there wasn't much of a story. Sure you finally see Wesker, Chris, and find out Arcadia is fake, but thats the only big things you find out about. So I really think Paul Anderson, in all that time that he spent playing the games should have pulled a little more aspects from RE 5 and Code Veronica, because those were supposable the two games that he used to get inspiration from. And that is why I give it a 7\10"
"biancahomie3","10","1","5","19 January 2011"," I've been a fan of the games and movies since I was a kid
","The first thing I would like to say is that I played the games when I was a kid and I saw the movie after playing the first and second resident evil games.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with a huge action fight scene taking place after the end of extinction. The beginning already draws you into a great start. Mila and ali (Alice and Claire) make a great team and you can tell that they get along great. The movie does lack a little bit in the plot area but that's kinda the point the story is exactly what your seeing it's supposed to be like a video game so the plot is thin so you can focus more on what's happening. another complaint is that Chris didn't seem like Chris he was awesome but he could have been anybody though he was cool wentworth did a great job. The end fight scene with wesker was awesome taken from the fifth game replacing sheva with clair. The action was awesome wesker was really cool and he didn't come off to me like matrix rip off especially since he was really cool and the guy from the matrix agent smith or whatever his name was isn't cool. The movies are very enjoyable personal favorites and they just get better with each installment though the 3rd was cool but my least favorite. The actors were great the special effect awesome in 3D it's 10 times better but seeing it just on my TV is still awesome. One thing that I would like to point out is that if your watching it with expectations that's it's realistic then you kinda an idiot because zombie outbreaks won't happen and movies aren't supposed to be realistic otherwise they would be boring like life also what more of a plot should there have been that seems to be a common complaint but no one ever says what they wanted to see they just hate because it's the cool thing. You know why the characters are there because there trying to fix things and survive a zombie apocalypse starting with bringing down umbrella and finding survivors it's pretty straight forward. The first resident evil stars with being thrown into a situation you don't really understand and having to survive until at the end you find out what happened the plot of the movie is is just surviving. The second one apocalypse is about the whole city getting infected and having to survive through it and get out before it gets cleansed, It also throws you into the middle of the second and third resident evil games introducing characters and storyline from them. The second one also begins the umbrella storyline. The third extinction takes you through the whole world being infected and leaves you to watch as they try to survive though this one doesn't really have any plot. The fourth afterlife brings you to trying to take back the world starting with destroying umbrella and uniting survivors. HOPEFULLY THE NEXT ONE WILL HAVE LOTS OF JILL VALENTINE."
"rsagget21","8","1","5","28 September 2010"," What did you expect?
","Yes there was a large lack of sensible plot and a plethora of unbelievable events (doors opening automatically and locking behind people, physics defying maneuvers, etc.), but what did you expect?<br/><br/>Anyone who has seen the last three Resident Evil movies can attest to the nonsense that has been present from the very beginning. The plots have always been just enough to say it was actually a movie and the action has always been a bit over the top. The first three movies did have more zombies, but they also had a power rangers sort of action to it (watch Alice as she fights the zombies). Not to mention, the terrible costume for the final boss in the second Resident Evil and the terrible fight scene between Alice and the last boss in the third Resident Evil.<br/><br/>Back to the unbelievable events, the locking doors and the ridiculous physics are a must in the movie adaptation of the Resident Evil video games. If you haven't played Resident Evil 5, please do so and you will know what I mean. Either way, the previous Resident Evils set the bar low enough for this movie to be somewhat decent, especially with the pretty good 3D action."

","This is a poor film. I love the games. This on the other hand is blasphemy. It tries to bring in elements of RE 5. So fans of the games say ""at least it's like the game"" I find this film quite insulting. The only reason I gave this 2 was because of Wesker (the bad guy for people who don't know, since his name is never mentioned). I loved his cameo he just looks evil and was played very well, just a shame he has hardly any screen time. Alice was played well, but I despise her character as she has become the focus of the films and yet she has nothing to do with the games. (Honestly why bother having her in series at all. When Jill Valentine was a perfect heroine in the first game)<br/><br/>The zombies were good even though they somehow got infected with the Las Plagas. They do give some jumpy moments however you never see them kill or eat anyone. Honestly I am watching a Zombie flick and we don't see them kill anyone. Oh and they dig underground, how have they learnt to do that? The reason they dig, is so Anderson can have a clichéd claustrophobic tunnel scene. Which is useless. <br/><br/>This film is an insult to the game, and the fact it has more game references because the film series is tired and pretty much dead. Hence Alice being human and her clones destroyed so they can start the series all over again with more RE game references. It's just a shame. The game series were scary and very enjoyable and would had been a great base for a zombie horror series. Just a shame Anderson and his fascination for Slow motion has tarnished the Resident Evil name. (By the way there is so many slow motion shots it is just ridiculous). <br/><br/>So this is the end of my rant at this film the film series Anderson. Hope it helps. To be honest if you like the other films in this series you will probably like this, where as me I think I will stick to my Playstation games because they are more scary and enjoyable."
"MovieProductions","5","1","5","11 September 2010"," ""Afterlife"" is a guilty pleasure, but far from a good film
","** out of (****)<br/><br/>Are you tired of all the post conversion three dimensional films? How they are so artificial and rather than being in 3-D, it's like 2.5D. Are you tired of the filmed 3-D movies that sacrifice CGI and high production values for filmed 3-D? Are you fed up with filmmakers using cheap 3-D cameras and the product being mediocre? Don't you just hate it when films take themselves too seriously and you just want to sit back and enjoy a fun popcorn flick? If the answers to all the questions is a ""no"", you've come to the right place. Make no mistake, Resident Evil: Afterlife was filmed in 3-D and is no post conversion money grab. Moreover, the 3-D cameras that Paul W.S. Anderson used for Afterlife, were the exact same cameras James Cameron used for his action packed extravaganza ""Avatar"". While the 3-D may add a plethora of money to the budget, is this a cheap film? Fortunately, it is not. The production values are quite solid and the images on screen look so crystal clear and the film has such a nice gritty atmosphere. To add to the fun factor, the third dimensions is highly gimmicky as numerous things come flying at your face. But the question is, is the film itself satisfactory or does the 3-D make the film?<br/><br/>To answer the thesis statement, it's unfortunately a yes. Without the 3-D, it would feel like another paint-by-numbers action flick but instead is ten times more stylized. Come to think of it, it is a pretty forgettable and generic outing. Also, the script and characters don't help matters. Albeit, no one can protest about the plot because there simply was none. Afterlife showcases expositions, 3-D, women with weaponry, and highly stylized action set pieces. It certainly is no ""Godfather"" so make sure before going in, you do acknowledge that. Now, what did I expect while seeing the fourth installment in the highly iconic franchise? I just expected impressive 3-D, awe-inspiring action set pieces, and just an overall fun time. Unfortunately, I have to say that the movie met my expectations because it's the truth. The inner, highly judgmental movie reviewer wanted to loathe this movie to the deep core and simply view it to add it in my bottom ten of 2010 list, but, it delivered surprisingly. <br/><br/>The 3D: 10/10. Words can't describe the epicness of Afterlife's third dimension. The 3D is so fascinating because it actually feels like you're trapped in the movie. I can definitely tell these were the same 3D cameras James Cameron used for ""Avatar"" and that's the biggest complement a 3D movie can have. I'm a sucker for gimmicky 3-D and it truly delivered in that aspect. Although, there are some scenes that use the more subtle technique, but those scenes are probably only twenty five percent of the movie. Listen to me carefully, only view the film in 3D! It's a huge waste of money not to see it in 3D. Trust me.<br/><br/>The Action: 7/10. Had the action been like the first and last ten minutes for the whole movie, my score would have easily been a ""10"". However, most of the action, while still solid, is pretty much generic. Also, while the occasional moments of fantastic action occurred, they were blatant rip-offs of The Matrix (the knife throw scene, the glass shooting scene, the dodging bullets scene, the ""run-on-the-wall-and-do-a-flip"" sequence, and many more). Still, the action was good.<br/><br/>Cinematography: 10/10. Easily a ""10"". The movie has a mammoth budget of sixty billion dollars and it clearly shows. The visuals are so enriching and have so much depth. This film was shot in several different locations.<br/><br/>Pacing: 7/10. The pacing was pretty good. Some nice breather scenes and when the action graced the silver screen, the word ""epic"" came to my mind.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Afterlife"" is a fun action extravaganza. The cinematography, the 3-D, and the action pieces are all worth the price of a matinée. It's just an enjoyable popcorn flick. However, the script and character development aren't anything to write home about, which makes it hard for this guilty pleasure to warrant a recommendation. Either a matinée or rental will suffice."

","""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" is a 2010 action horror film written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson starring Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. With the so far worst of the films behind me, I couldn't stop myself from still being excited about the following films despite my brain telling me that it's more than a terrible idea to be this hopeful. What else to expect now that the most amateurish and untalented writer-director of all time has also returned to being fully in charge of helming the project? That's right, another disaster. Still considering himself one of the best in the business, he once again created another messy screenplay and enacted it himself. Once again, I'm asking what meaning most of the scenes had. Already the beginning is absolutely ludicrous as it's nothing but a mindless shootout with obvious and terrible CGI that was neither innovative nor somehow entertaining to watch. The film features 3D, you say? Oh, that's probably Anderson's inducement of including mindless scenes like this. Dozens of unrealistic clones shooting up the Umbrella facility in such a ridiculous and useless manner? We totally get that you love to display your real life wife, Paul, but please do something with more purpose next time. Seriously. After this, it's obvious that the film ultimately decided to go full action movie and leaves its horror roots behind completly. With every entry to the series we stray further from the games and yet the film still pretends to be anything related to the original game series. What do you expect from a dilletante like Anderson? A clear and well conceived plot structure and story that knows how to respect its source material properly? Keep on dreaming. Yet, compared to ""Extinction"" it's still a minimal improvement in terms of continuity, as it is at least plausibly connected to the previous installment (in an Anderson type of standard, at least). It leads Mrs. Badass herself on the quest of finding Arcadia on the way to Alaska, just to have the whole story take place in Los Angeles anyway. I'm not gonna question that anymore. With the main focus lying on the action elements, the atmosphere disappeared completly. It has been sort of mildly scary in the past, but this is the new direction. Only guns and violence. Exactly what the fans of the games want. Isn't it wonderful how Anderson knows to treat the fans with so much respect? Not. Well, to his defense, at that time the games weren't any different than this, so it was bearable and even sorta mildly surprising that it features a few minimal aspects of the fifth game (majini, the scarab devices, the Axeman) even when they are used without giving a meaning to them. Why question things logically in an Anderson film? It has no use. Anyways, the film at least has a minimal entertainment factor to it. What seems like a blatant rip-off of ""The Walking Dead"" more and more becomes brainless fun with dozens of plot holes and character decisions, made by characters I couldn't care less about. Then there's the introduction of one of the finest characters of the original game, the actual protagonist: Chris ""The Boulder"" Redfield. Well, at least he tries to be. To be honest, his introduction was not only extremely unsatisfying, he's totally underused as well. Furthermore, casting Wentworth Miller as the charismatic leader was a terrible choice. First of all, he doesn't look like Redfield in the slightest, secondly, he's also completely misinterpreted. The guy who played Carlos in the previous films looked and acted more like Chris than Miller does. On top of that, it occurred to me that he isn't even much of a great actor either. Honestly, I've seen him in a handful of different roles and he always plays this seemingly emotionless yet cool guy with one facial expression who seems to know more than he admits. He's charismatic, indeed, but he didn't do my boy Chris justice. Seriously, it doesn't arise out of nowhere that I had the strange feeling that he literally just played Michael Schofield rather than the original game's protagonist. From there on, the film offers one overstated action sequences after another, until the final confrontation. If there's one thing this film totally nailed, it's the characterization of iconic arch enemy Albert Wesker. Despite him being way too weak and not that much of a threat, it was a surprise to actually see a character who looks and acts exactly like his game counterpart. In the end though, when the film finally concluded (after a decent fight between the Redfields and Wesker) and the credits rolled I again had the feeling that it was only the beginning of the film, as it, to this point, didn't offer anything interesting, just repetitive action sequence after action sequence combined with cheesy dialogue. It's a strangely admirable ability to stretch so little substance to an one and a half hour film and it takes a lot of audacity to call it a full length feature and decent video game adaptation. Cheap fun factor put aside, that's nothing but outrageous. Yet, Anderson manages to always get away with it. Sigh. All in all, this installment is still dreadful as cinematic achievement or as a decent adaptation, but at least brought back the cheap entertainment factor that was nonexistent in the previous movie. It's all style and no substance and keeps on disgracing its source material in the favour of absolutely brainless action and nonsensical violence. I've finally given up on getting a proper adaptation. Also, someone please keep Paul W.S. Anderson from making any more movies. Please."

","If you run any movie series long enough, you will run it into the ground. I am a big fan of the first and third films. As a sequel, this movie gets points for picking up where the last one left off, no ""Halloween 3"" here. Milla (Alice) and her newly discovered clones are going to go to Japan and go underground to kill and bunch of uninfected humans still conducting experiments. This would have been a great movie in itself, showing her getting across the Pacific, battling the dead with her superhuman powers. They could have made the third movie all over again, except in Japan with new humans. Alas this is not the movie they did, but instead it all happened in the first few minutes.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a brief narrative, then uses a few quick flashbacks to catch up any new viewers, or us old guys who forget a lot. The movie seems to have digressed into a ""B"" horror movie as Milla loses her superhuman powers, which was the reason why we watched these things in the first place. Now her lack of powers doesn't prevent her from fighting 13 million dead people in LA. Of course we just don't have dead people anymore. Some have become dead mole people and one guy was a huge orc/troll/Jason creature with super dead-human strength. What was that supposed to be?<br/><br/>The new cast of characters are boring. The special effects were great. The script was very bad for a sequel. I felt raped."

","This was about as mediocre as I thought it would be. It's nothing to write home about. Well, I guess it is something to write a review about. Anyway, this chapter features the characters finding a new place free from zombies. There's little plot besides that. That's probably the film's biggest fault. It doesn't have much of a story other than them going to a place where people are supposedly safe. I guess the action scenes aren't bad. The main problem with this is the slow motion. I think it's probably the fault of the 3D people, but there are many times where it just isn't done well.<br/><br/>I also kind of blame the 3D for having bad CGI. This is why Roger Ebert was opposed to this sort of thing! I having seen the last two movies but am not a fan of either these movies or the actual video games to really get invested to want to see them all. Besides, there's too many to list by now.

","They call these films video game adaptations for a reason. They are meant to be adaptations and not just another installation into that franchise. 'Afterlife' feels way more like video game on screen than it does a film by itself.<br/><br/>The film begins with CGI filled action sequenced that is flooded with unnecessary slow motion camera work. It's filmed in 3D, so I guess Paul W.S. Anderson was really wanted to exploit that version of the medium and give the audience it's most visceral film to date in the franchise. While there are some moments of brilliant B-movie fun, 'Afterlife' is just more of the same. And sadly it feels like some scenes are ripped right from the video games without any extra CGI or effects done.<br/><br/>As if you weren't already tired of the Umbrella Corp being at the forefront of each and every one of these films, they once again make their unwelcomed presence felt. Minus Dr. Isaacs and now adding pretty much the exact same character in Albert Wesker, the Umbrella Corp doesn't do anything they haven't already done in the series. Seriously, in every film Umbrella spies on Alice & company, attempt to take her down, and have a big confrontation towards the end. Besides a rotating supporting cast, the films are all structured the same way. There's a real lack of creativity here.<br/><br/>There's one clear reason why these films are made. Money. The filmmakers know how to produce these features and get people to spend their hard-earned cash on them. I enjoy a silly action adventure as much as the next guy, but there needs to be a little more effort put forth before I can actually certify these as guilty pleasure movies. As of now, they're mindless blood & guts action-horror films. However, the way this movie ends got me undeniably a little bit excited to sit down and watch the next one.<br/><br/>+Some fun action scenes<br/><br/>-But mostly too CGI filled for my liking<br/><br/>-Same old story over and over again<br/><br/>4.5/10"

","Resident Evil: Afterlife was a stark and precipitous drop off from its predecessors. Besides being one long rock video with bad CGI, the acting was poor as well as the plot. Not to mention that at times I didn't know if I was watching Resident Evil, Tremors, Silent Hill or The Matrix. <br/><br/>Let me say this: I get that slow motion and stop motion makes an action sequence cool but chill out a bit willya. It was way overdone like a child playing with his newest toy. Take out half the slow motion scenes and the movie is ten minutes shorter.<br/><br/>Speaking of the action scenes: there's action and then there's ""come on, get real."" I'm all for bending the laws of physics at times for an exciting movie but my brain has a certain point in which it refuses to ignore the blatant impossibilities. More than once I found myself rolling my eyes at the otherworldly stunts. Just tell me they're in the Matrix so I can mentally accept what I'm seeing. The extreme action and the paradoxically calm faces that accompanied it were too much to bear.<br/><br/>There is yet another exception I have with this movie. It's not fair but my idea of zombies has been largely defined by The Walking Dead and George Romero. Resident Evil is a totally different production, I know, and furthermore it's based upon a video game which probably has a totally different set of rules for its hordes of mobile carcasses. For all I know, the undead beings in Resident Evil aren't even zombies; they may be another creation entirely. But, since they look like zombies and behave like zombies I'm holding them to the zombie rules. <br/><br/>So, with that, I have certain expectations that were thoroughly defied in this movie. I found these zombies to be fast, strong, slightly cognitive and able to be silent when needing the element of surprise. Look, that is not my vision of a zombie and it's simply not fair. Part of the reason zombies are slow, dumb and weak is that 1.) they're dead and all higher brain functions have ceased and 2.) there are millions of them!! They already have a significant advantage in that they can only be killed with head shots (which is tough enough as it is) then you make their numbers multitudinous which is a recipe for invincibility as a species. There's no need after that to also make them strong, fast, sneaky and somewhat smart. The remaining humans have no chance!<br/><br/>Overall this movie just lacked intelligence and originality. They really went the mindless action movie route while liberally borrowing thematic and cinematic ideas from so many other known movies. The bottom line is they didn't even try and that's the saddest part."
"willcundallreview","3","0","4","14 October 2015"," We return to....the same old story
","We all think enough is enough at some point, and now that is the general feeling around Resident Evil. I know I know, why it couldn't have ended after one movie but to be fair it stuck to itself and did what it wanted to do, sure the movies are terribly written and directed but, well OK that isn't acceptable at all. This was a series that had room to improve, all it had to do was make it less bat-s*** crazy and try to make it feel more personal and less obsessed with stupid things when all it had to do was make it alright. The man, who produces, writes and directs this is Paul W.S Anderson who is now for me nearly at a point of no return, where even if he makes something good, this will be on his back forever. <br/><br/>Now maybe my introduction seems a little harsh I mean after all this is what it says on the tin, big action, more zombies than seen before and an actual kind of interesting plot(emphasising kind of). We see Alice searching and looking for the place where survivors may be, she flies around everywhere in this plane and even lands it in impossible places. The plot is hard not to ruin because straight away it jumps right into it and that I can respect, but my main problem is not with the plot, it's with the technical decisions. Anderson manages to blast out this movie that's scenes are chosen horribly, it feels Anderson somehow destroys his own script and after it is all over you just feel some opportunities were missed. <br/><br/>A problem I have always felt with this franchise is that it goes too big scale, it can't settle for street to street zombie fighting with normal guns and never feels like the characters do what actual people would do in that crazy situation. It builds Umbrella as this corporation that just has too much money, I mean it builds huge underground complexes which seem to figure in every movie and make it even more insane. The villain of this movie is just so badly created that it just seems stupid to have made that character, the person just seems to be straight from the video game which this uses too much from, and then the movie feels OTT. <br/><br/>Can Resident Evil ever get any better is the question on my lips, on this it cannot and this is the first one so far I have actually found bad and not just another poor movie. It doesn't try and that is what I can't respect, it's not like this movie isn't worth a watch but it certainly isn't one I would recommend to many, fans of the series maybe and I know people who love action movies will also enjoy it, but even some will find this an overuse of special effects and one movie that ruins this series even more so.<br/><br/>So Resident Evil marches on earning money from a very disappointing attempt and I feel there is a lot of this kind of thing left to come in the future. Whether Anderson feels this is going somewhere is really a hard thing to work out, it rakes in money but critically they are smashed, it's like a moral film question, do you keep on making bad movies if a lot of people don't like them?, my answer is actually to keep on going, but improve your craft and don't keep going at the same old stuff that you've been doing for years."

","Tonight's review is going to be short because honestly, there really isn't much to say about this movie other than the fact my mom found it on SyFy. I do remember the trailers and thinking to myself that it didn't look to be anything I'd want to watch.<br/><br/>Now that I have watched it (without watching the first 3 films, mind you), I can't say it was good or bad. It was just there to be there. It is a run-of-the-mill horror sequel based on what I think are the video games. There isn't much in the way of a plot, but it doesn't try to be anything innovative. It's about what you'd expect, which is a stale horror movie with some jump scares containing over-the-top monsters. It also knows what it wants to be, which is fun, but it does fall short the majority of the movie.

The APC (that for some reason never is used) also strongly resembles the one used in Aliens.<br/><br/>One area where it really fails is story continuity, with sudden jumps into the future without any explanation. On the other hand, this helped keep the film short and presumably retain only the very best scenes.<br/><br/>Parts of the film are not well crafted and somewhat implausible.

He's still got too much moxie to be the next Uwe Boll, but he's definitely heading in that direction.<br/><br/>I don't ask for a lot in my action horror thrillers, but I ask that the actions the characters take and their decisions make some kind of sense (at least in the context of the screenplay),and RE 4 is even longer on atmosphere and short on sense than the 2nd one.<br/><br/>-I still don't understand what Umbrella corporation's business model is supposed to be if there are no governments or corporations left to sell the damned T-virus to or what the point is of ruling the world if they can't go outside.<br/><br/><ul><li>I still don't understand why Alice decides to sacrifice her entire army of superpowered clones in a direct assault on an Umbrella stronghold when it's obvious they would be 100 times more effective as a group running a guerrilla war, rescuing survivors, taking out entire cities worth of unarmed zombies with little difficulty.

I know she's there to lead Alice to the next part of the plot, but a big banner on the beach would have done the same thing. Yeah, I know, it's because they're EVIL, but it makes no sense to have Clare wondering around free to get her memory back once Alice removes the device.</li></ul><br/><br/>There's more, of course, but I won't beat that dead horse. Instead I'll mention that Milla is still hot, and she has a sensitive, expressive countenance that supplies a badly needed human context to all the nihilism and wreckage the movie dishes out...but she still reads her lines and voice overs as if she saw them for the first time on a teleprompter. Some of the supporting cast are somewhat better, but since the characters are all blank ciphers, there isn't much they can do to distinguish themselves in my mind in the limited space they have on screen.<br/><br/>Also, I realize the big fight scene with Wesker is meant to be a ""call out"" to the fight with Agent Smith in ""The Matrix"", but slo-mo bullet-time has been a cliché for years now, and the fight has none of the verve and intensity of the first Matrix - it just comes off as Anderson saying ""Gee, I thought The Matrix was really neat."" <br/><br/>Worth seeing once if you are idly curious about what supposedly happens next in the RE saga, plus odd moments of visual interest and energy (Anderson isn't entirely without talent, after all)."

","I have to be honest and say that I've never liked zombie films until I watched the first Resident Evil; afterwards, I was hooked. I recorded the latest installment on my DVR, and waited for the perfect, cold night to watch it. Fast forward to the opening title sequence which immediately reminded me of the psychological style seen in current Japanese horror cinema; it was a perfect nod to that genre, and a great opening sequence, it gave me hope. Unfortunately, only minutes later it sank like the Titanic. <br/><br/>I don't know if writing the following would be considered, ""contains spoilers"" since reviews for this film are all over the internet, but here goes; after watching the captivating title sequence seconds later a male character with blond hair, who dressed, and talked like Mr Smith (the Matrix) appeared; next Trinity made her appearance dressed like Alice, or was it the other way around? <br/><br/>The hot spark that ignited this film was turning into cold ash. spoiler 2: Alice appeared cloned in triplicate, wearing Trinities shiny black leather suit, maybe she borrowed it? I could live with another sexy woman in black leather if she weren't nearly duplicating the shots and effects in what could only appear as a deadpan comedic homage to the Matrix. Sadly, the only difference here is that Alice was fighting armies of Japanese soldiers instead of armies of Mr Smith clones. The first time I saw these effects in, ""The Matrix"" it was exhilarating, eight years later it's sleep inducing.<br/><br/>Sadly this sequel makes absolutely no attempt to stand on it's own. It simply regurgitates something our culture has already so fully digested, which for me is the main reason it sank to the bottom of the sea so fast. Maybe, this movie might have been served up best as a comedic spoof. After all, to be fair,it showed us recognizable iconic scenes from another film with it's own actors,dressed exactly like those other actors, which could only be interpreted as an intentional lack of original content, so why watch? I found myself waiting for the movie to shift gears and land me smack on planet,"" Resident Evil."" Instead it seemed entirely content to endlessly mirror shot after shot of the same flurry of slow motion acrobatics and flying bullets. I found myself waiting for Peter Graves to show up, fresh from the grave , zombied face and all. No offense Peter, but really, it would have provided much needed relief. Unfortunately, this wasn't a comedy, and I wasn't laughing. <br/><br/>I was really looking forward to watching another resurrection of Alice. I wanted nothing more than to end my long day with a dark chocolate bar and slide into the entertaining world of a slick zombie fest. I was secretly hoping that Alice might find another love interest as sexy as Oded Fehr, his smile alone kills me. I doubt there will be any more resurrections after this one. I can only hope this zombie film lets the dead rest in peace."

If I were to tell someone the storyline I would say just this: ""They have to make it to a ship!"" I had the feeling that the script had 10 pages. It was predictable and not amusing (and an action/adventure/horror MUST be amusing). The characters are not developed enough, they have no depth, no emotion between them. The acting is close to terrible (especially Wesker), but Jovovitch really had a good time playing Alice. Miller, on the other hand was terrible. Anybody else would have been better in the role of Chris. His acting was wooden, without emotion, without being cool (and in the video-game Chris is always cool). The ending has no meaning, it leaves one sitting in his seat wanting a refund! It clearly indicated that we can expect another sequel. Quite frankly, I'm not sure I will be willing to go and see it. The only positive element is the music. It fitted into the movie wonderfully (especially in the shower-fight scene, which is the best part of the movie). Please stop the mangling of a masterpiece video-game."

","So, eleven years after the original movie was released, we are on film four in the successful Resident Evil film franchise. But does the latest entry succeed in being a great escape from reality into another zombie world or is it dead in the water?<br/><br/>The good news is that yes, this film does do its job as in it is a decent foray into the Resident Evil world and, if you head into this not expecting a massively marinated plot with character development and history defining dialogue then you wont be disappointed. <br/><br/>The film has a little bit more of a plot than the last entry in the series, as it focuses on the idea of a sheltering ""community"" called Arcadia. But Arcadia isn't what it seems. The overall plot flows fairly swiftly and the story is told in an interesting way. However, there are a few little sub-plots that really do bring the film down a little. <br/><br/>Claire Redfield's amnesia storyline is completely pointless in this film and feels as though it was only implemented to give her something to do. Nothing comes from the fact that she has amnesia, after being captured by Arcadia, apart from her locking her brother Chris in some kind of submission technique. It would have been far more interesting if she had not had the amnesia storyline and instead had to deal with the revelation that he brother is alive when she thought he was dead. Amnesia is often a lazy plot device and unfortunately, that was the case in this film also. <br/><br/>The acting was pretty decent; the cast gave out charismatic performances, especially considering the fact that there is no particular character development. Boris Kodjoe in particular played a very likable Luther West. While this was Milla Jovovich's weakest performance in the series, much down to her applying a huskier tone, she still shone as the lead heroine in the film. <br/><br/>So all in all, a decent film which offers some great escapism. If you are the kind of person who wants to watch cinematic masterpieces, then avoid this but if your into just watching something you don't have to think too much about and want to just have a good time, then this film is definitely recommended."

","Before I watched this part of the Resident Evil installment, I had lowered my expectation to the point of expecting my eyeballs to endure ~90 minutes of violence, lack of story and graphical, visceral combat. Like the other flicks in the genre, basically.<br/><br/>The story itself is weak at best. Continuing from the previous movie, she finds herself following a transmission from the self proclaimed haven Arcadia and looking for survivors in LA, where she meets the rest of the film's cannon fodder surrounded by a rather large group of hungry looking people with a bad skin complexion.<br/><br/>Now I enjoyed many zombie, splatter, lack-of-story films over the last years. Shawn of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Hobo With a Shotgun, blah blah... Loads. And I was expecting something similar, in all my naivety. From the start of the movie, all the way towards the start of the credits, it felt like I had watched every scene in the movie in other movies. At the beginning I just disregarded them, but as the first 20 minutes came to a close, I realized that it really was a bad ripoff of many well-know action movies. Scenes literally copied from the Matrix trilogy, Dawn of the Dead, The Island... the list is terribly long and wrong.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is unsatisfying. The story is weak, the ending annoying, the character development is so bad that it just makes all of them unpleasant and you nearly shout ""YES!"" each time someone is turned to food. The flow of the movie is action packed and predictable, giving the weak story another punch in the groin and like going in thrill-rides in an amusement park, if you keep doing the same kind, you end up not enjoying them anymore. That's how this movie made me feel in the end."

","i have just watched the next resident evil installment, afterlife what a load of rubbish the plot is getting thinner & thinner. the basis of the movie is the zombie's and umbrella corp the zombie's are rarely seen apart from a couple of minor scene's,the characters Chris reinfield and the other ""male actor's"" where hardly in the plot Chris's sister Claire had some scene's with milla jovovich. I know milla is the star and she was good in the other film's but i think this should have been called ""Alice doe's everything"" as the rest of the cast basically did nothing. Alice in my view has started to out stay her welcome in the movie. i liked the idea she lost her power's i personally think that adds to the tension more realistic, the ""human survival"" against all the odd's, where as before Alice would use her power's to escape easily and destroy zombie's or soldier's in some stupid manner, getting boring and old hat know. I know there may or may not be another film based on the way this one finished,I think the next one should be the last one before the film's start getting mundane and repetitive and stail as one is starting too. I don't care how good or bad the previous film's where but you can only go so fare with this kind of genre before the most ardent fan's start loosing interest in the film's. As I said before the main character Alice (milla)is getting more air time than the other character's which in my view cannot be a good thing, there has to be a balance between character's or the main character will over shadow the film itself. Milla jovovich herself is a is a good actress but i don't think she is brilliant, she keep's getting type cast in the action role which is passable sometime. I can think of better female action figure's, Angelina jolie for one, she doe's good action film's the move away from that role when the plot has been exhausted and on to more serious role's. I fear Milla is going to be type cast in the action role too much and will find it hard to escape it. She is a good actress not a mung the very best but she should choose her role's more carefully , I watched her in the forth kind and really liked her in that film."

"perkypops","Null","0","1","25 July 2011"," Potentially good story poorly transposed to screen
","The Resident Evil franchise has had its ups and its downs, and it is a pity that a really good story, written by director Paul W. S. Anderson, has not been better utilised in this episode. Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter do their best but sadly there are parts where the film just doesn't scan as it should.<br/><br/>The opening is promising with Alice (Jovovich) searching for Arcadia, somewhere in Alaska, where there is ""no infection"", but there is Claire (Larter) who is not herself. The pair, searching in a plane for survivors, find a group holed up inside a prison surrounded by hordes of voracious undead. For those who need to work out how you break into a prison then the method is commonly used when breaking out.<br/><br/>I suppose the weakness in the story is timing making the story seem very pretentious. I mean just how long does it take an ""undead"" to know how you get at ""food"" inside a prison? Although much use is made of CGI it really isn't that convincing, although the concluding sequences are better than much that has gone before. As others have said the talents of many of the cast are wasted especially Angel Ortiz. It's probably impossible to know all that went to the cutting room floor, but I have a feeling a lot of this was botched together because continuity of action is poor.<br/><br/>I do hope the next output is better because from unpromising material some of the series has been excellent. I suppose this episodes suffers by comparison but, had it been standalone, I would have had trouble giving it better than two out of ten. However out of reverence to the franchise I give it five out of ten."
"croftwesley","9","0","2","25 July 2011"," Truthfully not a bad film!
","I was excited about Afterlife when I saw the trailers featuring Wesker and other familiar characters. This film is honestly a good entry in the series and does do the Resident Evil series proud I think. I almost given up on the series after the absolutely dreadful Extinction before. <br/><br/>Another good factor that improved on the previous instalment is that Paul Anderson took over once more as writer/director and I think he's done a very good job. <br/><br/>The inclusion of more characters from Resident Evil 5 also made me like the film more being a massive fan of the game. Although the executioner made his way halfway into the film, his being there wasn't really explained and I feel that he was included just for cameo fun but was still good to see him. <br/><br/>The characters all have flare and spark and none of them behave in a chaotic or headless chicken kinda way which is something I find irritating in an action film sometimes, but I didn't see anyone hamming it up. <br/><br/>The story does pace well and has some good locations, set pieces and a lot of artistic style (the opening scene in Tokyo in the rain is a good one). I did get lost in the plot now and then and I think some characters didn't have a lot of time to shine (Chris, Jill and Wesker mainly). Also I'm not fully switched on to Alice and her predicament. <br/><br/>If you're a fan of Resident Evil, then there is no reason whatsoever why you would turn this down. I genuinely believe these films have transisted well from video game. I'm a fan of the series apart from the aforementioned Extinction but you won't be disappointed with this one. A few minor plot holes and untied knots but a great film overall. <br/><br/>P.S, my only drag with the film which I did laugh at was that amongst all the bullets flying, not one character in the entire movie reloaded their weapons!!!"

","Okay, the franchise is what it is. You must already be a fan of the games or previous films to understand the characters and the thin plot. However this film is visually beautiful and not short on genuine action. <br/><br/>I have been a fan of the games but not so much of the films. For me the first movie is only worth mentioning but since then this is easily the best. Okay there is not much character development and the family reunion of Chris and Claire Redfield is some what puzzling as there appears to be no case of 'Hi claire what have you been up to all these years'? Instead, this film is just action, action and more action and to be honest I did actually enjoy it. It was just 90 minutes of pure zombie and bad guy slaying. I imagine there was quite a bit of a budget spent on this film as there was some fantastic real scenery from airview of Canada, Northern America etc. And the special effects to help produce a scary and frightening post apocalyptic world are impressive. <br/><br/>don't expect too much of this film, it is cheesy, thin on the ground in terms of a real plot and character development but is enjoyable for its pure adrenlin fuelled rush!!

They lost the storyline in the script. The special effects were good. But the fight scenes were lacking in action and drama. They tried to make more prototypes of ""Alice"" and lost the sense of the original heroine. I hope this is the last one, I won't waste anymore time or money on future installments.

Well, I guess none of that really matters as long as Alice is able to find a stash of guns along the way. How about when they get through into the sewer system, next shot is them on a boat out to the Arcadia. How did they get the boat, 15 minutes seemed to be missing.

Watch it only if you don't have anything better at hand...<br/><br/>Jovovich is great like in the previous ones, but even she cannot save this movie. She looses her powers, but this doesn't really make a difference, she still fights like a super human. When she has Wesker at aim, instead of just shooting him, like anyone else would, she asks Any last words? only to make him aware of her presence. Then, he turns into Neo and the zombies mutate into Tremor-like creatures. We still don't know how the survivors are getting food and gas. Well, OK, we can forget all this for the movie's sake.<br/><br/>But some things are just ridiculous. The survivors in LA are keeping a man prisoner because they don't trust him. But the man is perfectly healthy! A healthy strong man in a zombie ridden world and he is a prisoner?? And how can he be strong and healthy when he has been confined to a 2 by 2 space for God knows how long?? And the ship, well. It turns out the ship is a lab facility where over 2000 people are being experimented on. A devastated world, 99,99% of the population are zombies, but somehow the Corp. is still experimenting *something* on survivors and finding healthy workers to pilot helicopters...come on, do they do it for the salary to buy, um, nothing?? One last thing, I never understood why they didn't just torch the zombies outside the prison...the zombies were there all together, it seemed like they were waiting to burn in a huge pyre of zombies...but no, Milla has to shoot them one by one, of course, losing a couple of secondary characters along the way."

"d_art","6","0","2","1 April 2011"," 'Resident Evil: Afterlife 3-D' has good 3-D, less everything else
","Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the latest, and fourth of the Resident Evil series, now called Afterlife, Alice (Milla Jovovich) continues on her journey, now with her sidekick Claire (Ali Larter), in a world ravaged by a virus infection to find survivors in L.A. and lead them to safety. Meanwhile the evil Umbrella Corporation responsible for the virus is after her.<br/><br/>This 3rd sequel has now went on to the Avatar-esque RealD 3-D format, and in all honesty, it looked amazing. The images were crisp, the whites looked white, and the raindrops Oh my, the raindrops. If you had a choice between watching it in 3-D or 2-D, I'd suggest the 3-D version, because, well, the movie itself doesn't fair as well on its own, meaning, in terms of characterization, plot, or even action.<br/><br/>The film starts off strong, particularly the beginning credits, which presents a rainy Tokyo street scene where a girl is standing alone without an umbrella amongst a crowd. The scene is filled with colors, tension, and mystery. Had the film carried that same sense of horror throughout the film, I think this film could've been something quite special. The pacing slows down considerably as well. As it is, it is a fairly standard action film with Milla Jovovich doing her usual badass, too-tough-to-bother action heroine thing. She looks cool, no doubt—but it's nothing new and she's mostly going through the motions by now.<br/><br/>The visuals are what sells this film. The sets, both virtual and not, are of high quality (and budget, too, I suppose). The storming of the Umbrella corporation in the beginning is quite out there, but kind of neat, too. A fight between two women vs. one baddie with a giant ax is a nice scene where you see 3-D blood splatter onto the screen. Personally, I don't see how the film could be better in 2-D, particularly these action scenes. These scenes are highly unrealistic, are often in slow motion, and not terribly exciting aside from the 3-D. They're great visuals, but there's hardly any tension, drama, or fear. Milla Jovovich's Alice has become a James Bond-ian superwoman where no bullets or sharp edges can touch her. She twirls and jumps in mid-air, easily dodging bullets as if they were tennis balls on American Gladiators. Advertisement And, this is all in slo-mo. Now, this is where 3-D gets useful. You can appreciate the details, the textures, and the spatial awareness. I've read in an article recently that one of the tough aspects about filming fight scenes in a 3-D film is that you have to actually connect, or hit the other person because you can't use fake distance with camera tricks like you can with the regular film. I suppose that could be the reason for the use of slo-mo. Then again, one can always do the other way as in some Hong Kong Films, where they ""undercrank,"" so people can fight slower with slower frame rate so it looks faster in normal speed. Either way, it works aesthetically well in 3-D. Motion blurs could look odd in 3-D, after all.<br/><br/>The plot involves a group of survivors stranded on a prison facility surrounded by flesh-eating zombies. It is up to Alice and Claire to help them get to safety to a ship offshore. The characters are fairly generic, with couple of fighter-type guys, a wimpy guy, a sleazy guy, and a pretty chick. Their backstory doesn't figure much into the plot, so it doesn't really matter what they do.<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich has played this type of role for so long that it's nothing surprising. She plays Alice with great physicality and delivers her lines as it is written. The dialogue is generic, lacking humor. Ali Larter plays Claire, who looks more like a feminine version of Alice. Shawn Roberts plays the evil head of the Umbrella Corporation, Albert Wesker. (Who pays for the Umbrella Corporation, by the way? And, do they still pay money?) Wesker resembles Ice Man from Top Gun, donning sunglasses, looking robotic--I suppose he symbolizes the cold, robotic nature of big corporations.<br/><br/>Overall, despite the simple plot and characters, Milla plays Alice as I suppose she is meant to played, with lots of action. I was still happy how good the 3-D looked and it could be a good reason to at least check it out in theaters. There's good potential and effective use of this medium, if coupled with a good script and characters we can care about."

"movieevangelist","2","0","3","30 January 2011"," Review: Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D
","The Pitch: It's Not A Wonderful Afterlife. (Just setting my stall out early.) The Review: It's one of the most commonly held theories in movies that you can't make good cinematic adaptations of computer games. Don't believe me? Then look at this list. Not one live action movie based on a computer game has a Rotten Tomatoes score of over 40%, and the box office for that list is also generally pretty poor. But surely any movie based on a computer game that's managed to get to its third sequel, and has done big box office business quickly enough to ensure that the fourth sequel is already on its way, must be doing something right? Right? If it is, then it's gone over my head. There's an obvious appeal from Resident Evil: the series of computer games – zombies and other mutated creatures, and you get to dispatch them in various satisfying ways. The games themselves have always succeeded in creating atmosphere, but there's precious little of that on offer here. An opening sequence wraps up the cliffhanger from the previous entry, doing so with precious little in the way of wit, imagination or style. It does then kickstart the real plot, prompting Milla Jovovich to have to act briefly in a confession to camera sequence that manages to be both tedious (it's very short but doesn't feel it) and unbelievable.<br/><br/>Ah yes, Milla Jovovich. Just because you're married to the director, love, does it really mean you have to keep doing these? You've got a movie coming out with Edward Norton and Robert De Niro soon! Jovovich continues to fill the function of acting as your avatar in the movie world but adds very little else in the way of proceedings to anything. Those missing Ali Larter or Wentworth Miller from their canceled TV series might think they'll get a fix here, but other than the fact they're actually playing characters from the computer games (unlike most of the others here), they're not adding much either.<br/><br/>Paul WS Anderson is content to reference other action movies without ever coming up with anything especially original. Shots are poorly framed and have no weight in the action sequences, characters are picked off in uninteresting and undramatic ways (at least throw in a bit of gore if people we don't care about because of your poor plot and character exposition are dying?), and for a movie that should be full of zombies, this goes to great lengths to keep them fenced off and leave you purely in the company of the other insipid excuses for characters, which is completely inexcusable. The games themselves are renowned for their puzzles – the only puzzle here is why you'd want to watch it in the first place? * Why see it at the cinema: If you're a fan of the series, then seek help you'll be going anyway. If you're not, then you won't be going anyway – hopefully. Frankly, if you've read this, if you haven't been to one of these before and are still tempted, then I'd be checking that pulse – the zombies might have gotten you already.<br/><br/>Why see it in 3D: Nominally, because this is filmed with the same 3D camera set-up used for Avatar, so the 3D isn't applied in post-production. The effect they have achieved is not only that the 3D looks dark, but in some places it actually appears the movie is in black and white. Still, things will occasionally be thrown in your virtual face, if you like that sort of thing.<br/><br/>The Score: 2/10 * You may indeed be wondering why I watched it in the first place? Foolishly, I had eight hours while my wife was out on a volunteer assignment and I could fit in three movies, Cyrus and 'Tamara Drewe' being the first two, and this then being the only realistic possibility for a third. On reflection, sitting in the car for two hours staring at a hedge may have been preferable. Hey, it's not the worst movie I've seen this year, just the second worst. Thanks, Catherine Zeta Jones."

","I normally don't like the term ""this movie is critic proof"", because let's face it, no film will ever be immune to criticism, and I don't just mean film critics. Everyone is really a critic when you get down to it.<br/><br/>That out of the way, the ""Resident Evil"" franchise is the kind of thing that's the very definition of being critic proof. Like the ""Saw"" and ""Underworld"" franchises, they are a glossy, flashy and for the most part empty series of films that will always receive a critical drubbing, but they have a built in fan base that loves them, especially on the big screen. In the world of the ""Resident Evil"" franchise, only a superficial similarity to the video games that started it all is had (it's really ""Resident Evil"" fan fiction put into movie form when you think about it), the acting and dialog is largely poor, the action is hyper-edited, and the whole series is empty. So in short, it's perfect for those who prefer movies on the high-calorie junk food variety, so I have nothing against it really. Hell, I liked the last entry in the series, which understood fully that it was a low-aspirations B-Movie and nothing more. So while it's not the worst entry in the series (Hello ""Apocalypse""), the latest entry in the franchise suggests something that is beginning to get long in the tooth.<br/><br/>Taking place after the events of ""Extinction"", ""Afterlife"" finds our heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her army of clones infiltrating an Umbrella Corporation unit in an attempt to take out Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), only to have Albert inject her with a serum that takes away her super powers. In the process, she runs into an old friend in Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), whose undergone amnesia. Thankfully, they find refuge with a group of survivors in L.A., which include Clair's brother Chris (""Prison Break"" star Wentworth Miller). However, they soon realize that their safe haven isn't all that safe, what with underground mutants, flesh hungry zombies and a masked monster with a huge axe all after them, and that the place known as Arcadia (no, not the Duran Duran side project) might not be what they hope it is.<br/><br/>Got all that? Good. Sure sounds dumb, doesn't it? It sure is. To be fair, I do enjoy cinematic junk food, and there are a few good things about this. Jovovich for one, seems to be getting more comfortable as the ridiculously bad ass Alice, and Kim Coates (from the all around awesome FX series ""Sons of Anarchy"") is a total blast as the sleazy movie producer Bennett. At the same time, I dug the industrial rock score by tomandandy, and I even kinda like how it rips off other movies. This is the kind of movie that unapologetic knocks off other, far superior movies (""Dawn of the Dead"" and it's remake, ""The Decent"" and ""The Matrix"" for example) so shamelessly that you can't help but go with it and say ""okay then.""<br/><br/>As I said though, this is not a particularly good movie, and is only sporadically entertaining one at that. Sure, there are moments that made me go ""Okay, that was kinda cool"", but those were only moments, as there isn't really anything here that's really engaging. It's just kind of there, with a lot of flashy editing techniques and action scenes, but little else. Scenes like Chris meeting his sister are clearly meant to appease fans of the games (and the movies) as well as gain some sort of emotional resonance, but they just can't. Also, I know it's useless to complain about bad acting in a movie like this, but dammit if Shawn Roberts is bad as Wesker. He grits his teeth and talks in an evil tone, and doesn't for one moment do anything to make him a very convincing villain. Another thing that needs to be brought up is the constant Slow-Motion shots, which are used to the point that it almost feels like you are watching someone parody the use of slow motion in a movie. It's no wonder the film feels shorter than it actually is.<br/><br/>As I said, it feels weird criticizing something that truly does feel critic proof, but in spite of a few fun things, ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" is a rather pointless sequel that barely furthers whatever dumb story there is, and feels like a franchise that's beginning to run on fumes. I wouldn't be surprised if even fans of the previous movies felt the same way."

Seriously whats with that? This movie has no plot and it would have been much more entertaining to fill in the gap here.

If it has enough energy to burn for 4 years straight then why aren't we running our cars on burning of Hollywood signs. this completely annoys me ... OH LETS HAVE A KEWL SCENE WHERE SHE FLIES BY THE Hollywood SIGN AND ITS LIKE ITS BURNING AND ITS LIKE A REMINDER OR SOMETHING OF PAST SOCIETY AND HOW LIKE ITS LIKE OVER CAUSE LIKE THE UNDEAD ARE HERE ! nevermind that after 4 years most if not ALL of the fires would be out of fuel.<br/><br/>and most of all it bothers me that I watched an ~80 minute movie and I feel like absolutely nothing interesting happened. There isn't really a plot. the main character goes from one place to another. does one thing. then shoots a bunch and its over. It was the same with the movie before this resident evil extinction. who agrees with me that both these 80 minute movies could've been combined into one regular length movie?

","I'm a HUGE fan of the Resident Evil games and I do enjoy the movies...even though the predecessors of Afterlife hardly had anything to do with the actual game; Wesker wasn't even mentioned until the 3rd installment, and Jill Valentine's part in 2 pretty much...well..sucked (I thought the actress was horrible and they made her into a total b!tch). Despite all that though, who doesn't like zombie movies? When I saw the trailer for Afterlife, I was PSYCHED! It looked like there was SO much more stuff in it that fans would appreciate and love to see, ie: Wesker and Chris Redfield fight, the big axe guy, etc. Although I loved seeing all of that, I was still kind of disappointed. There was a TON of cheesy slow motion scenes and I was really getting sick of seeing it. I just wanted to yell, ""Just let them fight and stop slowing it down!"" The ""big axe guy"" fight was VERY disappointing; the character that fought him, shouldn't have. They should have had Chris fight him. Probably the thing I hated the most was Ali Larter doing a backflip off of a wall...yeah, that was so unnecessary. Overall, I did enjoy the movie although not as much as I really wanted to. By the way, after a few minutes during the end credits, a scene will play which leads us to believe there will be ANOTHER movie."
"alexanderii","5","0","3","20 January 2011"," Being better than the third installment isn't much to say...(Spoiler)
","The Resident Evil movie adaptation of the video game series has got to top the list as one of those that truly stabs fans in the back. Not because its so horribly written and has almost no relation to the games or the books (yes there are books, you should read them), but because they decided to make 5 installments of this mockery.<br/><br/>The first Resident Evil movie was acceptable in the fact that it introduced new characters and elements that made it both captivating to fans and people who have never had a previous interest in the series. It could have very well ended with the first film but because it made a rather marginal success it spurred the series of films.<br/><br/>The second film continued to bring in new characters and elements but also brought in original characters from the games. This is also where the film completely severs an relation to the game and became its own horribly mutated beast of a movie franchise. In the first film the movie and the game could have still been connected, just more personal stories for the fight to escape Raccoon City. The second one killed it when they changed the personal stories of the original characters. Granted the movie was still watchable and fans could only hope that the new direction for the film was just so they could draw in a wider audience. This doesn't necessarily mean changing every possible aspect of the Biohazard Universe, but they did...<br/><br/>The third film was a complete disgrace. Thankfully after perceiving where the series might go after the second installment thousands of fans and myself didn't bother seeing the film in theaters and just waited for video. I don't even know where to start in how this film failed. Terrible music, plot, action sequences, new heroines (what is with the obsession of making every female character into some sort of Sarah Conner?), dialogue, and they kill off the most entertaining characters from the second film(!), also no Jill (guess we have to wait for number 5 to find out why she was missing... or not -_-).<br/><br/>Finally here we go with Afterlife and after reading the reviews and hearing from others who had seen it I decided to wait until it came out on video. So Claire is back... (this is Claire Redfield's Convoy... err movie). Claire has got to be the most obnoxious character rehash for the film series. I mean we already have Alice who is a badass and makes me very happy, but with Claire, its like too many chefs in the kitchen. Did I mention the similarity to Sarah Conner??? The film fails hardcore to provide any background to any of the characters what so ever. We might as well assume that the rehashed Sarah... I mean Claire and Chris Redfield were actually navy seals or something. I mean the audience has no idea who these people are. I mean I sure as hell don't recognize them as being from the video game series. Oh and hey it's the series favorite bad guy Wesker or at least looks like him... can't say he sounds a bit like him. Also looks like Alice burned through her clones rather quickly. I guess after crying over them one time it's OK to throw them in harms way like they don't have a conscious of their own. Wait doesn't Alice get injected with a ""serum""? She does and supposedly loses all her powers just before crashing into a mountain inside an osprey piloted by super human Albert Wesker (unfortunately the aircraft was only equipped with a three second warning system). After the crash she just walks away completely unscathed. Yeah I know right? Then it cuts to Alice flying some prop-engine aircraft (what there weren't any Cessna's around?) and left me wondering, ""Is this before or after Japan???"" I didn't get my answer until the killed Wesker with some sort of magic Umbrella bomb (magic because apparently it doesn't cause tidal waves when detonating directly over the ocean). Anyway this is getting really long so I'm going to simplify things even more.<br/><br/>Alice find Claire in Alaska and doesn't bother looking for more survivors (also Claire is very dirty and who knows how long shes been out there with no food, but after one night with Alice Claire appears quite healthy and apparently allowed Alice to apply a pound of make-up to her face while she was tied up). They find survivors in Hollywood (why it made sense for them to fly there the world may never know), all the survivors, except one NBA star, die. Great job guys! Oh hey Axe man makes an appearance! I was really surprised that they decided to write the characters as being smart enough to try to shoot him in the head but not intelligent enough to think hey maybe a .12 gauge would do a better job. Of course if they had thought that they would have not had quite as much stress to deal with. Check this out, the prison that the survivors were staying in was built with a dirt foundation but the only ones smart enough to dig tunnels through it were the zombies! So ya just like the horror movies of yore zombies come a bursting through the floor. Man what were those LA engineers thinking not placing a concrete foundation hmm...<br/><br/>Anyway to end this rant Jill makes a special appearance after the credits as... A MEMBER OF UMBRELLA! Awesome right? No. Yeah I wasn't to impressed either.<br/><br/>If they are really going to ""listen to the fans"" for the next film all I have to say is this: Bring back Marylin Manson, the sleekness and sexiness of the first film, kill Claire, and give characters other than Alice some god damn back story and well balanced dialogue."
"jboothmillard","4","0","1","16 January 2011"," Resident Evil: Afterlife
","The first film in the video game based series has been the only good one, the first sequel is one of the worst films ever made, and the third film was a slight improvement, and if you saw it, then this fourth picks up where the story left off, from first film returning director Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, AVP: Alien vs. Predator, Pompeii). Basically the film opens with Alice (Milla Jovovich) and a few of her clones we saw in the previous film breaking into the Umbrella Corporation base in Tokyo, Japan to try and kill Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts). After escaping and having an injection of the T- virus which rids her off all her superhuman abilities, Alice returns to the ship Arcadia in Alaska where you may remember the other survivors she left behind were heading. After coming out with a electronic device on her chest, which gets removed, Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) doesn't recognise Alice or have any recollection of previous events, so they head for Los Angeles. When they arrive on th roof of a building, where survivors are protecting themselves from the siege of undead people, Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) tells them the Arcadia is docked nearby and has stopped broadcasting the emergency message. With the help of their new fellow survivors, Claire, her criminal brother Chris (Prison Break's Wentworth Miller), Alice, make their way towards the vessel battling against the thousands of infected zombies and a monster or two with a variety of decent weapons. Inside the ship we see Wesker has been waiting, and below the floor are brought out hundreds of survivors are hidden beneath, and in the end, after killing the villain with his own bomb, a new emergency broadcast by Alice is made to say ""there is hope"". Also starring Kim Coates as Bennett, Spencer Locke as K-Mart, Kacey Barnfield as Crystal Waters, Sergio Peris-Mencheta as Angel Ortiz, Norman Yeung as Kim Yong, Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine and Fulvio Cecere as Wendell. This is pretty much exactly the same standard as the previous sequel, better than the second film filled with the same amount of quite entertaining scary, special effects ladened moments, not a bad science-fiction action horror thriller. Okay!"

","We all know that the Resident Evil films have been going progressively downhill since the 2nd one, but this one just decided to cut out the middle-man and nosedive straight to the bottom of the abyss. Films of games are rarely groundbreaking, but that's not important to the fans. I for one share this sentiment, but this crossed a line. Allow me to list some of my qualms with this, for lack of a better word, film.<br/><br/>Slow motion: It's cool once or twice to emphasise drama or coolness, but I honestly wouldn't have been surprised if they'd have slowed down Alice using the toilet, there's honestly that much of it. I can only assume that the film was running too short, so they decided to stretch it out by slowing it down to 1000 frames per second every time somebody blinks. On the other hand it does serve well for the RE:A drinking game. Have a drink every time something happens in slow motion. I dare you to make it to the credits.<br/><br/>Ammo: I've never fired a real gun before, but I know darn well you have to reload air rifles quite often. Machine pistols, I hear, adhere to this rule of reloading. I know its film logic and all that, but even Schwarzenegger reloaded a gun once or twice. This film took even the most brittle of film logic and wiped itself on it.<br/><br/>Chris Redfield: OK so almost everybody's dead (But Tokyo was surprisingly populated seeing as everybody is dead) and planet Earth is a big place, spanning oh about 24902 miles. Credulity is tested to its limit when it just so happens that Claire meets up with Alice and then they magically bump into Chris on a chance, freak occurrence. That's like me saying ""I really, really want a Twinkie (I'm all the way over in England) right now, opening my door and finding one there waiting for me."" In short, it's awfully convenient.<br/><br/>Coins: Maybe I missed something in the 'plot' (used very loosely) of this film and I'd maybe even chuckle if it happened because Alice or Claire jumped on an enemy's head, Mario-style to parody that it's a film of a game, but when some enemies were killed, they dropped coins. The hammer guy's wallet opened up. I could accept that a stray pellet from the sawn-off blast ripped through his money pouch (He did look like a LOTR reject, maybe worthy of the D&D films), but when a dog also did the same thing, I was just lost. It's like when Sonic the Hedgehog gets hit and his rings scatter What?<br/><br/>Summary: This film had more cardboard in it that Amazon's warehouse. A lack of a plot, terrible hammy acting (slow motion pouting from Claire. Not as sexy as she hoped), the slow motion was just silly, daft characters (Wesker was like a kid in his garden pretending he was Wesker), Chris Redfield's magic turning-up-at-the-convenient-time act and to top it off, what action there was in the film was just too predictable and really quite uninteresting.<br/><br/>Watch Zombie Nosh instead. It may have had no budget, but they did a lot better than this."

","Needless to say, one of the worst movies I've seen (so far). When you see that the director is also the one who wrote the script you know it's gonna be really bad. The biggest disappointment is the plot (or the lack of it). Wikipedia calls it ""film adaptation based loosely on Capcom's survival horror video game series Resident Evil"". Loosely translated it means ""don't worry if you didn't play any of the games, you won't know the difference. Sucker."" Here are some of the most glaring plot holes: Wesker injected Alice with some drug that supposedly took away all of her powers, yet she survived the plane crash a few seconds later without a scratch and, after a few months, jumped off a building and killed zombies like nothing ever happened. Guess the drug works pretty slow... The Executioner Majini (big guy with equally big axe), originally from Africa, suddenly appears at the prison in Los Angeles? C'mon, that is just retarded. There's also zombies digging thorough the floor - were they bitten by radioactive gophers? The viral outbreak and a few characters is all this train wreck has in common with the name Resident Evil. A bunch of survivors huddled together in a building besieged by zombies? I'd take ""Dawn of the Dead"" any day of the week over this travesty. Most acting was mediocre at best. Shawn Roberts tried and failed, simply by not being old enough, I expect better performance in the future. On a side note: They probably blew most of the CGI budget on Wesker's glowing eyes. What kind of a douche wears sunglasses inside? I guess that makes Wentworth Miller best actor. Well, he had the home turf advantage, playing Michael Scofield in Prison Break :-) We now come to the worst element ( element = :-), you'll get it), by which I mean Milla Jovovich. Would she have gotten the role if she wasn't the director's main squeeze? I doubt it very much. But then again, Paul W.S. Anderson must have seen her without any make-up and obviously thinks she's still presentable. That guy is a real trooper. The best thing she can do is butt out and leave acting to more talented and younger women. She and some other ""actresses"" out there should get it once and for all time straight: no one wants to see a woman over thirty (a.k.a. soccer mom) wearing anything skin tight like spandex or leather!!!"

It does continue the story where the 3rd left off, but it does leave a few question marks, that might not be revealed in this movie. Will Millas character finally set an end to it all though? You have to watch this to know for sure.<br/><br/>The action is shot well and you even get a character from the Resident Evil 5 video game. A very big one that is, but wait til you see it (if you haven't been spoiled by the trailer that is). It is more the action than anything, that elevates this above the 5/10 mark for me. Of course you might feel it deserves more or less. It's not about the rating. It's about how entertained you are going to be.

","So Paul W.S. Anderson is back with another zombie techno action flick and that is basically all this movie is. No tension, no scares not even a decent plot, just a tough chick running around with guns and knives with other survivors killing zombies although there is very few zombies in this movie. With some stuff happening in 3D and the 3D in this isn't all that great. Paul W.S. Anderson made some bold statements about how this is going to be the action movie of the summer and how he is a fan of the video games this movie is based on. He is full of crap cause this movie is a alright action movie but has almost nothing to do with the video games. So the plot is Alice is back again and she is trying to survive while trying to bring down the Umbrella Corporation that is behind the zombie mayhem. Shawn Roberts did a pretty good job portraying Albert Wesker, at least he got the attitude and voice down right. Well to sum it up Paul W.S. Anderson took some parts from the RE games even the creatures and randomly put them in this movie although it doesn't make any sense what so ever, with techno music and slow motion thrown in.

"tributarystu","5","0","2","27 November 2010"," Possibly the best in the series
","I haven't really changed my mind about this film franchise since I reviewed the last one of the bunch (or the ones before, really), but I've probably reached a point where I don't care that much any more and just hope for some good entertainment. Just to summarize where I'm at: big fan of the games, hugely disappointed by the lack of Resident Evil in the actual films.<br/><br/>Frankly speaking, I had a good feeling ever since I saw the trailer. There were quite a few familiar scenes, so I hoped for something tangible from the RE universe to keep me going. Ironically, it's not really the RE characters that make this film feel a bit more related to the games, it's a couple of friendly faces of the ""evil"" undead. Excuse me, infected.<br/><br/>The story (?) moves on from where it left off and while I couldn't really remember where that was, it seems it had something to do with Alice and her clones and finding the oh-so-clichéd ""safe haven"" in an apocalypse scenario. And really, not much else happens, except a bit of ping-pong between havens, while encountering the odd character that we had seen before in the previous films and some others who are mostly only meat to eat.<br/><br/>What surprised me in a positive way was that, had the producers taken a little more time to tie the action together, confer a tiny little bit more depth to the guys and gals on screen, Resident Evil: Afterlife could've counted for a very respectable flick. The way it came out, it just has this feeling of unfulfillment about it that I couldn't shake off.<br/><br/>Even so, it gets a passing grade. As mentioned above, the saving grace is two prolonged scenes - Axeman and Wesker fight. While I did keep wondering where one would get an Axeman strolling around Los Angeles, I loved how similar it felt to the game. Also, the shotgun with coins was a nice touch. It was such a fun scene that even the excessive slow motion (and there is a lot of that throughout the film) didn't ruin it. And then, the Wesker scene, where Shawn Roberts took all the effort to make Wesker move and act so like the character in the games that it made my heart skip a beat. Both, very well executed set pieces- as was the intro, actually.<br/><br/>To balance that, we had the underwhelming inclusion of Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller) and the ignorable presence of Claire (Ali Larter). Even some of the side characters had more of an impact than these two. But you can't always get what you want, I guess.<br/><br/>The positive surprise was complete in that the 3D didn't irritate me the way it usually does. Actually, having seen both versions of the film, it had a more authentic feel than the 2D version. I can't actually complain about how Anderson shot the film, it's just that his way of making things come together is rather superficial.

","Ill start by stating i am a resident evil fan, but not of the movies, of the games, and having played the fifth game i know what is going on (sort of) but what about the people who have only watched the movies. I took my girlfriend along to see this and she was confused as all hell when we came out. At one point i remember her asking ""whats with the giant dude with the axe?"" and it made me think, why haven't the directors/screenwriters explained ANYTHING? people who haven't played the games don't know where the hell the majini came from, or even what they are called, only that they are 'zombies' with tentacles coming out of their mouths. and no one else seems to get why wesker is the way he is unless you've played the games. on another point, i don't know where the hell the majini came from in this film, they are just there!! OK more ramblings, this time from a lover of film and not the games. The plot is terrible, there is no explanation (as i have already stated) and the acting was absolutely atrocious. the only person who carried their character properly was Ali larter playing claire. also, the casting for the new characters was terrible as well. Wentworth Miller playing chris redfield?????? what were they thinking, also Shawn Roberts who played wesker carried the character terribly, he well overdid it.<br/><br/>OK the good points, the flashiness worked, sort of, but i did have to turn a blind eye to EVERYTHING else but the stylised violence and the endless references to the fifth games enemies (which made no sense in terms of the plot of the movie but it was cool as a fan to see majini and the executioner in the film) and the fight between wesker, chris, and claire was kinda cool (if you overlook the fact that they have used the exact same choreography as one particular fight scene in the fifth game) and these are the reasons i have given it a much as a 5. purely cause it looked kinda cool"

","I'm kinda into Mila thanks to her movie debut with Bruce Willis and I kinda enjoy the Resident Evil general concept. With those two thoughts in mind I settled in for this title. What I was hoping for was a decent production. Boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>It's just... plain dumb an poorly executed. I really, really tried to enjoy this movie as I was watching it with my fiancée who likes the series. And this one left both of us with a bad taste in our mouth.<br/><br/>The action scenes are inconsequent both in quality and pace, they lack flair or finesse. I find it insulting when every possible scene of the film is easily predictable (just as the final outcome).<br/><br/>What is more - this part of the Resident Evil universe seemed to me as a prequel, not a sequel. The ending firmly established the plot for another production and does it in a way, which I find embarrassing.<br/><br/>I could try to write about the plot, but it would just end in me smacking each and every part of it with a big hammer. Alongside with bashing Wentworth Miller for absolute lack of any acting skill, as he seemed to me to be Michael Scofield pasted into this universe. Well... with shooting added.<br/><br/>There are no twists (well, for anybody above age 6), humor is non-existent and the actions scenes are surreal in their dumbness, poorly directed and simply boring.<br/><br/>To be honest, Resident Evil: Afterlife is a movie worth missing.<br/><br/>The one and only good part of the movie is the main actress herself. I find Mila a very beautiful (in a unique and intriguing way) woman.<br/><br/>And I suggest watching ""The Fifth Element"" to experience that. It will be fun, exactly the opposite to Resident Evil: Afterlife."

","Its hard to write an accurate review of what I just saw in this movie. A mix of all kind, that are irrelevant to the plot. Storyline is lost in a sequence of zombie attacks, where in you find that some mutants have even evolved. They wear a hood and a huge Axe. Mila tries to act here, but you do notice she isn't giving her best. I don't blame her, because the script has no end. Never ending resident evil...zombies, umbrella, blade 3 villain theft. I do believe this would make an awesome series, but to make sequel after a sequel, it loses its freshness. I like Mila, but Alice here looked like a soccer mom fighting those zombies!<br/><br/>Lame Matrix moves compel me to give this movie a 4/10 because we've seen this before. Still, no true conclusion in this episode."
"randalin","6","0","1","10 November 2010"," Dishearteningly lacking in a few regards, but a fun viewing for action
","I wish I could rate this movie higher, but the ending of Extinction left so much more promise. Afterlife leaves more than a bit to be desired.<br/><br/>Milla delivers a convincing portrayal of Alice. Several returning actors were promoted as having parts in this movie, but they actually had nearly zero screen time. Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) for example, is barely recognizable when she DOES finally appear; K-Mart (Spencer Locke) gets about 2 minutes of screen time not including flashbacks which are either cut-scenes from Extinction, or very close parallel reproductions.<br/><br/>It was very predictable (to me at least) that the effects of the serum which rendered the 'T-Cells' in Alice's blood inert, was short lived at best.<br/><br/>I had expected more of the Alice-clone attack from the end of Extinction. With the minimum of 48 clones CLEARLY visible at the end of Extinction, 192 directly inferred and about 4x of that number at minimum insinuated in the pullback, it was disappointing that the Alice Clone assault was limited to 13 'clones' confirmed, possibly 15 if one assumes a couple were NOT the same clone. So less than 1/3 of the verified clones are ever seen in action. (We saw more 'dead' clones in the ditch in Extinction, and there were far more alluded to at the end of Extinction than we ever saw in action)<br/><br/>Based upon the experience and abilities of Alice circa movie # 2 ""Apocalypse"" Chairman Whesker should have been killed at least 3 times during the first 15 minutes of this movie.<br/><br/>The first 'undead attack' we saw in this movie conflicts with the historical progression of the T-Virus portrayed previously, as the Japanese woman is standing in the rain for several minutes, quiet and still, before suddenly attacking someone. According to the previously established premise, exemplified in Apocalypse, the infected should show some symptom and collapse before becoming 'undead' and once undead they do not understand subtlety, instead they simply attack.<br/><br/>No explanation or even hypothesis is offered about the appearance of the ""Axeman"" undead from the game, just ""what the hell is that?""When Chairman Whesker appears at the end of the movie again, he moves like something from ""The Matrix"" and quite frankly if he can move that fast, he should have killed Claire, her brother, and Alice in under 1 minute flat based on how Alice is portrayed in this movie.<br/><br/>Based upon the history throughout the series as well as the games, Whesker should never have been able to get up again after Alice, Claire and Michael finished with him. T-Virus or no. And his 'fighting' the T-Virus for control of his mind/body seems so poorly conceived, as he did not have access to a viable clone of the original Project Alice, he should never have been in a position to be ""everything she is, only better"" given the time line presented in this movie.<br/><br/>I really WANTED to enjoy this movie. But it was a colossal let down in my eyes as a fan of the prior three movies, and someone who at least tried to play the video games. (I never got into the games enough, but my stepson played a lot, and I often enjoyed watching and offering advice on many of the puzzle components.)<br/><br/>I hate to give such a low view of what I really wanted to be a great 4th installment, but Extinction set too high a bar for Afterlife to measure up to. I almost wish this movie had never been released, as my imagination could create a hundred better 4th installments than what passed through the studio's approval."
"siyb","4","0","2","1 November 2010"," Just awful
","I am a fan of the old school games of the series, as well as the last three movies. Even though the quality of the series seemed to fluctuate from movie to movie, I still managed to enjoyed every part, until now! First of all, the movie recycles concepts and ideas from other movies of the horror/action genre:<br/><br/><ul><li>Blade II: The ""special"" zombies look an awful lot like Nomak and the new vampire breed.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Matrix / Equilibrium: The action scenes are a mix between The Matrix and Equilibrium, both of which I personally liked better.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Silent Hill: The axe swinging zombie, which opens the gates to the prison and is fighting Alice and Claire in the shower rooms, resembles Pyramid Head of the Silent Hill video game series and Silent Hill the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>In my opinion, the movie concentrated on elaborating a senseless, predictable and utterly boring plot. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting brainteaser, but in addition to the lack of zombie action and gore, the whole concept of the movie felt kinda pointless. I have the feeling, that, by putting the 3D label on a movie, writers and directors don't feel the need to produce quality movies any more. They probably think of the viewers as little babies, which are easily impressed by shiny objects and/or 3D omfg-slowmo-scenes."
"Master_of_Pie","1","0","3","25 October 2010"," Paul Anderson insults us and RE fans once again!!!
","First, I must say, that i'm no hardcore Resident Evil fan, i've only ever played RE:5 and was impressed. I didn't mind the films either. I thought they were OK. I went to see this one, with no expectations, but also hoping Anderson cracked the Resident Evil formula. However, I was wrong, so so wrong. I'd hate to spoil some things, but this movie is so bad there's nothing to spoil.<br/><br/>Let's start with the plot. Alice (Milla Jovovich) wants to destroy the Umbrella corporation. Why? I don't know. It opens with an action scene which is like a scene from the matrix, except really bad. There are so many slow-mo shots in the film I feel the movie is shot in another dimension. I saw the movie in 3D, and it's awful, there's actually nothing 3D in the movie, so save your money. Our Villain, Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) is actually more likable than Alice. He looks intimidating and those 2 Desert Eagles back that up. Alice is a boring character, she spends most of her time firing SMGs that somehow never need to be reloaded. At other times, she's filming audio logs as if they're trying to rip off Avatar all of a sudden, that continues to prove she just can't act. Im not sure how to explain this movie. Basically she finds survivors in an abandoned Asylum like Dawn of the Dead (I know they were in a shopping mall) where zombies can't get in. The zombies are better this time, RE:5 has inspired them with the parasite in their mouths and the evil dogs at the end of the movie. The executioner with the giant Axe-hammer is a welcome addition as well. It's such a shame they don't kill Alice. Wentworth Miller is a welcome addition as Chris Redfield. Other than Claire Refdfield (Ali Larter) and Wesker, he's the only thing to do with Resident Evil in this movie. I could go on all day hating this movie. Chris looks tough, and even fights like Chris in the games. Trust me when I say if you're a RE fan, the scene where Chris and Claire get owned by Wesker is the highlight of the movie. I won't go any further on the details of this movie, because i'll probably vent my rage so much, a volcano will erupt.I'll end by saying this is a pain to sit through, the special effects will give you a headache even if you don't see it in 3D. The acting other than Chris and Wesker is just terrible, and worst of all, it ends on a cliffhanger. Sorry Anderson, that's one movie I won't be seeing.<br/><br/>Well Paul Anderson, I bet you enjoying insulting humanity with this movie. I will just say the only redeeming factor of this movie is the fight scene involving Wesker, Chris and Claire. Everything else is crap. Also one word of warning folks, Anderson's next big film is going to be a movie adaptation of 'Castlevania' my favorite game franchise. I think i'm going to kill myself if he makes that terrible. Thanks for reading my first review on this site, If you have any recommendations on how I can improve, please email me, I can only improve with feedback. Thanks, and DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"
"Dmuminov","3","0","2","23 October 2010"," Resident evil is not what it use to be. It looks more like Matrix 3D...
","I have watched movie yesterday, and I am really disappointed. Like a real fan on Resident Evil, I expected much more, especially because, the director of the first Resident Evil (which is in my opinion the best of all sequels) was back to direct this one. First things first, this movie isn't a horror really, there is no mystery or scary scenes. This is more like an action movie, than a horror. A lots of scenes looks like they just come out of Rambo, Matrix or some other action movie. Story and plot are not interesting and exciting, in other words, there isn't any. Scenery is also static, it looks too much futuristic. In previous sequels, scenery was changing during whole movie, but in this one, there are maybe 3 dominant sceneries. Unfortunately, all my fears of this becoming an action instead of zombie horror are true. Special effects and 3D scenes are nothing special, but whole movie is based on them. This crew could have perform much better, if there only was a good story and plot. Resident Evil atmosphere is just missing out, even that great music theme from the beginning of the previous sequels is no more. If you miss this movie, you won't be missing much, I am sorry to say that, but that's just it."
"dgefuller","5","0","2","15 October 2010"," ""It's easily as good as 'Land of the Dead'!"" This is going to go well then...
","If you're watching this film then you know the drill:<br/><br/>Act 1: There's no hope for humanity! Act 2: I've met some lovely people, perhaps there's hope after all! Act 3: Ah, no... no I was right, there's no hope left, just a terrible conspiracy from a greedy company<br/><br/>(repeat acts 2-3 as necessary).<br/><br/>It's a familiar recipe, and one that nobody here shies away from exploiting time and again. Still, 'Afterlife' is probably the best sequel to a film that was so poor it shouldn't have had one- let alone three. That being said, it only makes it as good as ""Land of the Dead"". How bad, I wonder, was Romero's screenplay for the original 'Resident Evil' that it was rejected in favour of this formulaic franchise?<br/><br/>Though, like some criminally insane lunatic with an obsessive compulsive disorder, I have inexplicably been drawn to watch all four of these films. Some say Resident Evil: Extinction was unwatchable; it- like the first- bared some resemblance to the first two games from which it is adapted, the events from said shoot 'em-ups happening as a backdrop. And why not? It is an adaptation after all, and it's nice to have surprises. Shame then that's the only one the series offers.<br/><br/>The action here is okay- but you could easily lose about 20 minutes of the running time by simply removing the slow motion bullets, kicks in the face and swinging/running away from things that are exploding. The director (Anderson, returning after a brief hiatus from the series to run 'Alien' and 'Predator' into the ground simultaneously and the shockingly watchable 'Death Race') loves looking at shiny guns, too- so we have to look a lot of shiny guns.<br/><br/>The 'infected' are a bit boring (compared to the pants-wettingly terrifying ones in '28 Days/Weeks Later') and they seem to have a great deal of difficulty eating anything because they have four very long tongues with teeth embedded in them (a bit like the dog out of John Carpenter's 'The Thing'- a bit too much like that, actually). Furthermore, they look completely unbelievable (as if these zombies are walking around with a bad special effect stuck to their faces) and it's a gimmick that gets exhausted pretty quickly (Del Toro did something similar in 'Blade 2' as well, except he's a genius and doesn't submit to overkill).<br/><br/>The villain wears sunglasses ALL THE TIME and has a big black trench coat. Frankly, that's so clichéd it's beyond funny now: it's actually a little bit embarrassing, like that guy at college who STILL dresses like Neo from the Matrix. Seriously, it's been eleven years. Can we stop ripping that film off please? If it's not fashion, then it's the slow mo and the half-baked bullet time effects. It wouldn't be so bad if they weren't so terribly executed.<br/><br/>The highlight of the film is the unexpected appearance of Neil from 'The Inbetweeners' sister. The plot's the same as always, there's nothing new on display here, there's not even any innovation in terms of death- everything gets bitten on the neck or gets shot several times- because guns ARE the solution.<br/><br/>It's the best of the four, but it's still a sub-standard action/horror flick which delivers on neither action or horror. It's been bested by other, smarter films. I wouldn't mind the film being so dumb, so mind numbingly stupid if only it wasn't asking the audience to take it so seriously and this misguided self-belief that it's the greatest action/horror franchise of all time. It's the best video game inspired franchise of all time, but then again I think it might be the only video-game inspired franchise that hasn't been helmed by Uwe Boll (most other adaptations don't get sequels for damn good reasons- I don't see how Resident Evil was any better than, say, 'Doom'- which will never get a follow up).<br/><br/>Also, the trailer gives away something that the film tries to keep as a surprise, given how the opening scene plays out... although it's pretty obvious to be fair. <br/><br/>I can't say I'm disappointed, I knew it was going to be poor. And I will probably watch the fifth one too. Like I said, it's an illness."
"chrissirch9","4","0","1","12 October 2010"," Do not see..... If not in 3-D!
","Resident Evil Afterlife is an OK action flick. However those expecting something ground-breaking will be disappointed as it really isn't anything beyond your typical action movie. The effects are good, and in 3-D I'd bet they are even better. However, as I did not see the movie in 3-D, I cannot comment and therein lies my biggest argument with this movie. Its obvious to me that this entire movies appeal comes from the fact that its in 3-D and as a result, things like a solid storyline and good old original action sequences are seemingly sacrificed to put greater emphasis on the 3-D aspect. Because I only saw this movie in 2-D, its obvious I am missing out and that's disappointing. I feel like this whole ""3-D"" craze that's suddenly hit the film industry has led many movie creators to neglect the things that count in a film like a good storyline, and are instead more concerned with making sure the film has good 3-D effects. Resident Evil Afterlife is a prime example of this.<br/><br/>The bottom line here is only see this movie in 3-D. Without the 3-D effect, you will be too drawn to how unoriginal and bland this film is. Don't expect an engaging storyline which draws you in either, instead just sit back in awe at the amazing 3-D effects. After all, that is apparently all they were concerned with when making this film."
"poonhokong","4","0","2","12 October 2010"," It may be OK, if not counting the rip-offs
","Among the recent horror titles, Resident Evil: Afterlife maybe an entertaining film. It is fast paced and action packed, and it does provide some enjoyment if you let your brain stop working for an hour and a half.<br/><br/>Plot holes are everywhere. Why is everybody suddenly possess all kinds of superhuman abilities like jumping over a meter high, sliding everywhere, while they are not supposed to, except to pay homage to the video game RE4 and RE5 which normal human having superior power. The homages to RE4 and RE5 may also make watchers who are not fans feel absurd since many things are left unexplained, such as what is that giant monster exactly?<br/><br/>But what vexes me most is the rip-offs, which are everywhere. Come on are you serious? The opening scenes are from the Matrix. The landing scene is from Escape from New York. Signs on the roof? Thats from Dawn of the Dead remake! Jumping off the roof? Die Hard of course.<br/><br/>Afterall, if you just want some mind-numbing B-movie, give it a try."
"wynonasbigbrownbeaver","5","0","2","9 October 2010"," A mindless 3D set piece
","After all the negative reviews, I found this title to be routine action with nothing special in the wow factor, maybe because I put my expectations real low on this one since all it does is go through the motions. The 3-D is sufficient and the characters are okay in the terms of acting. It looked nice in some parts and the set pieces were decent with the zombie hoards and the opening credits in Japan. Action wise, it was rather forgettable and tried too hard to compensate with excessive slow motion. Though I did like those coin bullets Alice used. A small highlight... Wesker and Chris Redfield characters were decently casted but they need a little more material to work off of. Wesker looks spot on but need more substance than emanating the sinister Agent Smith scowl. <br/><br/>The fiber of the movie is even deader than the zombie itself. I didn't like this as much as the previous, but didn't hate it entirely either. There could have been improvements in some character development. I was wondering how squeaky clean and clean cut the supporting cast remained 4 and a half years after a zombie apocalypse. The supporting cast is routinely placed to get picked off at a predictable level for the sake of plot convenience. A little more so if you know about the characters in the video game. If they're neither Alice or the Resident Evil video game cast, then chances are they'll pretty much die (spoiler). Like the swim team girl, deliberately placed there to get picked off.<br/><br/>Plot holes are obvious, not really making sense in third or fourth dimensions of space and time. If you've seen the predecessors, you would realize that each back story changes during every subsequent movie made in terms of where and how the zombie apocalypse began. First it was Raccoon city and then Anderson decides the apocalypse started in Japan (?). There are more loop holes than that. Alice just didn't kill Wesker, but points a gun to his head with an ""any last words?"" conveniently enabling Wesker to retaliate against her, for the sake of plot convenience to keep the villain alive in the beginning. I also didn't feel that they elaborated on why Chris Redfield was trapped in a jail cell, because he's dangerous more so than the zombies (?). The roof top scene seemed a little too staged, as if zombies were waiting in between takes and then retry to bum rush our main character. Did the zombies move out of the way after they get shot or something? (spoiler) How did the trio know that Wesker will escape through another helicopter to the extent of where they staged a bomb on it?<br/><br/>Overall, RE 4 didn't upset me, but I really don't think I can recommend it entirely. It is slick looking but overall lacking in any real substance, Anderson knows that this movie wasn't going to be Oscar material but still, it could have been much better. Feel free to watch this, if you can take the mindless action."

"ratafelli","6","0","4","25 September 2010"," 90 minutes of stupid action scenes.
","Personally, I wasn't expecting much from the movie, but some things went right. Let's start with the good things. The soundtrack was awesome, almost every time we was gifted by a song that perfect completed the scene. If is not the best soundtrack that i ever heard on a movie, is on the top 3 for sure. I really like the production, and I think that is a step forward for the series. Extinction was terrible. Really. Afterlife does a great job making things work at least decent this time. But the good ends here. The plot is stupid and I wonder until when we have to wait for a real end? Those cliffhangers became so clichÃ©. The whole movie seems like a big trailer. Things happens and changes fast and they're always like ""let's do this"". ""OK, this won't work, let's do that!"". The movie lacks focus. I think that there's nothing more to do with the plot. The first movie did a great job because eight years ago things were different. But they tried everything to do with the plot... What's gonna happen next? Another 90 minutes of stupid action scenes with a decent production... and no end? Even if the production was good overall, I can't say the same about the effects. Some of them look really cool like the fight at the bathroom, where Claire kicks that big Zombie ass. This scene was incredible. But the first scene from the movie, where those Alice's jumped over the Umbrella facility... It was like a amateur movie. It was ridiculous, Well, at least I think Milla did her job, it isn't her best movie, but it's solid. Can't say the same for the other characters... they all look generic. Chris, Claire, Luther, K-mart... They doesn't inspire any kind of emotion. Claire sounds dumb when she says that don't remember anything. Telling the truth, if those characters didn't appeared it would simply change nothing. Because they didn't nothing. My rate is 6/10. Not totally bad, but far away from being a good movie. It's just 90 minutes of action. But... and I mean BUT stupid action. The only real good moment was the Claire's fight at the bathroom like I said before. Not really for the girl, but because the whole scene was superb and it looked awesome on 3-d. The other scenes like the plane scene, or the ""Matrix"" fight at arcadia were so boring that I was starting to think if the movie would last too long... So if you're a die-hard Milla fan, you'll probably love it like I've loved Apocalypse 6 years ago. A Resident Evil fan may like the references like the Big Hammer and the new zombies. An action movie fan may think it was decent. Anyone else you'll think the movie is just stupid, what, personally, I totally agree. And before I forget, any of you really thinks that any movie after the first had something new to offer? If they ends the series in a next movie, anything that they done on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th movie was useless because the story didn't went anywhere, take a look and you'll see it's like running in circles. Nothing changed at all. The formula is starting to get boring."

This is the same kind of impulse that makes you go and buy a hamburger to get quick and short relief, after which you completely forget about it. It's kind of the same with Resident Evil: Afterlife (2D).<br/><br/>You get garish effects (sort of like a ""best of"" collection from other flics), cardboard characters that are fleshed out so basically that when they turn sideways you can see the stand that supports them, a plot so minimal it doesn't bother to explain why some things occur (where do the petal-mouthed guys come from? who the hell is that hooded giant with the anime weapon?) and the longest drawn-out slo-mo you can get for the money of one ticket.<br/><br/>Sure, Milla is always nice to look at and we silently cheer her on as she goes on yet another killing spree but often times I not only had to suspend disbelief (the topic already demanded that) but to actively shut off the brain to enjoy some of the more impossible shenanigans.<br/><br/>There is no comic relief in this one, and that's probably because there's no real tension either. Yes, it has the few obligatory jumps but mainly because the scenes are cut so short that when a zombie says ""boo"" he's already snagged somebody and disappeared again before you can say ""argh!"".<br/><br/>Nope, the movie is too disjointed and characters as much as villains are too weak to care for them or hate them enough.
