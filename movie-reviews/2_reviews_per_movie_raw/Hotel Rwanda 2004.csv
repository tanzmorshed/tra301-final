","Anything I say in this review is probably redundant, because there isn't a single negative review in all the comments so far here, and I agree wholeheartedly with what has been said by other reviewers.<br/><br/>Nevertheless Hotel Rwanda is that rare kind of movie experience that doesn't easily relinquish its hold on the audience just because the credits have rolled. Watching with a friend, after ten minutes we had to pause the film because we decided we would be better served if we were more informed about what the basic facts of the conflict in Rwanda were. So to my shame, we had to read on the internet about what really happened, before we could continue. I say shame because we should have known, both of us were of an age when it happened to have taken more of an interest in world politics.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully understated, eschewing sentimentality in favour of raw emotion and letting the story tell itself. The acting was flawless - Don Cheadle's breathtaking performance being a particular standout - and the direction didn't falter, despite all the potential pitfalls of dramatising a recent and horrific conflict. The scenes which were hardest to watch in terms of tension and violence were often suffused with humour and hope.<br/><br/>It's difficult sometimes to separate the significance of the true story, from the artistry of the product, and often I get impatient with 'worthy' movies scoring big at Oscar time because it seems as though important stories ought to be rewarded, whether or not they make good films. However, I can't recall being so profoundly moved by a film since I saw The Grey Zone, and I hope Hotel Rwanda gets all the plaudits it deserves."

","I have never been so touched by a movie. It was the hardest movie I have ever sat through but also the best. it's so easy to ignore human rights abuses if they are not happening to you or your family, but just because you ignore it, they are still happening. i hope this movie receives the praise it deserves. i am frustrated because nothing i can type can represent how powerful this movie is or how much it moved me. i can't comment on the amazing acting or cinematography or directing because the movie transported me. i did not think about the making of the movie but rather sat shocked and horrified and nauseated and inspired. there was the red cross agent. there were heroes and while human nature perverts and the thin veil of culture unravels, there is still good. i have to look at the good of the heroes in the movie and of the people that wrote the movie, and realize that going to the movies doesn't have to be about escapism. it can be about reality. this is a must-see, not because it will make you laugh but because it will make you think and feel."

","The only comment I can give about this movie is - SEE IT. It's one of the most heart wrenching, yet beautiful movies I've ever seen. I really hope Don Cheadle and the movie receive Oscars! The acting is superb and the fact this is based upon a true story only makes it better. You may need some Kleenex as I was overwhelmed for a large part of this movie.<br/><br/>I had the honor of seeing this movie at a preview screening with the real ""Paul"" and his wife attending - what an absolute amazing experience to be in their presence.

","I have no doubt that this is the only movie for the past year that can get me totally, if not 101%, emotionally involved. For other movies, I might be interacting with the story a lot , say associating my personal experiences with the characters, making judgment on them, criticizing the development of the story, ways of expression, the cinematography, acting, etc. BUT, Hotel Rwanda simply took me over as I was watching it. My emotion was going along with Paul ( Don Cheadle) all the time. The director did a great great job in capturing the feelings of people facing uncertainty, horror, ridicules, anger, death, waning faith... Family, life and dignity/integrity become the largest things in the situation. What's more is that it squarely shows the realist thinking in international politics.It honestly shows the weakness or helplessness of the UN and the non-governmental organizations. It truthfully tells how indifferent most of the international community (or individuals, which may or may not include you and me) are towards the deprivation of social justice taking place in other parts of the world. It makes you question to what extent that it is true to say what we see ( the sufferings in the world) is what we tolerate. It shows you how monstrous human being can be. It scares you how sanity would fail. At the same time, the uglier the people become, the more beautiful you find those who have managed to keep brave and maintain humanity. The movie fully succeeds in showing me the spirit, faith, and compassion that the world is dreaming for."

","I was fortunate to see this film at the Toronto Film Festival. I had heard nothing about this film before I read up on it in the Fest guide and originally was going to see something else. But, the subway happened to shut down and I was not going to be able to see the film I originally intended. So, I decided to give this a try.<br/><br/>And I am so very glad I did.<br/><br/>This film is by far the best drama I have seen all year, and indeed was the best film of the 11 I saw at the festival. It is gripping, heart-wrenching, and opens your eyes to so many things. Don Cheadle -- who I am a long time admirer of his work -- is phenomenal in the lead role, and I hope that he is nominated for Best Actor this year, because he certainly deserves it.<br/><br/>I am recommending this film to everybody I know and I hope that it gets a wide distribution because it certainly is a film that needs to be seen. While comparisons can be made to Schindler's List, I think that this film goes further to show that events like the Holocaust can happen any time -- even now -- so long as people look away, just as the UN did in Rwanda. It certainly makes one think about how easy it is for us to forget our history and allow it to be repeated, because (as one character says) we will watch it on TV, say that it is terrible, and go right on eating our dinner. 10/10"

","I was fortunate to see it at the Toronto International Film Festival.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda starred Don Cheadle and was directed by Terry George. It's based on a true event, about Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu who worked at four star hotel in Kigali. When the war broke out he thought of only saving his immediate family but as he saw what was happening he opened the hotel to Tutsi and Hutus seeking refuge from the killing. He used all the favours he had stored as manager of the hotel and basically saved over a thousand lives. This will be the next Schindler's list. When the film was over, there was a standing ovation. Don Cheadle was excellent as an ordinary man forced to do extra-ordinary things. Paul Rusesabagina and his family attended the screening and he received a five minute standing ovation.

"anhedonia","8","50","59","16 February 2005"," A brilliant movie that deserved a Best Picture Oscar-nomination
","At one point in ""Hotel Rwanda,"" our hero Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) asks an American TV reporter (Joaquin Phoenix) how the western world could not intervene after seeing scenes of women and children being hacked by machete-wielding Hutu militia.<br/><br/>How could they not, indeed! As we all know, the west didn't intervene. Not surprising, really. After all, this was Africa and Rwanda had no oil reserves. The people being killed were innocent men, women and children, but they were poor and black.<br/><br/>A few years ago, former President Bill Clinton apologized to Rwandans for not intervening during the 100-day massacre that saw about one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus slaughtered in the most barbaric manner. It was gracious of Clinton, but a fat lot of good his apology did to the people who were killed and their families.<br/><br/>The Rwandan genocide - that's what it was, though western leaders split hairs over the meaning of genocide  also was a black mark on western nations, which simply got their citizens out of Rwanda and then remained indifferent to the senseless killings.<br/><br/>Terry George's film gives us one story about the Rwandan genocide, of one hero, Paul, a savvy, clever and cunning manager of a swank, four-star Belgian hotel in the capital, Kigali. When the massacres began, Paul, a Hutu, sheltered more than 1,200 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the hotel and saved them from the wrath of the bloodthirsty mobs.<br/><br/>Working from a smart script by Keir Pearson and George, ""Hotel Rwanda"" contains gutwrenching and emotionally trying moments not seen on the big screen since ""Schindler's List"" (1993). But whereas Spielberg's masterpiece was more arty and artistic - and I don't mean that pejoratively - George's film seems more immediate. Maybe it's because we now see a similar slaughter of poor, downtrodden people in the Darfur region of Sudan and, again, western nations aren't doing much other than threatening to rap the knuckles of the bad guys like angry teachers. This crisis gives ""Hotel Rwanda"" a sense of urgency.<br/><br/>As visceral as this film is at times, George handles everything in muted fashion. We never see the horrors firsthand. There's brief news footage of people being killed and one particularly searing scene when Paul and his bellhop Gregoire (Tony Kgoroge) find themselves on a bumpy road. The moment's made more horrifying because George unveils it quite matter-of-factly.<br/><br/>Making a PG-13 film about genocide requires numerous compromises. Putting most, if not all, of the violence off-camera is one such bargain George made. True, a closer look at the massacre would have rightly tortured us. But the film, nevertheless, works without gruesome moments. Pearson and George set out to make a story of heroism, survival, love and compassion amid the madness. And they succeeded.<br/><br/>Cheadle carries the entire film. There isn't a false note in his performance. For years, he's turned in one superb performance after another. He's one of those actors who never hits it wrong and whose performances always stand out even if the films themselves aren't all that memorable. Here, he's in equal measure the smooth manager, man with a conscience and frightened husband and father. You can sense Paul's frustration, though Cheadle rarely displays any vulnerability.<br/><br/>He gets great support from Sophie Okonedo as Paul's Tutsi wife, Tatiana, and Nick Nolte doing his best work in years as a Canadian United Nations officer, Colonel Oliver. Okonedo and Cheadle are utterly believable as a couple. They have one traumatic scene on the hotel roof, a quietly powerful moment that tugs at our heartstrings as we watch two people who love each other try to deal with what could happen. Okonedo conveys anger, fear and pain without ever turning the moment sentimental or needlessly overwrought. That's why the moment's shattering.<br/><br/>""Hotel Rwanda"" isn't flawless. George doesn't harshly indict the west for its indifference. Also, some scenes, especially one near the film's end, seem staged for obvious dramatic effect, to play with our sense of sympathy and dread. But minor faults can easily be forgiven because the rest of the film works so well, never sensationalizing any moment. The film's straightforward approach gives it more power, makes it more trenchant and meaningful.<br/><br/>I would like to believe that we learn from history and the more powerful western nations will always come to the aid of oppressed people everywhere. But we're doing little in Darfur and although President George W. Bush openly touts his vision to spread liberty and democracy to oppressed peoples everywhere, I doubt he actually means it. After all, this freedom doctrine was something he created only after his initial justification for waging an unjust war - Iraq's supposed stockpiles of WMD - proved to be wholly without merit or fact. I doubt he actually considers bringing liberty to places like Zimbabwe or Burma. He speaks of the need for people to be free, conveniently ignoring some dictatorial nations - Pakistan and Turkmenistan, for instance - because they happen to be our allies. And so the dumb foreign policy continues.<br/><br/>I can only hope the success of ""Hotel Rwanda"" will prompt other gutsy screenwriters and filmmakers to tell us more stories about the horrors that took place and the complacency of industrialized nations that could have helped and chose not to."

","I'm a college freshman at a small school in New York taking a class on the individuals role and responsibility in community. We read the book ""We'd like to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families"" about the Rwandan genocide and then went to see this movie. It is very accurate about what happened but reading it is just not the same as seeing it, it seemed horrendous always but when I actually saw the movie it was just... Jesus... it's so hard to believe that this happened and that this could. The film was excellent in both execution and portrayal. Everyone must see this movie and know we are all human beings and it is our responsibility to be there for each other. Jesus Christ... this can not happen."
"bob the moo","Null","18","25","31 March 2005"," An imperfect film but still a devastatingly emotional one that cries out to be seen (mild spoilers)
","In 1994 tensions are high in Rwanda between the ruling Hutus and the Tutsis rebels while the UN tries to broken a peace agreement. This is of little interest to Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu with a Tutsis wife whose position within a leading hotel means he has to curry favour with many officials and smoothing over any potential problems at every turn. When the Hutu president is assassinated, a massacre of Tutsis begin  adults and children alike. With the UN unable to take action due to the indifference of the West the murders continue and Paul finds himself with a hotel, evacuated of important whites but full of Tutsis refugees as the Hutus seek to finish the job they started.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure how one can review this film with a clear mind because no matter how good or bad a film it is, it is near impossible not to left shaken by the events it depicts. The plot follows the story of Paul Rusesabagina, who pulled all the strings he could to protect the Tutsis refugees who wound up in his hotel during the genocide by the Hutus. In this regard we are given a way into the atrocities through this specific story and this is both a strength and a weakness in the telling. The strength is that it gives us a focal point and a point of emotional connection that we can relate to and see a human face in the way that the terrifying numbers do not. However the downside of this is that it makes the story smaller than it could have been and puts the scale of atrocities outside of our direct view for the majority. It also means that it produces a ""happy"" ending that leaves you with a sense of some respite (not to mention the obligatory ""African"" song). This was a problem for me because the film had succeeded in gutting me at points and I didn't want to be left with any upbeat note  I wanted to go away feeling just like the foreign photographer did; ""f**king ashamed"".<br/><br/>However considering what the film does well, it is petty and unfair to make a bit issue out of the fact that the narrative is occasionally a bit clunky and perhaps that the depiction of the genocide doesn't go far enough. Even without graphic violence and more than one scene of actual horror the film still sickened me to my stomach, had me almost shaking with anger and fear while at the same time failing to prevent tears rolling. Like many viewers I knew little more than a genocide occurred and couldn't have told you which side was killing the other  this is not ignorance on my behalf but just the fact that the West ignored this and stood by while it occurred while the media gave it little or no coverage. The film depicts this very well giving us enough horror and enough human emotion mixed with an understanding of the West's attitude to produce an impression of an event that is indefensible and truly, truly horrific. The characters are quite broadly painted but they do enough to give us an understanding of what occurred. While I do feel that the film could have shown more and been wider, the close focus on the hotel and the Rusesabagina's means that we are never far from understanding the true extent of horror and just how much of a reality death is  Paul does not discuss how his family will survive if the hotel is stormed, only how they will die in the least horrific way.<br/><br/>Matching the tone of the film are two performances that blow away everyone they were nominated with at the 2005 Oscars. Cheadle's accent in Ocean's 11 was the worst cockney this side of Mary Poppins but here he gets the accent and mannerisms just right and made me forget that he was an American. His character changes throughout the film and he copes with it really well, producing a character that is easy to get behind and provides a very human face to the story. Okonedo is superb and is almost impossible to watch without being moved to tears more than once. Nolte is effectively gruff although he is less a character than he is a symbol of how ineffective the UN was at the time. In a similar vein Phoenix is excellent in a small role although really I could have done with a few less starry cameos as they tended to distract from the main material. Outside of the lead two, the actors are not given as much to work with as the lead two but Cheadle and Okonedo are superb and match the emotional impact of the material.<br/><br/>Overall this is not a perfect film; it didn't quite go far enough and the focus on a small group tended to conceal the scale of the genocide. However this is a minor complaint because the film is devastatingly effective and is impossible to watch without feeling lost, helpless and utterly ashamed for our inaction. This is not an easy watch and will not be a fun night out for the audience but for many reasons it deserves as large an audience as possible."

","I attended the United States premier of Hotel Rwanda on November 3rd, 2004 in Philadelphia. I have never written a review for a movie before, but this movie was excellent and I am urging everyone I know that they should see it as well. <br/><br/>I lived in Rwanda in the summer of '04. I have read several books on the history of Rwanda and talked about the '94 genocide with locals in Rwanda and also with Rwandans living in the US. I am by no means an expert on the history or the country, but I do know a fair amount about it, which is part of why I am writing this review. <br/><br/>The movie was an excellent reproduction of what Rwanda is like and it tells the true story of one of the many heroes during that time. While it is a sad movie, it is also a story of hope. The portrayal of the violence was subtle and powerful, but not overly graphic. The movie focuses on the efforts of the manager of an upscale hotel in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda to protect the guests/refugees streaming into his hotel to escape the killing. The writer/directory (who spoke after the premier) said that he made an effort to get a PG13 rating rather than an R rating to ensure that students would be able to see this movie. <br/><br/>It is an important movie to see because it brings to life the hope and triumph in Rwanda. It also shows what the media did not show in '94 and is not showing in Darfur: The suffering of ordinary people who need help from the rest of the world. While governments repeat the phrase 'never again' yet do nothing, it is up to us to ordinary people to learn about these events and do something or make our governments do something about them. Please see this movie-it does not have the budget to launch everywhere and relies on word of mouth to generate enough interest to make it into every city."

","The madness one sees in this brilliant film is hard to imagine, yet it occurred in Rwanda. Terry George, the director, captures those terrible days in Rwanda in his film ""Hotel Rwanda"". Mr. George has to be commended for bringing to the screen a detailed account of a country in chaos. Working with Keir Pearson on the screen play, the director presents us with the horrors of what the country lived during the holocaust that befell Rwanda.<br/><br/>At the center of the story is Paul Rusesabagina, a courageous man who witnessed first hand the worst days of the Hutu rebellion and its bloody aftermath. This man alone was able to protect and to save more than a thousand Rwandans that clearly would not be around today, had it not been for his tremendous stand against people that showed no mercy, or wouldn't reason about what they were doing to their fellow citizens.<br/><br/>The performance of Don Cheadle, as Paul Rusesabagina, is worth the price of admission! This wonderful actor projects such an intelligence that it's hard to find in any American film released in 2004. Mr. Cheadle was right to portray this man; it was a role he was born to play. Mr. Cheadle got under the skin of the hotel manager and runs away with the film. It's hard to keep ones eyes from this commanding performance.<br/><br/>The rest of the mostly black cast is excellent. One must single out Sophie Okoneko, who plays Paul's wife with such dignity that she perfectly matches Mr. Cheadle's performance. Nick Nolte is fine as the UN Colonel trying to keep peace in a place gone mad.<br/><br/>Congratulations to Mr. George. With this film he touches us in more ways than we imagined. The unfortunate tragedy could well have been avoided if the international community would have intervened sooner, but obviously, it didn't even try until it was too late."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","14","20","27 March 2005"," Indisputably a quality film, Hotel Rwanda is nevertheless a little more Hollywood than I thought it would be
","The basic hurdle for the world to have more empathy with the macro issue of the horrendous massacre is the fact that the world is uninformed. Unlike the situation of Nazis and Jews, Irish Catholics and British Protestants or Crusade and Islam, the issue of Tutsi and Hutu in Rwanda has not generally been heard of by an average citizen of the world. In the movie, the reporter asks two women at the bar in Hotel Rwanda what tribe they belong to. ""Hutu"" says one, and ""Tutsi"", the other. The reported turns around and comments to his companion ""They look like twins to me"". That says a lot.<br/><br/>The film does educate us on the brief background of the local history, on how the Belgians used the Tutsi's to rule the Hutu and so since they left, the Hutu had been waiting for their chance to revenge. That is however just the bare backbone of the history, but we have not been brought to a deeper understanding of the bitter hatred that drove the Hutus to a diabolical genocide of a million Tutsi in 1994 as the world turned its back: ""the nations are united in their indifference towards Rwanda"" as Mr. Ebert aptly puts it.<br/><br/>Rather than being an epic on macro scale, Hotel Rwanda is a personal story (albeit a true one) on micro scale, about hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina's heroic efforts which saved twelve hundred hotel ""guests"" of Tutsi descent, including his own wife. This is a story told with high quality filming and yet one cannot help but come away feeling that it leans slightly towards looking like a Hollywood thriller. It would be gross injustice to say it's crafted and yet, the climax after climax of narrow escape and cliffhanging suspense does feel a tad Hollywood. It would be gross injustice to say that it's a tearjerker and yet one cannot help feeling traces of familiarity in the Hollywood style emotional pull. And there is considerable predictability, such as the sudden bumpy ride of the jeep in the fog would be easily discerned by a regular moviegoer as the signal for the next scene: a road strewn with bodies of massacred victims.<br/><br/>Oscar nominee Don Cheadle's performance as the circumstance-driven hero is deservedly recognized by the nomination. Nick Notle, who was wonderful in ""Clean"", puts in another great performance here as a similarly circumstance-driven hero in the U.N. peace keeping force Col. Oliver. The rest of the cast contributing to making this film a solid success includes Sophie Okonedo who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress as Pauls's wife Tatiana and Joaquin Phoenix as the reporter whose videotape of the massacre made the world pay attention. All told, Hotel Rwanda is a high-quality movie, but I can't agree with many comments hailing Hotel Rwanda as another Schindler's List."
"Bambikilled","6","10","14","6 June 2012"," See ""Shooting dogs"" instead...
","This is a good movie. That can't be denied. But it is also the polished PG-13 version of one of the most horrifying events in modern history. Every little bit of information about the Rwandan genocide, that can find its way to the knowledge of people, is of course precious, and for that I am happy that this movie was made and brought lights to the topic in a way that regrettably not even the actual genocide could do. BUT... (And this is a big BUT.) <br/><br/>This movie, has IMO never been able to fully depict the absolute horror of the genocide in Rwanda. It is not about the amounts of blood on the screen, nor the number of bodies in piles in the frames. It's about how you close up to the subject. And nothing in this movie makes me relive the anguish and emotional trauma which I felt when I was in Rwanda, some 8 yrs after the genocide. I have seen the scarred remains of a country trying to build itself up from the ashes. I've seen the mass graves, the Gacaca courts, the thousands and yet thousands of convicted perpetrators in their pink uniforms, working the fields. I have been to the survivors center and I have seen the thousands of skulls lying in N'tarama Church. What does ""Hotel Rwanda"" make me feel? Not very much. (As a note - I have also been to ""Mille Collines"". Which was a rather bizarre feeling, that luxury in the midst of poor Kigali.) This movie is just a little bit too detached from the reality as it was, to get to you in the way that the story of the genocide really does, if told in another way. Sure, I can see that people who have not known much about the Rwandan genocide, can get very emotionally affected by the movie, and I do too, of course. But, I still think that this movie makes a quite a shallow impression compared with other movies on the topic. Of course, I wasn't there when it actually happened, but when you have seen the mayhem after it with your own eyes, it's still different to when you haven't. <br/><br/>AND ALSO - the thing that bugs me the most is the fact that Paul Rusesabagina really isn't quite the hero the world seems to think him to be. Did you know that the man ""sold"" shelter to the refugees coming to Mille Collines? The ones with money got in, the ones without, didn't. So the people who survived thanks to Rusesabagina were mainly very rich. Of course it's good that they survived, but what about the ones with no money. Rusesabagina did good, yes. But is he a hero? No. The heroes were the families who hid their neighbors, the UN-soldiers who desperately tried to get word out to the the rest of the world and get military task forces in, but were ignored and left to see the slaughter with tied hands. The people who risked their own lives to try to save others. The soldiers of the RPF, who were the ones who stopped this madness. Never believe everything you see in a movie without trying to get the full picture. <br/><br/>No... if you are interested in this horrific but engaging chapter of modern history, and wish to know more about the shameful way in which the UN and the rest of the world handled the whole thing, I strongly recommend you to watch some other stuff. Like the best movie made about the Rwandan genocide: ""Shooting dogs"", which is much more likely to get you to understand the event in a more broad way, as well as give a much more deep emotional experience. ""Shake hands with the devil"" is a very well made TV-production about one of the true heroes from Rwanda 1994 - Roméo Dallaire. (On which Nolte's character in ""Hotel Rwanda"" was loosely based). There is also a very good documentary with the same name - ""Shake hands with the devil - the journey of Roméo Dallaire"". Also, there are some other movies on the topic - of which ""Sometimes in April"" is the best. I recently saw ""Kinyarwanda"", which was very good from some aspects."

This is not a film about the Rwandan genocide as is was, but a film about the events Paul Rusesabagina witnessed. He cannot help the fact that he didn't get to see much of the genocide and that he and his family survived in the end. Or maybe flat6 (the writer) thinks they should have just killed Rusesabagina off in the film, which certainly would have been more dramatic, but much less true. Also, doesn't this criticism mean that Schindler's List is a bad film as well? <br/><br/>Another writer, imdb-45 states that: <br/><br/>""The film gives no treatment as to the reason for the hatred between the two sects of African black people and concentrates virtually on a man's heroic attempt to save people in a hotel, many of which are would-be victims of the genocide."" <br/><br/>If I'm not mistaken, the reason for the hatred is actually clearly outline in a conversation between Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), Jack (Joaquin Phoenix) and a local African journalist. I mean I am no expert on the subject, but it seemed pretty clear to me (if that was the whole of it). Basically it was just like WW 2, based on race, an African holocaust so to speak (although less organized and without the concentration camps as far as I know).<br/><br/>The same author states that: <br/><br/>""there is an awkward product plug for Volkswagon that ruins a genuinely amusing moment. There are product plugs for several different alcohol beverages that don't quite feel right."" <br/><br/>Well, sorry but in reality people use product and brand names on a daily basis. So why not in a film? Because than it is advertising? If you recommend a brand of beer to your friends it is also advertising in a way, although on a much smaller scale.<br/><br/>Someone else, fooltank77, states that the film doesn't say what happened after the genocide. While that is true, it isn't a flaw. This is the story of Paul Rusesabagina and his family and what happened tot hem during the genocide. The rest is nothing of the films concern. Also, everybody who watches the news occasionally or reads the paper knows that it is far from peaceful down there even now. Do you need to have everything presented to you? Personally I felt that this was a very impressing and good film. The performances and the directing were great and despite the fact that the film didn't show much of the slaughter, it was emotionally unsettling enough. I was especially astounded by the fact that the UN did so little to help. I knew that there wasn't much interference, but the fact that there was virtually no help at all just goes to show that Africa is just too far away for the rich and distant countries to worry. I daresay that the events in the film made me almost ashamed to be living in one of those rich UN countries.<br/><br/>I feel that if you actually go to see this film and expect it to be an individual tale within a massive cultural slaughter, you will come to accept that this film has it's boundaries and doesn't show everything that happened before , during or after the genocide. Demanding that and claiming the film is bad because it doesn't give you everything there is, would be like saying Schindler's list is bad, because it didn't show the political situation in Germany in the beginning of the 1930's, how Hitler gained his power, what happened in Stalingrad, what Dr.Mengele did during medical experiments on Jews or the killing of the moffen-hoeren (women who had sex with Germans during WW 2) in the Netherlands after the war. My point here is that a film like Schindler's list doesn't actually have as much background info as is demanded of this film by some viewers. It is just that we (in the western world) now much more about WW 2 than we do of a distant African genocide. Also there is so much suffering when something like this occurs and one film can not show it all. All it can do is show us parts of the tragedy and maybe inspire viewers to try and find out more about it. Giving a complete picture of such a tragedy is like completing a puzzle. Bear in mind that this is only the first piecehopefully.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","This is a terrific movie. The performances are spectacular, particularly Don Cheadle. He deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the hotel manager. The movie itself is much more important than just entertainment value. Most people aren't familiar with the horrific events in Rwanda in the 1990's, but they should be. We tend to think that genocide is something from the past that just doesn't happen in today's ""civil"" modern world. The true story behind this movie proves just the opposite. With all the focus on the Holocaust in World War II and all the talk about ""never letting it happen again,"" the world as a whole failed the people of Rwanda miserably just a few years ago.

","Hotel Rwanda (2004) Directed by Terry George, is the great film of 2004.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, an African who has bought into the European ideal of the perfect life. He's the manager of a four-star hotel in Rwanda. He has a beautiful wife (played by Sophie Okonedo), handsome and healthy young children, a new vehicle, and a fine suburban home.<br/><br/>All this changes when civil strife erupts in Rwanda. When this happens the former colonial powers wash their hands of the problems, and the Rwandans are left to fend for themselves in an atmosphere of increasing violence and anarchy.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent and the story is emotionally gripping. Like Schindler's List, the film follows one man's attempt to save as many people as he can. Schindler and Rusesabagina were heroic, resourceful, and amazingly effective. However, as individuals, they could accomplish only so much. Outside intervention could have saved a million lives in Rwanda, but it was never forthcoming. The Rwandan genocide is one of the great tragedies of the 20th century. Hotel Rwanda brings this horror onto the screen and into our lives.<br/><br/>Addendum: Nick Nolte plays Colonel Oliver, the U.N. commander in Rwanda. This role is obviously based on Lieutenant General Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian officer who commanded the ridiculously small force of 400 U.N. soldiers. These troops were unable to do anything more than watch the genocide taking place before their eyes. General Dellaire's story is told in Steven Silver's film ""The Last Just Man."""

","''Hotel Rwanda'''is a very powerful and sad story showing the atrocities that happened in Rwanda in 1994,where almost 1 million people were killed in 100 days. The division of two groups, the tutsis and the hutus,made Rwanda's peace something to dream about. We see that all started when the Belgians gave power to the tustsis, because they had a fair skin and a complexion much more similar of the Europeans then the hutus. Even measuring the noses was a normal thing to do. Years after, the Hutus were the ones who stayed with the power and they wanted revenge by smashing the tutsis.<br/><br/>This movie shows the history of a man called Paul Rusesabagina and his courage during the war in Rwanda, when he saved the lives of over a thousand helpless tutsi refugees from a big genocide. Paul is a hutu, but his family is tutsi, another reason to have experienced the terrible things the hutus were doing to the tutsis.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo are both awesome in their roles, and Don should have won the best actor award/Nobel.<br/><br/>Ps: Jean Reno's cameo here."
"flat6","5","28","50","7 February 2005"," Too grave a topic to deal with in such a manner
","This is a 'negative review', and I'm having a hard time explaining why I'm dissatisfied with this movie. I'll do my best. First off, it is a noble effort  the fact that this movie covers this topic of the Rwandan genocide, attempting to bring it a wide audience, is something to be commended. In the contemporary clutter of brainless, feel-good movies, anything that tries to be somewhat responsible and serious is to be commended for effort alone. But dealing with a topic of this magnitude is a double edged sword: the movie has a responsibility to making the viewer feel 1 million dead.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it doesn't manage to escape the formulaic Hollywood feel-good story of the hero who wins out in the end. This typical treatment may be fine for other topics, but Rwanda was a real genocide, and this tragedy should not be treated as the playground of 'based on a true story' movies. <br/><br/>When there are 1 million people being butchered, I don't want to see the main character hugging his wife, telling the audience how much his family means to him. I don't want to see the obviously sanitized gruesomeness that won't revolt the typical movie-goer. And please, I don't want to see the many, many cheap and improbable just-in-time rescues. Not here. That's too easy.<br/><br/>I can see that in every other popcorn flick concerning concocted disasters befalling some typical hero. (This type of treatment has been cheapened by its predecessors, and it no longer genuinely reaches the audience - or at least this member of the audience.) Something truly original was needed here, a delicate mix between the irrationality and inhumanity of the conflict. Instead, it let just a little bit of Hollywood formula creep in, and for Rwanda, that is unacceptable. Despite its excellent attempt, the movie fails. <br/><br/>Perhaps not surprisingly. This movie sets a huge expectation for itself by dealing with such a gruesome, REAL event. How do you condense into 2 hours something that no one can even begin to grasp, understand, explain? But the difficulty of its task still doesn't rescue this movie, because effort marks can only go so far. Even the slightest bit of over dramatization and the show cheapens  the lovely tale of the hotel manager falls apart, and the figure of 1 million dead reappears. It turns Hotel Rwanda from an attempt to make one understand and appreciate this bit of history into a gimmicky, easy-to-swallow portrayal of the genocide of 1 million people. Hotel Rwanda isn't gimmicky, nor easy-to-swallow, by any USUAL set of standards, but just dealing with the Rwandan genocide raises the standard to an impossible level. Not surprisingly, the movie can't reach those impossible standards; I don't know that anything this side of an excellent documentary can."

I really hope this movie wins an Acadamy Award all in the movie were amazing and did an amazing job portraying the seemingly hopeless situation they were in.

","Sentimental dramas are not my thing, but after the good reviews that Hotel Rwanda has been winning itself; I figured it has to be worth a go, and it was; but that's all it's worth. For a film that's supposed to 'stay with you' and 'leave an impact'; Hotel Rwanda is a huge disappointment. There isn't much in this film that wouldn't be able to be took from a documentary on the subject of the plight of Rwanda; but it has to be said, in spite of this, that Hotel Rwanda balances it's story with the human drama rather well, as not too much time is ever spent on either. The film can easily be likened to a disaster movie, as it gives two sides of a story - one being a terrible happening and the other being the effect on the people involved. This likeness continues when you come to realise that the protagonists are totally uninvolving characters and the only reason that the film gives you for feeling for them is the fact that they're the leads. Hotel Rwanda will get praise from some people because it's based on a true story, but this film fan isn't as easily impressed as many evidently are.<br/><br/>The film is very well put together, with the acting, direction and production values all being very classy examples of how good each can be. The story takes in themes of the futility of war, love for your fellow man and, of course, the race divide (another reason for the good critical reaction), and it has to be said that all of these things are done well, and even quite potent at times. The film is also notable for avoiding many of the pitfalls that befall most dramas of this nature - things such as over the top sentiment or long, heartfelt speeches. While the film definitely has an underbelly of sentiment, it never sees fit to fully expose it; and that is always a good thing in my opinion. The film is keen to give glimpses of it at it at times, however, and these moments tend to be cringe-worthy. The ending is a prime example of that; and despite the fact that this is based on a true story and that's simply 'how it ends'; the film could have handled it better, and then I wouldn't have left the cinema feeling like I'd just been slapped in the face after spending two hours of my time on the film.<br/><br/>On the whole, Hotel Rwanda is a long shot away from being a 'bad' film; but it's not a great film either, and the lack of sympathy for the characters will make some people feel like they should have watched a straight documentary instead. Many have, and will continue to be seduced by the racism theme and the fact that it's based on a true story; but not me, and hopefully not you either, as there's more to a great film than just that."
"Chris_Docker","8","8","12","2 March 2005"," Making a film and a contribution to humanity
","I usually say my criteria for assessing a film are asking myself if it inspired, educated or entertained me. I somehow don't seem to have a category for 'it totally devastated me'.<br/><br/>Nearly all the main characters are based on real life people  very real. One of the problems we have in coming to terms with the ethnic destruction of a peoples we have no knowledge of, have little culturally in common with, have little to identify them as 'people' other than a biological acknowledgement is that, for us, they are not very 'real'. So is the point of a film about the Rwandan genocide that left a million dead that they become more real? Does that make any difference? One of the results of going to see this very powerful, very harrowing (and in terms of the personal integrity and bravery of some central characters, very beautiful) film is that part of the proceeds go towards helping the people who are left. Another, perhaps, is that by becoming more aware of suffering our desire to find a way to avoid or alleviate it increases. The film shows a divide between - on one hand - the Rwandan people who, rich or poor, had sensibilities much like you or I, - and on the other hand - the troglodytes that wanted to kill each other and (with a logic reminiscent of President Bush's ""if you're not with us you're against us"" simplistic attitude) anyone who didn't join them. The inclusiveness of the carnage and the inability (or unwillingness) of the West to help meant there was no get out along the lines of 'if they want to kill each other let them'.<br/><br/>The performances are so spellbinding that it is hard to watch the film without feeling the suffering of those involved. Although it points the finger at a reluctance of the West to get involved, we also have to ask ourselves that, even if the powerful governments or the UN were willing to get involved, could the carnage have been prevented? The lack of any well-structured hint at a potential solution is perhaps one of the (very few) flaws of the film. Similarly, the swiftness of some of the events makes historic sense but there is not always enough detail to explain why things happened the way they did. But it seems clear that some intervention could have at least reduced a large amount of the carnage, so in a way Hotel Rwanda is a protest against international apathy.<br/><br/>The official website of the movie provides much in the way of reference material, links and analysis. This helped to confirm my view while watching the film that those involved felt that there was something more at stake than being film stars. In doing so they have become true stars, irrespective of what awards were won or not."

That is the question that South African Paul Rusesabagina faced ten years ago when the Hutu militia hunted down its Tutsi citizens determined to wipe out these 'cockroaches'.<br/><br/>Rusesabagina (played beautifully by Cheadle who deserves an Oscar nomination) is a mild-mannered yet savvy businessman who works as a hotel manager in Rwanda in 1994 who has put on blinders to the unrest in his nation that suddenly sets its all-too-true reality in his neighborhood one night when he witnesses one of his neighbors being dragged bodily from his home by a jeep of Army soldiers and then beaten when he resists. Life as he knows it is now over as this is the tip of iceberg to what events lay in wait.<br/><br/>Determined to save his small neighborhood and his family l Rusesabagina maneuvers one of the hotel's van shuttles crammed with his friends and family to the Hotel Demille where he works as a refugee site. Shortly thereafter the hotel is inundated with scores of fleeing Tutsis seeking solace and Paul must then decide what can be done to keep the bloodshed at bay. <br/><br/>On hand is the UN soldiers led by Canadian Col. Oliver (a world-weary Nolte doing some fine supporting work) who informs Paul that things are only getting worse for the most part and as predicted the black South Africans will not be rescued leaving the ingenuity and quick thinking of Paul to keep things on track until they manage a form of escape.<br/><br/>Director Terry George racks up the suspense and dread without resorting to any truly graphic images of the war at hand and the uprisings depict the machete brandishing hordes at a safe distance yet there is no doubt of just how horrific the proceedings at hand are in some truly unnerving moments including Paul's decision to get supplies in the dead of night when he encounters what he fears the most  that things in fact are only worse than he could have ever imagined.<br/><br/>Cheadle, one of our finest and most versatile actors working today, gives his portrayal of a decent, ordinary and extraordinary man that many of us would only aspire to be in the face of death and the threat of violence so thick in the air it would more than likely only cause paralysis to contemplate a next move in a morbid game of chess  a dignity that encompasses the entire film and spread to his co-stars, namely the stoic Okonedo as Paul's wife Tatiana who also provides some soul and tenderness yet a stern anger fueled turn. <br/><br/>Inevitably there are comparisons to ""Schindler's List"", ""The Killing Fields"" and even ""Casablanca"" yet the film stands alone in its defiance to what mob mentality is about and how prejudice is much deeper than what is on the surface. This is one of the most inspiring, harrowing journeys into fear and is one of the year's very best."

"rogerdarlington","Null","4","5","6 March 2005"," Movie with a message
","Like most ethnic conflicts around the world, the divisions in Rwanda between the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsis have long antecedents, in this case the invasion of the Rwanda highlands by the Tutsis from Ethiopia in the 15th century. However, it was Belgium - who ruled the country under a UN mandate from 1918 to 1961 - who institutionalised the discrimination by favouring Tutsis and introducing identity cards which specified the holders ethnic group. The spark which lit the tinder was the shooting down of the aircraft carrying the Hutu President on 6 April 1994. In the next 100 days, there was a ferocious outbreak of genocide orchestrated by the Interahamwe militia and sanctioned by the Hutu government in which around 800,000 mostly Tutsis were massacred while the world community failed to intervene. A decade later, a kind of collective guilt sees the release of no less than four films about these events, the most high profile being ""Hotel Rwanda"" which garnered three Academy Award nominations.<br/><br/>Portraying death on this scale in a work of 'entertainment' almost demands that we observe the savagery through the prism of selected individuals and, in this case, Irish writer and director Terry George has chosen to use the real-life experience of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina and his family. Rwanda is often called 'Le pays des Milles Collines' (the Land of a Thousand Hills) and Paul worked at the Sabena-owned Hotel des Mille Collines, a four-star establishment in the capital of Kigali. A well-educated Hutu, he was married to a Tutsi and had three young children, so he was geographically and ethnically at the heart of the madness. Like a kind of Oskar Schindler, he used a mixture of simple bribery and his sharp wits, together with charm and even obsequiousness, to create a haven in the horror that enabled 1,268 mainly Tutsis to survive.<br/><br/>America actor Don Cheadle, who played a cockney fool in ""Ocean's Eleven"" & ""Ocean's Twelve"", gives a powerful and textured performance here which marks him out as someone who is going to become an A-list star, while able British actress Sophie Okonedo is his wife Tatiana (Tutsis are lighter-skinned and finer-featured), and it is such a change to see the leading roles in a movie taken by black actors. The fear and powerlessness of the hotel occupants - over a thousand men, women and children crammed into a 113-room establishment - is well created and sustained. The settings are very realistic, being largely shot in Johannesburg, and most of the technical and support crew were African. The focus of the action is the hotel itself and the violence is deliberately understated and left largely to the imagination.<br/><br/>While one does not wish to see killing portrayed gratuitously, this artistic decision runs the risk that a largely ignorant western audience fails to appreciate the true nature and scale of this machete-fuelled rampage of rape and murder but, this reservation aside, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is an important and worthy work that should serve as a political warning of the price of international inaction in the face of ethnic conflict. Paul Rusesabagina, now lives in Belgium with his family, and recently told the US ""People"" magazine: ""What happened in Rwanada is now happening in Darfur, in the Congo, in all of these places they are butchering innocent civilians. It is high time we know that a human life in Africa is as important as a human life in the west."""
"FilmOtaku","8","4","5","28 February 2005"," Excellent and emotionally devastating
","""Hotel Rwanda"" gives a first-hand account of the genocide that occurred between the two main tribes in Rwanda, the Hutus and the Tutsis. Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle) is the manager of a luxury hotel in the area that caters to the wealthy and to government figures. Outside of the gates of the resort, Tutsis are being killed by the Hutu militia, and though Paul (a Hutu) is married to Tatiana (Okonedo) (a Tutsi) for the sake of his family, he turns a blind eye until his in-laws disappear and the militia literally come to his doorstep demanding his cooperation and the surrender of his wife, children and neighbors. With the diplomacy that he has learned in his job he is able to barter with them, basically paying a great deal of money for the lives of his family and neighbors. Meanwhile, Col. Oliver (Nolte), who is with the United Nations, is trying to help the refugees and keep some semblance of order, but is forced to evacuate only the Caucasian residents of the hotel, leaving all of the Rwandans (both Tutsi and Hutus that are Tutsi sympathizers) to fend for themselves, which leads Paul to open the hotel to over 1,000 Tutsi refugees. There they try desperately to get out of the country, and ultimately, survive since the Hutu militia is now targeting any sympathizers as well.<br/><br/>From about fifteen minutes into ""Hotel Rwanda"", I was pretty upset, and that feeling didn't go away once. Don Cheadle is incredibly good as a conflicted hero. Many comparisons have been made between this film and ""Schindler's List"", but if there is a way to rate levels of heroship, Paul Rusesabagina as portrayed in the film is pretty high up there. He is repeatedly given the chance to escape unharmed, but never gives in, a big turnaround from the beginning of the film when he first turned a blind eye, then became a reluctant hero. Cheadle captures this complicated figure brilliantly. It's not just the superficial coups that he achieves (flawless accent, etc.) it is the subtle strength he gives the character. His character may not be a beloved singer or a good impersonation of someone, but the strength of his performance should have given him an Oscar, not just a nomination. (Though I am glad that he at least got that much.) This is the first film that I have seen Sophie Okonedo act in, and she also extremely good. She quickly shows that she is more than a pretty face, and her strength and mettle are admirable, while experiencing the worst atrocities first hand.<br/><br/>As a film, ""Hotel Rwanda"" was not manipulative emotional. Under Terry George's direction, it felt at times like a documentary because it was truly an unblinking look at a terrible and shameful time in history. Though I had heard about the genocide, I was not fully aware of the ""reasons"" for the war, and as completely ridiculous as they were, the film is excellent at providing us a lesson in recent history without commentary. As far as I can tell, this is a pretty level look at the conflict and while it was incredibly emotional, it was not preachy. While I mention that it had an almost documentary feel to it, which is not to say that there were dramatic moments. One moment in particular where I literally felt like I was going to be sick was when Paul (in what was probably his defining moment) encounters literally hundreds of dead bodies on a road that he and one of his hotel employees are traveling. Having said that, however, even a moment like this one was managed with care and subtlety by George.<br/><br/>I was telling some co-workers about the film and its emotional impact and a couple of them who hadn't seen it went, ""Gee  that sounds too depressing for me"". ""Hotel Rwanda"" is certainly not a cheerful film, it is a film about a conflict that ended the lives of one million people in a matter of months while most of the world turned a blind eye. But it amazingly ends on a note that did not make me want to find the nearest closed garage and turn on the car, and left me with a newly found understanding of something I had only heard about and until Saturday night, knew nothing about. ""Hotel Rwanda"" is not an easy film to watch, but it is really and truly an excellent film that should be seen, both for its impactful storytelling and for its command performances. 8/10 --Shelly"

Cheadle plays a hotel manager and a good family man caught up in the events leading to and ultimately transpiring during the Rwandan genocide in 1993.<br/><br/>The majority of the film takes place with Paul (Cheadle) and his family refugees inside the Hotel Paul is the manager of. The actual genocide that is the main plot device of the movie is given very brief screen time and the majority of the scenes dealing with it, is the aftermath of it.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix's character, a journalist does give us a quick look at a very distant and out of context shot of two Rwandan's murdering a young girl, but Joaquin Phoenix has very little screen time and as quickly as he came into the film, he is almost quicker out of it leaving Cheadle to occupy the screen on his own.<br/><br/>However, Cheadle has his family with him, most notably his wife, Sophie Okonedo who is the epitome of the word ""melodrama"", her prescence is one of many anchors to the film and she could have done with much less screen time as she only brings Cheadle down in the scenes she shares with him. Her emotions jump backwards and forwards in all of her scenes, it's as if she suffers from Bipolar disorder, having just witnessed a massacre outside of the hotel she is outraged and crying, then seconds later is laughing and enjoying a drink with her husband who is trying to romance her, talk about inappropriate, it's as if there is no genocide occurring outside of the Hotel, and for all the film portrays, there is not.<br/><br/>The next biggest flaw with the film was the decision to cast Nick Nolte, who is in my opinion a good actor, as long as he is playing himself (such as he was in Affliction), but this time he isn't playing himself, he is playing a composite of General Romeo Dallaire named Colonel Oliver, who has NONE of Dallaire's qualities as a human being. Nolte drags on with his dialogue and it is my opinion that he was most likely intoxicated while filming took place, he looks confused, tired and hung over the entire film, not exactly military material. He bumbles, is incompetent and gets drunk on duty, is this the film makers idea to make Cheadle a more effective hero? By disqualifying everyone else of the role? In 1993, 800,000 souls were murdered and millions of others died as refugees and instead of showing this and letting the world know, we see Paul and his wife enjoying cocktails with Colonel Oliver, while their countrymen are being murdered just outside their doors.<br/><br/>A mediocre film that suffered from hollywoodization, for an actually emotional film that deals with the tragedies in Rwanda, I would suggest seeing ""Shake Hands With the Devil"", a film that does not suffer from hollywoodization and will leave you questioning humanity.<br/><br/>Cheadle was good, the rest of the movie was not.<br/><br/>6/10"

","""Never have so many owed so much to so few"" - Winston Churchill.<br/><br/>I think this quote best describes the atmosphere highlighted in this magnificent film. What Paul Rusesebagina did to help the helpless Tutsis families by sheltering them in his hotel was proof that everyone of us can make a change for the better. The story is simply amazing and shocking at the same time - the feeling of regret and compassion was amplified by the fact that this movie was based on a true story. <br/><br/>Don Cheadle delivers an outstanding performance.His acting is flawless - he manages to actually bring the viewer into the harsh Rwandian environment of the 1994 events. He skillfully points out the torment which Paul Rusesebagina faced! Sophie Okonedo also plays very well in this movie, masterfully playing the role of the determined and loving mother willing to do anything to save her children. Nick Nolte is superb in playing remorse haunted Colonel Oliver of the UN forces and Joaquin Phoenix does a great job on playing the character of Jack Daglish, the cameraman in charge to bring footage of the massacre. <br/><br/>What strikes me at this movie is the remarkable resemblance between Paul Rusesebagina and Oskar Schindler, two men who risked their lives to save other people and who, against all odds, succeeded in achieving this.Through their actions, they saved the entire world, saved it from forgetting the fact that we are all humans and a right to live on this planet!<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is superb and greatly deserves a spot in the Top 250! 9/10"

","'Hotel Rwanda' tells the story of hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who used his skills to save over a thousand people during the terrible events that happened in Rwanda in the early nineties. Tutsis were slaughtered by Hutus simply because they were Tutsi, while the rest of the world was looking away. The way the United Nations acted here is portrayed by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), the only fictional person in the movie.<br/><br/>First we learn about the way Paul, a Hutu, handles things in the hotel; he is a good manager, keeping the important customers happy with little gifts. They may come in handy later in his life. We meet Paul's wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), who is a Tutsi. Then the massacre starts and slowly more and more people try to hide in the hotel, protected by just a few UN soldiers who are not allowed to use their weapons.<br/><br/>In more than one way I was reminded of 'Schindler's List'. Schindler started to save people only to make money, but ended up caring for all of them. Paul's reasons are less selfish than making money, although at first he only wants to save his own family with the power he has. Paul also ends up caring for every single soul he can save. Both men stood up against a greater power with the risk of being killed. 'Schindler's List' is the better movie, mostly because it was amazing how it told a story about one man but gave us a strong impression of the Holocaust surrounding him. 'Hotel Rwanda' has some scenes that have that effect as well, but overall it feels more of a movie that plays on a smaller scale. Of course Steven Spielberg is also a better director than Terry George.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is very powerful and moving. Like I said, there are scenes that are close to unbelievable, showing once again what mankind is able to. Performances are helpful here, especially Cheadle does a superb job showing a smart man slowly losing hope. There is one complaint (one that also counts for 'Schindler's List') I have here. The people in Rwanda were not speaking English as their main language, but they were definitely not speaking English with accents. Maybe it makes it more realistic for an English speaking audience, it does not for most others. Just let them speak their original language or normal English. You didn't see the people from 'Gladiator' speak English with a Latin accent either and it worked just fine."

","Hotel Rwanda The true story of a man who saved over 1000 people (many of them very young children) from slaughter. Close to a million Tutsis died because the west didn't want to risk the lives of 300 of their own - these 300 people who have histories, families, loved ones, blah blah who were so much more important and valuable apparently. Instead of sending in the requested urgent intervention to protect over a million people marked for death, the west washed their hands of these people.<br/><br/>Based on the footage I have seen from various documentaries on the genocide, I believe that this film is an entirely accurate portrayal of what happened (except, of course, the language would have been French, not English). Filmed on site in Kigali, the painstaking attention to detail in the film made you realise exactly what it would have felt like to witness the situation unfold right before your eyes. I feel I can understand how it's possible to not see (or believe) something like that is imminent until too late. We all ""have"" these reassurances in the back of our minds that this sort of thing can't happen, that humanity won't let it happen, that someone in power somewhere will make sure this kind of thing won't happen. That surely it's someone's job somewhere to ensure this can't happen.<br/><br/>I watched this film with my friend Lucy, who was in Rwanda as an aid worker shortly after the genocide - she's even been to the hotel itself.<br/><br/>But what you realise is that, in reality, you really can be abandoned by the world, even if they know FULL WELL what's going to happen to you, even if they know FULL WELL that they'll regret not helping when they should have and be so very ashamed of themselves later. Humans seem to sometimes prefer to be ashamed later than to risk their necks in the now.<br/><br/>You forget you're sitting in a cinema - you are in Rwanda for those 2 hours. I felt a whole spectrum of emotions - I was scared, sad, horrified, angry, I felt the tension and relief for the characters at every turn, etc as the scenes unfolded.<br/><br/>Lucy said it best - we were both shell-shocked when we came out.

","2004, at least late 2004, may turn out to be the greatest period of cinema in the last 20 years at least. With the brilliance of such films as Million Dollar Baby and Finding Neverland and this heavy hitter but sadly under rated Hotel Rwanda. How does a film like this not get nominated for Best Picture by the Academy? Hotel Rwanda is the true story of Hotel Manager Paul Rusesabagina during the most turbulent time of Rwandan history. The two warring factions the Hutu's and the Tutsis are almost reaching a peace agreement when the Rwandan Presient is assassinated. Paul is big time businessman who spends his time making top connections in the event he needs to call in favors during war time. When war breaks out, Paul finds himself involuntarily harboring refugees in his hotel. As he is gradually immersed in horrifying images and war crimes against his own people, he stands strong and helps over 1200 refugees and saves their lives.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle is amazing, he's always been a talented actor but Hotel Rwanda will launch his leading acting career. His leadership qualities and his role is amazing. I must admit, I find the supporting cast, including his wife, played by Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, brief appearance by Joaquin Phoenix, and the hotel staff are certainly adequate but no one particularly stand out especially against Don Cheadle's role. But the cast really isn't what makes this movie a true astonishing film. It's the writing and the film making and the story, combined with Don Cheadle's role. Terry George focus's on the true horror of the Genocide situation, and Paul's struggle to save his own family but not at the cost of everyone else. He is determined to not let anyone die. The scenes of the bodies are disturbing and will bring tears to your eyes, and you feel Paul's compassion for this people. This might not be a well remembered event but after experiencing Hotel Rwanda, you won't ever forget it. It's without a doubt one of the best pictures you will see this year!! 10/10"
"seaview1","Null","5","7","26 January 2005"," Hotel Rwanda honors a man who made a difference
","A decade ago, the country of Rwanda underwent a costly civil war which claimed countless lives while a whole world stood by. In the true story of Hotel Rwanda, one ordinary man took it upon himself to save as many people as he could even risking his own life and the lives of his family.<br/><br/>This hotel is a luxurious venue for travelers (mostly white) to spend a pleasant trip while attended to by the staff and its manager, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle). Ominous signs in the news and rumors point to growing hostilities between two ethnic groups, the minority and former ruling group of Tutsis and the majority group of Hutus. A militaristic movement among the Hutus begins to form even as an impending peace treaty is brokered. When one leader is assassinated, all hell breaks loose. This is civil war at its worst as the Hutus begins to attack and kill the Tutsis en masse. It is the beginning of a genocide that will claim close to a million lives as the United Nations does relatively little to intervene.<br/><br/>As the white guests are escorted to safety by United Nations troops, things grow desperate for those left behind. Paul starts to shelter a few people including his own family and then more refugees until over 1200 fearful souls seek safety in the hotel. In some instances, it is out of necessity that he take in people who have nowhere to go. Pretty soon he realizes that he must do all he can to save his people and himself. This means calling on favors and relationships with any and all who can help, and frequently it means the difference between life and death. There are numerous occasions where the military is ready to take the refugees away or execute them and Paul on the spot. There is stark evidence of the increasing atrocities as homes are burned and bodies litter the roads. Bribes and supplies begin to run short, and as the outnumbered UN forces return to escort only a limited number to safety, the rebels begin to descend on them and the hotel.<br/><br/>As a shameful, cautionary tale of what happened when the world ignored its most needy, Hotel Rwanda serves its purpose, but the main thrust of the story is the love Paul has for his wife and children and the determination to save them. The important thing is how he responds to the horrific events and how he must think his way out of seemingly impossible situations. It is truly remarkable how resourceful the real Paul Rusesabagina was in staving off doom.<br/><br/>As portrayed by Don Cheadle, we understand his thought processes and feel his pain. He never loses his humanity and compassion for his fellow man. It is a splendid job of acting. Ironically, Cheadle (who was not considered box office leading material by the studios) has leaped into the forefront of leading men for good after having spent most of his career in strong supporting parts (Bulworth, Oceans 11, Out of Sight). Sophie Okonedo is quite good as the wife who must fight for her family and support her beleaguered husband. Nick Nolte plays a recurring part as a UN officer whose units of soldiers are virtually powerless to help. Joaquin Phoenix has a small role as a news cameraman witnessing the beginning slaughter and Jean Reno has a good cameo as a hotel executive in France who proves to be a valuable ally.<br/><br/>Although, there was initial difficulty in securing financing for this project, director Terry George (who also wrote the screenplay with Keir Pearson) does not seem to have skimped on his visuals. The massive crowd scenes and evidence of mass execution are thorough and impressive. It is as if we are living a real life documentary about war. He does a nice job of contrasting the chaos in the countryside with the peaceful, relative calm inside the hotel. He also manages to balance the tension and terror with a few effective moments of honest humor especially with Paul's family-quite a feat.<br/><br/>While there are obvious similarities in theme to Schindler's List, Hotel Rwanda's protagonist is not only the benefactor, but he becomes a potential victim, thus raising the stakes. Even with a PG-13 rating compared to Schindler's R rating, this is no less compelling history and the events no less despicable. George does not have the directorial flourishes of Spielberg, but his film succeeds on an emotional level.<br/><br/>Although the subject matter may cause potential audiences to pause, those who want an intelligent, honest depiction of one man's remarkable acts of heroism amid an unthinkable tragedy will not be disappointed. It is a courageous film that teaches the audience about individual responsibility and choice. It is about one man making a difference for over a thousand of his countrymen amid the horror and chaos even as the world turned its back.<br/><br/>**** out of **** (every bit as good as the five Oscar nominated Best Pictures of 2004)"
"kipale78","5","7","11","12 November 2007"," I am sorry, but I disagree with you all.
","I saw Hotel Rwanda last night, 2 years after its release. I had heard a lot about it, and was expecting (as many people said) a new 'Schindler's List'.<br/><br/>I am sorry to say that a theme, even when so important and shamefully unspoken as the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, doesn't necessary make a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The cinematography was as ugly, televisionized and cake-like as possible; the characters weren't well developed. the movie was fairly acted, nothing more. (except for Sophie Okonedo, she was a real revelation).<br/><br/>But most of all, that terrible genocide is barely shown. And it is extremely cleaned up. Bodies here and there. Almost no blood. But the images that came out of that event in 1994 were way different and shocking. There were so many butchered corpses in the rivers that you almost couldn't see the water. They really used machetes to slaughter them. Children did it, under the use of drugs. This movie shows a sugary version of it all, and doesn't make you feel the terror and the horror of these days. By filming it so, this genocide seems almost accepted and closed. It has happened, that's it.<br/><br/>It probably made a lot of people feel shame for their ignorance, that is already something. Many probably documented themselves, thank god. Maybe some learned some more about Africa today. But this doesn't make it a good movie.<br/><br/>What a disappointment. What a missed occasion. I wish Kevin MacDonald (The Last King of Scotland) or Fernando Meirelles (Cidade de Deus) or someone of that level directed it. Not this TV-movie director."

","The only possible explanation I can think of for the high regard and score for this film is that people are reviewing the theme, or the intentions, rather than the movie itself. <br/><br/>I found the script incredibly puerile. I felt embarrassed for the actors having to say lines like ""How can people be so cruel?"" or Joaquin Phoenix exclaiming ""I feel so ashamed"" because a porter holds an umbrella over his head. <br/><br/>It was no surprise to learn that the writer, an editor, wrote it in his spare time, and had not written anything before. There are no rounded characters, only mouthpieces for the humanitarian message that the writers are trying to convey. <br/><br/>The story is decent enough, and there are some effective scenes such as a convoy of vehicles driving into an ambush, but all of these play better with the sound down. The dialog was more suited to a Steven Seagal action movie than a fact-based movie with serious pretensions. The director resorted too easily to slushy music to tell the audience how to feel. And the characters were paper-thin: the hero who loves children and animals, the angelic aid worker, the cowardly bad guys. <br/><br/>Given the subject matter, this review will probably come across as mealy-mouthed and uncharitable.

","British Co-writer, producer/director Terry George (The Promise '17) has certainly carved out a name for being a maker of films to give us cause to think. He's also capable of showing the un-show able without resorting to sensationalised cinema 'stylized' violence - in fact, his great control allows us to be horrified & moved to tears with a remarkable lack of explicitness. So effective is his approach, the viewer feels as though they were watching an unfolding documentary account. His performers give remarkably convincing portrayals, leaving no doubt that cast and crew all shared Mr George's passion for this tragic cause. Excellent production values ensure an involving experience without overdone visual CGI excesses - making all that we do see so convincingly real. Some have drawn comparisons to Schindler's List but, that was stylized Hollywood, where' Rwanda' is all raw soul - giving it a far more compelling believability. <br/><br/>Much of the world apologised for its inaction --after the event-- but only following certain serving personnel and press witnesses having publicly shamed them into doing so. This brings into question the true effectiveness of the UN - and the responsibility of the politically 'economic' heart of the developed world."

","While America was transfixed by O.J. Simpson and his low-speed chase in a white Ford Bronco, the worst humanitarian tragedy since WWII was taking place in Rwanda.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle excels as the Hutu manager of a Belgian luxury hotel who does whatever is necessary to save as many people as possible while a Hutu militia, largely incited by government radio, engage in an unrelenting slaughter of Rwanda's Tutsi minority. <br/><br/>Cheadle and the people he is trying to protect hold out in the hotel protected only by a small contingent of UN troops led by Nick Nolte, whose number one order is to avoid a firefight with the locals. Cheadle effectively balances diplomacy and bribery to keep the Hutu warlords out of the hotel and to buy precious time for him and his people to ride out the massacre. The film accurately portrays the total failure of the ""world community"" to take action that could have prevented the massacre of hundreds of thousands. <br/><br/>The UN and other organizations have detailed files and reports of this occurrence that can be read on line by anyone who is interested in this. In those files you will learn there was a similar incident there in 1970 that claimed 100,000 lives. They're real good at writing up reports after the fact, but they were useless in preventing or limiting this tragedy. That's essentially what this movie tells us as well."

Don Cheadle is a man of many faces. This was one of his most remarkable. The quiet dignity in the face of the unspeakable in order to provide safety for others. It was very different from some of his other roles, yet he inhabits this one a hundred percent. The Academy still owes his an award."
"lougadou","10","2","2","8 July 2017"," The darkest of historical moments, told brilliantly
","Grim subject matter aside, this is a jewel of a movie which I hope with every fiber of my being you will watch. Compassion, corruption, fear, violence, hate, love, integrity and honor are the highlights of this film. The world stands by while terrible things happen all the time. We have no choice sometimes. We're far away, politically disconnected, we feel powerless. The cognitive dissonance pounds our hearts at times.<br/><br/>What chimes in my heart the most about this movie is that this is actually the sole theme of the movie. It is not overpowered by moral preaching, it does coerce you into feeling anything specific, it's purpose is simply to allow you to feel SOMETHING about what is happening; whether it be yesterday, 1994 Rwanda, or today with Syria. It gives you a road map and empowers you. It's incredibly inspiring. Words cannot explain.<br/><br/>Sometimes, feeling something is the best you can do. Reflect, learn and try to be one of the good ones. Be a hero in your own little world. You do what you can do be good, at the cost of witnessing certain atrocities and being restricted in what you can do about it. Just do what you can, when you can. (I speak of the protagonist's role and not the world, in this particular situation, the world was most certainly not heroic) And sometimes, when you can do that, you may not know it at the time, but you become something bigger; a real hero. This is a movie about the dignity of fear, of monsters at every turn and above all else, it is a movie to help you define what it is to be a hero, a true real life hero. Not the MARVEL superhero kind, but those kind of people with hearts so big that they make you feel grateful to be human.<br/><br/>In the very midst of hell happening on earth, the protagonist, brilliantly brought to life by Don Cheadle, feels the events and makes small decisions. That is all. And you watch him. This movie makes the world feel it. The moment of it. The smallness he feels and the enormity of the world at the same time. You feel it. It's a pure sentiment distilled down to its purest form and that is the very premise of the movie.<br/><br/>Bad things happen, we try to be good, we try to be strong, we do what we can and keep our chins up. The beauty of being human is that you decide how to react to the world, in all its contrasting colors and beautiful madness, you too can find honor, valor, humility, integrity -- MEANING -- PURPOSE.<br/><br/>What a brilliant shining beacon of light this movie was.... despite being at the same time a grimmest saddest and most harrowing foray into the darkness of the human spirit. All at the same time. A true masterpiece.<br/><br/>I must note that the powerlessness I feel after watching this movie is a bit overwhelming, but it has sparked something in me. I am not very political, but my views have now been changed. I suspect the director and writer and actors would be pleased that I feel restless to go out into the world and do something good now."

","In the face of true human evil, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) stood up and said Not on my Watch. Cheadle plays the real-life role of hotel manager during the 1994 genocide of the Tutsi sect people by the Hutu sect majority. At the beginning of the film, before the killing starts, you learn that people were arbitrarily assigned to one of the two sects based on physical characteristics, which makes the killing even more unbelievable.<br/><br/>Hotel Des Milles Collines is the one place of refuge in the middle of mayhem once the genocide starts. Cheadle uses guile, tactics, stalling, bargaining, bribing, begging, every tool in his toolkit to try to save as many as he can. Reminiscent of Schindler's List, Hotel Rwanda shows what one compassionate man can mean to so many others' lives when he's the only one that can do anything.<br/><br/>Rusesabagina loves his family, and that is portrayed over and over again, especially in many heart-wrenching scenes with his wife when he tells her what she must do if death comes near them.<br/><br/>Tension, plot, great acting, despair. Nick Nolte is terrific as the UN peacekeeper leader who has guns but no mandate or authority to use them. Excellent acting by the evil General and the evil supplier. The way the Director Terry George portrays the carnage, especially the river road scene, will stay with you for a long time. <br/><br/>Genocide never makes sense, is never understandable to the sane person, but never has it been so palpably seen as in Hotel Rwanda. thankfully the Hollywood ending is actually true. If you have time, watch some of the special features where the real Paul Rusesabagina talks about the reality of that time.

It is open and honest in its depiction of the neglect the world showed by turning it's back on the situation. In its dealing of the situation, the film manages to construct hope and doses of humour amongst tense and frightening situations.<br/><br/>The acting is stellar, with Don Cheadle (Paul Rusesabagina) in the performance of his career providing true despair and emotion throughout the film. Sophie Okenedo as Paul's wife Tatiana is superb in bringing real concern and fear to the role. Even Nick Nolte surprised me in his characterisation of Colonel Oliver (real life: Romeo Dallaire).<br/><br/>In its depiction of the horrific event, the film deals with themes and issues including racism, family, politics, culture and religion. All these issues are dealt with in an honest and sincere way.<br/><br/>Although the film holds back on showing horrific scenes of genocide, it manages to draw much emotion from the audience, moving many viewers to tears (myself included). This is largely due to the actors ability and the structuring of the crucial scenes.<br/><br/>This is not a film for someone who wants simply to be entertained. This is not a film for the lighthearted. It is film for those who wish to become enlightened as to the horrific events of 1994. See this film for its historical benefit (as well as it excellent script and acting). This is the first (in my knowledge) feature film made about the event and those involved. The film has very very few flaws; it is a perfect depiction of the efforts of Paul Rusesabagina.<br/><br/>Much like its historical counterparts (Cry Freedom, Schindler's List and Uprising), it is an accurate and truthful representation of the events. However, if one thing should be said to make the film more powerful it would be to have included a little more (in the story) of the genocide and to tie up one (or two) loose ends. However, the filmmakers clearly made this film in the hope of telling Paul Ruseasbagina's story with the 'backdrop' / setting being the Rwanda Civil War. So it can be overlooked if this was the intention.<br/><br/>An excellent film!!! Kudos to all!"

Mel Gibson could use lessons from this director in how much more effective suffering can be conveyed when it is done with more subtlety and restraint so the audience is never numbed by tragedy, but rather is kept constantly feeling with the characters so as to even laugh with them at the occasional light moment.<br/><br/>The script may not be conventionally catchy in terms of original dialogue, but it allows the film to move well while presenting many of the characters (even some of the villains) as three-dimensional human beings.

"TheAngryBanana","10","2","2","25 February 2005"," A Humbling Experience
","For me, Terry George's Hotel Rwanda was easily the best and most memorable movie of 2004. It's difficult to call a movie about a terrible tragedy such as the Rwandan genocide of 1994, but in every aspect, this movie is excellent. Yes, the movie is one of the most upsetting pieces I have ever seen, but this is only an indication of the greatness of the Hotel Rwanda. The actors (especially Cheadle) are so believable in each of their roles, that it does not take long for the audience to take an interest in the main figures, their lives, and the lives of their friends and neighbors. This fact makes the suffering of those who witnessed and fell during the Rwandan massacre both on film and in actuality so much more real.<br/><br/>Also, much credit must be given to the director, Terry George. In a film revolving around an incidence of genocide (in which many victims were hacked to death with machetes no less) it would be easy for the story and tragedy to be lost amidst a depiction of the excessive violence that occurred. However, while there is obviously a good share of violence in Hotel Rwanda, George avoids excessive gore and instead relies more on fear to express the suffering of the refugees at Rusesabagina's hotel. George instead shows the aftermath of violence (hundreds of corpses covering a road), the threat of violence, and especially, feelings of alienation and separation (the abandonment of Rwandan refugees by the western world). All these elements really draw the audience in and force the viewers to feel the pain and suffering felt by the refugees.<br/><br/>The excellence of Hotel Rwanda also makes it a very humbling movie. It forces those who live in the western world to acknowledge the atrocities that resulted from their countries pretending a massive problem did not exist. Possibly the most depressing fact that Hotel Rwanda asserts is in the last image of the entire movie, where simple white words on a black background remind the audience that nearly a million people died during this period of genocide, a toll that may have been dramatically lessened had the world not turned its back. Thus, in its greatness, the movie is also very shaming, a fitting feeling given the words of Rusesabagina in the movie, ""we must shame them into acting."" More than once I was reduced to tears watching this movie, as were many other members of the (unfortunately) slim audience present in the theater. Truly, this is a movie that all should see."

Cheadle is gripping - this from a man who has played a wide range of roles from a porn star with an identity crisis in Boogie Nights to Sammy Davis Jr. in the Rat Pack - and he supplements the troubling story of the country's civil war and genocide with a flawless performance. I immediately wanted to research the Rwanda situation after I saw the movie to learn more than the little I already knew - it truly was a war fought for outrageous reasons, and the ignorance of the rest of the world (something the movie did well to convey) at that time is hard to imagine. I would give Cheadle the nod for Best Actor, and the movie is a must-see for people of all backgrounds. An amazing film."

","My husband and I saw Hotel Rwanda and were very touched by it's content. It is one of the most powerful movies that I have ever seen!! Since we saw the movie I have told EVERYONE that I talk to, to go see this movie!!(even total strangers) We had intended to see another movie but heard that it did not get good ratings. This movie deserves an A+!! My husband loves to watch the history channel so I knew he would be very interested in seeing Hotel Rwanda since it is based on a true story. I haven't seen ANY previews or promotions of any kind and had not even heard of it before we went. In my opinion, this movie should receive MANY Academy Awards and EVERYONE should see it!!"

","Under the security blanket of America, we tend to forget or ignore the destruction that is occurring throughout the world. We may catch a glimpse of the danger present in foreign countries, but we put it off as out of our control. Yet Hotel Rwanda shows the viewer the tragic consequences of inaction in the face of genocide.<br/><br/>The main character of Hotel Rwanda is Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who looks out for his family in Rwanda, and who stands as an innocent bystander in Rwanda's civil war between the Hutu and the Tutsis. The Hutu forces are on the attack, and although Paul is Hutu, he must take a stand to protect the Tutsis being persecuted. His wife, Tatiana, a Tutsi, does not face the situation as calmly as Paul, because she is very protective of her children. These two main performances are extremely impressive and bring a lot of the emotional power of the film as well as to the characters themselves. Supporting cast includes Nick Nolte as Colonel Oliver from the UN and Joaquin Phoenix as a cameraman who catches on film the atrocities of the occurrences outside the ever-crumbling walls of the hotel. Nolte does a very good job in his position of helplessness, but Phoenix puts in a far less-impressive bit role.<br/><br/>The screenplay, written by Keir Pearson and Terry George is very good, and the dialogue shows the strength of a few, the helplessness of many, and the evil of those who started executing innocent people out of their own selfish ambition. The film reminds us, albeit through simple direction, of the destruction of which we as human beings are capable, but it also shows us the power of love for others. Some parts of the film are so hard to watch and so emotional, that one cannot help but remember them vividly. The power of Gregson-Williams' and Guerra's score stands out especially in such scenes.<br/><br/>If only films with such heart could be made without flaw! Although the flaws are outweighed, in my mind, by the film's message and stunning images, they must be mentioned. As I alluded to earlier, the acting of those in smaller roles is below par. Also, there seemed to be a kind of alacrity of direction throughout the film, as if George were attempting to speed through the film. This does not take much from the film's power, but the viewer is left with little time to take in each specific scene in order to understand the movie as a whole. Further, the song played in the credits, ""Million Voices,"" seems poorly hashed together, so that the viewer cannot think to his full potential upon the film in all its intensity.<br/><br/>Ironically enough, the film's strength increases when we see that we too are in a sense responsible for the genocide in Rwanda, because we leave the theater still unwilling to take action to help the helpless. The film is sadly flawed, but incredible in its message and force.<br/><br/>Final Grade: B+."

","My wife and I watched this movie in Fremantle yesterday afternoon and although I had a rough idea about what I was about to watch, the actual movie was far stronger than I had anticipated. The producer, director and writer, Terry George, must be congratulated for bringing to the screen such a horrendous story and yet making that story palatable to the extent that it is nominated for Academy Awards in a number of categories. Beyond that I was struck by the deftness with which he handled the unthinkable through elucidating the reasons the civil war massacres were taking place-the anger that motivated the participants. So often writers leave the audience in complete dark as to these motivations for some terrible event-the perpetrators are: simply fill in the words-mad, evil, stupid, directed, etc. We disagree with the bloodletting but we have no reasons to account for it.<br/><br/>Georges decision to cast Dan Cheadle in the lead role was inspirational-Cheadle handled a demanding role so well that I thought I was watching TV footage or a documentary. All the actors were superb and all contributed to this total feeling of ""realness."" I could talk about every person on the screen but perhaps my favourite was Fano Mokoena who played the Huto general who maintained the hotel sanctuary. Beyond Mokoena was Nick Nolte's portrayal of a Canadian Peace Keeper-I love Nolte's work but this small role was one of his best.<br/><br/>Please see the movie-it's one of those rare movies that has so much light to shed on a piece of history people would rather not see."

But this one is so much more uplifting and entertaining. It's truly a human story that's so much more effective because it's true. You see the events mainly through one man's eyes.

The only other movie I can possibly think of to compare it to is ""Schindler's List."" This movie reminded me of why I go see movies.

The rest of the cast was very good in their parts, but I was disappointed in the bit part that Nick Nolte had in this fine picture. It is a shame to see some one so talented have his career go down the tubes because of a drinking problem.

"shattenjager777","8","2","2","6 February 2005"," A hauntingly powerful and focused film led by Don Cheadle
","*NOTE: I will point out all points where spoilers occur, so those of you who wish to avoid them can still get a critical opinion of the film from me, but I apparently must mark the review as containing spoilers, so I want to let everyone know that much of the review will still not contain spoilers*<br/><br/>The most noticeably excellent part of ""Hotel Rwanda"" is the performance of Don Cheadle, who gives a wonderfully subtle and complete performance. Cheadle is able to let us know much about Paul Rusesabagina that would be easy to skip through brilliant small gestures. (*SPOILER* Notice the way he discerningly watches the military men in the hotel before the genocide begins--we see what a calculating, thoughtful man Rusesabagina is before we have much of anything that can tell us anything about him. *SPOILER OVER*) Sophie Okendo, Nick Nolte, and Joaquin Phoenix also give wonderful supporting performances (especially a surprising Nolte), but none is given a significant amount of time to breathe, because the film is about Paul and it is VERY focused.<br/><br/>Many have said that the violence in this film is too little and thus distances us from the genocide, but there are reasons for this. First of all, the film is not really about the genocide--it's about Paul Rusesabagina, and it's focused on him nearly every second. Paul *SPOILER* only sees it when he and Gregoire are out running over bodies *SPOILER OVER*, and thus it cannot keep its focus on him without losing some violence. It also makes a point that the violence is too much for people--*SPOILER* Paul himself, Jack, and Roger are all rendered essentially mute when they see it: Paul has his emotional breakdown immediately after, Jack is silent while setting up his tape, and Roger is reduced to hiding scared silently, not even capable of telling his parents that it's not his blood *SPOILER OVER*. If the violence is too much for people to see, obviously we can't see much of it. It also makes the little pieces of violence we do see that much stronger that they are isolated.<br/><br/>The dialog is very real and yet intelligent and the direction quiet, not trying to force too much on the viewer. The film is also quite heavily without score, lending even more weight and realism to the events depicted. The wonderfully focused script keeps us identifying with and watching Paul throughout the story, keeping him in constant, very real danger. The film even manages to get the story of how the Hutus and Tutsis emerged into it without seeming terribly forced, by bringing in a news team (including Joaquin Phoenix, who is rather quietly building up a very impressive body of work) to cover the events.<br/><br/>All told, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a great film depicting a truly remarkable story of a man doing wonderful things in an almost unbelievably terrible situation. The acting is top-notch, the writing is superb, the direction is as good as one can hope for, and the story has a powerful resonance to the point that it makes one think again about what nations' obligations to the people of another nation are. In an excellent year in film (three films that I would rank in probably the top 25 I've ever seen came out in 2004), ""Hotel Rwanda"" is one of the standouts and definitely the most powerful film to come out in a long time. Don't miss it."

ButI kept asking myself while watching: Am I not related to all these people? Could I ever treat my fellow humans as cockroaches and vermin? How can people think of other people that way? If such a condition can exist in others, can it exist in me? If I saw human depravity around me, how much would I tolerate and wink at before I did something about it? And what WOULD I do about such things? Would I throw my hands up in hopelessness or would I find a way to alleviate pain and suffering? This movie is difficult to watch, yet it is important to watch.

","Ever since seeing a program on television about the circumstances of the Rwandan genocide, I have become somewhat of a student of the issue. And sure, the Interahamwe didn't kill as many people as the Nazis, or even Pol Pot, but the brutality of slaughtering nearly a million people, most by machete, more than makes up for the numbers. And the abandonment, the sheer disregard for anything African that the West perpetrated on Rwanda, that should make all of us ashamed of our governments.<br/><br/>You should see this movie. Everyone should see this movie. Exquisite performances by Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo bring to life the desperation of simply holding on to life with the proverbial barbarians at the gate (right at the gate, as it was), and all while Cheadle's Rusesabagina clings tenaciously to the image and prestige of his hotel, giving his best when everything else falls apart. How the real life Paukl managed to keep it all together, bribe the army, keep the militia at bay is nothing short of a miracle, and the cast brings that to you in such sharp detail that you can't feel anything but the utmost admiration and astonishment for everyone who kept it together.<br/><br/>Rusesabagina, General Dallaire, and many others are the true measure of hero. They gave everything they had to make sure that 800,000 didn't turn into millions."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Don Cheadle's Academy Award nomination for Hotel Rwanda is a well deserved and a wonderful thing. Hopefully it will encourage even more to see director Terry George's incredibly moving tale of the 1994 Rwanda crisis between the Tutsis and the Hutu. As with Schindler's List, nothing is more powerful than a real life hero. Paul Rusesabagina is a real life hero. With the slaughter of nearly a million right outside his front gate, Paul R gave refuge to nearly 1000 who surely would have died. The tour de force by Cheadle is with his divergent performance from the elegant Hotel manager to the smooth negotiator to the passionate husband, parent and humanist. This man cares about people and what is right. Although, Nick Nolte's performance was slightly askew, the movie is well paced and heartfelt and should be seen by many. Very powerful."

I haven't seen a performance like that in a very long time. He and Sophie Okonedo were both incredible. It was very moving. It's hard to not feel like something is wrong with a world where we can live peacefully in America and people are living that way in Rwanda... still to this day.

"Camoo","1","22","46","8 April 2007"," Embarrassing , Manipulative garbage!
","I was conflicted for about two seconds before deciding to give a film like this a bad review, a film that I really am a minority in since it was widely praised and reached by some miraculous flight to number 62 in the IMDb top 250. It's just a shameless and grueling piece of film-making, and I can't help but feel disgusted that the Rwandan genocide has been reduced and distilled by Hollywood into this. <br/><br/>The injustice is overbearing. As someone who was in lower Manhattan on 9/11, I resented Oliver Stone for making his swan song 'World Trade Center', another hand wringing piece of garbage that was so disconnected from the reality of the event it was laughable, which is terrible because the last thing you want is to see such an inaccurate reflection of events to where you are forced by the director to sneer and feel uncomfortable at a film about it. Believe me, people, there were no violins playing in Rwanda while this was going on. I appreciate how people are waking up to genocide and injustice in Africa and how Don Cheadle has taken his research from this film and gone on to bring tremendous public awareness to places like Sudan, but that is all I can give this.<br/><br/>For one, it does nothing to speak of the actual problems that led to the genocide in the first place, leaving an audience that might not know about the lead up to this story (and I do think the target audience for this film has no idea where Rwanda is on a map) to come to the conclusion that there is such thing as 'faceless evil', as arbitrary as some of the worst crimes humanity has ever encountered are, things aren't this simple, black-white, right-wrong. I think this kind of mentality has led the way for Bush's statements on 'good and evil' and 'evildoers' to be taken at face value, without questioning the social, political, religious, or moral conflicts that might have led to an act of genocide like this, or an act like September 11. I suggest instead of watching this film and thinking you have learned something about history, you pick up a book like 'The Graves are Not Yet Full' to understand the complex dynamics in Africa, dynamics that have led to generations being wiped out by ethnic cleansing and tribal conflict. I worry that a film like this closes out on a still ongoing argument, leaving the viewer with a feeling that even in the face of humanity's most vile action, 'everything will be okay' with people like Paul Rusesabagina around. This simply is not true. <br/><br/>This film made me viscerally angry. This wasn't simply a 'bad movie', I feel like it stepped over a personal boundary, my own human boundary and insulted me, and literally millions of other people that have to endure life's struggle as it's given to them. I watch this and I feel ashamed to only have to endure the hour and a half of this film, and that is the stark low point of my day. I feel ashamed to even afford a ticket to waste on this movie. It's watered down, inaccurate film-making at it's most manipulative point, and that is what makes me angry, not to mention Don Cheadle's embarrassing attempt to 'be African' while driving in carefully placed advertisements for Volkswagon. Really he is a just sheltered like the rest of us, a Hollywood movie star sucking in fat paychecks while there is real, not dramatized, suffering in the world just adds to the pain of watching the film. I saw 'Sometimes in April' recently and found this to be much more believable and affecting a film, I would recommend this well above 'Hotel Rwanda'. The realities are still out there, this is fantasy. I know this is harsh, but this film insults my intelligence as a film-goer and as a human being."

","There is no doubt that Hotel Rwanda is a brilliant and uplifting story; showing that what we (South) Africans call Ubuntu; caring for each other and assisting in anyway possible simply because we are all human and it is our fellow humans that make us who we are . I always liked Don Cheadle but his performance in Hotel Rwanda made it clear that he's one of the most underrated actors - The Brother is Brilliant! His performance in the movie is outstanding to say the least. He literally carries the movie on his shoulders. Sophie Okonedo (Cheadle's wife in the movie) gives a great performance. Nick Nolte and Joaquin Phoenix are also brilliant. There some brilliant visual moment in the movie, for instance when the UN trucks are ambushed when trying to transport Tutsi refugees for the time and when the military rescues the trucks the second time the mission is taken. There are brilliant shots and brilliant acting.<br/><br/>However, I have a couple of concerns (to put it mildly) Well, I appreciate that I do not know or understand the reasons for the director and producer's decision to do and use methods that I'm about to question. However, as junior director in SA who hopes to be able to tell African stories to the world at some point, I'm very concerned. Firstly, the story is based in Rwanda however, South Africans make up what appears at least 70% of the cast that has dialogue/lines in the movie. This is of course great for Our industry as Our actors are getting exposure and experience. The problem however, is that they have South African accents when they are supposed to be Rwandan; Fana Mokoena (although his performance was great,) only remembered to have an accent towards the end of the movie - same goes for Desmond Dube! Yes an accent might not be a big deal but language is an important issue; it helps the local audience identify with the characters and gives the characters a sense of originality. Yes, the international audience might not be as aware of the differences between a South African and a Rwandan accent but South Africans and Rwandan's know and I feel that it is not fair to them (Rwandans). I don't understand why they couldn't use Rwandan actors….<br/><br/>There are one too many mistakes that again ruin the sense of originality, such as the use of English; it's used way too much! Yes this was made for an international audience but speaking from a Black South African's point of view whose first language is not English, there are times when you don't use it: when you've just been rescued from death by someone who understands your language, you'll thank them in that language! Especially with relatively old extras - I know for a fact that those in rural areas don't speak English to you if can understand their language they are more concerned about preserving languages that are being taken over by Western languages<br/><br/>What got me annoyed is that there's a scene featuring a red taxi in front of The Hotel and the taxi has a big yellow Alexandra (Johannesburg, SA) Taxi Association sticker on one of the windows - so what, do Rwandans have Alex taxis, we just didn't know about it?! What got me fuming are the names of the children displayed on boards at a refugee camp; Thabo, Buhle, etc. For crying out loud these are South African names! Again, someone from Canada might not know the difference but what does this imply to Rwandan's; that yes, this amazing story will be told but they'll be watered down as much as possible?!<br/><br/>This annoys me because I believe that if one is to tell a story about a people, one has to do it right; in every sense of the word. What is the point of saying one is telling a South African Story then bring a whole American cast and props? I felt that I had to make an effort to convince myself that the story is based in Rwanda when watching the film because there are so many things that suggest otherwise. I guess this is another important sign (as in Amandla) that if we as Africans want our stories told and portrayed as real and true as possible, we have to do it ourselves.<br/><br/>Having stated my concerns, I still say big ups to Terry George and the whole production team for telling this amazing story. And, absolutely Don Rocks!<br/><br/>Asania Nkate Aphane Jozi"
"howard.schumann","9","5","8","18 April 2005"," A moving and powerful film
","Just over ten years ago, Rwanda, a former Belgian colony the size of Vermont, became a horrific killing field, the result of ethnic, social, and political hatred between the majority Hutus and the rival Tutsis, the former ruling elite who ran the country for the Belgians and treated the Hutu as second class citizens. The Washington Post reported ""how the heads and limbs of victims were sorted and piled neatly, a bone-chilling order in the midst of chaos that harked back to the Holocaust."" The massacre that claimed over one million lives was triggered by the still unsolved assassination of Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana, whose plane was gunned down by missiles on his return from a conference in Dar-es Salam. Senior Hutu leaders used the downing of the plane as an excuse to exterminate Tutsis and moderate Hutus. While the UN maintained a peacekeeping presence they did not intervene, nor did the U.S., France, Belgium or other Western powers who had the power to stop it.<br/><br/>In the Oscar-nominated film Hotel Rwanda, the atrocity is dramatized through the story of the determination of one man who sheltered over 1000 Tutsis including his wife (Sophie Okenado), a Tutsi woman, and his children. Don Cheadle portrays hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina in a towering performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Rusesabagina, who served as an adviser to the film, managed the Belgian-owned Hotel Mille Collines in the city of Kigali, a luxury hotel where UN dignitaries socialized with Western diplomats and media. As homes are invaded and bodies pile up, people are forced to leave their homes and seek shelter in churches, schools, and in this case the luxury hotel.<br/><br/>As the sounds of fighting outside increase, the White guests are forced to leave and the remaining Africans are left to defend themselves with the token aid of the UN peacekeeping force, led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), who is faced with an insurmountable task. With supplies of food and water diminishing and the violence increasing, Paul pleads with his guests to telephone the outside world in a plea for help but with scant results. The comment by an American journalist about the value of airing a segment explicitly showing Hutus hacking Tutsi civilians puts it into perspective: ""They will go  'O God, that's horrible!' and then go back to eating their dinner."" <br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda allows us to see the conflict in human rather than political terms and Paul's loving relationship with his family is believable and deeply affecting. Though scenes of gory violence are kept to a minimum earning the film a PG-13 rating, the scene showing Paul and his assistant Gregoire driving through fog and discovering hundreds of bodies of slaughtered innocents lying on the road, stands out for its understated horror. Though not justifying the massacre, more historical background would have been helpful such as knowing the role of the Belgian colonial authority in fomenting ethnic division in the country, and the 1990 invasion of Rwanda by the exiled Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front with the support of the Americans and the British. While Hotel Rwanda may fall short of greatness, it is nonetheless a moving and powerful film, an unflinching indictment of the political extremism that fed the turmoil, the indifference of self-satisfied Western nations, and the courage and tenacity of one man who made a difference."

","""Hotel Rwanda"" is a docudrama which tells the true story of a hotel manager (Cheadle) who, at his own peril, provided safe haven and protection for about 1000 refugees fleeing the Rwandan genocide of 1994 when 800,000 people were killed in a three month civil war. As is often the case with films which are built around compelling subjects such as holocausts, the import of the subject rubs off on the film elevating it's importance. Such is the case with ""Hotel Rwanda"", which is well crafted though it offers nothing new, conforms to the Hollywood playbook, and is probably slightly over-touted. The film spares the audience much of the bloody horror of the genocide with its PG-13 rating while doing a good job of building suspense and imparting a sense of the magnitude of the slaughter of innocents. Didactics are worked into the story so it is not difficult to follow even though the good and bad people are all black Rwandans. Those interested in the 1994 Rwandan genocide might also want to check out ""Sometimes in April"", a 2005 TV drama about the genocide which offers a somewhat broader perspective. (B)"

But, with 'The Hotel Rwanda,' the intensity delivered by director Terry George and the powerful performance by Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, this film was able to put the shock into people in a much more disturbing and intense way than I had ever seen any other movie do and leaves you silent and just as helpless long after you've left the theater.<br/><br/>The Hotel Rwanda refers to the Belgium hotel that, under Rusesabagina's unexpected direction, served as a refugee camp for the Tutsi people who were being wiped out by Hutsi rebels in Rwanda. On the one hand, this movie shows you the kind of atrocities that could result if one faction controlled the media (the Hutsi's here controlled the radio waves and incited their violence and recruited their followers through a propaganda radio program). On the other hand, Rusesabagina is such an extraordinary heroic figure where he tried desperately to save people from the slaughter when it seems that every government that could help denied assistance to the Rwandas. Even where journalists were able to enter the country before the worst fighting began and report the massacre. We ought to be made aware of these things, and we should never ignore them, and never forget them.<br/><br/>I am still amazed by the powerful emotion that this movie is able to invoke, to nearly lose your mind in desperation when it seems like there is going to be no hope left for Paul, his family, or the Rwandan refugees. To become nearly violent when anger when you their holocaust, but the other countries refuse to help.<br/><br/>And, actress Sophie Okonedo, who plays Tatiana Rusesabagina, likewise gives an incredible performance as Paul's wife. <br/><br/>This IS the Best Picture of 2004."

And then we would turn off the TV sets, take dinner and go to sleep. The movie shows the attitude of the world when mass killing is being done in Africa in the communal riots between Hutus and Tutsis. The protagonist, ""Paul"", who is a Hutu himself, is just like one of us for whom his family (which is Tutsi) is the most important. In the beginning he would do anything to save his family and would not even bother about his good neighbour. But slowly as he sees what is going around him he starts to realize. He takes up the responsibility of giving shelter to thousands of refugees in his hotel. He keeps giving bribes to the Tutsis leader. He even speaks to so many influential people around the world. And although he had a lot of difficulties convincing the world powers that they should interrupt, he ends up saving lives of about 1200 people. It is not a feel good movie or anything like that. It is a true story about Survival and Will Power. If you liked Schindler's List, the this may be a notch above but not less. Buy it! http://www.schoolofsymphony.com"

","For a while now, there have been uprisings in Africa, most of the time, it is quite violent. In Tears of the Sun starring Bruce Willis, the problem in Nigeria was put into perspective. It was shown through the eyes of the US military trying to rescue a couple of select people but end up bringing back refugees. Hotel Rwanda takes a different path, shown through the eyes of those under attack.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda is based on a true story out of Rwanda, Africa. It is a country gripped by war and oppression. When a four-star hotel is now thrown right into the mix of things, manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) has to make a very important decision. He must decide whether or not to let Tutsi's live in his hotel to take refuge from the Hutu soldiers.<br/><br/>The problem is that the Hutu's, a tribe of Africans in Rwanda, are taking control and want to exterminate the Tutsis, a rival tribe. This hostile take over is one that spreads all over Paul's town. One night over a radio broadcast, the Hutu militia's leader told all of his soldiers to find and eliminate the Tutsis. Now, Paul, his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), who is a Tutsi, and their children must stay in the hotel and watch over all of the ""new guests"". With Paul paying off the leader of the Hutu militia, General Bizimungu, he tries to keep his hotel out of harms way.<br/><br/>When he runs out of ideas and aid from the General and from the United Nations, led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), and the media, he must defend his hotel by finding a way to get those refugees out of there and keep his family safe at the same time. Paul is faced with heart breaking decisions and must stay strong so he doesn't show weakness or give up the Tutsis.<br/><br/>Cheadle's performance is breathtaking. When everything seems to be coming apart and he might lose it, he has to hold it together. Cheadle's character sees things that shouldn't be seen by anyone. So much death and destruction in one area can have an impact on a man. With scenes that are similar to Schindler's List, this movie is powerful and really shows how little people have known about the crisis in Rwanda.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda was nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Actor (Cheadle), Best Supporting Actress (Okonedo), and Best Original Screenplay. Although it didn't win, the movies message was carried across and brought attention to the devastation in Africa.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda is a masterpiece and is one of the most moving films of all time.

","Some films hold importance because they shed light on a world that most of us will never know or comprehend fully. ""Hotel Rwanda,"" the true story of a hotel manager who saved the lives of 1,268 men, women and children in Kigali, Rwanda in April of 1994, is the most important film of 2004.<br/><br/>A decade ago, the African nation of Rwanda became a place of mass genocide. The two dominant tribes, the darker skinned Hutus and lighter skinned Tutsis, began a civil war. After 100 days of fighting and over a million casualties, the U.N. finally interceded.<br/><br/>We follow the story of Paul Rusesabagina, portrayed by the excellent Don Cheadle, who has never troubled himself with the affairs of the people. He is a businessman and manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines, the most luxurious hotel in Rwanda. Over the years, he has become friends with important people by providing cigars and expensive Scotch in meetings with them.<br/><br/>However, Paul's world goes from heaven to hell when the civil war begins. The Hutu militia walks the streets killing any Tutsi they can find, including helpless children. The militia wants to kill every Tutsi to wipe the slate clean of their kind.<br/><br/>Paul himself is a Hutu, but his wife is a Tutsi and his three children are mixed. The welfare of his family is his priority throughout the film. In addition, Paul helps other refugees by housing them in the hotel and bribing the Rwandan army (who has sided with the Hutu militia) with money, beer and other items to protect the hotel.<br/><br/>Some have hailed the film as an African ""Schindler's List."" This is right in the aspect of a heroic businessman protecting innocent people from their death. However, ""Schindler's List"" is better-made film because of the unflinching portrayal of the Holocaust and Steven Spielberg's powerful direction.<br/><br/>""Hotel Rwanda's"" only major flaw is toning down the violence to make this a family oriented piece. Director Terry George cleaned the image of war up so the film could receive a more commercial PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Still, even though the violence is not accurately portrayed, the film is simultaneously haunting and heartbreaking. In one scene, Paul and an associate drive down a foggy and unusually bumpy road, only to stop the car and realize they are actually running over hundreds of dead bodies. It's a scene that will stay with you for weeks.<br/><br/>One key factor that makes the film work is Cheadle's performance. It has been nominated for an Academy Award because it is flawless and Cheadle has never been better. We really believe Paul's plight because of Cheadle's perfect Rwandan accent and ability to convey conflicted emotions.<br/><br/>Also worth noting is Sophie Okenedo who plays Paul's wife Tatiana. Okenedo has been doing small television roles for most of her career, but after this film, it wouldn't be surprising to see her more often on the big screen.<br/><br/>Although ""Hotel Rwanda"" sometimes has an overly sentimental feel to it, it still succeeds in commemorating Paul Rusesabagina and shaming the world for not helping stop man's inhumanity toward man."

","I have seen the movie and being a undergrad who has spent a year working on the Rwandan Genocide I have to say that I was disappointed with this movie. I like that it is trying to bring some light on a subject that we have all seemed to forgotten or never really knew anything about in the first place. However, this movie never seemed to show the brutality or show the reality of the horrors that were occurring in this county at the time. Most of this film takes place in this hotel where they are drinking wine and one of their biggest problems is having to boil their drinking water out of the hotel's swimming pool. There are very few scenes where you are given the opportunity to see a glimpse of what the real horror of the genocide must have been like. I understand that the movie was trying to keep its PG 13 rating but I think that the rating of this film is not as important as the message. All that said this was a still a good movie and did a much better job with the historical facts then I had expected."

Though fine work was turned in by the other nominees, Cheadle's performance was breathtaking. And heartbreaking.<br/><br/>The very few negative reviews I have read will compare this film to Schindler's List, which also deals with genocide. However, the analogy fails because: (1) Oscar Schindler was not a member of the targeted group; (2) The distinction between Hutu and Tutsi was completely arbitrary and artificial; and (3) The West had ""intervened"" in WWII.<br/><br/>That distinguishing feature--the West's intervention or lack of it--is doubly ironic: first, it was the West's meddling which had created the problem in Rwanda, both the colonial aspirations and later arming the factions it created. And second, the people we were saving from Hitler were mostly white. No truer words were ever spoken than the line delivered by Nick Nolte's character as an explanation for the lack of concern by the West: ""You're African."" This film was horrifying without being unduly grisly--a remarkable and commendable restraint for a film about a war fought mostly with machetes. And without further explanation (in case you haven't seen the film), I point out there is one particular road trip in this film as chilling as anything in horror films.<br/><br/>After about ten minutes into this film, I was thinking, maybe 8/10.

","""Hotel Rwanda"" is the heart-wrenching story of Paul Rusesabagina, a Rwandan hotel manager who sheltered over 1,200 Tutsi refugees from the Hutu militia and their 'purification' crusade in 1994. The movie begins by giving a thorough explanation of the political situation in Rwanda at the time. The nation is divided by two factions, the Hutu and the Tutsi. Rwanda, being freed from its Belgian colonizers, forms its own national government and attracts the attention of the international media and wealthy tourists. However the Hutu population, the majority, still resents the Tutsis for their alleged cooperation with the Belgian colonizers. By the early nineties both factions have organized their own militias and the official government is leaning toward the corrupt Hutu cause of exterminating the Tutsi people. The UN is caught in the middle trying to act as a peacekeeping force.<br/><br/>Paul (Don Cheadle) is a Hutu that must use various diplomatic skills as a hotel manager, a job bringing him in contact with various entities. When violence does break out, Paul goes against his instincts and decides upon protecting his endangered Tutsi neighbors. As they escape to the refuge of the hotel more refugees come under Paul's care and he realizes that the UN and the media, the only ones who can protect him, are fleeing the country. Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) is a UN commander that has befriended Paul and, being one of the few westerners who cares about the genocides, does his best to protect Paul's hotel.<br/><br/>I must say that the entire cast is outstanding. Don Cheadle becomes Paul right before our eyes and amazes us in virtually every scene. Sophie Okonedo plays Paul's courageous Tutsi wife, Tatiana Rusesabagina, who encourages her husband every step of the way. This character reminds me of the old adage: behind every strong man is a stronger woman. Nick Nolte has one of the greatest and most convincing scenes in the movie when he (as Col. Oliver) explains to Paul why the West doesn't care about his plight.<br/><br/>The director and producer, Terry George, pulls the picture together in such a way that it is an outrage was not nominated for an Oscar. The dialogue is realistic and human in every sense. Finally, the cinematography tells the story in such a straightforward manner that with the very appropriate (and sometimes eerie) music we as an audience feel transported into Paul's terrifying world.<br/><br/>""Hotel Rwanda"" is an excellent tale of survival."

Aided by his wife (Sophie Okonedo) a UN general (Nick Nolte), and his staff, Rusesabagina became an important hero that has rightly been characterized in this film by director Terry George and one hopes this film will be remembered as importantly as 1984's 'The Killing Fields'."

This is another recent release and though I believe there is no distributor yet for the US, you should try to see it if you can.

","Based on the 1994 genocide between the African ""tribes"" of the Hutu's and the Tutsi's, Hotel Rwanda has gotten decidedly mixed reviews. Before seeing the film, I was a little surprised since such subject matter alone is usually powerful enough to lead a film to critical acclaim. After seeing the film, though, I was incredibly surprised, as this is one of the most powerful and harrowing films I've seen in a year. It moved me in a way most films fail to do.<br/><br/>Documenting a sadly little known event from just a mere decade ago, when nearly a million Rwandans were killed brutally with machetes and other weapons in the short time span of two months, everything within the film works. It never becomes manipulative or sentimental, always letting the emotions flow naturally. It also never becomes a blood fest, instead letting the majority of the violence be seen in small glimpses. It is an effective strategy that actually shocks more than any amount of hacked limbs and bloodied faces could.<br/><br/>However, the film does become a wagging finger at those around the world that did not do enough, or anything. Yet, it does not blame without a purpose. This is a film that urges it's viewer not only to look back at history and have a reaction, but to look at today and forward into the future and to seek out the injustices that occur now so that perhaps those in need will not become abandoned again. For example, in Somalia the 'G' word has been brought up for atrocities occurring to this very day.<br/><br/>Then there is Paul Rusesabagina, played by Don Cheadle. Simply put, Cheadle becomes his character, never going for the showy theatrical bits that will look good in a 30-second clip. Rather, he embodies the spirit of a true honest-to-God hero. The actual Rusesabagina helped on the set of Hotel Rwanda, and the touch of honesty that would have come from the real Paul is evident on screen and in Cheadle's presentation. Ultimately, Rusesabagina is a name as worthy as Oskar Schindler.<br/><br/>Ignoring the built in power of the subject matter, though, Hotel Rwanda is a work of cinema and art on its own merits too. I first began to realize I was in for more than a Discovery channel special in an early scene before the genocide, as lightening brightens the sky at intermittent points. It is a brilliant way to foreshadow the coming storm Rwanda is about to face. Rusesabagina himself is a Hutu, but his wife and many of his friends are Tutsi, and as Rusesabagina and some friends are talking about the looming danger on the horizon as Tutsi members have become verbal targets thanks to a local radio station's spreading of propaganda, the brilliant touch of the lightening that is not overused but rather subtly inserted into the background helps create a sense of unease.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a film that needs to be seen. The Oscar nominations come out tomorrow, January 25th, and I hope this film picks up several nods partly to help it gain more attention in a way the actual event never really did. The film is as powerful as Schindler's List but still unique in its own right, helping to illuminate a terrifying but little known event. Hotel Rwanda is testament that there is always a reason to stand up against humanity's greatest flaws, and that those who turn their backs can be just as dangerous as the ones who carry the bloody machetes down into their local neighborhoods."

It is difficult to talk about a film like this and use terms like what a great movie etc.. since it is about such a horrific event and a movie is a form of entertainment. I was caught up in the film right from the start, Don Cheadle made this role his own, every scene that he was in showed another angle another side of a man torn by so many things from what he knew to be right to what he knew in order to survive. It was his eyes that riveted me, each and every thought that he had as Paul was mirrored there - he was a man torn between so many things whether to just concern himself with his family or include his neighbors or the plight of strangers as well. I was so impressed also with the way he carried himself with such quiet dignity even while you knew that inside he must have been seething. He moved with such grace like a ballet dancer, even his fingers as they moved carried expression. I have always liked Mr. Cheadle in movies from his crazy turn in Devil in a Blue Dress to his great Brit part in Ocean's 11 and 12 but here he showed that he is by no means a lightweight. I can only hope that he has the opportunity to bring more of this talent to the screen.

","The Rwanda genocide is certainly one of the most atrocious crime in the 1990s. Rivalry between the Hutus and the Tutsis led to the death of over a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus in a span of three months.<br/><br/>""Hotel Rwanda"" is a true story based on this massacre. Unfortunately, I do not feel any pain watching it. The entire film focuses too much on people inside the hotel that the film fails to portray the horror of the massacre. ""Hotel Rwanda"" spends too much time inside the hotel. It does not show the events outside the hotel and how they connect one another. I notice the hotel but I do not witness Kigali and Rwanda.<br/><br/>I do not demand a feast of bloodshed, shootings, and corpses. However, I would also like to see how the terror moves Paul. I only notice several brief scenes where Paul actually witnesses many corpses and cries. The film needs to present more connections between the genocide and Paul's family.<br/><br/>This film has some shadows of ""Schindler's List"" but it is nowhere near the calibre of ""Schindler's List."" When Hutu soldiers started the massacre, I doubt that Paul's hotel can keep getting away from the bloodshed by means of personal relationships and bribes. I cannot believe that this is true.<br/><br/>""Hotel Rwanda"" has its positive elements in spite of its weaknesses. I am impressed that they vividly portray the world's negligence. Foreign nations care more about pulling out its citizens than stopping the bloody massacre. This was the case in 1994 and ""Hotel Rwanda"" makes this point. In another scene, Paul tries to send his family away and determines to stay with others in the hotel. This scene touches me because it deeply illustrates Paul's sentiment and humanity. He is not a selfish individual caring only for him and his family.<br/><br/>""Hotel Rwanda"" is not a bad film. Its subject is serious and worth us to reflect. However, it can do a better job portraying how atrocious the genocide was and how Paul and others survived."

","Somalia, Ethiopia/Eritrea, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Congo, Sudan, Algeria, Nigeria, Tunisia - and Rwanda...what do all of these African counties have in common? They're countries torn apart by civil war, where millions have been slaughtered and millions more have been maimed, raped, beaten, tortured, threatened, displaced, and, most importantly, ignored by the rest of the world. And the main reason for the nightmare that Africa has become? Europe colonized Africa and divided it along new territorial lines, splitting tribes and clans into pieces, and forcing rivals and foreigners into the same territories. The entire Rwandan genocide is namely due to the Belgians, who basically handpicked certain Rwandans and called them Hutus, and called the others Tutsis, all arbitrarily, then left the country and power to the Hutus, creating a power struggle between two 'tribes' who were really the SAME PEOPLE.<br/><br/>In the end you have Hutus and Tutsis at war, even though there is absolutely no difference between them save a name granted by their Belgian 'lords', and power unilaterally granted by uncaring and abandoning colonizers. I just watched the Shake Hands With The Devil documentary on Radio-Canada tonight, and one thing that astounded me was the footage, at the 10th anniversary conference on the Rwandan genocide, of a personal attack by the Belgian senatorial representative, on Dallaire, because of Belgian casualties within the UN peacekeeping corps. I think that this is the perfect example of where the Western priorities lie.<br/><br/>Everyone in North America and Western Europe needs to see Hotel Rwanda. Only through this kind of film can we actually learn about and feel the sort of terror that exists in a land where death can come to someone simply because they're unfortunate enough to be branded with a colonial name that divides them from the Powers That Be. 10/10."

Don Cheadle's performance is amazing as he demonstrates Paul's extraordinary courage and compassion.

","As one who feels that there is ""no best performance"" for the Oscars but rather, everyone who is nominated is a ""best performance"". How can you possibly compare any one performance against another when the movies and stories are totally different. We loved many movies this year and feel they are worthy of nominations. We have already been rewarded by seeing that Natalie Portman and Clive Owens were honored by the foreign Press for a movie that we loved, but understood some would find it abhorrent. The line is drawn in the sand by Don Cheadle who we have always liked in every role he has played. He has been relegated the usual stereotypical roles for Black actors and it must be frustrating for him and the handful of very talented black actors and actresses who just don't get the great roles. Don Cheadle sets himself apart from every single actor in any movie of 2004. It is done by simply providing the best acting role in a movie about ""real events"". It makes us all ashamed of the fact that we were frozen to the TV watching OJ Simpson at the time that all of this took place. What a disgrace to us. As usual the world stood still and did nothing as in the Holocaust and the few other cases of genocide. The French true to their colors did nothing when they could have and should been first on the site. The English and Americans turned their backs as did the UN. Cheadle brings us to tears and cheers in this fascinating story of ""one man"" who defies the odds against genocide of his own people. He is an outstanding actor and he surely deserves not only the nomination but the win as well. True, Leo was great as Hughes, Sideways is still something I cannot understand as to what the hub bub is about, Clint and Morgan were superb in Million Dollar baby, but none come close to Cheadle in this spectacular role of a lifetime. Bravo to Cheadle and those who had the guts to make this movie. Everyone from 8 to 108 should be required to see this movie as much if not equal to Schindlers List."

When the genocide finished in July 1994, there were a million dead bodies left in Rwanda. The Tutsi rebels forced the Hutu army and the Interhamwe militia to move to Congo.<br/><br/>It is amazing that it has taken ten years to see this powerful contemporary drama on the big screen, when we see dozens of Holocaust movies as if this has been the unique slaughter of a race in the recent history. As far as I remember, this is the first movie that I see showing, in a sensitive and full of love and hope way, the misery of this people, which the world turned back maybe because they do not have oil, gold or diamonds in their poor country.

","One can rate movies according to what they bring of ""newness"" to our horizons. For me this movie hasn't added anything and i can only say that to the people this movie was a ""widening"" of some sort, then you must have been asleep before you saw it. The first objective criticism i have to make is that once you have visited Africa you cannot relate to the images in Hotel Rwanda. We see the movie as if we are in a western suburban area and that, i might say, as nothing to do with the feel of Africa. Throughout the film we seem to be taken through a somewhat digestible version of scenarios for western bourgeois audience.<br/><br/>Sure enough that the film is talking about a sensitive issue and how the circumstances enforce heroic acts on the part of the main character. But if we go a bit deeper into the portrayal of Rwanda's reality then we find this film has no specific content other than the poor commercialization of conflict, and i would say that's mediatic malady. I'm sure Tutsi survivors may have praised the film as something important. But talking in cinematic terms this film is a hoax. The horror of Rwanda is much more darker on the whole of humanity than this film can show. One would have to film constant panic to get a bit closer.<br/><br/>It's not Hollywood made but it is still the same formula. In my opinion: don't watch it! It has the stink of culpabilization on it.

Someone like Spielberg with his knack for ultra-realistic violence could have done a better job. When you feel like you're watching something real it hits you on a deeper level. There's a lot more to it than gratuitous bloodshed. The unnerving chaos of Africa was displayed much better in ""Blackhawk Down.""<br/><br/>This was a case where filtered gore robbed the movie of the outrage one should feel. There were only a few serious cringe-inducing scenes and I expected the whole movie to stay at that level. There was definite unease throughout, but it wasn't quite edgy enough.<br/><br/>I think some rave reviews describe what the move could have been and the importance of its theme, not what it actually was. I disagree with those who say the reason for the conflict wasn't explained well enough. It was just a type of gang vengeance and us vs. them, like so many other wars."
"MovieAddict2016","8","3","5","22 August 2005"," The PG-13 rating restricts some of the content but nevertheless its message is effective
","Ten years ago in the country of Rwanda, one million people were brutally murdered in less than three months by opposing forces, and much of the world passed over the events giving them little notice. However one brave man (played in the film by Don Cheadle) granted over 1,000 refugees access to his hotel and helped save their lives.<br/><br/>I had heard very mixed reviews on this film. On a UK talk show when it came out overseas one critic called it the next ""Schindler's List,"" and another said it was too tame and ""not scary enough"" to be a great movie.<br/><br/>Personally I felt that although the movie was very good, and extremely well acted by Don Cheadle, the PG-13 rating does indeed restrict some of the atrocities that were actually performed. It kind of seems redundant to make such a daring, un-Hollywood film and then rate it PG-13 so more people can go see it and it can bring in more money.<br/><br/>At the time, I thought the critic who said it ""wasn't scary enough"" was off her nut, but now I can understand what she was getting at - ""Schindler's List"" really immersed you into the Jews' struggle through its brutal depictions of senseless violence. It hurt to watch.<br/><br/>""Hotel Rwanda"" is tamer. It still deals with hundreds of thousands of lost lives, but PG-13 is still PG-13 and it does give the film a lighter edge - an R-rating would have allowed them more freedom to really examine the full extent of the atrocities in Rwanda.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, for being restricted to a PG-13 rating it manages to translate its message rather well, and thanks to the lead performance by Don Cheadle it really does have moments of near-greatness. I wouldn't put it on the same level as ""Schindler's List,"" but it's still a haunting reminder of what happened in Rwanda."

"jmverville","7","3","5","18 January 2005"," Good Film With a Strong Story
","Hotel Rwanda is quite a strong story due to the uniqueness of location and topic, as well as the emotionality that is penned into it. I found though, that although the story is very strong and so is Don Cheadle, the rest of the film is not all that it is cracked up to be. Many people like to focus on the good parts of this film (of which there are many), but one must not be so quick to overrate it.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle's performance is very convincing and engaging, and as in most of Don Cheadle's roles, he is able to acquire an accent and a whole different method of acting for each role that he takes. He is truly a diverse actor that deserves much credit (and awards) for this performance. However, Nick Nolte plays an aging military man and throughout the film you cannot help but note that the Colonel is weakly portrayed and Nolte acts quite poorly. I have never seen the portrayal of such a military man being so unintentionally weak and sheepish, yet at the same time the attempt to make him seem soldierly. Either Nick Nolte's acting is bad, or Terry George doesn't know what he wants out of the Colonel.<br/><br/>Which leads me to elaborate that the film was poorly directed. George, for whatever reason, focuses away from the action of the film (the riots and war in Kingali) to the hectic scene at the Hotel, when it is quite obvious that any viewer after hearing all these reports about warfare on the streets would like to see more than is shown. One could say George is tantalizing us with action, but I am afraid that the action seemingly doesn't exist as it should in this film. The film had endless potential to show the depravity of genocide and war in an active and engaging way, but in the end George focuses on a passive portrayal -- with which I would have had no problems by itself, but it becomes quite unsavory.<br/><br/>Furthermore, George also throws inappropriate scenes at inappropriate times, and sometimes the vocal narratives on the radio which are meant to be threatening and scary seem to be comical due to the selection of words. Scenes that bring you in one direction (towards something riveting and compelling) often leave you unfulfilled. George also does not drive home the messages as hard as he could have, and by the end of the film, one can scarcely remember many of the messages that George wanted to drive home, being that one is quite exhausted with the puzzle of plot that George assembles.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a good film, but certainly not without flaw. It could have been a much better film had there been a different style of directing (or, in short, a different director)."

The story of one, brave man, that saved hundreds of people is really strong and breathtaking. All the actors are pretty good in it. And well done screenplay. Unfortunately, the film itself was hard to watch for me, because the music is just terrible (MIDI keyboard orchestrations and irritating melodic motives), the work of camera and generally visual work is boring and amateurish. If they gave such strong story based on such dramatic political situation to better director and crew, they could have made second ""Schindler's List"" out of it.

"maskirovka77","Null","4","8","8 January 2005"," the Blame Game
","Hotel Rwanda did not live up to my expectations. It was a decent movie, but it just isn't in the same category as Schindler's List.<br/><br/>On the plus side, I thought that Don Cheadle and the rest of the cast did a fine job (although Nick Nolte was probably too old for the role that he played). I also thought that the movie depicted the Interahamwe militia in a chilling fashion. The most horrifying parts of the movie for me were the moments showing ordinary Rwandan Hutus being incited to kill the Tutsi ""cockroaches"" by Radio Mille Collines.<br/><br/>On the negative side, I thought the movie ""disneyfied"" what happened in Rwanda. What happened in that country for 100 days was surreal. Hundreds of thousands of innocent Tutsi, Twa, and moderate Hutus were brutally murdered. Friends and neighbors killed each other. Doctors killed patients. Patients killed doctors. Teachers killed students. Students killed teachers. And supposed ""men of God"" betrayed their parishioners.<br/><br/>Yet Hotel Rwanda shied away from depicting any of this. There was no scene like that in Schindler's List when the Nazis cleared out the Cracow Ghetto. We see the threat of violence, and we see the aftermath of violence. But we don't see the actual evil being committed. I think that one brief series of scenes depicting a massacre would have brought home the horror of Rwanda much more effectively than this movie did. Depicted (or non-depicted) as it is Hotel Rwanda, someone might think that there was some nameless force at work at Rwanda causing some people to act in a threatening fashion and randomly slaying others.<br/><br/>My second criticism is the blame shifting that the movie did. It has become popular to blame the West, specifically the United States, France, and a few other countries, for what happened in Rwanda. The logic is that we knew what was happening was genocide, yet we did nothing to stop it.<br/><br/>I was in the American Army at the time. Yet because I was over in the former Yugoslavia (where bad things were happening at a somewhat more leisurely pace), I was only dimly aware of what was going on in Africa. With ten years' perspective, I find myself wishing that we had intervened. Even a gesture as small as jamming ""Radio Genocide"" would have been something.<br/><br/>Yet I totally reject that my country is at fault for Rwanda. The bottom line is this: the Hutus and Tutsis did it to themselves. I am including the Tutsis in the blame game because the Tutsi regime in Burundi committed enormous crimes against the Hutus living there before the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Those killings had dire consequences for the Tutsis in Rwanda.<br/><br/>Assigning primary blame to people other than those who gave the orders to kill or were actually swinging the machetes is wrong for two reasons. First, it infantilizes the Hutus and Tutsis. They are human beings and have free will. Some of them did the right thing. Many more did not.<br/><br/>Second, who can really say that the UN, US, or any other country could have stopped what happened? I would be willing to bet had there been an intervention by US military forces, some of the people here and elsewhere who are loudly damning the US for inaction would be just as loudly damning the US for ""violating Rwanda's sovereignty."" Meanwhile people like John Pilger would be writing editorials accusing the US of trying to re-colonize Central Africa.<br/><br/>I feel no guilt about Rwanda. Yet I wish that we had intervened anyway because it would have saved lives. That would have been worth having to put up with anti-war demonstrations and idiotic statements like ""this war is all about Congo diamonds, or uranium, or control of the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest gorilla safari industry."""

Don Cheadle does full justice to his role and his acting is superb. Every frame of this movie is gripping with suspense and thrill as to what fate awaits the helpless victims of the mindless genocide. Once you begin watching this movie it is hard to stop it halfway , and throughout the movie the edge of the seat suspense is maintained.<br/><br/>But above all this movie is a triumph of the indefatigable human spirit, a triumph of good over evil, and a triumph of sanity in an atmosphere of madness. All of this is represented in that one man , Paul Rusesabagina. Throughout this movie this man grips our attention. When he cries we cry with him, when he laughs we laugh with him when he worries we worry too. In my opinion, very few movies can lay claim to this rare distinction. There are quite a few very violent and disturbing scenes but when the truth is stranger than fiction, there is no other alternative but to bare that. This movie is based on truth and the truth is quite shocking. It is enough to jolt a man from his nonchalance and stupor. In this context , it is shocking to see how the entire world watched this gruesome drama without lifting a finger to help. The helplessness of the UN , the shocking cowardice of the super powers and above all the failure of entire humanity itself is very movingly shown. <br/><br/>But again in this depressing backdrop, the courage of this one man Paul Rusesabagina , his cleverness, his resourcefulness and above all his humaneness contrasts sharply and shouts aloud the message : That the whole world is one , that what a difference a few good men can make. And this voice of sanity will ring loud and clear and cannot be drowned out in the din and stench of the voices of madness.<br/><br/>I can write an entire book of praises for this movie and all its aspects and still that wont be enough. I don't want to dissect this movie and kill its charms. But just one line will suffice : A thoroughly watchable movie!!"

","One of the better movies I've seen in a long time. This movie and ""Lord of War"" make nice bookends on the some crises in Africa that are ignored by the West. Although one would think that it would have something of a documentary or ""victim's movie"" feel it is also very entertaining, and you can take your eyes off of the screen once you start. This is one movie that Hollywood and the filmmakers of the world do deserve applause for, the main character, who is a real person- Paul Rusesabagina, who is a real world who is hero without weapons. The movie also did a good job in showing the plight of the UN Soldiers, who are often painted as unfeeling robots when in fact they do very much care about the refugees they are trying to protect and save. More movies like this need to be made."

Shame..........shame...shame...on us all is my opinion.

And then I remembered the words April being in the title and sure enough I found the movie I was thinking about right here on IMDb Called ""Sometimes in April""<br/><br/>It was in that movie that I saw America's role and how cavalier we were about it.

It was based on the Radio Hutu DJ that riled the masses and his brother, who was opposed to his brother's actions. The brother who was not a DJ and was also married to a Tutsi was very upset with his antagonistic brother.

At first i thought it was going to be like The Constant Gardner and be a complete bore, but i was so surprised at how well made and gripping it was. Although The Constant Gardner may have mystery, Hotel Rwanda has tension, which ultimately wins the movie over for me. Hotel Rwanda tells the story of the Genocide in Rwanda, Africa and how it affects a hotel manager and his family. The cast are great, especially Don and Spohie who give fantastic emotion and love as the husband and wife who come from different tribes. Not only does Hotel Rwanda give you information about the real story of the Tootsies and the Hotu's, but it gives us a story to follow and characters to follow and feel for. Although it may not look brutal as in violence, the fact that something like over 8 million people died is quite sickening, and the fact that no one did anything is even more sickening. I loved this movie and although its not a oh lets all sit down and be happy movie, it still has comedy moments and tender moments. One of the best films this year!"
"coolprasad-1","8","2","3","7 February 2006"," Rwandan Schindler shines
","Read complete Review at<br/><br/>http://screenart.blogspot.com<br/><br/>'Hotel Rwanda' is the story of Paul Rusesabagina, a good, simple and a decent man. What's extraordinary about him is that he remains a good man, a simple man and a decent man when somebody points a gun at him. That takes extraordinary courage. It's not the sort of courage where he plots and fights to kill the bad guys, but a Gandhian courage where his actions bear his goodness signature and are devoid of any violence. Paul is the manager of the Milles Collines Hotel, Kigali, Rwanda. He belongs to the Hutu tribe, which has just come to the power (in 1994, when the movie begins) and a radio broadcast addresses the other tribe, Tutsi, as cockroaches.<br/><br/>Because Paul is the manager of a star hotel, he has contacts with many high level officials and because of his human nature, he is in their good books. When the Hutus took the government office, there was a mild trepidation among the Tutsis and when the Hutu president was killed by the Tutsi rebels, the trepidation transformed into a strong fear. Paul takes his family (his wife is a Tutsi) and his Tutsi neighbours to his hotel. Good hearted Red Cross workers save as many victims as possible and they bring them to Paul, because he is the only one they know who can't say 'no.' Paul keeps the wagon spinning by bribing the soldiers with wine and money, but that doesn't help him after a while. What unfolds is a chronicle of Paul's desperate measures to keep the soldiers at bay and save as many as possible.<br/><br/>There is a scene about halfway into the movie. Paul gets rice, beans and milk powder from black market and returns to his hotel on a very foggy morning. Suddenly they seem to have hit a bumpy road and the van is stopped. Paul gets out to check whats up with the road. He stumbles, falls down and slowly, shiveringly gets back to his feet realizing that the whole street is full of fresh corpses. Along with Paul, I too lost my balance, and gained my hold on conscience slowly. They were all hacked to death with machetes and gardening instruments. And it was just one of many such streets all over the country.<br/><br/>The above scene is an example of powerful film-making. The movie is rated PG-13. There is no explicit violence. But we are allowed to understand the immensity of the genocide through such scenes, where we only get a glimpse, because it's hazy and unclear because of the time of the day and still we realize the cruelty of the massacre. There is another scene where Paul is unsure whether his family is dead or alive and he runs across the hotel rooms looking for them. The character development is so complete that I too was running with Paul desperately looking for his family. And when he finds his wife and kids hiding in a bathroom tub, they all cry and laugh and then I slowly settled comfortably into my seat with a happy smile knowing that his family is safe.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle as Paul delivers a stellar performance. The beauty of his act lies in his simplicity. There is not a scene where he overacts or underacts. Sophie Okenado as Paul's wife Tatiana is equally admirable. There are so many close up shots of these two artistes and there is not a single wrong twist on their faces... every emotion they express is accepted without a question. The supporting cast, which comprises of Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix, Desmond Dube... are all top notch. Terry George is the director working on a script by himself and Keir Pearson. I was simply immersed into the story and that pretty much sums the quality of work by the writer/director. Music should have been good because it never drew attention to itself.<br/><br/>Paul saved over twelve hundred lives during a three month hell where close a million people were killed. The UN didn't intervene because what happened in Rwanda couldn't be termed 'genocide' and if this isn't genocide, I don't know what it is. That reminds me of another recent sad story - Darfur, Sudan. Again, the first world countries and the UN turned a blind eye as trained militia went of a life-hungry rampage. I've read cover stories about the active role played by USA and UN in African countries - it's really uplifting. During the Rwandan genocide, a Pentagon bastard joked ""Is it Hutu or Tutu?"" I know that if something goes wrong in Nigeria, high level meetings will actively take place because it's the eighth largest exporter of oil. So much for world peace!! This cinema is about respecting another human being. This cinema is a showcase of the horror due to the unnecessarily deep-rooted distinctions based on caste, race, tribe, etc. This cinema is an attempt to shame the U.N and the first world countries for their callousness. This cinema is a reminder of the value of life. From an artistic viewpoint, this is a very good cinema. From a historic viewpoint, this is an important cinema. 'Hotel Rwanda' must be shown in the UN general assembly for a packed audience who call themselves diplomats. If this doesn't put them to shame, I don't know what will."

","I can't believe my eyes. This is an actual tragedy that happened in the history of this world and George is trying to get the word out through this dramatic film since no one in this society would listen to anything if it's not in the form of TV or film. It's sad because instead of reflecting on this tragedy seriously, you people are making trivial comments about lighting and typos and nit picking about flat stupid things that don't even matter. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Maybe if certain people would stop trying to deflect blame of themselves and also realize that Western countries actually do bad things to other countries, tragedies like the genocide in Rwanda wouldn't have happened and maybe this world would inhabitable."

"liston15","6","2","3","6 December 2005"," A missed opportunity
","Hotel Rwanda is all right, but it is only all right and certainly does not merit the praise that has been heaped on it. It is true that is it has given a new audience to the terrible atrocities of 1994, but this does not get away from the fact that it is only a slightly above average film. If anything, it should have been easier to make a great film because of the power of the story, but instead of letting the events speak for themselves they end up Hollywood-izing it. The most glaring pandering to the Western audience is the fact that everyone speaks English, which reminded me of the awful portrayals of the German soldiers in all the old war films, where they speak English in a German accent. But this is only the tip of the iceberg and there are plenty of changes with how things really happened. Again, what did happen what so ghastly that there was no need to do this, and there seems a lack of understanding that something can be emotionally powerful without intrusive music that cheaply pulls at the heart strings. And why, oh why, did they not use more of the Rwandan countryside. It's certainly one of the most beautiful places I have ever been and the film missed a trick in this respect. The Constant Gardener's cinematography is much better, even though the lush greens of Rwanda would be much more conducive. But despite everything I hate about this film, I still like it. It is exciting in some parts, and with other parts is successful in making you angry about how the West left all these people to be brutally murdered. But it's not in the same league as Shaking Hands With the Devil, a far superior film on the Genocide."
"michaelRokeefe","8","2","3","2 November 2005"," Astounding as it is awesome.
","This movie deserves every accolade thrown its way. Don Cheadle probably has never been better. Based on an event that seemed to escape the eyes of the rest of the world. Some of the worst atrocities of the twentieth century was like a rancid belch in the central African nation of Rwanda. In spite of peace talks between the Hutus and Tutsis; the Hutus militia broke the pact and started killing Tutsis on sight. Almost one million people were brutally murdered in their homes, in the street at will. In the middle of the madness, an ordinary hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina(Cheadle)summoned the courage to actually save 1,268 refugees by hiding them in the four star hotel he managed. HOTEL RWANDA is a testament to Paul's devotion and love for his family and mankind. Also in this modern day classic: Mosa Kaiser, Joaquin Phoenix, Nick Nolte, Fana Mokoena, Mabutho 'Kid' Sithole, Kgomotso Seitshohlo, Simo Mogwaza and Hakeem Kae-Kazim. This is an outstanding motion picture and worth every minute of the the 2 hour 2 minutes running time. Kudos to writer and director Terry George."

","Quite simply a brilliant movie. It has a great balance between style and theme. It is refined, artly, but at the same time it has that rare quality of a work of art that talks about something essential. It is simply a must-see movie, a lesson for all other movie-makers that thought that a horror-reality is enough to provide a quality end-product. Extremely well-played and directed, this is a movie that goes far beyond its context and will perhaps become a point of reference for several reasons at least: its treatment of image, pictural and subtle; the screenplay, concise and balanced, the whole product which offers the impression of something complete to which you cannot add or take anything from."
"matthewbelanger","Null","2","3","10 August 2005"," The Injustice Behind Hotel Rwanda
","It should be noted that a great injustice was committed in the making of Hotel Rwanda. For the most part the story is true, Don Cheadle's character Paul Rusesabagina was a hero amidst terrible acts.<br/><br/>The injustice lies in the portrayal of Nick Nolte's character, Colonel Oliver. Oliver is a fictitious person, but there is no denying the comparisons to Romeo Dallaire, a Canadian hero and the man in charge of the UN peacekeeping mission. For whatever reason, it was decided that the true story would be altered for the movie. Dallaire, recently voted as the 16th greatest Canadian ever by a CBC poll, was depicted by Nolte's character as ineffective and a drunk. This is far from the truth. Dallaire had limited resources and insufficient personnel to be able to stop the oppression and genocide, but he stood his ground. The world turned its back on what happened in Rwanda. The UN committed such little resources and soldiers to the mission that there was no chance of success. It is true that hundreds of thousands of people were massacred, but this number would have been considerably higher had it not been for Dallaire.<br/><br/>It is unthinkable that such an important man and his actions would be altered in the retelling of this story. A more accurate account of the Rwanda genocide is available. Romeo Dallaire tells the story from his perspective, good and bad, in ""Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda"". Perhaps one day this story could be retold by Hollywood and give Dallaire the proper recognition he deserves."
"lee_eisenberg","10","2","3","21 July 2005"," I heard Paul Rusesabagina speak at Lewis & Clark College.
","""Hotel Rwanda"" recreates the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in the same way that ""Schindler's List"" recreated the genocide against the Jews. The movie shows not only the massacre, but also how the international community did nothing to stop it. Hotel owner Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) and his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) sheltered several Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the Mille Collines hotel, saving them from getting murdered.<br/><br/>Right after I saw the movie, I attended a speech by the real Paul Rusesabagina at Lewis & Clark College. He explained how the Belgian colonization of Rwanda set the stage for the 1994 genocide (the Belgians put the minority Tutsis in power, completely disenfranchising the majority Hutus), and what it was like for him experiencing it. As for why specifically the international community did nothing to stop the massacre, Rusesabagina said (as a mild joke): ""Maybe it's because Rwanda doesn't have oil."" Anyway, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a very powerful movie that reminds us not only of this specific event, but about what can happen if we forget the past. I recommend it to everyone."
"TxMike","Null","2","3","28 May 2005"," Not a pretty picture, but a struggle for survival.
","Fairly accurately, I suspect, 1994 Rwanda is depicted as a nation where intimidation and bribes control everyday commerce. Don Cheadle in a superb performance is Paul Rusesabagina, the assistant manager at a Belgian hotel in Rwanda. Paul becomes manager after the president of Rwanda is killed by insurgents, and the white manager flees. Instead of trying to cover the whole conflict, with millions killed by rival tribes, this movie focuses on this person, Paul, and his efforts to save over 1200 by welcoming them into the hotel, while doing what he could to stall the insurgents who wanted to kill all the ""cockroaches"", their name for those being killed. They especially wanted to kill all the children, to prevent that generation from growing up.<br/><br/>I suspect the movie is mostly accurate, as the real Paul Rusesabagina was a consultant for making the movie, and he is also featured on an interesting DVD extra, where he takes us back 10 years to the places and events depicted in the movie. Nick Nolte has a key role as Colonel Oliver of the UN peace keeping force. As was described, they could not do much to stop the genocide.<br/><br/>Not a pleasant movie to watch, but an important one as it shows a dark side of the world we live in. But also a bright spot, how one person can make a difference. And, Don Cheadle gives a superb performance as Paul."

","Hotel Rwanda is an excellent story, and the movie certainly deserves perfect scores on it's message and the topic at hand. The problem with this movie is a bit on how it's done. I understand the direction the movie was going with light on the gore and rather on the story but I felt it just left a bit too much out, as we know close to a million people where killed, although we really never get that feeling watching the movie. The great movie ""passion of the Christ"" uses extreme gore to drive home a point, and perhaps tell a story like it really is not so that we don't turn off some viewers. I think this is exactly the point, Mel Gibson figures if you can't watch this movie (Understand how awful it is) but yet refuse to accept it you refuse to really accept the truth, the same could be said with Rwanda and the current tragic events we have currently in Africa.<br/><br/>The acting here is top notch, and I can see the nod for best actor nomination but the movie is a bit too ""Hollywood"", there's too much music matching the moment and it feel's unrealistic & typical, any experienced movie watcher will get upset with this style. In conclusion, I wish this was done again.. to think of it, we will have another chance, someone will show the horrors in Dufur in a Hollywood production I just hope next time there won't be music playing when the main actor is running to his family, lets get it done right."
"esteban1747","8","2","3","1 May 2005"," Hutu- Tutsi war in Rwanda
","Although I visited Rwanda shortly before the war I do not remember 1000 colins hotel in Kigali. Certainly there was a tragedy in this tiny African country where brothers- I do not make any differentiation between tall Tutsi minority and somewhat small Hutu majority - were fighting each other. Probably all this hate started at the time of colonialism when the Tutsi were more favored by the Belgians, and once the country got the independence, a Tutsi kingdom was established with discrimation over Hutu population, which lasted not for long. The Hutu defeated the Tutsi and came to power with a Republic that continued the discrimination this time against Tutsi. In that country was compulsory for everyone to have the ethnic indication in the identity card. The film is only touching the final phase of the war between Tutsi guerrilla who was coming from the North of the country and the Hutu extremists, who were able to kill its own president, as it is shown in the film, just because he signed in Nairobi a peace agreement. In the film one can see how Hutus were killing innocent Tutsi population, and how international community was weakly reacting to this mass assassination. Unfortunately, it did not show how many Hutu families were coming from the North to Kigali. The film finished with the victory of Tutsi, but was it the end of this war? Not at all, Hutu escaped to Goma in the neighboring Congo, and many of them died again in war established between both groups, but no in their land. So if Hollywood makes several sequels of non sense films as ""Terminator"", ""Die Hard"" and others, it would be wise to prepare a sequel of ""Rwanda Hotel"" showing what happened after the Tutsi conquered Kigali, and how this confrontation finished, or perhaps to prepare a similar film of the tragedy in neighboring Burundi, where the same groups are still fighting. Don Cheadle acted very well but somewhat different to the role he played in the film ""Rosewood"". In ""Hotel Rwanda"" he was a Hutu but married to a Tutsi lady and with several children, always looking for peace and understanding."

","It's difficult to imagine the inhumanity and horror of the Rwandan genocide. Yet this film does a good job of conveying it without resorting to excess gore. It also leavens the horror with well timed moments of humour or tenderness. From all accounts it is factually correct. Why then did they not portray Gen. Romeo Dallaire as himself instead of inserting some trumped up fictional character played most unsuitably by Nick Nolte wearing a Canadian flag on his shirt? This detracts from the film and angers Canadians. Most of us regard Dalaire as a compassionate, highly principled hero who was betrayed by the UN. (Read his book, ""Shake Hands With The Devil."") The movie tells a terrible story very well. But eliminating Gen.

"MichaelMargetis","9","2","3","15 April 2005"," A Heartbreaking and Powerful Film About a Sensitive Subject
","I remember viewing many powerful and great movies last year, but something about 'Hotel Rwanda' stuck with me more than a lot of the others. 'Hotel Rwanda' is about the unbelievably sad and horrible incident that shook Rwanda to it's very foundations eleven years ago. It was April 1994 and almost no one could predict how nasty things would turn in a matter of days, and how many lives would be shattered. 'Hotel Rwanda' is the incredibly haunting and mesmerizing true story about one man who saved the life's of many of his fellow men during this period of Genocide and conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi citizens in Rwanda.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Paul Russesabegina (played expertly by Don Cheadle), a hotel manager of a four-star resort in Rwanda. Paul's an extremely generous and chivalrous person who gets caught up in a very unsettling situation. Tragedy strikes Rwanda when the Hutu leader of the nation is assassinated by a band of rebel Tutsi forces. The Hutu citizens and government go absolutely crazy and start trying to annihilate all of the Tutsi citizens. After this starts happening all the Americans get rushed out of Rwanda (especially all the non-African hotel managers) and Paul is left to fend for himself and his family and friends in Brutal Rwanda. Paul turns out to be like an African version of Oskar Schindler, and turns his hotel into a refugee camp for the prosecuted Tutsis, including his wife and children who are also Tutsi. Paul is able to accomplish this by his cunningness to trick the Hutu government by not only paying them off, but telling them the American government is watching them through satellites and will charge them as war criminals if they do anything to them. Paul also has the help of a peace officer (played by Nick Nolte), who helps him bribe the Hutu government and try to rush the Tutsi citizens out of Rwanda. <br/><br/>Despite a few of the films shortcomings, it's a little overlong and drags during it's third act, it's still an excellent production and showcases some wonderful performances. Don Cheadle gives the best performance of his career as the title character. He gives a powerhouse character embodiment that's riveting all the way through the film. You can tell he really poured his heart into this very crucial role, and he should have won the Oscar over Jamie Foxx (in my opinion). Sophie Okonedo is very impressive as Paul's strong, independent and caring wife. She definitely deserved her Oscar nomination, and Nick Nolte gives us some of the finest work we've seen in fifteen years. Joaquin Phoenix does a nice job in the role of a photo journalist in Rwanda during this time, and Jean Reno is pretty good as the owner of the hotel Paul manages. The cinematography is interesting, and the screenplay is especially compelling. The directing has it's few flaws, but the musical score is always effective in stirring up emotion. <br/><br/>All in all, 'Hotel Rwanda' is definitely worth renting and/or buying on DVD. You can count on me having it in my DVD collection in the not-so-distant future. I think all the U.N. members elected during this time should be forced to watch it and confront their decision not to help out these poor people, especially Bill Clinton.

I watched this movie with my teenage son, and felt it was important for him to not just ""see"" but to ""feel"" the sense of dread and fear that the people of Rwanda were feeling-which this movie portrayed very well. Some movies go over the top with the graphic scenes for the shock factor, and some movies portray unrealistic heroes-the knight in shining armor that saves the world-but this movie was very real for me. The actors did an excellent job portraying emotions of fear, horror and confusion of the Rwandan people along with love, graciousness and humility.<br/><br/>This movie kept our interest from start to finish. I think this is Don Cheadle's best performance to date. Joaquin Phoenix has a small role, but one very powerful statement that I believe hit home for many people. Don Cheadle should have won an Oscar. Paul Rusesabagina should be commended for his bravery, wit, humility and compassion. A very worthwhile film."

The twisting story helped elucidate the political complexity. To the extent that the story is true, it showed the remarkable courage and ingenuity of Paul, his wife, and a UN peace-keeper, all operating under unimaginable pressure.

With most of the world unconcerned and unsympathetic, and U.N. peace-keepers ineffective, the Hutu's had a green-light to slaughter more than one-million Tutsi's.<br/><br/>Paul is married to a Tutsi (played by Actress Sophie Okonedo) and decided to allow Tutsi refugees to live in the hotel; holding off the soldiers with bribes such as wine. But bribery only works for some time as his wine reserves begin to run dry and he is forced to make hard decisions and take a stand to save not only the Tutsi people, but also his half-Tutsi family.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda is a very important movie that shows how senseless religious and cultural hatred could result in the decimation of so many innocent lives. It also demonstrates how little the world truly cared about this little country and it's Cival War, as one character put it: ""If people see this footage, they'll go, 'Oh my God! Thats horrible!"" then go on eating their dinner."" During some scenes, the movie is raw and violent, but it's true eminence and heart comes from the emotional struggle Paul has to endure to save the people he loves and the people he has developed bonds with. Hotel Rwanda is a powerful movie with a throat-clenching, underlying message of what happens when humanity is lost in the harshness of war, and reclaimed in one person's quest to ask why.<br/><br/>-Rawan Aqil"

","A fantastic film depicting the untold story about what the UN did not do about the genocide that killed nearly 1 million people in Rwanda in 1994. An outstanding performance by Don Cheadle playing a Rwandese international hotel manager, who bought into the story that the UN would not abandon them. As Cheadle comes to understand that he was duped by the rhetoric Joaquin Phoenix, who plays a reporter assigned to cover Rwanda, suggests that the most likely reaction of the western world after watching the horrible footage on the news would be: ""They will say how horrible, and will go on eating their dinner."" The lack of an international intervention force, in a situation when it was truly needed, is one of the main points of this movie. Along the similar lines, I would recommend ""No Man's Land"", about the Balkans war. Food for thought."
"dj_bassett","Null","2","3","18 March 2005"," Fine drama, highlighted by masterful Cheadle performance
","Obvious comparisons to SCHINDLER'S LIST can be made, and this is not the grim masterpiece that film was. This one plays it safe and conventional a bit too often, hitting discordant notes of forced Hollywood catharsis and grand moments and the like. I disliked Joaquin Phoenix's pro forma guilty white liberal, and I think Nolte was simply miscast as the impotent UN general.<br/><br/>All that said, the movie succeeds far more often than it fails. For every wrong note there's a bunch of absolutely right ones, and some of the dramatic crescendos are riveting (the bodies on the road and Cheadle's subsequent breakdown, for instance). Those who would criticize the movie for it's conventional structure ignore the power such conventions have: an event like the Rwandan genocide is beyond any one viewer's ken to grapple with -- it is these very conventions which enable the viewer to engage with the subject matter.<br/><br/>Cheadle is superb as the hotel manager who becomes a reluctant savior. Throughout he's a man consumed with the value of appearances; what's fascinating is we see him plausibly shift from believing in a phantasm-like symbol behind those appearances to using his skill with appearances to accomplish other, better goals. Unlike SCHINDLER's Liam Neeson, Cheadle is a real, plausible human being. I think this is the best thing he's ever done in the movies. As his wife, Sophie Okanedo does a fine job with a rather underwritten role: it's to her credit that she makes such an essentially passive character believable and memorable.<br/><br/>Has it's faults, but mostly very fine, and shamefully does not seem to have garnered the audience in America it deserved."

","This movie was outright fantastic. Having seen both this film and Ray I felt that Don Cheadle deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture over Jamie Foxx (and, mind you, I think Jamie Foxx did an EXCELLENT job himself). The fact that this film wasn't nominated for Best Picture is outright ridiculous. This important film is very emotional and will leave you wondering what you were doing while all of this was going on. Most of us were watching OJ Simpson's trial.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle's emotional performance deserves high praise. The scene where he is arguing with the general in the office of the Hotel Diplomat is his best work overall. I couldn't believe the outright emotion this man put into his strong performance. The death scenes are tear-jerking while abstaining from graphic violence. Death is never glorified in this film. You'll also be amazed by the driving scene by the river.<br/><br/>I especially liked the mise-en-scene (did I spell it correctly?) that showed issues of Time Magazine in the background with Bill Clinton's face featured prominently. I don't feel this film bashes Clinton or the United States specifically -- instead it makes us all feel guilty for being blissfully unaware the entire time. The media coverage here in the United States was centered around OJ and 2 deaths while 800,000 were dying elsewhere. While the film never states this, it becomes obvious when one finally realizes what they were watching on TV during this time.<br/><br/>This film is a must-see for anyone who was an adult in 1994. While it is not a ""feelgood"" film it is powerful and emotional. Easily the best film I've seen in quite some time."

","When referring to ""genocide"", the average American would automatically correlate the word to the Holocaust. However, it's amazing to think that the Western nations allowed another genocide to occur that could have been so easily prevented. I would find it hard to believe if 5% of the American population knew that a million Africans died in Rwanda. However, it's that fact that makes the desperation and isolation of the primary characters in this film seem so terrifying and heart-wrenching to the viewer. If for no other reason, but to awaken Westerners to the genocide in Africa this film would have served great purpose.<br/><br/>However, the brave story within the story is what separates the film form simply a tragic historical piece into one of the best films of the year. Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo provide depth and believability to rich characters wrought with unconceivable choices and bravery. It is a great story of survival and you should leave the film feeling guilty why you didn't know why you know this was happening and why Western leaders didn't stop it."

Words cannot describe the feelings that came over me while I watched this movie....it wasn't even like watching a movie I felt like the outcome of this story would be the outcome of the world. As I watched it the gravity of what happened hit me and it was impossible to even consider the making of the film. Even so now thinking back on it, the portrayal of such an event with so much compassion is so smooth that the desired affect is reached. It drew me in so much that all I have words for is that this is the closest I have ever come to so much sadness and so much determination to survive. At the same time that it is completely depressing and eyeopening it is motivational. I don't want to be one of those people that goes back to eating their dinner after remarking on the misfortune of others."
"cterni","Null","2","3","29 January 2005"," What about Sudan?
","I do think people should see this film. Don Cheadle's performance is stunning, perhaps reaching its apex when the film's script seems to take a page from Franz Fanon. Paul Rusesabagina realizes that the he spent his career working for a group of people who ultimately care little about the fate of Africans. In his European suit and tie, he stands in stark contrast to the bright-clothed Hutus threatening to kill his family and their Tutsi neighbors. His connections to Europe, however, provide him only with tenuous protection.<br/><br/>My critique of the film is echoed in one of the message board comments, one that suggests that 'the West' should stay out of Africa, given the problems created by colonial and post-colonial interventions. Very little historical context is provided in the film for the Hutu aggression against the Tutsis, and as such, it's possible to read the entire film as another example of violent African tribalism. In other words, it's possible to suggest that the West, having made a big enough mess of Africa already, should just leave people there to their own devices.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the 60-year anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz has just passed. Many commentators on that anniversary stressed the necessity of ensuring that such a massacre never takes place again. It is precisely the same kind of massacre that took place in Rwanda in 1994, and is now taking place in Sudan. My greatest hope for this film is that people see it and realize, first, the terrible mistake made by the US in abandoning Rwandan Tutsis to their murderers, and second realize the importance of intervening in Sudan in a way that actually makes a difference.<br/><br/>My last comment, somewhat disconnected from the main purpose of this post, is simply that one of the most affecting portions of the film features a radio broadcast from the Hutu militants, enjoining Hutus to ""cut down the tall trees"" and ""squash the cockroaches,"" referring to the Tutsis. I heard a recording of the Hutu power broadcasts during my first visit to South Africa in 2002, and I remember the fear they produced in me even then, in a bright, sunlit room on a university campus. Hearing the broadcasts again in the movie theatre only heightened my awareness of the terrible obstacles the Tutsi faced during the genocide."

","""Hotel Rwanda"" masterfully humanizes the enormity of the Rwandan genocide by focusing on the sane humanity of one man and his family when the whole world around them has gone insane. It ranks with ""Schindler's List"" as a film and a statement of the potential for action when faced with man's inhumanity to man.<br/><br/>It is not just Don Cheadle's superb inhabitation of the real life hero Paul Rusesabagina that makes this film captivating. Co-writers Keir Pearson and director Terry George (who has previously shown through Irish films his understanding of fratricidal civil war engendered by colonialism) do more than guide us step-by-step through the facts of a few horrific days in 1994.<br/><br/>We also see the transformation of a man who had benefited in an ironic oasis of a four-star Belgian tourist resort as a proud Hutu accomodationist to elitism, corruption and racism. Less a docudrama like ""Bloody Sunday,"" this is gripping story telling of personal relationships, quick thinking and moral responsibility.<br/><br/>The film is not only edge of your seat suspense on the roller coaster of events to know what happens next to people we get to know (Sophie Okonedo has magical chemistry with Cheadle in portraying his spirited Tutsi wife) but also full of the humor, pathos and individuality of human foibles and emotions.<br/><br/>The wider background to the situation is explained very quickly in passing to a photojournalist moved to care, played by Joaquin Phoenix, as a legacy of racist Belgian rule that sounds like the plot of a classic episode from the original ""Star Trek,"" so is even the more shocking for being true.<br/><br/>We've seen before the agonizing futility of ""the whole world is watching"" hope in films going back to ""Ship of Fools,"" here painfully racist as well, and we've seen films about incomprehensible African strife through the eyes of sympathetic white witnesses that come across like ""Uncle Tom's Cabin."" Revelatory are how the African vs. African tensions are demonstrated, not only the culminating tsunami of violence (the visual gore is minimized such that seeing dead bodies, particularly of children, to the horizon is effectively stomach-turning enough so we don't need to see close-ups of machete wounds), but we are caught up in the build-up to the tensions, the humiliating negotiations to try and maintain civilized behavior, the class clashes, tribal treachery, and the specter of future repercussions, all scarily recreated.<br/><br/>The U.N. peacekeepers, represented by Nick Nolte, are presented more positively, and not as helpless, as their bitter depiction in Yugoslavia in as ""No Man's Land."" The ever-present ranting radio, whose managers have been accused of war crimes, is a frighteningly heard presence in orchestrating the horror.<br/><br/>The closing song, ""Million Voices"" by Wyclef Jean, sounds quite much like Peter Gabriel's tributes to Stephen Biko and Nelson Mandela, but the Afro Celt Sound System's score well exemplifies the movie's theme of a bitter tragedy for African and European cultures."

","Hotel Rwanda engages the viewer in a catastrophe of epic proportions while emphasizing the resilience of human dignity and the tenacity of love. Don Cheadle excels as Paul Rusesabagina, highest-ranking African official at a Belgian-owned luxury hotel in Rwanda, who is left to run the place himself when European staff are recalled amid growing social violence. Paul's first concerns are to protect his family and to maintain a high level of service in the hotel. As the killing frenzy grows around him, so do his compassion and pragmatism, and he gradually opens his heart and the hotel's doors, converting luxurious quarters into a refugee camp. Nothing is overdone, and there is no preaching. But as the chaos spreads, turning neighbor against neighbor, the movie develops moral and artistic power. Private scenes are beautiful and convincing. Crowd scenes are authentic and riveting. Early on, as approaching guns explode and children huddle in fear, a small boy flinches in the crowd. You flinch with him. That's it. You're there.

If that kind of thing happen in my life, I might just kill myself first, I can' accept that kind of thing. I truly think Paul is a big hero, he did something that us can't do, sometimes, he will be afraid too, but he still make himself to clam down, because if he don't do this, then they will all die, he try his best to save all the people in the hotel, instead of to only save him self. That was a great decision, all of people understand Paul can easily save him self and his family, but he still save all of them, even he have a chance to go away, he choose to stay here and help everyone here who can't go away. Even he knows he might lose his family and his life.
He 's just a normal person too, but just this thing make him become a hero, what he choose made him to become a hero. I like this movie very much, it shows the most true thing happened before, it make us to remember the history, but not to remember the hatred."

It makes me feel depressed because a lot of people died and they was innocent, I think I will be despair if I meet those event in my country. I think the UN need to distribute more soldier to stop the massacre and be a peacekeeper so that can let the interhawme be prevented so the massacre will stoped. If I am a citizen in Rwanda , I will find my friend who are abroad and let them help me and if I can get rescued I will take as more refugees as I can.

","I believe in goodness, I don't know about any other Holy entity but if there's anything pure and eternal in this world, in this history we share for the better or the worse, it's definitely ""goodness"". In the same train of thoughts, I believe hatred is more devastating than any devils or divine wraths. Sorry if I sound too metaphysical but that's the emotional state ""Hotel Rwanda"" left me in.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Terry George ten years after the Rwanda massacre. At that time, most viewers knew the numbers but didn't take their full measure. Indeed, why do we insist so much on World War II lessons if no one cares about the last genocide of the twentieth century? Has the African setting something to do with it? Is Africa so connected in the international subconscious to poverty, famine and civil wars that there would never be enough corpses to make the world care? History seemed to proved this right.<br/><br/>No one cared about the genocide and the genocide emerged out of that carelessness, that's its most tragic equation. The film is told from the perspective of a hotel manager who uses the 'Milles Collines' hotel to shelter refugees, protecting them from the Hutus who wish to settle a historical record with their 'enemies'. The man will witness savagery and horror from the view of a hotel balcony before walking among piles of dead bodies, but the toughest lesson of all would be that the victims weren't worth the help of Western countries and that obliviousness killed much faster than machetes.<br/><br/>It's very ironical that it was the Belgian colony that sowed the seeds of the very racism between Hutus and Tutsis, they ruled by dividing before division would implode like a volcano of blood. In a necessary expositional scene, a journalist played by Joaquin Phoenix (who represents our POV) learns that Belgians made the Tutsis the privileged ones on the basis of their tallness, lighter features and even the size of their nostrils. Tutsis would indeed rule Hutus and have more than a few altercations, but in 1994, for any newcomer, these considerations were silly: the journalist sees two girls in the bar, one Hutu, one Tutsi, but they could be twins.<br/><br/>The film doesn't hide the tacit responsibility of the European colonization and makes the absences of reactions from Western countries accessories to mass murders. The film doesn't point an accusing finger because facts speak for themselves, but it shows us the two sides of the same coin. Hutu and Tutsi living, working together, forming families and living in harmony and a radio program alimenting the hatred and asking the Hutu population to get out and ""cut the tall trees"" or kill the ""cockroaches"". The word is used so many times that we almost get used to it.<br/><br/>And naturally, these ugly terms of reference have a strong resonance and remind us of the darkest hours. And it's a credit to the film's central character to have been capable to save so many lives with so little help, the UN contribution was acknowledged through the character of Nick Nolte, a UN peacekeeper left powerless when there was no peace to maintain but who knew when it's necessary to show a gun. But let's get back to the film's hero, because he's a hero. The man is a Hutu, Paul Rusasebegina (Don Cheadle) and married to a Tutsi Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) and together they have children.<br/><br/>Their chances of survival are thin but Paul, once abandoned by his Belgian bosses, knew he couldn't make profits because it meant betraying his family or buying their lives by selling others. Paul chose to jeopardize his life and his family's to save a thousands of Tutsi refugees from the altar of ethnocentric madness, using his hotel as a true oasis of peace. What was a publicity stunt became a reality of ""matter and death"" significance just like the factory in ""Schindler's List"" and it's true the film borrows a lot of elements in he narrative but there's a singular difference.<br/><br/>Indeed, Paul is directly concerned by the tragedy and the hotel is only a temporary situation and he knows it, at any time, the army can come, rebels can attack and his refugees massacred, Paul has no help but only time and skills. And this is what makes the film so riveting: to see this man who's only a civilian, uses what he knows best as a hotel manager to handle the most life-threatening situations. He needs ten minutes to put on a suit and these ten minutes are used to save hundreds of refugee, all it takes is to serve the guests a beer, to be a hotel manager, patient, polite, well-dressed, aware that war makes many profiteers and carpet baggers and you can make business with them.<br/><br/>In a more painful scene where he's asked to shoot at his family, he manages to bargain lives in exchange of money. Paul knows that for as long as he works as a manager and never loses his capability to negotiate, to bribe and even to blackmail with diplomacy, there might be a chance of survival.That's what ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a character study with a horrific war in the backdrop. And it doesn't leave us much time to catch our breath, it's truly a powerful and emotional journey that makes you wish you'd never have to live such a tragedy with your own beloved ones.<br/><br/>As Tatiana, Sophie Okonedo gives a magnificent performance of a mother who's always at the verge of a breakdown and yet keeps enough strength to protect her children, I could feel my heart pounding at the sight of her trembling body. And as Paul, Don Cheadle shines as a man whose best asset is his professionalism and self-control in the middle of chaos. And since I decided to deify goodness, I would call this man not a hero, but a Saint."

The reality of the scenes hits you so hard as to make you think you could be one of those souls stranded in the hotel if you were born under wrong circumstances. The acting, directing, story telling, everything about this movie looks impeccable. Technically, there could be some minor flaws to a trained eye, but the little cinematographic details are simply obstructed by the sheer power of the story. A movie about a million people who were butchered with machetes can't escape the violent and disturbing scenes but the blood and gore were craftily kept spare to keep the focus on human drama. Even then, you feel the violence much more powerfully than cheap Tarantino movies, in which brains and guts are lavishly splattered all over the place for redneck audience consumption.

","It's films like this, whether one hundred percent historically accurate or not, that convince me that any suggestion of 'world peace' is merely a pipe dream. Here you have two warring tribes within the same country that can't get along with each other, resulting in death and bloodshed involving over a million people. And for what? When you come right down to it, what was the essential difference between Tutsi and Hutu? None that I could tell, and quite honestly, none that most of the evil Interhamwe could tell as well unless one admitted to being one or the other. It just makes me so angry.<br/><br/>And as for the United Nations, what exactly is their purpose if they can't take a principled stand in the face of genocide and slaughter? Any minute I was expecting Nick Nolte's character, General Oliver, to take matters into his own hands as he witnessed the persecution and beatings, but no. He was handcuffed by a set of principles laid down by distant bureaucrats with the threat of losing his command if he didn't follow orders.<br/><br/>It's hard not to wind up being cynical after seeing a treatment like this. I have a t-shirt that states 'Losing Faith in Humanity, One Person at a Time', and this film is the embodiment of that sentiment. The real life Paul Rusesabagina, portrayed by Don Cheadle, is a living saint in my book, having the courage and selflessness to look beyond his own family and personal circumstances, to put his life at risk to help both Tutsis and Hutus escape an impossible situation. His most powerful scene, in my estimation, was when Paul realized that the world community was not moving forward to help the Rwandans, challenging his hotel guests and the targeted Tutsis to reach out to anyone they personally knew who could possibly help their situation. It was such a travesty that he had to implore them all to 'shame the world into sending help'."

","Based on the true story of a Rwandan hotel manager who sheltered over a thousand refugees during the 1994 genocide, 'Hotel Rwanda' offers a glimpse at a sad chapter of modern history seldom told. Often mentioned is the blind eye turned by the outside world to what is happening in Rwanda with a key piece of dialogue coming from lead actor Don Cheadle saying that they need to shame the world into helping out. The film is supported by strong performances from not only Cheadle but also Sophie Okonedo as his strong-willed wife who truly rises above stereotype: she is never once fragile, passive or helpless. Upon initial release, the film attained comparisons to 'Schindler's List' with a similar story of a brave man sheltering others in war, however, such comparisons actually reveal some of 'Hotel Rwanda''s shortfalls. Most notably, Cheadle's Paul is honorable and generous from the get-go compared to Oskar Schindler's who gradually progresses from greedy to selfless. Spielberg's inclusion of seemingly random subplots (like the gun that does not go off) also paint a fuller picture of the Holocaust, whereas 'Hotel Rwanda' offers a far more contained portrait of the genocide. And yet, if not the out-and-out masterpiece that some claim it to be, 'Hotel Rwanda' remains quite an accomplished motion picture with tension frequently felt in the air."

","""There's always room"" was the phrase uttered by Paul Rusesabagina at the end which captures the essence of this great film. Hotel Rwanda is a well directed and beautiful film. It captures a shocking and brutal period in human history. Despite a Rwandan genocide in 1994 carried out the Hutu militia as revenge for being oppressed by the Tutsi in previous years Paul's humanity and bravery still prevailed. His qualities and actions could sound like a fictional hero yet it is very real. In the most dire situations the bravest and most humane stand out. Despite different conditions and circumstances Paul Rusesabagina in the film shares similarities with Oscar Schindler in Schindler's list who used his factory to save so many Jewish people. Don Cheadle gives an Oscar worthy performance and more than carries this beautiful yet shocking film as the brave hotel manager who housed and saved so many refugees. A once charming hotel is transformed into a temporary refuge safe haven for many. <br/><br/>Despite showing the harsh realities that once existed this film pointed out the sad truth about the rest of the world in this period. The west and the rest of the world refused to intervene even though there were so many pleas to be saved. A bright light was shone on human nature. Overall this eventful and tragic film was well directed and educational about a dark period in history. Often many forget how many innocent people are affected by civil war and unrest. It only takes a number of instigators to disturb the peace for millions of civilized people. Hollywood and society can benefit from well made and accurate films rather than looking for the nearest gravy train. One can only be thankful for not being stuck in those tough times and for their freedom."

","Based on a true story, this is one of the hardest watching movies I've ever seen. Not even the Holocaust was portrayed in film as hard as we can see in this film, where the theme is Rwanda's genocide, by the eyes of a friendly hotel manager who just wants to protect himself and his family. They are caught in the midst of a series of political and social twists that escalate and turn into a genocidal civil war, and we can see how they suffer and fear for their lives. The way they quickly capture our sympathy turns their fears into our fears, in a powerful and very emotional way. Suddenly, those deaths also affect us and the initial sense of detachment fades. What more could a movie want? Despite this, the film isn't very graphic, we are spared the most painful scenes, although it has many shocking scenes. The film also criticizes the inability of UN to intervene there and save lives. Don Cheadle led the cast and made the biggest film of his career to date, shining in an inspired and profound performance. The environment, the scenery, the costumes... everything was meticulously thought out to reproduce the events and the realism paid of. Although unsuitable for the most suggestible, its one of the most intense films I know."

","Rwandan genocide was a bleak, bloody, ruthless and violent page in African history, and Hutu massacring Tutsi and UN Forces also suffering casualties is no small thing to depict. A bad filmmaker would make this into a sweet melodrama with all the clichés and trite ideas. A good director has made this heavy story into a real must see foe everyone who wanna know about what genocide is and how awful vile people may behave. Terry George made a great work here, showing just one page of that tragic book - hotelier Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu, saving hundreds of both Tutsi and Hutu from immediate murder and shame. His actions are shown as actions not of a super hero, but a mere man of flesh and blood, but with guts and valor to withstand the threat, deceive the killers gently, buy the time, do all one can do in such gruesome situation, and thus save those people. Don Cheadle is a highlight of this as a main hero, and his dignity, vigor, skills and power shine all throughout the movie. Nick Nolte as an UN officer is another great stronghold here, brave and level-headed man of duty and word. Even the cameos of such stars as Joaquin Phoenix or Cara Seymour are absolute treat. And then, there are all those vile, brutal Hutu warriors with machete and guns, cold-blooded and intolerant. They are shown so deeply true that they awake sheer terror and shiver. This is a very good movie and deserves all the praise and attention. 10 out of 10"

","Tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples lead to a civil war in Rwanda, where corruption and bribes between politicians are routine. Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle), the manager of the Sabena owned Hôtel des Mille Collines, is Hutu, but his wife Tatiana (Okonedo), is Tutsi. His marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, most prominently Georges Rutaganda (Kae-Kazim), a friendly goods supplier to the hotel who is also the local leader of Interahamwe, a brutal Hutu militia.<br/><br/>As the political situation in the country worsens following the assassination of the president, Paul and his family observe neighbors being killed in ethnic violence, initiating the early stages of a genocide. Paul curries favor with people of influence, bribing them with money and alcohol, seeking to maintain sufficient influence to keep his family safe. When civil war erupts and a Rwandan Army officer threatens Paul and his neighbors, Paul barely negotiates their safety, and brings them to the hotel. More evacuees arrive at the hotel from the overburdened UN refugee camp, the Red Cross, and various orphanages. Paul must divert the Hutu soldiers, care for the refugees, be a source of strength to his family, and maintain the appearance of a functioning hotel as the situation becomes more violent."
"magilroy","8","1","1","13 December 2016"," Amazing movie depicting Rwandan Genocide
","Hotel Rwanda, directed by Terry George, is an American film that depicts the genocide in Rwanda. The Rwandan Genocide arose from conflicts between two ethnic groups, the Hutus and Tutsis. When the Belgians originally colonized Rwanda, they choose the officials to lead the country according to skin color and nose size that agreed with people in the Tutsis ethnic group. This caused a rift between the two groups thus leading to the genocide. Paul is a Hutu hotel manager for an upper class vacation hotel. His wife and most of his family are Tutsis which eventually leads to their endangerment. After the genocide starts, Paul is dumbfounded by the atrocities that are committed by the Hutus. With the safety of people in mind, Paul decides to help protect Tutsis people by letting them stay at the hotel after all the white vacationers fled from the violence. Paul continuously pays off the generals for protection and calls upon all his resources to help his family and all the refugees as well as stop the genocide. Paul eventually is able to help many of the refugees escape along with his family and two stranded cousins whose parents had been killed. This film is an amazing film that helped me learn and understand the Rwandan Genocide. I would recommend this movie to everyone in order to help educate people so that history does not repeat itself."

","Hotel Rwanda is by far my favorite movie out of all of the ones we have seen. Being the third time I have seen the movie, I was able to pick up things that I did not understand my first or second time around. This movie is American made so we get the happy ending that we do not usually get in this class. The film uses great camera angles. For example I remember seeing a pan of all the dead bodies. Horrible sight to see but very well filmed. I understand that the UN has the job of keeping peace but they should have done more earlier in the film to help the Tutsi. The UN is a lot more helpful towards the end of the film rather than the beginning of it. It is very mind blowing how the Hutus just wanted to wipe out all of the Tutsi just because they were different than them. Tsotsi are smaller, lighter colored and also referred to as cockroaches. I believe that the world should be ashamed of what happened in Rwanda. None of the superpowers helped at all. It makes no sense that America did not intervene because we stick our heads in literally everything. Not many people really even know about this genocide in America and I feel like it has to do with the fact that we did not help them. If we would have helped them everyone to this day would know but because we did not we keep it secretive."

","Before I watched this film I had heard of the Rwandan genocide a few times. It was explained as a really horrific thing which had mass killings of people, that's why going into this movie I was interested in what I would be shown. The way the movie started gave me the American movie type feel, having a successful man with a family running a hotel and of course the language of the film being in English. As soon as the killing started I couldn't quite see why it did, but it turns out the reason was that one ethnic group disliked the other, that's all. In my opinion, the most horrific scene in this movie was when Paul was driving down the ""clear"" road and it was really bumpy and foggy out. Then they discovered that the road was full of dead bodies. I like doing the way the movie ended with Paul's family making it out mostly safe, but I would've liked to see where the young went after they got onto the bus."

","Overall I really enjoyed this movie. I thought that the actors, some who are famous did a really nice job by acting out exactly how the people in Rwanda were feeling during the Rwandan genocide. Although this is not a foreign film, it is very educational, because one who has never really heard about what exactly happened during the Rwandan genocide or know anything about it, can learn something new by watching this film. I particularly liked Paul the best in the movie as he was also one of the main characters. He took the risk, by taking in refugees that were going to get killed, and let them stay in his hotel, which I thought was a very audacious thing to do. I really liked the way that he cared for the other Rwandan people, since he was the one to step up to save them. There are many things that I enjoyed about this movie like, the way it was filmed, and the scenes and emotions that the people showed, but it would have been even better if this film showed the effect that the Genocide had on the Rwandan population and the younger children. This film stressed Paul as a heroic character, not only did he protect his family, but he protected others. I thought this was a great movie, and based on this reasoning I would give it a 5/5 ."

","For starters, I really enjoyed watching this film. The first time I watched it, about 4 years ago, I didn't really pick much up from it. The second time I watched it (this time), I understood so much more and the movie left a much greater impact on me this time. I never really knew there was a genocide in Rwanda, or in any countries really except for the Holocaust. This really opened my eyes about third world countries and in how horrible of a condition most are. One thing I really enjoyed about the film was production quality in general. It has definitely been the highest quality movie we've seen so far in my opinion, aside from films like City of God. I also liked how there were some famous actors in this movie like Jean Reno and Don Cheadle. I feel like these actors helped the movie a lot in terms of how many people would go see it. Since people want to see movies with the actors they like in it, why not make the movie about a serious global issue to bring more eyes to it? There weren't many things I did not like about the movie, if any at all. I felt like some of the not famous actors didn't do the best job, but they still made the movie great. I really liked in the end how Paul and his family found the lost kids of their family friends and how he adopted the entire group almost of lost kids."
"jahouston-96994","7","1","1","14 October 2016"," Informative Movie
","I thought it was very interesting to learn about the genocide. I knew very little about the Rwandan Genocide before I watched the movie. I can't believe there was nobody to protect the people in the hotel. Paul was my favorite character because he never gave up on his guests. He loved his family and just wanted to make them safe, but he was also willing to stay behind and help the people who stayed in the hotel. Paul was genuinely my favorite character I've watched in any movie this year. He was very brave and never thought about just saving himself. Moreover, it was crazy to think that nobody in American politics wanted to help. I think they definitely knew what was going on over there. America intervenes in so many conflicts it just doesn't make any sense as to why they wouldn't help. I was curious as to why people in America didn't help, so I decided to do some research. Not only did America abandon the Rwandan people but also other major powers, like France. When the killing in Rwanda intensified the major powers pulled out. The French set up a ""humanitarian zone"" which is where I guess the people from the hotel ended up in the end of the movie. I guess that was helpful but nobody wanted to go beyond and reach out to pull innocent people into the safe zone. Also, I found an article that said Bill Clinton knew about the mass killing of people in Rwanda but buried the evidence so America wouldn't intervene. The officers who were on the ground in Rwanda used the word Genocide when they described the situation; however, because Bill Clinton had already decided not to intervene the press never got coverage of the killings as a genocide."

","Hotel Rwanda was a very intense, sad, and inspirational film. Before watching this movie I knew a little about the Rwandan genocide. I knew that it was between two ethnic groups, the Hutus and the Tutsis, but I did not really comprehend the amount of deaths or the true atrocity of this genocide until I saw the film. I think that it did a really good job of portraying the horrors of the genocide to the viewers. On top of that, it showed that no country came to the aid of the Tutsis. The UN was there, but they did nothing which really shocked me. I thought that in a humanitarian crisis like the Rwandan genocide the UN would be very concerned and have a lot of involvement in helping the people, but they did not seem to be doing anything at all. I hope that in future crises, the UN would have much more of an impact to stop deaths from occurring. The movie was directed by a Jamaican director who was American trained; this was evident by some aspects of the film including the happy ending, the almost death scenes, and the depiction of some of the characters. I would give this movie ⅘ stars overall."

","""Hotel Rwanda"" is an incredibly sad sort of film. After all, during 1994 between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were murdered--mostly Tutsis hacked to death due to an insane tribal rivalry with the more numerous Hutus. Genocide is not pleasant viewing. However, the film is a bit easier to watch than it could be, as most of the scenes of the slaughter are pretty tame. This isn't really a complaint--it doesn't deny the killings but it also doesn't show a lot of hacked off limbs and bodies (though there are quite a few of the latter). I appreciate how the MPAA changed their minds and re-rated the film PG-13 instead of R, as R would seem to imply that it's not a film for a wide audience. Folks should see this film.<br/><br/>Instead of ""Hotel Rwanda"" showing the violence in a general fashion, it focuses on a very brave man. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) was the man who ran the swank Hotel Rwanda around the time of the genocide. In a very brave move, he opened the hotel to the Tutsi (who were being massacred) and created a tenuous safe haven. However, when the UN pulled out (as the UN did what it usually does in these situations...NOTHING!), Rusesabinga had to learn on the fly to work with the ruling powers, the mobs and the few remaining UN troops (though most had left). Rusesabinga managed to not only save his family (his wife was Tutsi and children half-Tutsi) but 1200 people through his heroics. The film shows the way he connived and begged and worked to make this possible in the midst of Hell.<br/><br/>The film is a high quality and well made product. Not surprisingly it's on the IMDb Top 250 list and it also was nominated for three Oscars (including one for Cheadle who sure sounded African to my untrained ears). And, not surprisingly, it's an awfully tough film to watch. I don't recommend it for very young audiences but folks need to see this film and realize we have not come that far as a world. And, it's sad the film and other films about Rwanda during this period didn't come out until a decade after the massacres. It also makes you realize just how far from its original charter the UN has gone--it SHOULD have been able to take a stand against such evil."

","What were you doing in 1994? I was probably rockin to Soundgarden's latest album on my portable CD player, waiting for Seinfeld to come on while pondering the OJ Simpson murder case, the ""news of the century.""<br/><br/>Meanwhile, as many as one million people were being butchered with machetes, raped and tortured by their fellow humans, as an entire nation collectively lost its mind.<br/><br/>Suddenly Seinfeld ain't so funny.<br/><br/>This film is epic, if for the sole reason that it brings to light a horrific chapter of human history that many of us would otherwise know nothing of. Let me repeat: as many as 1 million people (the population of North Dakota and Wyoming combined) were slaughtered, and the politicians of the western world did nothing to stop it, and the media never gave it 1/1000th as much air time as OJ. Yes, it is a disturbing film, but it focuses on the brave struggle of one individual in his efforts to save as many lives as possible. So it is also a very inspiring film.<br/><br/>To be honest I was too engrossed in the story to be able to review this movie on technical merits such as acting, cinematography, musical score, etc. I believe that is the way to watch this film; it is not a film, it is an experience. A lesson. A reminder that, while we live our comfortable lives in 1080p HD Blu-Ray comfort, we have no clue what is going on with ""the other half"".<br/><br/>I will say that every performance was very convincing, and several scenes could be called poetic if they weren't so disturbing (I'm referring to the river road in the fog... but you'll see what I mean). I was instantly pulled in by Don Cheadle as the ""everyman"" hero of the story, and I was equally intent on supporting cast members such as Nick Nolte whose character was based on Canadian general Dallaire (even though the real Dallaire was never consulted about this film).<br/><br/>It's crazy, but you'll have to keep reminding yourself that this story is real, even though its plot is as preposterous as the craziest Hollywood fiction you've seen.<br/><br/>This is a film I highly recommend to people who like to get involved. Whether you're a political activist, whether you volunteer walking dogs at your local animal shelter, or whether you blog about life in general, this is a film for you. Yes, it will upset you. But I think in the end it will get you stoked to get out there and change this damaged world."

Soon enough, the violence escalates, and the Hutus begin their genocide of the Tutsis. European guests and staff at the hotel are flown out of the country, and Paul is left in charge. He finds that his conscience won't allow him to watch as the innocent are slaughtered, and before long, the hotel has become a well-appointed refugee camp. Paul is seen as a traitor by some, putting his life in danger, and the predicament of his ""guests"" grows more precarious every day, but despite good intentions on the part of a journalist and a UN peacekeeping colonel, the rest of the world is not eager to intervene and stop the massacre.<br/><br/>This is a sobering and heartfelt tale about massacre that took place in Rwanda while most of the world looked away.The almost forgotten but all too real African genocide documented in Hotel Rwanda hits us as suddenly and as hard as it does Paul Rusesabagina, the accidental hero played so masterfully by Don Cheadle.

One major Hutu henchmen character, George, stated it this way.<br/><br/>'""We're half way there.""<br/><br/>The screen play is a compelling story. Paul, (reprised masterfully by Don Cheadle) is a front-line manager at the 4 Star Des Milles Collines hotel in Kigali, Rwanda's capitol. His colonial employers, the Sabena Corporation, are headquartered in Europe, Belgium to be specific.<br/><br/>No doubt the former colonial rulers of this land still take pride in their African possession. Their resort hotel is an oasis in the hot sun not only to tourists but to foreign diplomats, international press, and domestic government officials.<br/><br/>One of the Rwandan Army's top generals (later convicted for his role in the genocide) in the region is a frequent visitor. Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) head of the U.N. Peacekeeping force (sparse) also is an honored guest. We learn soon that the U.N. Colonel Oliver and the good Hutu general share a common trait. The both enjoy the elixir that the staff serves: imported single malt Scotch whiskey.<br/><br/>Paul made sure the bar was always well stocked with good spirits. For certain, life at the hotel was like that of any other African resort: relaxed and far from the maddening crowd and wild animals. Both locals and hotel guests alike enjoy their stays. <br/><br/>Paul sees to it, sometimes personally. In his presence, people are treated royally. His and the hotel's reputation depend on it.<br/><br/>And who wouldn't want to kick up their heels in the hotel's air conditioned bar after a hot day in the Central African sun? For about 30-40 minutes I too succumbed to the hotel's luxurious ambiance and decadent pleasures. Yes, even Cohibas, the finest Cuban cigars were offered to select guests.<br/><br/>Then the dogs of war are let loose. Rumors abound that the Hutu President was assassinated. The head of state was bound for Tanzania to sign a peace agreement with the rebel Tutsi opposition group. Later we learn from the Hutu dominated press (radio) the earlier terrible reports indeed are true.<br/><br/>The Hutu media is quick to add their bias: the traitor Tutsi rebels performed the dastardly deed. Paul disagreed. So did I.<br/><br/>However, the confirmed news and later evacuation of all foreign nationals from Rwanda (only if you're white or the holder of a foreign passport) places Paul, in a serious bind. He and he alone must now fend for and protect those 'guests' forced to stay.<br/><br/>Many of the refugees are Tutsis. Knowing that fact, the Hutu machete wielding militia await outside the gates. With the grounds left unguarded, the Hutus no doubt will invade. Then the feeding (killing) frenzy starts.<br/><br/>Their mission: kill all the traitor 'cockroaches'. That meant the Tutsis were to be singled out. Even the U.N. blinked. They laid an egg but not before Col. Nick announced that the pretty blue helmeted U.N. Armed Force was ordered to pull out of the hotel guarding business, permanently. No surprise there...<br/><br/>Now the their situation looks hopeless. Surrounded all around by bloodthirsty Hutu militia, their supplies cut off, even the water, Paul prepares for the inevitable. He asks each guest to call a friend.<br/><br/>In his own words, Paul knows exactly what to do: play the guilt card. He also instructs his guests on how to say 'Goodbye'.<br/><br/>""Make them (friends) feel ashamed.""<br/><br/>Now knowing the true aftermath of the slaughter (almost 1 million), I couldn't find fault with his tack."

Also Sophie Okonado appeared in this film who is also famous for appearing in 'Skin'. The whole film was made very emotional by the horrific and happy scenes.The film made me think about what people will do to save people's lives.I believe that Don Cheadle was the best actor in this film due to the role he played and the way he showed his emotions. the scene i remember most is when Paul is looking for his wife.The part of the film that made me feel good was when Paul's family were hiding in the shower.The best bad guy in the film is the leader if the interhamwhe.Paul was the best good guy due to what he did to save these people's lives.I would gladly recommend this film to people between the age of 13-16.I chose this age group because it is very informative of what really happened not long before their birth."

","Imagine that you have the responsibility of a hundred lives. You are watching your only hope going away while you are standing in the rain and can do nothing but save as many lives you can...<br/><br/>You won't understand this unless you have seen the movie. Hotel Rwanda is a fragment of cinema that shows the ugly truth of this world: Life is not always fair. This movie is marvelous, not because it's based on true events it's because the cameras captured the recreated events very beautifully. There is a reason why this movie has a low rating on IMDb. (yes it's quite low in my opinion) It deserves to be with Movies like Schindler's List and Godfather. You will know that reason once you have seen it. <br/><br/>Don Cheadle was great and I was surprised that he didn't won the Oscar. The performances really are great. Especially in the scene when all the foreign tourists are leaving the hotel and Paul watches them, standing in the rain, as they go away safely from the riots leaving the Rwandans... the emotions run deep. You even see a lady holding a dog in the bus. Now that's creativity! <br/><br/>I would recommend this to everyone. It's a unique movie with a very different style of film-making. And surprisingly, it's entertaining too. Hats off to Hotel Rwanda and 10/10."

","A fascinating story, and a subject that I'm pleased to have learned slightly more (ie. something) about: the Rwandan civil war and genocide of the mid-nineties, and how it was played down and ignored by the West.<br/><br/>The central performance by Don Cheadle is strong and his character likable and understandable. However, most of the characters were barely developed at all. An awful lot of story is crammed in, and most of it is only lightly brushed over - I think it would have worked better if some elements were left out and the remaining ones covered in more depth. Worse, the tone of the film started very well, but became increasingly syrupy as it went on. However, the story-telling is very efficient, especially at the beginning; it wasn't difficult to follow a fairly complex plot and it maintained my interest all the way through.<br/><br/>Well worth a watch, but I won't be buying it."
"thomvic","10","1","1","12 October 2010"," An amazing emotionally drenching film that you can't take your eyes off
","I didn't know much of the genocide that happened at Rwanda though I had heard brief talkings of it so this film was very intriguing for me to watch. What starts out as a man called Paul (played magnificently by Don Cheadle) who has the unfortunate burden of being the protector of hundreds of people who will surely be killed by the opposing party during a civil war. What we see is the conflicts of these characters who are trying to stay alive as the world abandons them.<br/><br/>This film is truly gripping from start to finish. It is a very powerful film that makes you care about the characters so much and makes you marvel at the cruelty of humanity. What you see is a man who does not want to get involved in the corrupt politics of his surroundings and just wants to run a nice hotel, but then ultimately becomes the hero to many people in order to save them. You also learn of the selfishness of powerful countries such as America an the UK in how they simply do not see countries such as Rwanda as of any significance for them.<br/><br/>The film has terrific performances from everyone, the violence is not as bloody as what I thought it would be but it has a high degree of realism that it becomes violent in your mind and through what you can only imagine is happening in the slaughter. A movie like this can only bring out the compassion in you, and I would find it hard to believe that you would not be moved by this film. <br/><br/>Essentially, this is a story that is really nothing new, as it is a movie that you probably can predict it going in a certain way, but you really don't care. You just get swept up in this magnificent tale of a man simply aiming to protect the people of a nation that has gone into turmoil. This is a masterpiece!"

","Films like this remind me why life is just one big ball of tragedy. It is very difficult to live life happily unless all these horrible facts of reality are summarily swept under the proverbial rug in our minds. Don Cheadle does a reasonably OK job in his role as the messianic hero, although his face is usually stamped with helpless despair most of the time, a lot of time the fact that he is acting oozes through the lens a little too intensely. The film tap-dances around the horrific violence going on in the periphery, there is minimal on-screen violence shown. I was always waiting for the other shoe to drop and there be an actual depiction of the massacre going on. But, in the end, it was an attempt to shed some light on the Western world's indifference to the suffering of a split-off continent that is kept in captivity by the superpowers, kind of reminds me of the film ""Martyrs"", except in geographic terms, and applied to about 1 billion people in 54 countries. Now, the ridiculous thing about this movie, in my opinion, is how the main actor does this ""heroic"" thing for all the refugees, and yet ends up leaving his country and moving to Belgium, where it's all white and safe; again, the racial and economic split is created, but people swallow it easier since the actor is black, but the egregious disregard for human life is eternally stamped on the final message of this film... after all, who cares if 700,000 people lost their lives in this atrocious genocide, as long as the charismatic wealthy hero who knew all the right white guys comes out unscathed?"
"peter_hyde","7","1","1","25 April 2010"," Over rated
","I just saw Hotel Rwanda on PBS, and after reading other reviews here, I must admit I felt let down. It was admittedly well made, but didn't leave any lasting impression. Probably because it was basically an excellent solo show by Don Cheadle. Sophie Okonedo was badly miscast; whoever saw a Tutsi that light-complexioned? Nick Nolte just wasn't believable as a General. Some may criticise me for being too bloodthirsty, but apart from the episode when Cheadle was driving over the bodies in the road, the depiction of the treatment of Tutsi was too long-range and detached. It seemed like a news report viewed from a distance, without any real involvement. This is the story of an horrific episode, but fails to press its point."
"KineticSeoul","7","1","1","16 April 2010"," A bit overrated but worth the time to see at least once
","Some people say that this is like the African version of ""Schindler's List"" now I wouldn't go that far, but it still is a fantastic and powerful film. The movie is basically about the Rwandan Genocide that took place in 1994, where many Tutsi are killed by the Hutu extremists. Probably hardly any one cared about this atrocity that didn't have to go through it and I enjoyed the aspects of it showing why. Don Cheadle really was perfect for this role, and he put on a great performance here and it's one of those films he most definitely was worth being in. There is also a deep message, although it isn't a movie I would see multiple times or anything, but it was most definitely worth the time to see it at least once. If I can name one flaws is that you don't really care about the people that are trying to survive from the genocide, but maybe that is just the realistic aspect of it and why the message behind this film is deep.<br/><br/>7.9/10"
"kcollis1985","7","1","1","11 December 2009"," Not terrible, but certainly not great.
","The story is inspiring, and the film deserves praise for shining a spotlight on issues that the west chooses to ignore. So, whilst it may seem uncharitable to criticise, it would be patronising to overlook the glaring faults. Even though the film isn't that bad, it is disappointing. The problem is that the film-making is second rate - you can't help but be distracted by the mechanics of the film. <br/><br/>The film is overscored. Barely a line of dialogue passes without music telling the audience what they ought to be feeling. This device demeans and patronises the viewer. The blatant product placement throughout the film destroys any attempt at nuance or subtlety. You can't help but pity the actors who have to perform awful dialogue about beer brands or car manufacturers. Even when they are not forced to read dialogue that might as well have come from an infomercial, the dialogue is clunky - and at times woeful. The result is a stack of poorly developed, two- dimensional characters. <br/><br/>Social/ political/ historical complexities are either ignored our disposed of in one line. The Hutus are largely portrayed as soulless killing machines pitted against our 'western-friendly' bourgeois hero (the only good Hutu), his family, and periphery characters. The result is that scenes start to feel more like a horror movie than a serious drama. Inexplicably, the filmmakers deliberately chose to omit actual events (possibly to ensure a PG-13 certificate), which would have given the film a greater sense of jeopardy for main characters.<br/><br/>It's a credit to the actors involved that some of them manage to feel in any way human. Particular credit is due to Sophie Okonedo who is required to make ridiculous mood swings feel believable. Joaquin Phoenix also does well. <br/><br/>Not terrible, but certainly not great."

","Hotel Rwanda is the true story of a real life hero, who risked everything he had, too save as many as he could; while the governments of the world that could have helped, stood by and did nothing. Obvious comparisons have been made between this and Schindler's list, and the harrowing truths in both films do stir the emotions and enlighten the blind to the real tragedies in the world, but the films and the stories within them are very different.<br/><br/>Just over ten years ago some of the worst atrocities in the history of mankind took place in the country of Rwanda, and yet in the media driven world in which we live; these events went almost unnoticed by the general public and were ignored by the powers that may have helped.<br/><br/>Even without the production quality of Schindler's list, this film still proves to be equally as powerful; so much so, that i felt ashamed that such things had really happened during my adult life, and i'm sure anyone who sees this movie will feel the same way.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle excellently portrays the hero, a ordinary man named Paul Rusesabagina, who offered shelter to over a thousand people at great risk to himself and his own family. Over a period of just three months; one million people were brutally murdered, and if one man managed to save over one thousand others, imagine how many could and should have been spared their terrible fate.<br/><br/>The story simply has to move you, even if the film itself may appear a little cheap looking, but to me it isn't, it's realistic and shocking.<br/><br/>9/10 Well done"
"udayp_00","10","1","1","11 December 2006"," A must watch movie for its brilliant portrayal of varied human personalities
","It is a hard hitting civil war(between the rebelling Tutsis and the ruling Hutus) movie based on true incidents during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It depicts how the central character Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu, manager of a four-star Hotel uses his diplomatic skills and political contacts tries to save hordes of Tutsis while he himself is in grave danger of being hunted down by the Hutus for harboring Tutsis. It depicts wonderfully how gruesome ethnic hatred is induced by the State to maintain its political clout. A wonderful melange of politics at various hierarchies. It depicts how regional politics for control instigates mob mentality and gruesome genocide, how international politics keeps UN from taking any affirmative action, how individual politics played by Paul Rusesabagina helps save lives. It skillfully presents the contrast between how common people torn by ethnic strife and witness to thousands of killings, many of them near and dear, accept their fate while some others in power try to extract every single ounce they can to fulfill their personal greed. A must watch movie for its brilliant portrayal of varied human personalities. <br/><br/>PS: A brief perspective on the Rwanda genocide can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide . The book by UN general Lieutenant-General RomÃ©o Dallaire ""Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda"" and the documentary film with the same name are definitely worth a watch. While watching the movie I could not stop thinking about how history teaches us nothing. After the Rwandan genocide, every one went about condemning the genocide, the world body has setup a war crimes tribunal, Bill Clinton has termed the genocide the biggest failure of his administration and still today we have Iraq burning on the same ethnic conflict, Darfur in Sudan enduring a killing of 400,000 people(and that's just the official figure). Hope history teaches us something. Still I'm sure, in future, politics will be played and men in power(or the others seeking it) will try to instigate petty differences among people to fulfill their own ambitions. But, let's hope this is not done at the cost of millions and millions of lives for human life is too precious to be lost on the basis of some caste or creed. Obviously the change won't come from the preperators of these heinous crimes as they have high stakes in the game. But the sufferers are just puppets in the show. They should be aware of the fact that they remain the ones who bore the brunt of the conflict no matter which ""side"" belonged and no matter which ever side ""wins"". They should abandon the mob mentality. Only then will there be hope and only then may be history won't repeat itself."

","I watched this film only recently, and what an eye opener, as a westerner i only heard about the genocide through the the news but since reading certain reviews and commentaries, it bought a tear to my eyes. The parts played by all were heart felt and even though i cannot begin to understand what it was like. I give this film a 10 out of 10 i know this world is full of hatred and barbarians but................. never have i been moved by a scene such as the misty road scene. The struggles and trials and tribulations of Don Cheadle playing Paul a man ""playing both sides"" and his ""cockroach"" family and staff make me wonder exactly what the character and indeed the actor went through to achieve the tension the success and the horror to what the people of Rwanda must and did go through. The scenes were beautifully shot and even the ""chopping"" were to add a sense of reality to the situation for want of a better word. It can be compared to ""Schindlers List"" and even ""Saving Private Ryan"" for the ""Reality"" of the world today that it brings. The atrocities of the police chief and the warehouse people taking ""Paul"" as a dedicated Hutu but not quite understanding him as a man with morals and beliefs was easy to see but then again hard to understand. What makes this world react like this apart from religion, beliefs and politics."

","The most impressed movie that I ever saw was ""Hotel Rwanda.""<br/><br/>I saw many kinds of movie before, but watching this movie, I cried for the first time. Hotel Rwanda is a true story. It is about a fight of a race between Hutu and Tutsi in 1994. At first, Tutsi was stronger than Hutu but the position changed. A man, who ran a famous hotel had a family. Three children and a wife. They were living happily. However, the war was getting more severe and many people were killed or forced, especially Tutsi. The man was Hutu and his rest of his family was Tutsi so they were in danger. He desperately tries to protect his family but what will happen at the end.<br/><br/>I like this movie for many reasons. First, their acting was really great. I think Japanese can't do this kind of acting. Second, the song which sung after the movie impressed me deeply. I can't forget that song. Third, The violence scene was so grotesque that it was like a real one.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie, nobody will say ""I didn't cry."""
"raina_bee87","10","1","1","24 July 2006"," Top Notch
","Grade: A<br/><br/>Terry George's sober-sided and ham-fisted Hotel Rwanda is a caustic indictment of Western indifference to atrocities committed in the world's rawer precincts. It reminds us that we have short memories and shorter attention spans and most newspapers these days cede coverage of foreign events to the various cable news networks. We pay little attention to the internecine tribulations of savage foreigners so long as only brown or yellow people are involved. <br/><br/>And so, a decade after the slaughter of nearly a million Rwandan Tutsi by their Hutu countrymen, many Americans may be surprised to learn that such atrocities took place -- that the powder blue helmets of United Nations peacekeepers could virtually stand aside for genocide. Even the division of the Rwandans into Hutus and Tutsi can be laid at the feet of the West -- it was Belgian colonists who decided the slender, lighter-skinned Tutsis were superior to their Hutu brothers and required that all citizens carry identity cards that identified them by their ethnicity. For decades, the Belgians encouraged the belief that the Tutsi minority was superior to the Hutus. Tutsi were favored with better educational opportunities and jobs than the Hutu, with predictable results: In 1959, 20,000 Tutsis were killed in a series of riots. When Belgium relinquished control of Rwanda in 1962, the Hutu majority adopted the Tutsi as an all-purpose scapegoat. Some Tutsis fled to Uganda and -- along with some moderate Hutus -- formed an opposition group called the Rwandan Patriotic Front. <br/><br/>In the midst of this maelstrom, Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu hotel manager with European manners and training, was able to save more than 1,200 endangered Rwandans by passing them off as ""guests"" at the Belgian-owned Milles Collines resort in Kigali. Rusesabagina has so often been compared to Oskar Schindler, the Czech industrialist who saved the lives of thousands of Polish Jews during World War II, that the comparison feels easy and reflexive, but the truth is Rusesabagina performed a miracle in Kigali. As played by the ever-efficient Don Cheadle, Rusesabagina is the ultimate concierge. He knows his clients and uses a brutal general's taste for single-malt Scotch and Cohiba cigars to buy time and protection for his charges. A walking argument for decency, we see sublimated anger flashing in his civilized eyes as he deals with all sides to maintain his makeshift sanctuary. A product of European grooming, Rusesabagina can't quite believe that he -- and his people -- have been abandoned by those he'd considered his friends. Cheadle admits a trace of hubris to his character; Rusesabagina's horror at being abandoned mingles with disgruntlement at being not quite a full-fledged member of the corporate family. <br/><br/>Director George isn't as subtle as Cheadle. He's an old Irish Republican who tends to see the world in strident shades, but he has got hold of a subject worthy of his righteous anger. And he has cast it with fine actors -- Nick Nolte quakes with self-disgust as a Canadian colonel ashamed of the orders he has to follow. Sophie Okonedo is brilliant as Rusesabagina's Tutsi wife, Tatiana."
"The_Triad","7","1","1","22 June 2006"," An important film.
","Hotel Rwanda is an important film, it's subject matter is of an extremely serious nature, in a similar to the likes of Schindler's List. It depicts the events of a genocide in Rwanda in 1994, during which Hutu man Paul Rusesabagina shelters the endangered Tutsi civilians from the angry machete-armed Hutus. The film handles it's subject matter very well, telling precisely why these two ""types"" of people, (they are really only different in name, which was given to them by Belgian imperialists based on vague classifications) are not getting along, without being too simple. The film than follows the Schindler's List formula, with Paul trying to shelter as many of the Tutsis that come his way, and hold off the Hutus for as long as possible. The acting, script, score, cinematography etc. are all of a good standard, though nothing really stood out for me (which in this case is a good thing as it enhances the realism). The film should also be praised for challenging the viewers watching, in a line that Jack Daglish's character (the cameraman) says. The film is difficult to watch at times, and works as it's own film very well. It's only major failing is that it may seem a bit samey for those who have seen Schindler's List, or even Lord of War, or any other film with genocide as the subject matter."
"canuckster1127","10","1","1","18 June 2006"," Outstanding on several levels
","Hotel Rwanda is a remarkable film that borders between social commentary, documentary, and character study in the Main Character - Paul Rusesabagina, portrayed brilliantly by Don Cheadle.<br/><br/>Filmed in South Africa, it includes documentary film of actual events woven subtly into the film.<br/><br/>The film resists a tremendous amount of temptation to lapse into social preaching, shaming and condemnation of those nations that stood by or left in the advent of what can only be described as genocide; despite the unwillingness of those countries that fled, to use the word. The subtle nature of what does exist in that realm, is in fact more effective simply presented in the overwhelming imagery of the unimaginable, horrifying scope of events as they played out.<br/><br/>It boggles the mind that the Western World could have been so complacent and indifferent. In the US at the time, we had more important things to focus upon in the media. The O.J. Simpson Trial took center stage and this did not raise to the level of importance to even be a lead story. Bill Clinton identifies this as his single greatest regret of his presidency that he did not use his power, influence and resources to act. There is no excuse that can be offered to justify that lapse. Bill Clinton in this instance, more than any other, had greatness within his grasp to act with the greatest impact upon Human History and demonstrate the values he claimed to possess. Yet he failed to do so. We in the US failed along with him.<br/><br/>Paul Rusesabagina presents a rich study in Character and Leadership. Others examining this film have identified his leadership in the film as situational and there is no question that a strong progression takes place from the beginning of the film where he cannot go beyond his gate in watching a neighbor brutalized to the end of the film where he has taken personal ownership of the fate of over 1,200 refugees to the extent that he is willing to remain behind and send his family to ""safety"" without him.<br/><br/>On may argue that circumstances dictated responses, and there is no doubt that incredible pressures skewed the responses portrayed. However, there were choices to be made and alternatives available that seemingly offered more direct or immediate results. What we witness is a man faced with impossible demands and challenges who must reach deep within to draw forth a higher level of leadership, a servant-leader who elevates the needs of others above his own.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a remarkable film. One can only hope that the multitude of lessons available to the astute listener will be learned. There are few films that have the potential to impact one's life. This film can, if you will let it."

I couldn't possibly put to words how hard it was for me to hold back the tears for almost all of this movie(which I had to, due to the crowd I saw it with). Some of these tears weren't ones of sadness... they were at the beauty inherent in this person. This humanitarian. With everything to lose and nothing to gain, he selflessly helped people who had nothing to offer him in return. This movie reminded me of Schindler's List. However, as one of the other viewers pointed out to me, it's far easier to distance yourself from that... with all possible respect to any and all victims of it, World War 2 ended over 60 years ago. What this movie depicts is just over a decade ago. Genocide. Which took place while us in the West sat far away, comfortable and not affected by it... and we did nothing. No UN, no US forces, nothing. This film is incredibly touching. I can't see anyone watching and not being emotionally involved. The plot is well-written and intriguing. The pace is perfect. It never moved too slow or too fast. It started adequately slow, but moved intensely later on. The acting is all spot-on. The writing is excellent. A great film that everyone should see.

","but not the best movie of the year. I've seen other movies about the conflict between Tutsi and Hutu in Rwanda. All were good. It would be hard to make a really bad film about such a powerful subject. The film focuses of Paul, a hotel manager at a swank hotel. It's where all the white people vacation and journalists gather. The genocide of the Tutsi breaks out and they seek refuge at the hotel. Paul is Hutu but his wife is not. He does business with other Hutus who help keep the hotel safe for a while. Paul tries to buy time by bribing soldiers with money and beer. He knows they all will be killed if forced to leave the hotel. The only thing keeping them safe is the hotel is not considered a refuge camp. But the Hutus who are committing murder on the streets know Tutsis are in the hotel. Paul is offered a chance to turn some over in order to get his family out but will not do it.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle was very good. He uses a convincing accent. He must play a man who appears strong and in charge but really breaks down behind closed doors because he knows their chance of surviving is low.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Good, compelling, but any movie about this subject would be. Good acting, Cheadle definitely deserved all the award nominations."

","From time to time one can come across a movie that transcends the ordinary or commonplace and rises to the level of being special. This is one of those movies. The story here is not only about a man who rises above his circumstances to become truly heroic, nor only about the seemingly pointless conflict between two groups of people, but primarily is about the human condition in general. This movie challenges one to ask: Is there any hope for humanity? This movie can generate feelings of deep despair, yet it does not, and for one reason: the main character, Paul, magnificently portrayed by the excellent actor Don Cheedle. Paul convinces us that in tumultuous times when people are being cruelly mistreated and uncertainty abounds, men like Paul are there to lead, to inspire and to serve. What a wonderful, marvelous, inspirational movie."

","What I expected and longed to see the most in this film, based on facts that should hit everyone's consciences, was a strong emotional impact. Well, the director has been successful in that, managing to tell a heartfelt tale. Don Cheadle's performance is simply outstanding, deep and convincing and I found strong also the peace keeper Nick Nolte and the American photographer Joaquin Phoenix. Hotel Rwanda is one of the best movies I've ever seen and its lesson should be carved in everybody's soul. It is obviously very disturbing for the quantity of violence and blood shown but its authenticity and emotional complexity make it a masterpiece."
"asalem182","9","1","1","18 December 2005"," Hotel Rwanda will hit you harder than the majority of the movies you've seen
","Hotel Rwanda was a touching, shocking, and very powerful film. I was surprised filmmakers waited a whole 10 years to make a movie about one of the biggest massacres of all time.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda tells the story of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle, in a career best performance), a hotel manager who is forced to turn his hotel into a refugee camp to save his family and the refugees from the massacre that took place in Rwanda in 1994.<br/><br/>The first question that will come across your mind while watching HR is ""why have we become so cruel?"", and no wonder one character asked the exact same question during the movie. You'll see roads covered with corpses, the males of the dominant tribe, The Hutus, raping females of the other tribe, The Tutsis, and Hutus slaughtering Tutsis on the streets. And then the United Nations, in one of their biggest failures of all time, decided to rescue only the Westerners (by making them leave the country) and leave the people of Rwanda to die alone. And Hotel Rwanda isn't afraid to show everything. I wonder how they could get away with a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>After that, I think you'll feel ashamed. In the best scene of the movie, an American cameraman (Joaquin Phoenix, in a great cameo), had to leave the country after the infamous UN decision. When his Ruandan friend begs him to take her with him, he says with teary eyes ""I've never felt so ashamed"". And frankly, I was ashamed too. I didn't try to donate money, or protest, or do anything for that country, and that's why I felt I (along with millions of people around the world) was responsible for what happened. I even think your average Joe will never know this massacre happened in the first place. And that's another great thing about Hotel Rwanda: It reminded us of that horrible event.<br/><br/>And I have to disagree with the people that said the somewhat uplifting ending ruined the movie for them. In fact, I can't find a better ending for the movie. That ending happened in real life, and it shows that despite all the cruelness in the world, there's still some hope left.<br/><br/>So, I'd definitely recommend Hotel Rwanda. Being a true story, it will hit you harder and touch you more than the majority of the movies you've seen."

"Enchorde","9","1","1","16 October 2005"," Deeply touching movie
","Recap: Paul Rusesabagina is the manager of a luxurious hotel, Milles Collines, in Kilagi Rwanda. Deeply involved in the business the hotel does, Paul makes relations and friends with as many important and powerful people he can. Because there is trouble growing in Rwanda. Two ""tribes"" live together since the colonial time, and now there are a lot of hatred for the other kind. A Hutu-militia is already acting very threatening, and the Hutu-dominated army is not ready or willing to stop it. The peace is fragile. So when the president of Rwanda dies, everything breaks lose. Paul, a Hutu, ends up with his family, Tutsis and a lot of Tutsi friends at Milles Collines, where Paul bribes, collects favors, calls everyone he knows, lies and pulls every trick he knows just to protect those inside his walls. Outside, there is a genocide going on. The UN is powerless, and the outside world is only interested in rescuing their citizens.<br/><br/>Comments: A very emotional, deeply touching, and very appalling movie. The tale (equal the truth I'm told) is told in a very realistic and plausible way. A lot of strong and frightening scenes are included, and a lot of them left me with a bad taste. That included when the UN and the Western powers abandoned the people in Rwanda. I'm old enough (unfortunately I don't have to be very old to do so) to remember the actual event, and I am dismayed by the fact that this move touched me more than those news did. In truth I am ashamed of it. So, as you surely can conclude, I think this is a very powerful movie. And it was made very well in all aspects. Especially a brilliant performance from all the cast, and mostly Don Cheadle that are mainly in focus. He brings us through all the emotions, love, hate, fear, terror, friendship, honor and actually happiness. Masterfully acted. I do recommend this movie to all and everyone, but I must warn you. This is not a movie to watch if you want to leave cheerful.<br/><br/>9/10"
"kevin142","9","1","1","23 September 2005"," Conscience
","Due to long conflict between Hutu and Tutsis, a big massacre began in Rwanda. This time Hutu prevailed. As the manager of a hotel, at first Paul just wanted to protect the hotel from destroying. When he learned more and more Tutsis got killed, Paul made up his mind to save Tutsis refugees as possible as he could.<br/><br/>The whole saving process was quite thrilling. Paul and his family also experienced the test of death. The following scene was impressive. Paul persuaded his wife to take the truck, though he remained in the hotel. What a touching parting.<br/><br/>If Paul lost his conscience that human being should own, the story would be totally different. Only conscience can make the world peaceful. If conscience always exists, the unfair phenomena will disappear from the present crazy world.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle's performance was full of appeal. He deserved fully to be nominated for best actor (Academy award). I am not surprised if one day he wins the academy award.<br/><br/>One of the best movies in 2004. 9/10"
"hrdefender","7","1","1","17 September 2005"," Hotel Rwanda's cinematic compression of history
","The historical errors in the film Hotel Rwanda will unfortunately go unnoticed by the average viewer. While the film is not billed as a documentary, the director has neglected to provide any disclaimers for the cinematic manipulation of factual events--a manipulation which is all too obvious to those who know the history of the country well.<br/><br/>One of the most glaring errors in the film seems to be due to the cinematic compression of time, which is often unavoidable when attempting to simplify complex events for a general audience. The General portrayed in the film, Augustin Bizimungu, did not in fact hold that position (as Army Chief of Staff) until 3 weeks after the genocide. The actual Chief of Staff at the time, Deogratias Nsabimana, was aboard the President's plane that was mysteriously downed on April 6 (no one has claimed responsibility for this crash since, although evidence points increasingly toward the country's current President, Paul Kagame, as the man who gave the order to fire the 2 missiles that brought it down). There were, in fact, 10 people on the plane, including 2 French pilots. In addition, the airplane was a gift from Francois Mitterand. Both of these facts truly call in to question the current Rwandan government's suggestions that the French military is the entity responsible for downing the plane (which in essence, qualifies as an act of terrorism under many international legal instruments).<br/><br/>This last statement should not, however, be interpreted as an attempt to excuse the grave mistakes that the French did make in its Operation Turquoise.<br/><br/>Immediately after the plane crash, which is commonly referred to as the 'trigger' that touched off the genocide, a man named Marcel Gatsinzi was named to replace Nsabimana. 3 weeks later, A. Bizimungu was named to take over the post. (Before the plane crash, Bizimungu even lacked the credentials necessary to become a general, which makes the film's portrayal of him as such even more inaccurate.) Gatsinzi, a Hutu, is now employed in the current government of Rwanda, which is dominated by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (the army that is credited with stopping the genocide).<br/><br/>The film further neglects to mention--not even by providing a paragraph of text that could enlighten the audience further--that the Rwandan Patriotic Front was responsible for targeted killing of tens of thousands of Hutu civilians (especially those from the North of the country) during its invasion into Rwanda in October 1990 (which instigated the civil war that preceded the genocide), as well as ""after"" the genocide and in the years immediately following (particularly 1997-98). The RPF currently enjoys considerable impunity for its war crimes and the crimes against humanity it has committed, and acknowledges only selected crimes.<br/><br/>Despite the film's compression of time, and the ahistorical consequences that arise from this, the film does provide a powerful, well-acted glimpse into an isolated part of the horror that engulfed Rwanda in 1994.<br/><br/>For more information about the economic roots of the genocide, read Chapter 10 ('Malthus in Africa') of Jared Diamond's best-selling book ""Collapse."" For more information about the genocide in practical and political terms, read ""Leave None to Tell the Story"" by Alison Des Forges (Human Rights Watch publication): http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/ Finally, if you are really serious about understanding the full context of the 1994 genocide and its international political dimensions, familiarize yourself with the research of scholars Rene Lemarchand and Filip Reyntjens (available in English)."

But all this is thrown into disarray when the African president is murdered and tutsi rebels are suspected. The local militia begin a nasty campaign of genocide against them and those suspected of working with them.

It's a few notches away from the quality of that film though.<br/><br/>In the lead role, Cheadle plays it stern and serious all the way, with a real conviction for his passion to the project. He has a heavy supporting cast too, from Nick Nolte, Joaquim Phoenix and Jean Reno, who only marginally manage to capture his sincerity.<br/><br/>I was expecting the film to be a bit longer, actually, but it manages to wrap it all up perfectly as it goes.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda is a startling film, depicting things that I know go on everyday in foreign countries but don't watch the news very often and, like many others, sort of pretend isn't happening to an extent.

","To say I was sceptical and ignorant about this film before I watched it is a true understatement. I chose the film at my local store because of a lack of alternatives, and knew very little about the Rwandan Genocides that it is based around. In fact, between myself and the three University Students that watched the film with me our combined knowledge on anything relating to the Genocides was minimal to say the least. The film certainly changed our perspectives.<br/><br/>Well shot and emotional, the film based on the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a Western-owned hotel in the middle of the conflict captured the terror faced by the genocide victims extremely well. Top class acting from Don Cheadle and Sophie Okenado further added to the powerful story lines impact on the viewers senses. Oscar nominated acting should have been Oscar winning acting.

","What is it that makes a story worth telling? Yeah, what happened in Rwanda was one of the most horrible (and unnoticed) things in recent history, but how would you tell that story without focusing just on the horror? Hotel Rwanda delivers the task so mercilessly it will leave you breathless. This is a story about priorities, about survival in the most horrific circumstances, about pride and intelligence. Paul (Don Cheadle) is an amazing character. He makes you feel ashamed of yourself. Could you face this sort of thing in the same fashion as he did? I kept asking myself that question the whole time. To be reminded of this atrocities is one thing, but to confront them and still keep a straight and gentle face is another thing. Paul is such an amazing character he's beyond human, and Don Cheadle portrayed this man with such dignity and charisma it left me biting my nails every moment. I also loved Joaquin Phoenix's character. You always wonder what the feelings of journalists would be given the chance to cover a story like this, and I think he hits the mark very close. This is not an entertainment movie, it's a wake-up call for mankind."

","I guess there is no-one who can say that he or she doesn't know what has happened during the genocide in 1994 in Rwanda. The images of all the massacres, often committed with nothing more than machetes, were absolutely horrifying. But on us Belgians this event has perhaps had an even bigger impact than on other Europeans and on Americans. Not only has Rwanda, after Germany's defeat in World War I, long been a Belgian protectorate (no, just as Burundi it has never been a colony. We only had one and that was Kongo), making that we still have some kind of historical connection to the country. Our government has always helped the Rwandese with military assistance and training (except during the genocide). But we were also personally affected by the genocide when 10 of our UN peace-keepers were brutally murdered in a military camp because they tried to protect one of the Rwandese ministers. Three of them were shot, the others were hacked open with machetes. The images of the paratroopers who cut their blue berets into pieces with their bayonets, once their returned home, will never be forgotten by all those who saw it back then.<br/><br/>""Hotel Rwanda"" doesn't show anything about that particular event, but it does give a good idea of what the rest of the entire genocide, and the reaction of the international community towards it, was like. This movie tells everything from the perspective of Paul Rusesabagina, an ordinary hotel-manager from Hutu origin who saved the lives of many Tutsi's. While the rest of the Hutu's brutally murdered every Tutsi around him, he not only protected his Tutsi wife and his children, but helped many of her relatives and friends to escape the horror by opening the hotel doors for them. Despite the fact that he didn't get much help from the UN or from the French, he was able to save over a thousand helpless refugees...<br/><br/>I would like to say that this is a wonderful movie, but not without adding that I'm not talking about all the murders. What I like so much about this movie is that it shows how a seemingly ordinary and unarmed man was able to stand up against all those militia men, not only protecting the lives of thousand people, who would otherwise have faced a certain death, but risked his own life by doing so and didn't care. If this hadn't been based on a true story, many would have said that it was impossible, but it isn't. All this actually happened, the good things as well as the bad. The makers of this movie have recreated it all very well and certainly have done some great research about the reasons and the attitude of the international community.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was also outstanding. Don Cheadle did a perfect job in his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina and Nick Nolte was excellent in his role as the Canadian Colonel Oliver, but that doesn't mean that the other, less known actors, weren't at least as good as them. They all did a wonderful job, lifting this movie far above average. If there is one thing that I could have a remark about, than it must be the fact that they speak English, instead of French. But that's such a little detail, that I'm very willing to forget about it. It didn't really bother me and it certainly didn't spoil the rest of the movie for me.<br/><br/>Overall this is a movie that should be seen by all. Not only because we should never forget what has happened over there in 1994, but also because we should hope this is a lesson for those who are planning on doing it and for those who never did anything about it. I give this movie a well-deserved 8.5/10."

","Hotel Rwanda is a great film. Yes, it has direct ties to a very heart-wrenching part of history, but what makes it powerful is the strong performance by Don Cheadle, an excellent supporting cast, great direction and storytelling.<br/><br/>I love movies like this. I very much enjoy movies with historical settings, even if their not always accurate (not a problem with this film). But anyone can make a drama based on historical events. What matters to film is the event gets the proper focus and circles around a handful of important characters. ""Hotel Rwanda"" does just that: it shows the Rwandan genocide as it occurs within a few square kilometers with the hotel as a focal point. More importantly it shows the tragedy through the eyes of a handful of people (if you focus solely on Cheadle and miss the viewpoint of the main character's wife and children you miss a great deal). This is how great historical dramas are made. Look at ""Patton"", one of the best WWII films ever made, not because it showed the action any better than any other WWII movie, but it focuses on a single, strong character brilliantly played. ""Hotel Rwanda"" is such a movie.<br/><br/>A great film, great performances (Cheadle was robbed of an Oscar on this one), and a powerful story. ""Hotel Rwanda"" should be shown in high schools across the country come fall.<br/><br/>9 out of 10. Sometimes it was hard to figure out which side characters were which (perhaps that was the point based on the whole Hutu-Tutsi past), but that is only a small nit.

As a Canadian, a former member of our military, and a huge admirer of General Dallaire, I had some difficulties warming up to Nick Nolte's character. I can't quite put my finger on it, but Nolte seemed almost unfocused, sloppy, and unconvincing in the part. On top of this, the inaccuracies in his uniform drove me absolutely around the bend--the little ""CANADA"" bar that is supposed to sit just beyond the four ""colonel"" stripes on the shoulders is a standard feature of the uniform, and its absence on an officer that was obviously supposed to be Canadian really discombobulated me in every scene Nolte was in.<br/><br/>But I know the typical IMDb reviewer doesn't fret about such things and will likely advise me to lighten up. So in closing, I will--the movie was moving, engaging, engrossing, impeccably acted, beautifully photographed and uncomfortably informative. I loved it."

","This film touched me and everyone who saw it with me in so many ways. I can't remember how many times I cried, but it was quite a few times. I remember seeing ""Schindler's List"", and all I could think about was how this movie portrayed Spielburg's classic as it occurred in Africa.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix, Cara Seymour and Desmond Dube all gave wonderful, heart-wrenching performances. There are many scenes that gripped me so subtly that I didn't realize that I was holding my breath until I realized that I was still in the movie theatre. The movie draws the viewer in, especially in the scenes concerning the threat against the lives of Paul's family and friends. <br/><br/>To think that so many stood by and allowed such a thing to happen puts me to shame just thinking about it. This movie raised so many signs in front of my face, and I was surprised to find that when I asked several of my friends about Rwanda, those that had not reached high school didn't even know about the genocide, or that Rwanda was even a country!<br/><br/>Don Cheadle, the Academy Award Nominee for this movie, said that he wanted to ""prevent Hotel Darfur"" from being released. In Sudan, things very similar to this movie are occurring, and need to be stopped. I can only pray that this movie continues to bring awareness to those who were blind to the truth. I know that awful things are happening everywhere, but the fact that the genocide could have been stopped just sickens me.<br/><br/>This movie is recommended for only the stalwart of heart, despite the fact that the carnage and bloodshed is kept to a subtle minimum. Please keep an open heart when you watch this movie-it will change your life."
"Ultima2","10","1","1","27 May 2005"," Unbelievably Gripping
","This movie is one of the greatest movies I have seen in years. It is by far my favorite movie of all time, surpassing Pulp Fiction. But besides it being a great ""movie"", it's a great story... The happenings in Rwanda really needed to get out to the public, and a documentary was not the way to go about getting attention. This did it, this really did. The decision to take what happened in Rwanda and personalize it to a single individual was a great one. The connection you feel for Paul and his family in this movie is far greater than any other movie you'll find yourself watching. You'll notice subtle little things about his character, his personality... It has some of the most influential scenes I have ever seen. I will admit, I find myself ""downloading"" movies a lot more than going to them. But my family rented this movie, and now I've made it a point to purchase it... and show it to everyone I know. You wont regret seeing this movie, you will leave your seat with a lot more knowledge, and a lot more heart. I specifically registered on this site to give this movie the rating it deserves, hopefully more people will see it."

","In 1994 a mass genocide took place in an African country called Rwanda. Have you not heard of this tragedy or have you CHOSEN to turn the other cheek? Now, let us break down the word genocide, the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines genocide as ""the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group."" Does Hitler pop into your mind? Well, less then ten years ago (in your lifetime) this event happened. The movie Hotel Rwanda is an excellent portrayal of the absolute devastation that took place. Millions of Rwanda natives were killed in this mass genocide. Don Cheadle gives an astonishing portrayal of Paul Rusesagagina a savior for over a thousand caught up in the madness occurring right outside the gates of the Hotel Mille Collines. ""When the world closed its eyes, he opened his arms,"" a tagline that fits oh so well into the heartfelt movie that puts you right into the conflict. Perhaps you did not care to pay attention in 1994 when the conflict fully unraveled, but see this movie and you may change your thoughts about looking at the horrors occurring abroad within our own small world."

I was, however, not prepared for the wide array of emotions felt by watching this film. The human cost of watching this film is astounding. As a member of the audience you will be terrified and enraged at the lack of concern given to the Rwandan people by the world community. But over and above the all, it is a story that needed to be told. Don Cheadle gives a performance which is only matched by the film greats. The story itself is the cinematic portrayal of humanity, both the ugly and the beautiful. As a member of the human race, you are obligated to see this film, if for no other reason then to know what happened so we can prevent it in the future. SEE THIS FILM!!!"
"whitefalcon79","8","1","1","16 May 2005"," Has a Schindler's List feel, but trust me - it's better
","The premise for Hotel Rwanda seems much like that of Schindler's List, released a decade before it... the story of one man who uses his power and position to provide a haven for refugees from a brutal war where they are the targets. I'll be blunt; Schindler's List underwhelmed me and I felt like I was being forced to feel emotions that just wouldn't generate themselves.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda succeeds where Spielberg's self-proclaimed classic failed. Lead character Paul (Don Cheadle) shelters men, women and children from both sides of Rwanda's bloody civil war. You don't go into this film with any preconceived 'Jews good, Nazis bad' notion of whether it is the Hutu or the Tutsi people who are being demonised. It is the atrocities of the war itself that are painted in a deserving light and the producers let the film focus on Paul's struggle to save the lives of those in his care.<br/><br/>The film is brutally honest about the horrors of war without the melodrama that might bely a lesser production. The images speak for themselves; there is no need for over-blown orchestral melodies in the background trying to forcibly yank the tears from our eyes. It's a straight-up, believable film.<br/><br/>The entire cast nail their parts to perfection, especially Cheadle who comes into his own playing an unlikely hero, sometimes skittish and unsure of himself, only once having to display any kind of bravado, and even then only when it is necessary that his people's lives will be spared.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda is a brilliant, moving and most of all realistic film that lets the true story on which it is based tell itself, without having to 'Hollywood it up' and thereby ruin the picture. A must see for all ages."
"pedrofjmk","8","1","1","26 April 2005"," When Humanity falls apart
","It's no secret that this film caused a lot of controversy, stirred many lakes, revolted many people and moved many more. All of us will have different interpretations of it. The one undeniable fact, however, is that what we see on the screen happened. As is. No law and peace-abiding Nation did a thing to prevent it. All those who could flee, fled. The rest is history.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle has a break-through role in his career. The role of a man who, saving the distances, reminds me of other brave people such as Schindler or Aristides de Sousa Mendes, whom in extreme circumstances, and going beyond their very human fears and flaws, did the right thing. Nick Nolte doesn't have a brilliant role. Actually, as flimsy as the helplessness the poor Canadian Colonel felt in real life, probably.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda is a real eye-opener. It reminds everyone that the news have a human face. What happened there in the 90s is nowadays happening in Sudan (and has been for years!) as in other places: people are simply getting killed for nothing. That's the bottom line. Some will say that's the way the world is. Those are the cynical. That is not the way the world should be. We screamed never again. Yet, here it is again, asking for a new script in 2015: Hotel Khartum. The acting is not superb. The script aims at telling a story, but also at making the movie a real tear-jerker.<br/><br/>But if one thinks about all those that survived the Genocide and are perhaps thankful for the story, then it had to be worth making it. Despite the lack of help, no one will now be able to forget.<br/><br/>Any human being must feel ashamed of himself while watching it. It's a civil offense in most democracies to see someone in need of help and doing nothing. There isn't a more extreme example. We all shoved it under the carpet and pretended it wasn't there. Hotel Rwanda stands as a memory. To face us with our passiveness, it should be mandatory."
"fastmike","7","1","1","25 April 2005"," Rusesabagina's List
","I do not intend to sound sarcastic by my above 'one-line-summary'; for if the real life Paul Rusesabagina, a 'Hutu', did the things he was portrayed to do, to save hundreds of 'Tutsi', then indeed there is a comparison with great people of conscience like Oscar Schindler.<br/><br/>The story is that of the infamous 'ethnic cleansing' of minority Tutsi's by their nationalist rivals, the Hutu's. The film also cleverly weaves in the reasons for the deep ethnic hatred between these peoples, by ordinary conversations between locals and European visitors.<br/><br/>The violence is not nearly as bad as one might expect. In fact, the actual news reel footage that the world 'witnessed' at the time of this genocide was far, far worse than the movie portrays.<br/><br/>The film will rivet you to the screen, as you follow 'Paul' beg, borrow, steal and bribe to save the lives of the 'hotel guests' Well worth seeing, a little bit 'over' on the acting but smartly sensitive to the brutal violence that Hollywood so often turns out, (even in its' jests) just a wee bit to long but,still, a story that need to be told, and more importantly needs to be heard."
"benihana83","10","1","1","19 April 2005"," Don Cheadle is the best actor working today. And Hotel Rwanda deserved more than it received.
","With all due respect to Jamie Foxx, Don Cheadle gave the best performance of 2004 in Hotel Rwanda. The real-life tale of the Rwandan genocide that took place in 1994 might not have been seen by the majority of the American public this winter, but it should have been. As Rwandan hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina, Cheadle commands every scene and puts himself into the upper echelon of today's American actors.<br/><br/>The story of Hotel Rwanda may not be familiar to many. In over 100 days in 1994, nearly one million people died as a result of a war between two Rwandan tribes, the Hutus and the Tutsis. This tragedy was completely overlooked the world over, especially here in America.<br/><br/>During this civil war, Rusesabagina housed thousands of Rwandan refugees in his hotel, the Mille de Colline. As hotel manager, he bargained, pled and bribed for the lives of friends, family members and those he didn't even know.<br/><br/>After numerous, but memorable, supporting roles in movies like Swordfish, Bulworth, Ocean's Eleven, Boogie Nights and Traffic, it was refreshing to see Cheadle get his chance at being a leading man.<br/><br/>While Cheadle was the heart and soul of Hotel Rwanda, he wasn't the only bright spot. In addition to the aforementioned writing and direction from Terry George, relative newcomer Sophie Okonedo turns in a brilliant, Oscar-nominated performance as Rusesabagina's wife, Tatiana. Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte also nail their supporting roles, Phoenix as an ashamed American journalist and Nolte as a struggling UN Colonel trying to keep the peace.<br/><br/>Though Phoenix appears in just a few scenes, he delivers the most memorable and perhaps the most accurate line depicting the Rwandan conflict. ""If people see this,"" he says, referring to Americans watching the news at home, ""they'll say, 'Oh my God, that's horrible,' and then go on eating their dinners."" Maybe, if more people get a chance to see Hotel Rwanda, that sentiment could change. This isn't just a movie; it's a film that can change lives, policy and the way we think about our actions."
"gradyharp","10","1","1","17 April 2005"," ""I promise to tell your story""
","With these words written on a visitors' log in a memorial site in Rwanda, the reason for making this stunning film is posed. HOTEL RWANDA is not only a well written (Keir Pearson), well directed (Terry George), well acted (entire cast) work of cinematic history, it serves as a thunderingly loud announcement of how the world ignored the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, Africa - a country whose only exports are tea and coffee and therefore not high on the agendas of importance of the other nations of the world. HOTEL RWANDA brings us the realization that there are many unreported acts of inhumanity that never reach our television or radio or newspapers. How many of us knew about this incident before now? But this well-crafted film is all the more poignant because it focuses on the quiet heroism of one elegant, enlightened hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) and his response to the Tutsi rebel uprising that resulted in the slaughter of over a million people, and for what reason? Going back to the time when Belgium 'owned' the country they divided the people into the Tutsi and Hutu categories based on skin color, nasal width and other absurd parameters. With Belgium's exit the two parties were placed in delicate balance and long years of struggle for control resulted in the 1994 disaster.<br/><br/>The senselessness of the genocide is shown by the selection of victims for which the Tutsi rebels depended on registration cards to identify Tutsis from Hutus: in reality the people had intermarried - even Hutu Paul was married to Tutsi Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) - so that the killings were wholly irrational. Given this madness, Paul struggles with the insurgency and gives shelter to as many people as he can squeeze into his hotel, refugees including orphan Tutsis, hotel staff, and friends and fellow countrymen in need of a Gilead. All of this is happening while the United Nations contingency led by Col. Oliver (Nick Nolte) is impotent and the outside reporters such as Jack Daglich (Joaquin Phoenix) grab footage of the slaughter and flee to safety. Only a Red Cross nurse Pat Archer (Cara Seymour) remains to assist in any way she can. Paul attempts to contact the outside world through his employer Mr. Tillens (Jean Reno) of the Belgian Sabena Airlines, but the world refuses to recognize the reality of Paul's plight in saving his countrymen.<br/><br/>The cast is exceptional: Don Cheadle and Sophie Okoneda are brilliant in their roles and the supporting cast is superb. The DVD opens with a statement from Don Cheadle the actor, the movie unfolds, and the remainder of the CD includes 'the making of' sequences and historical segments that for once are not self-serving aggrandizement, but sensitively informing pleas for understanding and digestion of a genocide that was ignored. This is a powerful film that deals with an atrocity without electing to lambaste the viewer with gore: the message is more powerful for its understatement."

The movie is about two different kinds of people, the Tutis and the Hutu. How can you tell the difference, this is exactly what I thought. This is how it was explained to me was the Tutis have lighter color skin than the Hutu do, they are the darker color. This movie is based on what happened in Rwanda in 1994. Where these two different kinds of people were at war. The exact thing that happened back in 1994 in Rwanda, is now currently happening in the Congo right now.<br/><br/>Wow, what a excellent performance from Don Cheadle.

It is sad that people just don't know what happened in Rwanda in 1994, and that still are completely ignorant about what continues to happen in Africa. In cases like this you can't help but wonder if everything that the current US government says about helping other nations be ""free"" is just B.S. and realize that in cases like Africa there are no political or economical interests for them to intervene. This movie really makes you understand what people went through and how we thought in current years a thing like this wouldn't happen and it actually did without anyone doing anything about it.

","Having heard excellent things about this film I finally had the opportunity last night to see it before it left the cinemas here. I thought it was fantastic, extremely moving and well made. Don Cheadle excels in the lead role. The pacing and tension in the film is fantastic as Cheadle gradually takes on the role of protector for the Tutsi refugees, pleading and bargaining for their safety through his various connections forged as the manager of the luxurious Milles Des Collines hotel. His torn allegiance between his immediate family and the refugees he houses is at times both difficult and fascinating to watch. The ambush by Hutu rebels on the UN convoy with Cheadle's family on board is simply heart-stopping film at it's very best. Also the river road and Joaquin Phoenix's shame at being escorted to safety by the man with the umbrella are two of many unforgettable moments. The film opened my eyes to a wider world and I now feel ashamed of my relative ignorance and, more importantly, indifference to world events. It's true that I alone cannot make a difference but if more people are aware of incidents such as the one depicted to such breathtaking effect in this film then maybe in future people won't be left behind. Whoever, if anyone, reads this post, please either go or urge people to go and see this film.

","Hotel Rwanda is a great motion picture. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in these kinds of issues. Don Cheadle leads an excellent cast who bring you deep into the story. The story of the Rwandan genocide is a deeply touching story and this movie fully represents that. Although much of the violence that occurred in the Rwandan genocide is cleaned up for rating and audience reasons the movie still alerts the audience to the issues of the genocide that were hidden at the time. The reaction of the western world is surprising but true. The scenes can be disturbing with graphic images but its all worth it to understand this piece of history. This movie was deeply touching. It can get a little intense at times so i would recommend that you are prepared for this before seeing the movie.

By pretending that somehow the African lives were not worthy. Don Cheadle portrays the hotel manager with such dignity, trying to keep calm in the face of the most distressing circumstances. Go see this movie. Haunting, sad but uplifting. This reaffirms my faith in the African continent. Most times we hear of the many who wreak such havoc and terror on their people but we need to be reminded that there are many Africans who strive to maintain the age old tradition of loving thy neighbor and extending kindness to others.<br/><br/>As a west African (Sierra Leone), I thank the director for choosing to bring this story to the big screen.

Maybe a bit too emotionally manipulative but powerful and unforgettable nonetheless. Exceptional performances and a look at a continent I had never seen presented in this way before. You may not be in the mood to emerge from a movie ashamed, depressed, and emotionally exhausted, but from a humanist perspective, this movie asks what I think is a fundamental question, that is, ""Why are people so cruel?"" There are no easy answers to be found here, only a politically charged slap in the face."

I have long been interested in the feature film industries of both countries. This is a movie that could NEVER have been produced in Hollywood, as it is an uncomfortable and scathing indictment of the neglect and disinterest of the West in what went on in Rwanda. The events show in this movie are no different from what took place during the Holocaust, and what is going on in Sudan and other areas at this very moment. It is not enough that every thinking, feeling person must see this movie. We should all rise up and point our fingers at our governments, who did NOTHING, while these terrible events were taking place. For anyone who has not yet done so, read General Delaire's book about his experiences in Rwanda, ""Shake hands with the Devil"""

It also should shame us in the West for the complacency over situations there, often caused by our own selfish politics.<br/><br/>This film intersperses the sadness and tension with wonderful flashes of humour and little touches that remind us that people are people even in the most horrific circumstances. The film also assumes no prior knowledge of the reasons behind the genocide, but explains the situation in a way that is understandable and natural rather than getting in the way of the narrative.<br/><br/>See this film, if it moves you great, but if it causes you to question why the West can treat large populations of the world as less than human then even better!"

"psi_fla","Null","1","1","4 March 2005"," An easily accessible and very valuable history lesson
","Co-written and directed by: Terry George<br/><br/>Starring: Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix, Nick Nolte, Cara Seymour <br/><br/>First things first; Hotel Rwanda is an excellent film, possibly my favourite of the last twelve months. Terry George's film successfully places an uplifting story of survival in the midst of a real-life disaster, rarely slipping into melodrama. It is content to tell its tale in an understated and unpretentious manner.<br/><br/>The disaster in question is the Rwandan genocide of 1994. In the space of three months, one million people were murdered in Rwanda - and frighteningly enough, not many people around the world seemed to notice. Most of these people were the Rwandan Tutsi's, murdered by the Rwandan Hutu's. The Hutu's described the Tutsi's as ""cockroaches"", ""traitors"" and ""invaders"" who ""stole our land"".<br/><br/>While all this went on, a Hutu hotel manager, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) campaigned to save as many Hutu's and Tutsi's as he possibly could. He felt especially close to the Tutsi's, his wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), being one herself. And so his hotel effectively became a camp for refugees. But he knew that it couldn't stay that way forever.<br/><br/>Certain film intellectuals slam these ""manipulative"" films for making us ""feel good about feeling bad"", and not teaching us anything new. Others will certainly give Hotel Rwanda a hammering for focusing too much on the survivors and not enough on the victims. I seem to recall some people stating similar things about Schindler's List and The Pianist, two critically-acclaimed historical dramas.<br/><br/>In my opinion, these writers are way off the mark. Detractors must remember that the aim of both Hotel Rwanda and Schindler's List is not to be the definitive film of the Rwandan genocide or the Holocaust, respectively. They are not documentaries either. Rather, they are stories about how one man made a difference during a horrific tragedy. They never let you forget the seriousness of these situations, aiming to show you how you can find hope and optimism in those times - and they both do so brilliantly.<br/><br/>It's questionable, however, how much of an impact such films can have Â– after all, as one character states at one point during the film: ""After they see this, people are gonna say 'My God, That's terrible' and then go on eating their dinners"". But if film-makers like Terry George and Steven Spielberg believe they can make a difference, then why shouldn't they try? Mainstream audiences should be reminded of events like the Rwandan genocide, and it's to George's credit that he presents the situation in such an effective manner.<br/><br/>A hero such as Paul Rusesabagina did exist, so why deny him the compelling story that he deserves, based on the evidence before us? No two-hour film could possibly do justice to the Rwandan genocide, and George understands that. So rather than constantly bombard us with exploitative, over-the-top footage of people dying, he instead focuses on Paul's story, which is the right thing to do. George doesn't take sides either - the film might be seen by some as a battle between ""good"" Tutsi's and ""bad"" Hutu's, but not for one moment is the film as simplistic as that. That we sympathise with the Tutsi ""cockroaches"" is largely down to the treatment that they are receiving.<br/><br/>I've known that Don Cheadle was a gifted performer for a while, but to anyone who only remembers him from Ocean's Eleven, the strength of this performance may come as a real shock. The film lies almost squarely on his shoulders, and while his role is largely an underplayed one, it does call for him to be emotive numerous times, and he is up to the task. His Oscar nomination was merited, as was Sophie Okonedo's. We find Tatiana both sympathetic and believable despite the fact that she doesn't figure as prominently. Cara Seymour's Red Cross worker also stands out (in fact, she features heavily in two of the most moving scenes in the film). With the exception of Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte, the rest of the cast is largely unknown, but no less effective.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda would have been a worthy Oscar winner, and is, without doubt, an easily accessible and very valuable history lesson.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** (out of *****)"
"wisewebwoman","9","1","1","16 February 2005"," Incredible Film
","The action in this film takes place in 1994, when war exploded between two tribes in Rwanda - the Hutus and the Tutsis. This film tells the story of what happened, focussing on Paul Rusesabagina, (played by Don Cheadle) the manager of a four-star hotel in the capital city owned by Belgians (who caused the tribal problems to begin with but that is another story). He and his friend, the UN commander Oliver played by Nick Nolte, assisted over a thousand Tutsi refugees by first of all hiding them in the hotel and then through mounting tension and bloodshed whisking them outside the war area to safety.<br/><br/>The film reminded me of Schindler's List and had the same powerful effect. Much like the book on which it was based (I believe)- Romeo Dallaire's ""Shake Hands with the Devil."" The character of Oliver is loosely based on Colonel Dallaire - and a film should be made about him too, he is given short shrift in this movie.<br/><br/>It is about the nobility of the human character when faced with incredible acts of evil and horror. Particularly when the world turns its back, as it is still doing on Africa. Some horrors are just too huge (the Holocaust, the Irish famine, Rwanda) to be comprehended. The tsunami is about all we can manage. The rest we know in hindsight, as in this movie and others like it.<br/><br/>This nobility of character is never more exemplified than by Don Cheadle in this movie. His acting has to be seen, he just nails the character of Paul, the hotel manager who knows all the tricks of diplomacy, graft and bribery in the book.<br/><br/>The depiction of the actual horror in Rwanda is fairly discreet and leaves much to the imagination it is rendered through radio broadcasts and one haunting scene of a road fading into the horizon covered in the hacked bodies of women and children. There were many heroes in Rwanda, the orphanage managers, the nuns, the UN peacekeepers defying orders not to shoot, but we observe it all through the eyes of Paul, his day to day wrestling with the sheer challenge of feeding and hiding over 1000 people in his hotel.<br/><br/>The movie ends on an uplifting note, a surprise, much like ""Schindler's List"". It is still with me, which is always the sign of a great movie. Don Cheadle should get the Oscar. He is simply stunning.<br/><br/>The one word that strikes me about the Pauls and the Oskars of this world is that they were noble, an old-fashioned word. We cannot apply that word to too many but it is something to which we should all aspire. 9 out of 10."

The straightforward and by-the-numbers direction of Terry George service this tale very well, as it allows the fact based and ultimately uplifting story to speak for itself and allows the actors (most notably Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo-both rightfully honored with Oscar nods) to shine. There's a lot of heartbreaking stuff here both of a personal and political nature.

","Hotel Rwanda is a an amazing movie and a story that needs to be told. The Rwandan genocide, lasting just a few months, was one of the greatest tragedies among many in the twentieth century. The US, Europe and the UN stood by and watched and this leaves us lessons for current conflicts in Sudan and other parts of Africa. As a movie, Hotel Rwanda is wonderful. Don Cheadle is perfect as Paul, tough and determined but full of doubt and fear. Any of us could be Paul but few would have the guts and strength. Some reviewers have claimed the movie is too Hollywood or does not show the true violence, but the use of sound, facial emotions and scenery forces the viewer to put themselves in the place of a Rwandan, not an American viewer. The movie is almost a documentary of what happened but is also very moving and an appropriate length. All in our theater were choked up with emotion at the end. I spent time in Tanzania in 2003, next door to Rwanda. East Africa is still dealing with the repercussions of the Rwandan genocide and so should the world. We all need to do what we can to prevent such conflicts."

","This true story shows audiences both the best and worst of the human race as we see a man use every bit of his wits and tact to save 1,200 lives while the rest of the world turned it's back and ignored the atrocities that were taking place. Story is set in 1994 in Kigali, Rwanda where death squads are formed by the Hutu's after their leader is murdered and they engage in genocide against the Tutsi tribe. The manager of the Hotel Des Milles Collines is Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who is a Hutu but his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) is a Tutsi and she and the lives of their children are threatened so they take refuge at the hotel.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** The hotel chain is Belgian owned and many Tutsi refugees end up coming there until the count reaches about 1,200 but the Hutu armies start to come around to find them. There is a United Nations presence led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) who does his best to protect them and try to get them out but his hands are tied as his orders are strict in that he cannot get involved with trying to maintain peace. Paul talks to Generals and death squad leaders and uses bribery, lies, and tact to keep everyone alive until the United Nations can get them out but the roads are blocked and supplies have run out.<br/><br/>This is only Terry George's second effort as a director and with this powerful film he has clearly shown everyone that he is a director to watch from now on. The strength of this film comes from different sources but along with the true facts that this is based on the performance of Cheadle is one that is extremely crucial to the story. Cheadle gives us a character that even amid horrible circumstances (and even his own safety) he uses his clear thinking and controlled nature to keep not only the hotel running but to keep everyone alive. In a powerful scene Cheadle changes his clothes and attempts to tie his tie but with everything that he's witnessed he finally breaks down but the key is that it happens when he's alone. After he emerges from changing he proceeds to run the hotel as any manager would and I believe this moment in the film sums up what the character is about. George has made an important film that people should view just so that the genocide that took place will never be forgotten and it also marks a career defining role for the versatile Cheadle who after giving audiences many good performances in previous efforts shows that he is indeed a very special actor."

","This is a powerful drama. In 1993, there was ethnic war between the Tutsis and the Hutus in Rwanda. The film highlights the horrors of war, and also brings forth that a man must do, in all his ability, to always protect his family first in times of crisis. It's sad, but true, that there is always a limit to the number of people you can help.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager whose hotel was used by the UN and world media as a base for covering the supposed peace treaty between the 2 ethnic groups, and later used as a place of safe refuge when Hutus start to ethnic cleanse the ""cockroaches"" Tutsis - it's amazing how easily hatred is bred through endless radio broadcasts.<br/><br/>Being a Hutu himself, and married to a Tutsi, this brings forth danger to Paul himself. However, with his street smarts, and network connections, he manages to stay one step ahead of the situation, and brings hope to his family, employees, and refugees, when all seems bleak.<br/><br/>While the West has abandoned Paul and Rwanda, Paul has shown courage and hope in turning things around, during times of violence and rampant corruption. You're as good as what you can offer to those in power - once you have nothing, you're as good as a goner. This doesn't only apply to Paul and the generals, but also, on a bigger picture, between the West and Rwanda as well.<br/><br/>I haven't watched a lot of movies starring Don Cheadle, except for the Ocean11/12 movies. Given these shows tend to root for strong leading man types, probably Denzel Washington, Cheadle does an excellent job here.<br/><br/>No doubt the lack of A-stars, the supporting cast gave commendable performances, see if you can spot Joaquin Phoenix underneath his bearded face! I shan't preach here, but I must state that genocide is evil, and the world cannot turn a blind eye when it happens, no matter where.<br/><br/>Watch this film, and understand."

","""Hotel Rwanda"".<br/><br/>Paul Rusesabagina is a regular man. He is happily married with a nice wife, Tatia (Sophie Okonedo), and has a few pleasant young children. He works as a manager to the hotel Milles Collines in his small native country of Rwanda. He is a good manager, a smart one, knowing when and how to bribe the right people for better business. When asked why he spends four hundred Francs on a Cuban cigar, he answers that four hundred francs to a businessman is nothing, but a Cuban cigar for a businessman is style. And style means good business.<br/><br/>Paul is of the Hutu tribe, which was ruled over by the Tutsi in Rwanda for a long time. The Tutsi killed many Hutu, and now that the Hutu are in power there are rumors that they are planning on striking back. Paul is not interested politics though, Hutu and Tutsi are no different to him, his wife being a Tutsi is proof of that. Paul just wants to run his hotel with a minimum of interruptions or trouble.<br/><br/>But the trouble comes to his door one night. He comes home from work to learn that Tutsi terrorists have murdered the peace-wanting Hutu president of Rwanda. Hutus around the country are going crazy, killing all the Tutsi they can find. A crowd of Tutsi have taken refuge in Paul's house. He is uneasy. His son is missing, looking for a Tutsi friend. Paul finds the child, drenched in blood. It's not his own blood, but Paul disintegrates nonetheless. Indeed, the man has been hiding his fear.<br/><br/>When Hutu military soldiers travel the country, murdering and murdering the Tutsi they call ""cockroaches"" Paul does the only thing he can offer to do: he hides wanted Tutsis in his hotel. Helping him is a desperate Canadian UN Colonel (Nick Nolte) who has been practically abandoned by the rest of the world in this small, conflicted country. The Colonel, named Oliver, has all of three men and a few trucks at his disposal; he has a deep need to save these lives, but his orders are restricting.<br/><br/>So the bulk of the movie shows these two men doing all they can to save as many lives as possible. There is a close situation every day, soldiers and terrorists are continually showing up at the hotel door, and food and drink is running out. Paul and Oliver use all of their strength to think fast, bribe, make phone calls, and otherwise improvise their way out of danger. Paul is losing it, watching the bloodshed around him. He is desperate. They all are.<br/><br/>Paul is played by Don Cheadle, that actor best known for ironic or violent side roles in crime comedies. He's given quite a few great performances, my favorite being his role as the psychotic ""Snoopy"" in Steven Soderbergh's ""Out of Sight"". That was a performance worthy of an Oscar. But here Cheadle gives his best performance yet, his character, though frightened and frustrated, is full of such warmth, heart, kindness and strength. This man is a hero, but not in the traditional action-hero, long-speech type way. He is a man pushed into a corner with a thousand lives behind him, doing his best to think his way out. This performance will hopefully get Cheadle the recognition he's always deserved.<br/><br/>Nolte and newcomer Okonedo are also in top form; this is Nolte's best performance since ""Affliction"" and Okonedo, well, I hope to see her in the future. Her character symbolizes Paul's hope, his love, and his humanity. She is a believable wife too, and her reaction to one of Paul's decisions later in the movie is sort of heartbreaking.<br/><br/>A few scenes that don't work, I must say, are some romantic moments between Paul and Tatia. They sort of break the mood and I'm not too sure if they'd have a candle-lit, rooftop dinner when death is at hand. Also, I think the movie needed a little more  and I hate to say it  violence. An R rating would've suited it, I think, because it would've shown us the weight of Paul's deed, what he was rescuing the Tutsi lives from.<br/><br/>You hardly think of this while watching though. The movie is all about the strength  and evil  of humanity, the importance of lives and the hardships of survival. It's also about a husband and father's love for his family, and about one of the Western world's greatest sins, turning away from Rwanda. It's about a lot of things.<br/><br/>8/10."

"Image-4","6","6","15","2 February 2005"," Missed opportunity. Great background and potential story, weak movie
","Hotel Rwanda has the merit of bringing to the western attention the amplitude and drama of the civil war in Rwanda between two local factions Hutu and Tutsi, a war that lead to almost 1 million victims, most of them non-militants, women and children. Don Cheadle portrays the real Paul Rusesabagina, the Hutu manager of the Belgium-owned hotel Mille Collines who, while trying to protect his own family (his wife being a Tutsi) from the irrational killing, ends up offering asylum and protection to about 1,000 Tutsi and Hutu refugees. Paul is an interesting character, a man who was cultivating his friendship with the powerful hotel guests, knowing that the time will come when he will require their favors. His virtual rope-walking is impressive and Cheadle's performance is up to par.<br/><br/>However, the movie fails to deliver an informed unbiased view on the war in Rwanda, but rather chooses a heavy-handed approach which can be summarized as: Rwanda was artificially divided into Hutu/Tutsi's by the ruling European and now the Hutu want to exterminate the previously-ruling Tutsi's. The same European and UN do not care in the least about the genocide that is unfolding, and turn their backs after recovering their own citizens from the country. Furthermore, they probably supply weapons to the various factions. The Hutu's are exterminating villains, while the Tutsi rebels are the saviours. In truth, just to give one example, as the Tutsi rebels managed to overthrow the Hutu's and the Interahamwe militia, they drive approximately 2 million Hutu's into exile for fear of repercussions.<br/><br/>Furthermore (some spoilers ahead) the movie itself falls into the typical handkerchief-drama stereotypes. There is an entire setup meant to lead us believe that Paul's family committed suicide as he instructed them at some point, in case they risk being captured. Did anyone fall for that? Or even if you did, wasn't it obvious from the moment Paul instructs his wife, that we will get to this point in the movie where he at least will believe they followed through? While the massacre is gruesomely portrayed, none of the characters that are introduced in the movie actually gets hurt. All the dead people are just nameless masses. The only named loss is that of Paul's brother in law, yet his two daughters are found against all odds allowing the movie to end with a high spirit-lifting tone as the main characters are happy embracing each other and singing...<br/><br/>A missed opportunity."

The events it portrays truly are a black mark in the history books, and it does well in not sensationalising what happened. On the minus side though, I thought it did seem to gloss over the whole thing. There just did not seem to be any sense of outrage. To get the point across there should have been more on-screen atrocity - not with a view to satisfying gore hounds, but to emphasise why the world should be ashamed of what happened. Consequently there was virtually no dramatic impact in it for me. As I said, it wasn't bad - neither was it particularly good. The script and acting were acceptable, but I wouldn't give it any more praise than that."

","To keep it short: What really turned me down was that the makers of this movie or maybe rather the writer of the script didn't have the courage to focus on the events of the genocide in rwanda as such. Why couldn't they just try and show the mere barbarism of what really happened. Like the catholic church of rwanda got involved in massacres, like last days neighbors became murders over night - and the dimensions of the genocide itself which were unseen of since the shoa. 800'000 to 1 million people slaughtered within 3 months, for the greater part with machetes and other tools - very little of this does shine through the almost romantic story of a brave and pure man. Sometimes I think that such stories rather use events like the rwanda genocide for a historical background only: The main story seems to be this of heroism where in fact a mass killing among neighbours was going on in rwanda. what fits this picture is the way the rebels of the rlf are glorified in the end of the film. in fact, after they had kicked out parts of the hutu murder gangs, they started intense killing based on racist projections too. it is still unknown among historians how many the killed then, but figures may go up very, very high. But as I said - maybe the actual events aren't that important for hero-movies like this. What I liked about the film was the role of the u.n. and the post-colonialist governments as portrayed in ""hotel rwanda"": in fact the international community witnessed over months the mass murder."

","Like many inhabiting this board I feel a deep sense of shame for my country and the West's abandonment of Rwanda to its fate during the 90's genocide. This film based on a the true story of Paul Russebigina a hotel manager who struggled to survive and save some innocents a la Oskar Schindler.<br/><br/>Although Hotel Rwanda goes some way towards redressing the deliberate ignorance of the West over the genocide in Rwanda it is a far from perfect film. Its main flaw that undermines the film greatly is its sanitization of the dreadful bloodshed, naturally for commercial reasons. This 'chickening out' though counterbalanced at times by the bodies in the street and some mild violence makes the Rwandan Holocaust seem a relatively insignificant event.<br/><br/>Come on! Millions died for God's sake and we are left with a director and a script pussyfooting around the real issues. Instead the film focuses on one man Russebigina and his family.<br/><br/>I must admit the standard of acting in this film was very high with Cheadle and his wife in the film making a heartrending couple, whilst Nick Nolte plays a very believable UN Officer ashamed by the Wests conduct and doing his best whilst being placed in a tactical straight-jacket. It is not the fault of the actors that this film that could have been better then Schindlers List fails to reach those lofty heights and I hope that the next film in the genre of War Crimes (possibly about Bosnia, Iraq or Sierra leone) goes no holds barred and depicts man as he is at times: a terrible animal."

","There is a certain sadness, a certainty of sadness in stories like this, and the movies that tell them. <br/><br/>It reduces to us being made to care for a very few souls and then celebrate when our chosen people escape the fate of many others around them. The cost of this dynamic is straightforward: we have to make the others die, often horribly. It is a cheap sort of drama, the cheapest, the basest. It dehumanizes us because we become complicit in dehumanizing those that are sacrificed so that we can have a perhaps challenging but comfortable theater experience.<br/><br/>We'll see it in blockbuster movies, when some alien invasion or natural event kills millions (or billions) but we follow a few that escape. We'll even see it in the shootouts of ordinary magical gun movies where the others drop one per shot while our guy wondrously and gracefully kills.<br/><br/>But in this case, the tragedy is real. It really happened: a million people killed in as much time as a summer vacation: killed by neighbors with machetes. A million people killed because we stood by. The film does make a very central point, but not clearly enough. There are two warring tribes here, Hutu and Tutsi. But genetically they are identical. They speak the same language and culturally are the same. The difference? Belgium race theorists created the difference so that they could turn over the country to those they believed genetically superior, and that superiority determined by body and facial proportions. The accursed ""golden mean."" (The distinction until then was one of class.)<br/><br/>We do have Nick Nolte in the role of Privileged-Non-African-on-the-Spot. Joaquin Phoenix as a reporter supplements his role. They have the task of letting us know these facts and also that the genocide was easily preventable if a few troops had been sent in, which could have happened but for French and Belgian obstruction. No more than ten bureaucrats in Europe — whose names we know — killed a million while the local church helped.<br/><br/>With that sad background, we have a hard time celebrating the survival of our hero and those he saves. This is made harder because the drama is poorly constructed and executed. It not enough that the wife be a good soul, or that the hotel manager be resourceful, or that many cliffhanger episodes are pulled back from near disaster. It is not enough that two little girls are found at the last minute and whisked to an adjacent country with laws and safety. It is not enough. It almost is not anything.<br/><br/>The camera could have been used. We know how to do that. We had a camera on screen in a ready role. There could easily have been the power of effective cinema brought to this event, this reportage,<br/><br/>When you make a film that involves political events so significant, you take a responsibility. I'm on the fence as to whether the history has to be factually correct. But you have to allow them to matter. Because they do.

","""Hotel Rwanda"" is an historical drama with good merit. Terry George has directed this film independently, and therefore the budget constraints peek through. There is a very intense performance by Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina who does his best to save lives in a tragic situation in Africa. His wive, Tatiana Rusesabagina played by Sophie Okonedo is equally as inspiring in her empathic portrayal. Nick Nolte plays Colonel Oliver, a United Nations Colonel, who is practically impotent in his ability to give aid to an impossible situation. Nolte is a drawback for he seems to read lines without any regard for believability. He fails to convince the audience that he is really a young United Nations military person. This movie is worth seeing for it's historical importance. An epic portrayal is lacking, but the essence remains. It is not a film of entertainment, but it is one for education."

","This was a rare case for me of a piece of media being genuinely hard for me to sit through. Some of the scenes in this movie are so powerful, sad, and tearjerking. The scene where all the orphanage children show up at Paul's hotel and are informed they can't leave the country and the scene where Paul's family and some of the other refugees are almost murdered by the Hutu militia were extremely painful to watch. The movie is powerful even from the beginning with the jarring scene of a box of machetes spilling out and the Hutu militia leader bribing Paul with more half priced beer. Nick Nolte also gives a powerful performance. You can tell he really feels bad about not being able to do anything about what's going on around him. The best performance in this movie however, is Don Cheadle who plays a perfect strong straight man character as Paul who must fill several roles and a balancing act to protect everyone he can and be strong for his family.

","The film Rwanda Hotel tells about the conflict between two races, Tutsi and Hutu. They have lived on the same land for many years. But later, in Hutu's view, the Tutsis were invaders of Belgian colonists. They plundered Hutu's land and flogged them. They called Tutsis ""cockroaches"" and ""murderers"". So they plan to drive Tutsis away and decide to ""eliminate cockroaches"". In this way, under the vigorous propaganda of Hutu Power Radio, a vicious massacre began.
After the signal of ""Cut down the tall trees!"" the Rwandan militias killed, set fire, smashed houses, etc., and drove the Tutsis to their death. Even the orphans in the orphanage did not let go, many people died. Rwanda has always been in a state of turmoil, which has attracted the attention of the United Nations. Therefore, it has long dispatched troops to mediate in order to maintain peace. However, when the massacre began, foreign troops stationed in Rwanda were withdrawn, and the only hope of the Tutsis was dashed. With Paul's strength, he offered bribes to officers many times. Finally, hundreds of Rwandan Hotel Reed were sent to safety, so they held their lives. Eventually, the massacre was stopped, the Tutsis were rescued, all reactionary activities stopped and peace replaced everything.
This is a war between nations. For a long time, the state has not handled the relationship between the two nationalities properly, has not implemented a reasonable national policy, and has not formulated a complete constitution of the national army, so the massacre occurred. In my opinion, there is no fundamental difference between Hutu and Tutsi. There is no cultural difference, no difference in customs, no need to be racial. Before the incident, Hutu and Tutsi were neighbors, colleagues, friends and lovers. There is no racial discrimination, not to mention the constraints of inter-ethnic interaction. However, after the Hutu incident, they lost their humanity, abandoned friendship, love and family, and carried out massacres irrationally.
Hutu people have always regarded Westerners as intruders, with the majority dominating, and the Tutsis have become ethnic minorities. Within a country, there must be different nationalities, just as there are different people in society. Such a country is a complete country. With the exchange of different nationalities, the culture can be integrated, and the country can have a long history. It is incorrect for Hutu people to expel and kill the Tutsis in order to remove their hatred. War is not the best way to solve all problems. War only brings pain to people. Peace will win war in the end. Hutu people should remember history, but they should strive for peace instead of rewriting it. In response to the massacre, the national government did not intervene in a timely manner and did not formulate a clear system for the management of the army. The national government can carry out regional national autonomy on issues between the two ethnic groups, and each ethnic group can elect its own leaders, which will eventually be under the unified management of the state. A complete set of ethnic policies has been formulated and strictly implemented after reaching consensus on the unity of all ethnic groups. It is essential to arouse people's patriotic and peaceful consciousness, strengthen national patriotic education, deepen cultural exchanges between the two nationalities, and make them live in harmony and peaceful coexistence."

We need to say thanks to the hero that try everything to saving life and stand the side of justice. You maybe will lost you way in the crowd, everyone as same as you did choice so you didn't think, you just follow it, that's not terrible, if you don't change, that's horrible indeed.
Why don't you be nice? I thought in the movie because this is not humanity that killing by hatred, the people who is innocent get killed, and no body help them, the UN, the journalist, they struggled and making self-helping, if there is not a Hutu to confront Hutu rebels more people were died in this event.
Why don't you be nice? Maybe someone will ask nice in our real life, because there is someone did something bad to our society, although it is really serious like the genocide, but it will become big problem when it accumulate, I wish the people watched this movie can reflect and think their behave, do good thing, maybe you could be a hero like Paul, but please don't let yourself be a criminal like the General Bizimungu."

It makes me feel depressed because a lot of people died and they was innocent, I think I will be despair if I meet those event in my country.
I think the UN need to distribute more soldier to stop the massacre and be a peacekeeper so that can let the interhawme be prevented so the massacre will stoped.
If I am a citizen in Rwanda , I will find my friend who are abroad and let them help me and if I can get rescued I will take as more refugees as I can.

In times like these it is ongoingly important to be remembered how absurde and horrifying war really is and also what responsibility lies upon every one of us in order to do what is within his posssibilities to do good. The main character here is not an angel, he has his own interests, trades with the worst people and prioritizes. But when he was needed he took action and saved many. It also shows that such people need help and that we as westerners have possibilities to grant it to them but too often don't care enough to do so.<br/><br/>All in all this is a movie with an important message and some very intense scenes, not a gamechanger artistically but a strong film."

The film is also known as the African Schindler's List for a reason.<br/><br/>It's a fascinating true story, but it also means that we don't see much of the war and genocide happening outside the hotel grounds. We see glimpses and flashes here and there, but mostly this is a movie about what war is like for those that are close to it, but not directly involved. Which has its novelty, but it also means that you don't get that emotional impact you probably went in looking for.<br/><br/>Then again, I have to admit it's brilliantly acted and all-around well-made.

He would bribe people, risking his life in the process, and the fact that he held over 1000 refugees in his hotel was amazing. It pained me to see the army treat Paul and his people like dirt, not even attempting to help with the thousands upon thousands of Hutu murders. The armies came, but they arrived to tell the people that they could not help. Most of the Tutsis did nothing to deserve this hate, but they still received the full force of the genocide. On the other hand, some Hutus also did nothing to be involved in the genocide, but they were still blamed for the murders of the Tutsis. It was very good to see that the Hutu General was sent to a war crimes prison after the genocide, because what he did was horrible.

Almost a million people were killed in this conflict, many of them being innocent people who were blamed for crimes they did not commit. The Hutu extremists wished to exterminate the population of Tutsi's in their country, as well as any sympathizers to their cause. As a result, thousands were killed and the governments of the world didn't help to stop all of the killing until much later. This story instead focuses around a hotel manager who wants to get his people to safety and has to struggle against the Hutu extremists who wish to wipe out everyone in the hotel.

I was surprised seeing it was only a 4 star hotel. An anonymous voice is always heard on the radio that seems to be very angry and filled with revenge. Now, before you watch this movie, you should get a back story on the Rwandan Rebellion between the Hutus and the Tutsis. I'll help explain a little bit, but mainly, the Belgians came in and decided who was to be a Tutsi based on their looks and they were given their position instead of earning it. Due to this, the Hutus eventually had enough of it and the man on the radio said something about falling trees and then instantly the rebellion began. Every Hutu was instantly killing the Tutsis, all based on the separation that occurred only based on a different countries opinion. To me, this is ridiculous, but it is what it is. Another main point is the fact that no other country would get involved, or saw it as a huge problem that they needed to stop. Paul was left at the hotel and eventually it turns into a refugee camp for the Tutsis, now you will have to see the rest. It is a must see!"

","**** May contain strong spoilers ****<br/><br/>This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....<br/><br/>This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.<br/><br/>The Rwanda genocide were happening during about 100 days. As far as the authorities could count, about 1.000.000 were slaughtered, butchered, killed... a brutal hunt due to deep political issues between what we all define as upper class and lower class. Terrible.<br/><br/>This is, as I use to say, an important movie. Shed the light on a genocide that took place in a country ""only themselves cared about"". With just those first words, the whole situation and repulsing actions could point to the darkness of insanity. Many thoughts were let through as I watched this motion picture. One of them were that I had only ""heard something about terrible events in an African country"". This is why these movies is so important. If movies can gather the whole global population in a good and human way, let the movies do that. It can be a fantastic change. I am so glad I turned on this film and were able to grasp what happened down in Rwanda. Mr. Paul Rusesabagina; was he a hero? In the aftermath, there were information coming from a hotel guest during the real activities that Mr. Rusesabagina took money to keep the people at the hotel, with priorities given to the wealthier people. Is it correct to call Mr. Rusesabagina a hero? Only taken consideration to lives, he helped people to survive. About 50 years later from World War II, another man took action and saved lives. In WWII, it was Oskar Schindler.<br/><br/>I can perhaps missed myself information in this movie about exactly what the story and history behind the genocide were. Perhaps I just filtered that through as I enjoyed the movie. On the other hand, if the writers Keir Pearson and Terry George left out some of the background information, this movie may miss the target a little bit. I myself researched a little around this devastating event. With that background information, I could in a better way understand and grasp the entire story and motion picture. <br/><br/>Let's all make an effort to create a world where we wish each other well and treat each other well with good will. Where we desire that we all feel good. Where we all should take the chance to be the best versions of ourselves. Where we care about each other. Where the conditions are created to become competent adults and good individuals.<br/><br/>Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Authentic scenery. A soundtrack that gives the film a little push to enhance the drama. Editing in some scenes could have been better. A few times I could see some errors and strange things from cut to cut. Especially one time, the acting were suffering due to bad editing (quick talk between Paul Rusesdabagina and madame Archer). - The actors : Academy Award nominees. Questions to that one? - The story : Magnificent work to bring light upon the genocide. - Entertainment : Left me with both a sad and happy emotion thinking of all of us humans on this planet. Important and entertaining. - Age : 15 due to brutality and blood<br/><br/>7,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)"

","HOTEL RWANDAHotel Rwanda is a film that was taken 2004.It tells one of the worst atrocities in the history of mankind which takes place in the country of Rwanda in Africa. The film shows the horrors of the civil war in Rwanda, bet**en the ruling Hutus and the rebel Tutsis.The film tells the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, who was the manager of a high class hotel which catered to many foreign clients. As the film opens, the president of Rwanda, a Hutu, has signed a peace agreement with the Tutsi's that will presumably mean the end of unrest in the region. Shortly after signing the treaty, ho**ver, he is assassinated by Tutsi rebels, sparking an uprising throughout the country. The Hutu police call for death to all Tutsi's in the country, and the massacre begins.The world inside Paul's hotel is quite different. While there may be horrendous fighting outside the walls, he attempts to maintain the dignity of the hotel by treating everything as normal. Things begin to change when refugees pour in from the surrounding areas, and Paul is forced to house them, at least until the U.N. can come to the rescue.Paul's main concern is for his family; his wife is a Tutsi, and he must go to great lengths simply to keep her with him. Unbeknownst to Paul, the U.N. has given specific orders not to interfere with the war, and to simply act as a transportation device for those lucky citizens allow**d to leave the country.Meanwhile Paul is forced to leave the hotel to pick up supplies, and it is only after he sees the corpses that litter the roads that he realizes the enormity of the situation. Suddenly, he seems to realize that simply saving his family will not be enough, and garners the strength to attempt to lead the civilians to safety.Because he realizes that neither US army nor U.N will **** them.While thinking these,Paul doesn't want to start out a hero, and doesn't even seem to want to be one. As time passes though,although he doesn't want, he has the task thrust on him, and rises to the occasion.He tries to do his best but can only save a few thousands of people.Unfortunately because of what has happened is true,there is not a real end in the film.In the end Paul and Tatiana tries to find their orphaned nieces among the children of a refugee camp and they find.The reunited family walk off together,as if the story all along had been only about them."

","Seriously this movie wouldn't let you breathe for even a second, that's because you concentrate on hoping that Paul Rusesabagina and his family wouldn't get killed by the Hutu army. I have to admit, I am still shaken after watching this movie twenty minutes ago, it's such a heart stopper!<br/><br/>I can't imagine how the real Paul Rusesabagina felt when his hotel was hijacked and outrun with refugees whose houses were burnt down by the army. The scenes were very shocking with such killings and corpses lying around, even it makes you forget that this is a movie! I was very surprised and shocked that the U.N. were complete buttheads for not bring the Africans into safety at first, this happened the year I was born. Didn't they realise what filth and ignorance did they think of leaving the blacks out of it and bring the whites instead? I was honestly angry and they said no to safety in their country. Who do they think they are? The U.N are still cowards today especially with Korea in trouble! <br/><br/>Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo did such great African accents, you would think they are from Africa when they actually aren't! They were excellent and I applaud this film for not being so Hollywood. I applaud it for what we are facing in reality and I definitely should think it deserved the 3 Oscars! Excellent movie!"

","It's 1994 Kigali. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is a hotel manager who knows the right people and gets things done. He's Hutu but is apolitical. He sees signs of upheaval. His wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) is Tutsi but he expects his connections to pull his family through. Canadian Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) from the UN is at the hotel touting the new peace agreement. Reporter David (David O'Hara) and cameraman Jack Daglish (Joaquin Phoenix) arrive to cover the story. When the massacres start, his home and then his hotel are inundated with refugees.<br/><br/>This is a sincere telling of a harrowing historical story. Don Cheadle delivers a sincere performance. It's all very sincere. There is an inevitability to the story. It is a bit heavy-handed but the history demands some heavy-handedness. However, the lines coming out of Colonel Oliver is too much. There are a couple of instances of overly sincere lines when the simple images are more than enough. I'm almost glad that the white people left the hotel.

","Hotel Rwanda (2004): Dir: Terry George / Cast: Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix, Fana Mokoena: Powerful film about the security found in one place. Set in 1994 where war runs rabid in third world countries Don Cheadle plays a hotel manager threatened with death when soldiers and tanks patrol the streets in search of refugees. Bodies litter the street until Cheadle opens his hotel for others to seek safety although he is running out of resources to bribe protection. Director Terry George captures the conditions and emotions of the event but he also portrays a Biblical allegory with regards to one man risking all, including his own life for the benefit of others. The performances are in top form although Joaquin Phoenix is too brief to warrant necessary. One wonders what he is doing there in the first place. Great performance by Cheadle who pulls off all the stops while struggling to survive himself. He is backed by Sophie Okonedo as his wife who shows support and concern. Then we are given a scene stealing performance by Nick Nolte who appears as a soldier whose best scenes appear towards the end when all chaos breaks loose. This is a well made film that technically conveys the atmosphere these people were stricken with. Strong themes of self sacrifice rewarded in this tense and suspenseful independent film. Score: 9 ½ / 10"

Paul Rusesabagina is an example of how good & concerned a human can be, given the right thought. The violence that occurred & the way its been portrayed on-screen is heartbreaking, disturbing & ultimately repulsive. Violence leads to NO GOOD! Its Unity that leads to Peace, Harmony & Bliss. <br/><br/>Keir Pearson & Terry George's Screenplay is bravely engrossing & genuinely moving. George's Direction is atmospheric. Cinematography captures the helpless scenery, with realism. Editing is sharp. Background Score is perfect.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Don Cheadle leads the show with a power-packed performance. As Paul Rusesabagina, Cheadle delivers a masterclass act, that very rightly won him international acclaim. Sophie Okonedo is affecting as Tatiana Rusesabagina.

","There's an ugly not-my-country-not-my-problem tattoo stamped on the U.S.'s backside. At times, they thoroughly believe in that tattoo; but in others, they gaze at it with a tinge of regret. I'm sure America has felt that potent remorse when reflecting on the Holocaust or the Cambodian genocide. But as one character in Hotel Rwanda puts it, the majority of our nation hears of the crimes, says ""that's awful,"" turns right around, and finishes their dinner. I'm guilty of it, you're guilty of it; we're all guilty of it. There is no one to blame in particular — an ordinary person can't simply drop everything and become a humanitarian — but in Hotel Rwanda, the that's awful mentality is transformed from a mere numbers game to a stinging reality.<br/><br/>In 1994, millions of Rwandan citizens were killed in a response to the snapping of the racial tension between the two predominant ethnicities, the Hutu and the Tutsi. When Tutsi rebels assassinated the country's dictator, Juvénal Habyarimana, the slowly growing mentality that the Tutsi, who migrated to Rwanda early in its foundation, were not natural- born citizens and therefore a threat to the country finally hit its climax. In response, Hutu soldiers began exterminating Tutsi civilians without even batting an eye. <br/><br/>But amidst any atrocity there is always a hero; in the Rwandan genocide's case, that hero was Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of the Hotel Des Milles Collines. By allowing scores of would-be victims to stay in the fluctuating rooms and hallways with no charge, he saved nearly 1,300 people. The film presents him not with the rugged exuberance of a John Wayne type, but rather with a man who feels the need to do the right thing and has the means to do so.<br/><br/>We are only given glimpses into the barbarities that took place in the varying neighborhoods and regions, but Hotel Rwanda succeeds in the fact that it's not a lecture or an in-your-face history lesson. It's by turns enlightening, grim and affecting. Because Rusesabagina is Hutu and his wife is Tutsi (therefore his kids are in grave danger as well), there is an added franticness that makes every second more precious than the last.<br/><br/>Rusesbagina is portrayed by Don Cheadle, his wife by Sophie Okonedo, with Nick Nolte playing a conflicted French Canadian colonel who is forced to make tough decisions in an environment where there isn't any time to make tough decisions. Cheadle's performance is so poignant because he is willing to risk everything he has in order to save others, despite the fact that he may die in the process. To go from fledging hotel manager to a saint within a matter of hours isn't a smooth task, but he accents Rusesbagina's integrity with a devout spirit. What should he do, send every Tutsi out into the street to die? As Rusesbagina's wife, Okonedo is the emotional core of the film, fearing endlessly for her kids and her valiant husband. Okonedo lays every sense she has down on the table; we feel what she feels.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda is a terrifically acted and tremendously vigorous account of a monstrous part of our history. Even though the majority of countries looked away, the film places us at an uncomfortable distance to the heinous event, making us rethink that entire not-my-country-not-my- problem philosophy. <br/><br/>Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com"

","A decade after tribal extremists in Rwanda organized a blitzkrieg of ethnic killing while the world minced its words, Hotel Rwanda spilled out on the screen, aiming to remind us of evils hurriedly forgotten and lessons still unlearnt.<br/><br/>The film picks up just before the presidential assassination. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is a Hutu hotel manager, married to a Tutsi, who never underestimates the value of a bribe, greasing the wheels of commerce and police protection with the occasional bottle of single malt. When the Hutu president is killed by Tutsi rebels, Hutu extremists take to the streets with machetes, slaughtering every Tutsi 'cockroach' they see. Paul finds the four-star hotel he manages turned into an impromptu refugee camp, as Tutsi refugees and their families rush in, seeking out what little protection he can offer. He trusts, still however, in the goodwill of the West. He believes that his activities will be temporary, and that rescue is on its way. But he doesn't immediately grasp what is happening: the West, catching the odd news report, have dismissed the genocide as 'just a bunch of Africans killing each other again', before flipping channels. The UN force, led by a self-disgustedly impotent Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) does what it can to help but it soon becomes clear that Paul will have to rely on his own resilience and back catalog of favors to keep as many of the Tutsi alive as he can. <br/><br/>Filled with indelible, haunting images, Hotel Rwanda is a moving and provocative film that shows how one man can make a difference, even when the evils and horrors around him appear unsurmountable. The film is beautifully understated, eschewing sentimentality in favor of raw emotion and letting the story tell itself. Director Terry George handles the potentially suffocating subject matter with a grace and subtlety that breathes precious life into a heart- wrenching story about the wretched effects of hateful propaganda and an outside world concerned with capitalism over humanity. George never sugarcoats any of the violence - the violence comes frequently and unexpectedly, making for a lasting impression of horrific imageries (Watch Paul floundering among a scattered sea of corpses that he'd unwittingly been driving over in the dawn fog).<br/><br/>Knuckling down to a native accent, Don Cheadle gives a beautifully restrained tour-de-force performance as a singular voice of reason at the epicenter of the carnage. The actor transforms from suave schmoozer of militia leaders, to protective family man, to a reluctant savior who's forever struggling to maintain his fragile composure, all the while sidestepping every histrionic outburst you'd expect. Sophie Okonedo pulls out an equally stirring portrayal of Paul's Tutsi wife, Tatiana while bigger names like Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte - effortlessly energize the smaller roles.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a film of rare courage and imperishable heart that deserves to be seen."

","Making a film of the genocide that took place in Rwanda in 1994 is not an easy thing to do as you need to find a hook to grab the viewers and keep them interested. I have already seen Shooting Dogs which was released at a similar time and also dealt with the events of the Rwandan conflict.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda sees Don Cheadle playing a luxury hotel manager Paul, a Hutu who spends his time charming people of influence. His wife is Tutsi and the he is respected by the corporate owners of the hotel based in Belgium.<br/><br/>As the conflict escalates and using bribes in terms of money and booze to some sympathetic Hutu bigwigs to tune a blind eye he brings over some Tutsi neighbours and his family to the hotel.<br/><br/>Once the UN decide that the country is too dangerous and decide to leave and leave the Tutsis to their deaths, Paul opens up the hotel to the Tutsis and then figure out how to get everyone to safety as the Hutu militia are sensing blood.<br/><br/>The film is based on true events and has a docu-drama feel to it by director Terry George. The film has strong performances from Cheadle, Nick Nolte and Sophie Okonedo.<br/><br/>Maybe because I saw Shtting Dogs first there was an element of seen it all before. The film could had done with more spikiness as to why UN forces left people to such a fate when they were supposed to be protecting them."

","Terry George's Hotel Rwanda is not only a movie about the Rwandan genocide in 1994 that lasted 100 days but it is a movie where hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle) (even though he is a Hutu) is defending Tutsi refugees including his wife Tatiana Rusesabagina (played by Sophie Okonedo) (while being protected by the United Nations) from the Hutu militia known as the Interhamwe. While watching this movie another movie entered my mind over an dover again and that was Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993) because both movies were powerful stories told in an extraordinary way. The writing, casting and story was very intelligent , as well as the supporting cast which includes Nick Nolte as the commanding U.N. officer, Joaquin Phoenix as a press cameraman, and many more well done performances. Out of all the best Actor nominees at the 77th Academy Awards i think that any single one could have won instead of Jamie Foxx for his performance in Ray (2004) but really Cheadle deserved it the most because his performance was moving, and inspirational because he proved that a man must make tough decisions in his life, and that you have to do the right thing even if you don't feel so sure about it."

"Red-Barracuda","7","0","0","19 August 2014"," An incredible story of bravery within one of the most barbaric episodes in recent history
","The Rwandan genocide of 1994 remains one of the worst atrocities in recent history. Maybe even the very worst. After all, has there been a situation since where 800,000 people were murdered in a three month period? Not only that but they were primarily killed by being hacked to death by machetes; women, children, babies – everyone. The massacres were a result of the Hutu tribe taking vengeance on their Tutsi counterparts. The problem between the tribes had its roots in colonialism, where the Belgians had installed the Tutsis in positions of power due to them looking more 'European'. This ties in with more recent events in the Middle East where Western intervention has caused many more problems than it has resolved. Unfortunately, history has a tendency of repeating itself. But the biggest disgrace of the Rwandan situation was that the world actually did not intervene when the people of the country really needed them to. They did nothing aside from save their own citizens. The United Nations came out of it looking especially bad and completely ineffective, basically withdrawing when ten of their men were killed. The fallout was an unchecked murder spree of unbelievable proportions.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of this horror via a true life story with a positive narrative. It focuses on a Hutu called Paul Rusesabagina who is the manager of the Les Milles Collines hotel in Kigali. He used his connections to save over a thousand people by giving them shelter in his hotel and by doing so putting himself in considerable danger. The narrative has some very obvious similarities to Schindler's List (1993). It's kind of a story that seems too unbelievable to be true but true it is though. It does sanitise the story somewhat though, in that it resists showing violence or too graphic results of the carnage. I think this pulling of its punches was a bad move though as this was such a dreadfully violent situation that the film would have been better served being more explicit to hammer home the true horror. The similar film Shooting Dogs (2005) presented the carnage more harshly and in some respects had more of an overall emotional impact as a result. What Hotel Rwanda does have though is Don Cheadle. Rusesabagina is played by this excellent actor in a performance of perfection. The on location shooting also contributes a lot to the overall impact. And even though the music was too forcefully Hollywood obvious at times, the drama overall was very effective in giving its message out clearly without being too contrived. All-in-all, an impressive film about a bit of history that shames the Western world."

The almost forgotten but all too real African genocide documented in Hotel Rwanda hits us as suddenly and as hard as it does Paul Rusesabagina, the accidental hero played so masterfully by Don Cheadle."

","Hotel Rwanda is one of those movies that I had quite a tough time rating. Picking between a 7, 8 or 9 was very difficult. As you see I picked an 8. Here's why. The movie was well filmed, well written, extremely well acted and well edited, but I found that the pacing was a little bit slow at some points. Other then that, this was quite an excellent movie. As always, Don Cheadle excelled in his part as the hotel manager. One of the things that was so very appealing about this film was the fact that the story that they told actually happened. And it's hard to believe that many of us never even heard about it. There is also something to be said about the real-life human being that Don Cheadle portrayed. The hotel manager was such an interesting and caring man, that is always a plus in my books when I'm looking for a lead role. So in conclusion, I should just say that this film is really good and you should at least watch the trailer to find out what you think. <br/><br/><ul><li>Marcel Laforge</li></ul>"

","Summary: HOTEL RWANDA stars Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, a real lifetime hotel manager who became a courageous hero in Kigali when he witnessed the horrifying massacre of the Tutsis by the Hutu extremists in Rwanda, while the rest of the world looked on and did nothing about it. The massacre was part of one of the few of the worst atrocities in humankind history and it really occurred in April 1994, now twenty years ago. This is a story that really happened and it isn't fictional. 4 or maybe 5 parts of the true reality were changed in the film, but overall the movie mostly shows what really happened, I think. This is the kind of dramatic motion picture which completely catches your attention and drives you through the minds and emotions experienced by the leading characters. This is a story that I believe everyone should pay careful attention because Hotel Rwanda is truly sobering and heartfelt, and I'm really not kidding about it. In my opinion, everyone should like this movie and pay close attention to the way characters behave, because that's mainly what captured my mind and made me like the film. My comments are that the actors who had the main lead in the story all played well and were believable inside the skin of their characters they were interpreting. Don Cheadle and Sophie Kurlenko had an excellent performance and I won't ever forget it. Their performance was well done, because the magnitude of their performance was so high and that really shows the power of the human struggle and how much they care about the problems taking place around them. Plus, the film has feel-good warmth, is constantly filled with one problem after another, has a sparklingly original, well written screenplay and that's all great. This isn't a movie about action, but about the human heart and don't already think in advance that the movie will be boring with not enough action. JUST go watch it and see it for yourself. Enjoy!"

","Cheadle is infinitely moving and Sophie Okonedo is quietly magnificent as his wife. The sensitivity of their performances is matched by the script and direction, which make their points, both personal and political, with grace, not bitterness. Like Schindler's List, this film takes us deeply into the horror of one of the 20th century's greatest tragedies by allowing us to focus on the illumination cast by one small story of grace, courage, and humanity. The film works because Cheadle, Nolte and the filmmakers are interested in how two men choose to function in an impossible situation. Because we sympathize with these men, we are moved by the film."

Hotel Rwanda is basically a similar portrayal of how a single man saved a lot of lives by risking his own lives. The movie doesn't compete with Schindler by any of the artistic characteristics, but it deserves praise on it's own merit. Don Cheadle done an excellent job with his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who housed thousands of Rwandan refugees.

","There are movies and then there are some like Shawshank Redemption which catch hold of your imagination and let you experience the pain, agony, happiness or whatever emotion they wanted to convey. Hotel Rwanda is a movie of that category.<br/><br/>Do i give credits for this emotionally packed, high on action with a pinch of violence to the actors in the movie, maybe the director, the writer? I don't know. All of them have shown that while making this movie they were at the top of their game.I had never though Don to be an actor of such mettle or Terry George,a powerful director for that matter, but they now have given me a reason to believe what they can do when given a chance. And since watching this movie i am on a hunt for their other movies. I am definitely buying the DVD for this one though.<br/><br/>An apt portrayal of the HUTU dominion over the TUTSI, a perfect showcase of the sufferings of a war, a movie on family, a presentation of the west's doings in the Africa and how easily it would evacuate those they are 'concerned about' without helping those actually affected, this movie will show you all.<br/><br/>If a man like Paul Russesbagina could do it in such dire conditions, i undoubtedly think there will be anyone who won't appreciate it and to portray the same must have been a challenge which, fortunately,was excelled at.<br/><br/>What should I say about the direction, every scene in the movie is worth paying attention to, a fact true enough because I didn't blink even once during the entire movie :)<br/><br/>For those who think such movies are only for the weeping clan, I'd say think again since this movie offers not only emotional highs but many lessons worth keeping in mind and to find them out, go watch the movie as soon as you can lay your hands on it.<br/><br/>I was surprised to find that this movie was not even nominated for the Academy Awards of 2004 while some truly forget-worthy movies made the cut, to them I would ask what were they thinking? <br/><br/>In my opinion, I feel this movie is pretty under-rated and deserves a spot in the top 25 movies of the IMDb.

","Based on the true events of the massacre that took place in Rwanda during its civil war, Hotel Rwanda is a tale of how a simple man went too far & risked his own life to save as many people as he possibly could even when he had the chance to simply walk away unharmed. It's a disturbing, violent film that also shows how the entire world deserted this nation when it needed them most. Don Cheadle stars as Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager who housed thousands of people in his hotel & his performance was, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the strongest of the decade and he single-handedly carried this film throughout its runtime and was brilliantly aided by other supporting actors. On an overall scale, Hotel Rwanda is a sad, disturbing, heartfelt tale of loss & genocide but also a very important film. Like Schindler's List, it shows that nothing is more valuable than a human life and just like Oskar Schindler, it shows a compassionate human being who stood up against all odds to save a race from complete annihilation.

","In 1994, in a globalized world concerned with Western affairs, the east-central state of Rwanda disintegrated into a state of neglected turmoil. Within a period of just three months, the nation's Hutu ethnic majority brutally slaughtered 800,000 Tutsi minority members due to deeply-rooted conflicts, resulting from a legacy of the Colonial Era known as ""Tyranny of the Map."" However, Hotel Rwanda (2004) focuses not on the atrocities of mankind, but rather on its humanitarian success. In the midst of chaos, the level-headed hotel manager, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) uses his store of goodwill, collected through the flattery of influential powers, to protect his Tutsi family, along with over one-thousand refugees within the safety of his hotel. Rusesabagina epitomizes the good in society, driving miracles in a land torn by violence.<br/><br/>In a world skewed toward moral deterioration, few people possess the nerve required to do what is right in the face of terror; however, director Terry George recognizes that these people do exist, and they act as the moral compass that guides the masses and lend hope in an increasingly hopeless world. Paul Rusesabagina endeavors as one such leader, and George utilizes his example to not only shed light and promote Western intervention in genocides of the 21st Century, but also to demonstrate that one person – a person whom holds fast to what is right – can be the difference between a massacre and the lives of 1,200 people. Hotel Rwanda illustrates that light shines even in the darkest of places, and accomplishes so through the brilliant use of character and other film techniques.<br/><br/>George effectively realizes that his film must not focus on the entirety of the genocide; rather, it must focus on the courageous acts of a man in an imploding world. The countless scenes of butchered bodies, emotional breakdowns, and gunfire undoubtedly elicit the emotions of the audience as they witness the atrocities of mankind; however, these very events reinforce Rusesabagina's demonstration that good will prevail against evil. Overall, Hotel Rwanda triumphs as a compelling drama depicting the need to help others in a time of desperation."

","Dialogue over a radio opens Hotel Rwanda hinting at the impending genocide of the Tutsi people. The next few scenes play out with a sense of terror in the air as various snippets of dialogue encourage violent action. Paul Ruseabagina (Don Cheadle), a hotel owner and a Hutu, is married to a Tutsi. His marriage has caused tension with certain Hutus. Historically the Hutu and the Tutsi have not had the best relations. One morning this violent tension explodes as the Hutu begin killing all the Tutsi. Paul flees to his hotel and begins to hide and save the lives of as many Tutsis as he can.<br/><br/>The film's tension creates a sense of danger throughout. The deaths depicted in the film are usually off camera or in the distance, allowing the viewer to imagine the horrific deeds. Unlike other films of violent events in Africa which play up the violence for ""entertainment"", this film turns the volume down, allowing for a more impactful viewing experience. Brutal images are not needed to confirm this.<br/><br/>The theme of genocide raises questions we can ask ourselves after the film. Exactly what makes people hate each other? After the Holocaust, many thought we would never see a similar incident again. Pol Pot in Cambodia and the violence in Yugoslavia have occurred within the same generation,confriming that the human race has not learned frm past mistakes. The incident in this film occurred two decades ago. Hopefully this film along with other films (Schindler's List) allows us to see the horrors of genocide caused by hatred perpetuated by manufactured differences. Most importantly, the film encourages one to read and learn, so we as human beings do not repeat the horrors of the past."

","After watching Hotel Rwanda, I realized why this film is considered as the ""African Schindler's List"". Based on a true story, Hotel Rwanda managed to capture the brightest and darkest sides of the human race - from the heroic deeds of Mr. Rusesabagina to the horrendous Rwandan genocide. Until I watched this movie, I had only heard about the Rwandan genocide, I had no idea about how terrifying and brutal it really was. The film didn't only manage to portray the cold-blooded actions of the Interahamwe, but also the West's shameful ability to neglect and ignore the genocide of almost a million innocent Tutsi and Hutu refugees - one of the reasons to why this was one of the most shameful and horrific times of our race. The plot was mostly historically accurate as far as I know (except some dramatization in some scenes such as when Paul doesn't get on the bus with his family and stays behind at the hotel instead). Surprisingly though, the movie was not dramatized in the violent aspect, as according to Mr. Rusesabagina, the violence in the movie was far less severe than it was during the actual genocide. Nonetheless, I must add that Cheadle's performance really had me, his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina was astonishing and real (as far as I know), while Nick Nolte's acting also kept me satisfied.

George stays focused on Rusesabagina's story as the violence has been toned down. One can only imagine how much bloodier, visceral and brutal it really was. More than a million people were slaughtered while the rest of the world just went about with their daily lives. Pearson and George's screenplay is solid and the execution is quite raw. The art direction is brilliant as the sets and costumes looks authentic. The background score is effective without being melodramatic.

Seriously, just every emotion a person can have, I had while watching this movie.<br/><br/>It is a masterpiece. It is a raw portrait of the conflict in Rwanda in the 1990s, of the people who went through every day of it in fear. There is nothing wrong with this film. The only thing that I don't like about it is the fact that everything in it is true and happened. I hate the cruelty of man, but I love the perseverance of the human spirit.<br/><br/>The score of this movie is brilliant. It tells you what's coming. It forces you to be sad, or happy, whatever, when it's the time. You can't watch a sad scene in this film, hear the music, and not be saddened. It complements the movie perfectly. It's a lot of orchestra, violins predominantly, and an African song sung by children. It's chilling. It's absolutely beautiful.<br/><br/>I cried several times during this film. Not just little tears rolling down my cheeks, no, I was crying out loud. It will tear you up. I have never struggled so much to get through a movie. When the case warned of disturbing images, I knew what was coming, you know, corpses strewn about, young and old. I didn't think it was going to impact me as it did.

Don't watch the movie passively. Imagine being there, sleeping on the floor of hallways surrounded by strangers, crying children and babies, permitted to eat only a fraction of what you ate before and unable to bathe regularly. Imagine not being able to close your eyes for fear that when you open them again there will be a gun in your face. Imagine not wanting to turn your back on your family because when you turn around they may not be there. Let this movie change you.<br/><br/>I own this movie and I am extremely proud to. It is one of the most incredible cinematic documentations of true life that I have ever witnessed. I definitely recommend it.<br/><br/>Don't forget this movie after the credits start rolling.

The film addresses the horrors of the Rwandan genocide, and the horrific arbitrariness that makes one group of people so utterly hate another that they want to destroy them, but it's never preachy. Director Terry George successfully walks the delicate line between making an entertaining film about a terrible incident without exploiting it.<br/><br/>Cheadle was rightfully Oscar nominated, and a nomination also went to Sophie Okonedo as his wife.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","A film of this proportion covering the 1994 Rwandan conflict would have to stock its shelves with a dominant and talented cast to create the sense of emotion that such a topic deserves. This film forms the harsh contrast of terrible truth in a world that we thought was civilized. <br/><br/>Don Cheadle plays the role of Paul Rusesabagina, a real-life hotel manager in Rwanda who begins the film simply trying to save his wife, Tatiyana (Sophie Okonedo) and children. Supported by a UN General played by Nick Nolte, Paul becomes a savior, and his hotel is the only ""oasis"" for over 1,200 people in a nation filled with turmoil. As the world turns their back on his country, he realizes that he cannot turn away from the hundreds of people who look to him for strength.<br/><br/>Cheadle gives a commanding performance in his portrayal of Rusesabagina. One realizes the ignorance of so many people in this third world country, and Cheadle shows a sophisticated and intelligent difference from this norm in each one of his actions. From his treatment of the orphanage children to the way he makes the President of Sabena stand up and listen, his presentation is truly inspirational.<br/><br/>In comparison to the high-strung UN general played by Nolte, Cheadle is the ""eye of the storm""; he beautifully illustrates the emotional strength and clarity of thought that had to be the only traits that saved the real Paul and his refugees.<br/><br/>Okonedo, who plays Paul's wife Tatiyana, delivers an outstanding supporting role as a strong wife and mother who is a member of the Tutsi tribe that is being attacked. She is the main reason that Paul even allowed refugees in his hotel; begging him do save their friends and neighbors who gathered at their home. Okonedo excellently conveys the emotional strain of a woman in such a difficult situation.<br/><br/>The story of what happened in Rwanda needed to be told by something other than the film camera crews that were on location. But to display the magnitude of what really happened, the resulting would need to put the viewer right there, in the middle of the action. This film provides the viewer a true story of Paul Rusesabagina who is a hero and a victim at the same time. Terry George creates a dramatic and emotional film with the location, the special effects, and the hundreds (possibly thousands) of extras that give the viewer a sense of how cruel and ignorant humans can be to one another.<br/><br/>A difficult, but realistic film to watch, I have not seen something so powerful since The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Such a high-quality story accompanied by several commanding performances deserved more than a few award nominations, and many more wins; I expected to see the entire main cast on stage for the Oscars and Academy Award nominations."

","It is a powerful portrait of a slightly befuddled man who, when inhuman demands were placed on him, found within himself an unexpected response. The owner (Don Cheadle) of a hotel in Kigali opens it as a refuge for imperilled Tsutsis during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda is a powerful slant on a crisis that shook the world, but not to the extent of stepping in: it works mainly as a conventional salute to one man's bravery, but Cheadle handles the demands of his role superbly. The film was nominated and won several awards in 2004–2005, including those from the Berlin and Toronto International Film Festivals."

","Hotel Rwanda is based on a true and sad story. This movie is based off the Rwandan genocide that killed thousands of people back in the early 90's. This movie explore the emotions of what the natives were going through and the fact that not one single country cared about the people dying.<br/><br/>This film is directly about Paul Rusewanabinga, a hotel manager. His job is to keep himself, his family, and his patrons safe from the terrible doings of the genocide.<br/><br/>The acting is near perfect. Don Cheadle basically carried this movie himself. He is a very good actor. The actor who needed more screen time is Joaquin Phoenix. He barely had 5 minutes on screen if that.<br/><br/>This is a very emotional movie. I'm sure that this movie will bring tears to a few eyes. This is one of the few movies that no one should forget. This is a truly powerful movie. I rate this film 9.5/10."

","I have never seen such a movie before. Trying to save lives without bloodshed! The movie shines in it's own sheer brilliance and definitely has a moral for each one of us.<br/><br/>The director has done an Excellent job! Don Cheadle does justice to his role as the Hotel Manager. It takes nerves of steel to stay back and protect others, even after you get a chance to save your life along with your family, especially when you are a common man. The moral behind the story is simply outstanding. The sacrifice that a man makes(who is a husband, father and a responsible manager), even risking his own life, to save others is simply moving, emotionally touching and definitely teaches us all something good. <br/><br/>A wife's anger on her husband, because he wanted his wife and children to be safe and endangering his own life in the process, shows the amount of love that she has for him. If every woman loves her husband as much as the wife of Hotel manager loves her husband, then such kind of woman is surely worth to die for!!! This shows the strength of love and bond between a couple and definitely is a good lesson for all couples out there.<br/><br/>Conclusively, this is a must watch for everyone!<br/><br/>Thank you."
"Electrified_Voltage","10","0","0","16 March 2010"," A great performance from the leading actor in this moving historical drama!
","The 1994 Rwandan Genocide happened during my lifetime, but I was just under eight years old, and was totally unaware of the atrocities that were taking place. In fact, I knew absolutely nothing about it until ten years later, when I was taught about the genocide in high school. That was shortly before the release of this film, ""Hotel Rwanda"". So, I knew about the mass murder by the time this 2004 historical drama came to theatres, and knew that this was a film about it. I was probably well aware of this movie's existence from around the time of its theatrical release, and I remember being interested in seeing it years ago, but that never happened. I never saw the film before renting it last week, but now that I have seen it, I think I can understand why it was so well received.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples in the African country of Rwanda is on the rise in 1994! The Tutsi people are often referred to as ""cockroaches"" by Hutu extremists and anti-Tutsi propaganda is constantly heard on the radio. Paul Rusesabagina runs a hotel called Sabena HÃ´tel des Mille Collines in this country. He is Hutu, but his wife, Tatiana, is Tutsi. As the danger in this African country increases, Paul and his family witness the appalling assault of a neighbour! Paul has to use his bribing skills to protect his family from the anti-Tutsi powers that be, and it isn't long before the hotel manager begins to provide shelter for Tutsi refugees at his hotel. After he takes his family and neighbours there, many more refugees come from different places for shelter and protection at this hotel! Paul must do everything he can to prevent the murders of as many Tutsis as possible, which gets increasingly difficult.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, we hear an anti-Tutsi propaganda radio broadcast. With this, the film is already compelling, and it continues this way. This drama as a whole is a very powerful one, with a lot to hold the attention of the viewer with. There's a lot of tension in the film, and it's hard not to admire the protagonist for his courage. Since this is a movie about genocide, it's not surprising that there are heart-wrenching scenes here, such as Paul and Tatiana's son, Roger found injured outside the house (it doesn't take long for this scene to come), and a Red Cross worker named Pat Archer talking about the killing of a Tutsi orphan! There are scenes which viewers could easily not expect and find pretty shocking! In addition to all this, an excellent script was written for ""Hotel Rwanda"", and the dialogue and acting in the film are generally impressive. For a film like this, it goes at a decent pace, not too fast and not too slow. The lead role is played by Don Cheadle, and I wasn't familiar with this actor at all before seeing him in this drama, but many people think his performance here is excellent, and I agree. It's one of the many memorable aspects of this powerful movie! <br/><br/>Since this successful 2004 drama is based on a true story, one might wonder how accurate it is. As with any other historical film, I can't be the one to tell you exactly how historically accurate or inaccurate it is. I know that UN Peacekeeping forces leader Colonel Oliver is a fictional character, though he is loosely based on Romeo Dallaire, a former Canadian Lieutenant General who is well known for his contributions to stopping the Rwanda genocide. I'm also sure that it was more complicated than ""Hotel Rwanda"" shows, and obviously not all the events of the genocide are shown in this film. On the other hand, it seems some people have praised the film for its historical accuracies. Well, even though it obviously can't teach you EVERYTHING about the genocide and the conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples that led to it, it's still a very well made film, and it can really make viewers think about the cruelty and danger in the world! It's obviously not the most pleasant movie to watch, but if you're looking for a gripping emotional drama based on a true story, I recommend it!"
"Richasantos","8","0","0","5 March 2010"," Reality too real!
","There is only one thing I can say after seeing this movie. They made reality too real. The horror lived by the Tutsi's was put on the silver screen with shocking realism and in gruesome detail. Hotel Rwanda represents bravery (about those who helped solve this conflict, focused on saving as many people as possible without concern for their own wellbeing), it cant also represent cruelty (about those who killed thousands of people because they had a different nose or lighter skin). Basically, It's a movie that symbolizes humanities strengths and weaknesses. It also shows us that African countries cannot overcome their own problems without asking Europe or USA (for example) for help. Through the entire movie bribes and favors are a constant subject. For me, reality doesn't make me cry, doesn't make me laugh, but It does make me think: How/Why is mankind capable of committing such atrocities? How/Why are there men capable of not respecting the meaning of life? How/Why are there men capable of respecting the lives of others more then their own?"
"johnmschofield","10","0","0","19 February 2010"," A shining example of one person's fight to try and do the right thing
","I first watched this film only recently and after it was finished my overall feeling was of depression. Before I go any further I should say that it was a very disturbing and moving experience and I am glad that I spent the time to watch it properly. The film is very well made and the storyline is strong and ultimately as in most of this type of film the end result is whatever you make of it. This description sounds extremely vague but in my opinion the positive way of looking at it is that at least someone stood up to be counted and actually tried to save some of the people. If you look at it in a negative way only a small percentage of people were saved and perhaps it could be seen to be a futile attempt at trying to do what you can when virtually nobody is willing to help for numerous reasons. The way I sum it up is that one person saving one other person is an achievement and if everybody who was able tried this who knows how many more could have been saved. Anyway this film portrays people in the very worst of circumstances and this lofty ideal has its merits but when you are in a position of death being just a heartbeat away it doesn't really figure too highly in the minds of everybody under this sort of pressure. This film has been compared to Schindlers list and when you have watched it you will probably see why. This film represents an example of what happens when a group of people try to impose their will on another group of people. In my opinion unfortunately this situation will keep happening somewhere else because the United Nations and other organisations cannot act soon enough and when they do their frame of reference is so limited any peace keeping forces will not be able to interfere. At some point somebody in authority hopefully decides to do something helpful and if as in this case it is successful the world and its dog can watch in awe as someone cares enough to risk his or her life for others. Sadly it simply doesn't happen often enough and that is ultimately why this film is depressing to me. However as a shining example of a really brave person trying to do the right thing I would recommend this film to anyone."

","Hotel Rwanda shows a country falling apart with the sudden start of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. What follows is an unreal, incomprehensible nightmare, in which the protagonists watch how everything they valued is being destroyed. The lack of an explanation amplifies the absurdity of the situation, while the fact that this movie covers recent events increases the impression that this could be happening here and now. The great acting draws the viewer into the characters' situation, and together with them it is waiting for the international community to come to the rescue. They will come, won't they? In summary, I found this a very touching and eye opening movie. One of a kind."
"Samiam3","8","0","0","30 October 2009"," Schindler's List in Africa
","What is the definition of a hero?<br/><br/>Naturally a hero is one who saves lives, but with a particular state of mind. Fictional heroes (including macho cops and super heroes) save lives but not in a moving way. They risk nothing and have no fear. They come to the resucue and a crowd cheers them on, before going back to their lives, not realizing that they could have been the ones in distress. Real heroes are people like Paul Rusesabagina, an African version of Oskar Schindler. He risked his life and everything he had, to save many lives out of love and selflessness. <br/><br/>The tiny, internationally neglected nation of Rwanda, in central Africa, is made up of two peoples, Hutus and Totsis. They are rivals. With the help of the UN, they almost made a peace treaty in 1994. On the day that was to happen, the Totsi rebels shot down the Hutu president. The Hutus then went on a massive manslaughter, taking no Tutsi prisoners, just hacking them down in cold blood (especially children, to prevent future generations) Paul Rusesabagina was the manager of one of the most luxurious Rwandan hotels. He was Hutu but his wife was Tutsi. By bribing the police (with what little he had) and thinking on the fly day and night amidst the gun fire that was erupting all over Rwanda, Paul was able to save the lives of 1200 innocent Tutsis, until the UN was able to transport them to freedom.<br/><br/>Rwanada is a sad story, not just because of what happened there, but because it took too long for the UN to give sufficient aid. The country was ignored by the rest of the world, practically dismissed as a speck of dirt.<br/><br/>The movie is not quite as heartbreaking as Schindler's List, but it is almost flawless. It feels like there are a couple of unnecessary sequences, but no movie is truly perfect. Sensational acting across the board except for Nick Nolte, who delivers his lines as if he is in a gangster movie. Probably a miscasting.<br/><br/>So once again, I ask you, what is a hero? Well, here is an example of a real one."

","The movie is about a man trying to rescue Tutsi refuges during the very sad incidence in Rwanda where Hutu militia committed one of the biggest genocide in modern times. This movie is certainly a true master piece, a corner stone in movie history. Don Cheadle is in general a great actor but his performance in this movie is far more than excellent. Character development, story telling, directing and acting is truly professional. You can feel the drama as the story progresses. It reminded the cold face of the truth. Our humanism, democracy and all other nonsense that we like to talk about is nothing but a pile of lies. We all watched millions killing each other and we did nothing."
"valadas","8","0","0","7 June 2009"," The word is genocide
","Yes genocide committed against Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda in 1994: almost one million dead. The authors of the massacre were the Hutu militiamen. A particular savage massacre including of children and women done chiefly with cutlasses. This is what this movie is about and it describes and shows the situation and the various acts of violence in a very realistic and convincing way. But this is also the story of a particularly courageous man, a Hutu hotel manager married to a Tutsi who, risking his own life and safety, sheltered in his hotel in Kigali more than 1,000 people of the Tutsi ethnic group thus saving their lives. A small parenthesis now to say that some ethnologists say that the differences between Hutus and Tutsis are much more social than ethnic. It was fomented by German and Belgian colonists during their respective rules of the countries of Rwanda and Burundi following the old maxim that to rule you must divide; the German colonists considered Hutus those natives who possessed more than ten cows or (and) had an European-like straight nose. Both groups had lived in peace till the arrival of Germans first and Belgians later and only after that and after the decolonization period they began to be at each other's throats with Hutus killing Tutsis in Rwanda and Tutsis killing Hutus in the neighbouring Burundi. But going back to the movie this is in fact a true story (in the sense that the narrated facts happened indeed) and told in a succession of revealing episodes, images and dialogues of great strength that don't put aside the clear responsibility of western powers who deliberately withdrew their troops and abandoned the victims to their doom betraying their mission of maintaining order and protecting innocent civilians. Also an excellent performance of the cast mainly of the principal protagonists such as the Hutu hotel manager, his Tutsi wife and the UN commander in charge of protecting the hotel with a ridiculous half a dozen troops or so but who, despite that, accomplishes his mission in a brave and gallant way (performed by Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo and the veteran Nick Nolte)."

We as a human being, from the beginning of the word, have not learned that there is nothing valuable than a living human life.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","0","25 February 2009"," Educational and emotional film with a story that needed to be told
","Films like ""Hotel Rwanda"" are important. When it comes to genocide, the human race needs constant reminders that just because we've managed to stop it once before, it doesn't mean it won't happen again and isn't happening right now. The war between the Hutus and the Tutsis in Rwanda in the early '90s is just one example and it's portrayed in a meaningful and emotional light in Terry George's film.<br/><br/>""Hotel Rwanda"" tells the courageous story of Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle), a hotel manager who saves many lives, Tutsi and Hutu alike, by hiding refugees in his hotel and bribing Hutu military leaders to protect them. It's an up-and-down story of how one minute they feel safe with the UN there to help them and the next minute they've been abandoned and left for dead. Rusesabagina, however, is always trying his hardest to do what he feels is right. He is empowered and his leadership becomes invaluable.<br/><br/>Though Don Cheadle had been around long before this film, this is without question his breakout role. A much deserved Oscar nomination for a performance that is winning of your heart and sympathies. He might not have the command or the intimidation factor of a Denzel Washington or Will Smith, but that's what makes him so right for this film--he is an unlikely hero of sorts.<br/><br/>The story is excellent, focusing mostly on what happens to Paul and his family, placing some context to the fighting by adding in the audio of a propagandist Hutu radio show promoting hate at various intervals during the film. In general, the film doesn't address the conflict as much as focus on the individual story, so while you develop deep feeling for the characters, the impact of the conflict itself in the historical sense is not as strong. <br/><br/>This is also not as violent of a movie as it would seem. Although George is not timid about showing you a body count, there is minimal blood and there are no really disturbing images. Some people might need to see it to really feel the impact, but in a sense it's commendable that such a strong and affecting story could be told without a ""gross-out"" factor. It also makes this a strong educational film that everyone can learn from."

I was frightened by how Hollywood may distort the story of the Rwandan genocide for commercial reasons. Well, I have to admit that I think they did a wonderful job. Don Cheadle really rises to the task, despite being American. It feels right to have concentrated on one person's remarkable story and allowing the horrifying conflict ( and the world's guilt ) to remain as a backdrop. I find this an important film in the way Shindlers List was important in telling a man's story and reminding us of the flawed humanity which caused it to happen in the first place.

","Hotel Rwanda is the amazing and heartwarming true story of Paul Rusesabagina, played wonderfully by Don Cheadle. Paul owns a hotel in violent Rwanda during the civil war. The Hutu and Tutsi people are at odds and Paul is a Hutu and his wife, Tatiana, is a Tutsi. In the midst of the war Paul sees the atrocities being committed to his fellow Rwandans and makes his hotel a safe haven for refugees. The film is incredibly moving. Although it shows the horrors of life in Rwanda during the war, with people being dragged from their homes, murdered, and living scared for their lives, there is also a humanity and uplifting aspect. The compassion that Paul and his wife have for the refugees and the risks they are willing to take to keep those within the hotel is heartwarming. One of my favorite things about the film is that it doesn't shy away from portraying the Rwandan conflict and the genocide that is occurring and brings the country's issues to light. The film has raised awareness of the genocide and telling this true story brings some hope to the situation. Cheadle is amazing in the film and carries it. His performance is convincing and moving, he is the perfect man for this role."

","By the time this movie ends, you really have no choice but to sit back and take a deep breath as you process the insanity of the fact that this really happened. A million corpses. That's the note this movie ends on, in estimating the carnage caused in Rwanda as a result of the Hutu slaughter of Tutsis in the early 1990's. ""Hotel Rwanda"" offers just one glimpse into the madness - but a soberingly powerful glimpse.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle is brilliant as Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a Belgian owned hotel in the capital of Kigali, who is left in charge when the Europeans leave and finds himself the sole protector of what would become hundreds of desperate Tutsis, who find shelter in the hotel. Paul is a Hutu who is married to a Tutsi, and who is horrified by the escalating violence. Sophie Okonedo is equally brilliant as Paul's wife Tatiana, under threat for being a Tutsi, her children under threat, her brother and his family missing in the midst of the chaos. You get drawn into this family's nightmare, but the movie never becomes solely about them. It's always about the insanity, and the complete failure of the international community to do anything about it. From that point of view, Nick Nolte plays Col. Oliver, a Canadian officer in command of far too few UN peacekeepers, who knows what's happening but is powerless to stop it. Oliver is essentially a representation of Canadian General Romeo Dallaire, who was the UN Commander in Rwanda at the time. Nolte wasn't as brilliant as Cheadle or Okonedo. I thought he struggled a bit with the part, although he drew out the character's frustration and anger at the UN's impotence.<br/><br/>The movie reminded me a bit of ""Schindler's List"" - particularly as Paul bargained with Hutu officers for the lives of Tutsis, just as Schindler bargained with Nazis for the lives of Jews. The first hour or so I thought was a bit slow, although director Terry George built the suspense nicely, and one of the more interesting parts of the movie came in that first hour with an explanation of the difference between Hutus and Tutsis. It apparently isn't a traditional tribal designation. The Belgian colonizers divided the natives into these two groups, based on the lightness of their skin and the wideness of their noses! There's no happy ending in this movie. There is a family reunion of sorts (a partial one, anyway) but the haunting memory for me was that closing caption - ""a million corpses."" Even after writing all this, the more I think about it, the more I wonder - how do you do justice to a movie like this in a short review? 9/10"

","Paul Rusesabagina is the human face of a conflict the West chose to ignore. In ages that pre-date multimedia, conflicts like this occurred and were forgotten because no one took the time to chronicle them. Our consciences no longer have that luxury. Nor, however, do we feel any moral compulsion to action. Especially when it comes to Africa. The continent is, after all, the heart of darkness, and we choose to believe that evil deeds that take place there are beyond our comprehension or powers to intervene.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda gives the lie to that myth by showing the human faces of the genocide that took place. Rusesabagina's initial prevarication is admissible with the benefit of hindsight. Most of us, in similar circumstances, would choose 'not to get involved.' As filmcraft Hotel Rwanda excels by telling an African story. Nick Nolte is good as a compromised UN General, but it is Cheadle who shines brightest as a man called to act in a way nothing he has done previously suggests he can. This is not Africa through the prism of the white man's eyes. Africans commit, Africans fail to act, and Africans rise above in an African conflict. The West is complicit, historically and contemporaneously, but responsibility for the horrific acts that are let loose ultimately belong to Africans. As do the plaudits for the heroism.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda is an important film, a fine film, that humanises and lays prosaic an ugly chapter in recent human history few of us chose to contemplate or condemn. Tense, shocking and cathartic in equal measure, it will live to do for the Rwandan conflict what The Killing Fields did for Cambodia."

","Hotel Rwanda is an important film. It tells the true story (some fictionalization here, but not much) of Hutu hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who, during the genocidal events of 1994, shelters both Tutsi and Hutu refugees, including his family, in his hotel and defends them by bribing the reluctant military and pleading with an ineffective, hamstrung U.N. force.<br/><br/>While the film does not strive for shock value, nor does it over-dramatize the events of 1994, the stark reality of the story is, indeed, shocking. And the abject desperation of Paul and the over 1,200 refugees he helps is movingly and powerfully presented. The film's tone is appropriately serious, and the cinematography and directing are very straightforward - giving it an almost documentary feeling. Yet the pacing, acting, editing and script bring out the drama enough to prevent the film from slipping into the doldrums of re-enactment.<br/><br/>All of the acting is very good. I am not going to single out Don Cheadle. His ability and what he brings to this role is unquestionable - but what amazed me was the rest of the cast playing their roles right at his level.<br/><br/>The film did what it was meant to do - it reached a good number of people who knew nothing about the 1994 uprisings in Rwanda. It also provided a more realistic examination of what people do in a crisis than many similarly themed films I have seen. The denial and paralytic fear portrayed in this film are tangible and true.<br/><br/>RECOMMENDATION: I have rated the film on the basis of its entertainment value. My rating is not meant to be critical of the film, but rather to suggest that people who are not interested in a serious treatment of the subject matter are not likely to be well-entertained by this film."

In these times a man which is portrayed in this film voluntarily gave refuge to hundreds of Tutsi people in his hotel, although he himself is Hutu and his wife is a Tutsi. By doing this he himself endangered his own life by being labeled as a traitor to his own tribe but in the long terms he saved so much lives. This movie also shows the callous and extremely non serious attitude of the world community the U.N , NATO Eurpopean union And The U.S , they left the whole country at its own in such a horrendous , horrific and merciful situation when so many helpless folks needed them. If u see the movie collateral , u ll see tom cruise quoting about Rwanda "" ten of thousands of people were massacred before sun down , no one has killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki"". It almost really happened. While talking about Paul rusasebagina it also reminds me of another person , a Hutu politician i saw on BBC at the 10th anniversary of Rwandan genocide, he allowed quite a few Tutsi children to leave the country under a safe passage while the militia men were standing in their way with their fear some weapons but he risked every thing to save the lives of Tutsi children. I believe the world needs people like these , which are free from hatred prejudice narrow mindedness and aggression in their hearts and minds. If the film is concerned i like the work don cheadle, the direction and production , induction of nick nolte and Joaquin Phoenix and more over the song ""million voices"" in the end which some times brings tears into my eyes. A very great but also teaching a kind of lesson film."

","I have not seen this movie. From the comments I did read I feel Hollywood has once again taken facts and Hollywood-ized them. The main character had only a minimal role and pretty much didn't have a choice to help out. To make a factual assessment of the Genocide in Rwanda you should read the book ""Shake Hands with the Devil"" by Romeo Dallaire. He was the General in charge of the UN forces there at the time. It outlines the complete futility of the mission, the inept UN Organization in New York, the lack of cooperation and lies from the waring parties. Most importantly the way the world turned it's back on Rwanda, specifically the United States. These brave Countries had assessed there was no ""value"" or ""gain"" in helping Rwanda. Read the book."

","Hotel Rwanda is a fantastic film where one man (Paul Rusesabagina) uses his courage and determination to save over one thousand Tutsi refugees from the blood thirsty Hutu militants.<br/><br/>As the Hutus, armed with machetes, went round every street looking for Tutsis to brutally assault (and chop to pieces) all the Tutsis sought Paul's help. Paul then willingly turns his 4 star hotel into a Tutsi refugee camp to save all of them. Therefore all the pressure was on his shoulders to ensure that he was safe, his family were safe, his hotel staff were safe and every Tutsi was safe.<br/><br/>During the film I thought that the actors acted superbly, especially Don Cheadle who plays Paul Rusesabagina. I thought that he performed his role extremely well and just as good (maybe even better) than any Hollywood actor could have performed. Hotel Rwanda was nominated for 3 Oscars, 12 wins and 28 nominations and I thought that it was a real shame that they didn't go on to actually win anything.<br/><br/>The only flaw that I could find was that I believe, personally, that there needed to be a slightly more content of violence. My reason for this is because it would allow us to get a real insight into how bad the situation had escalated and it would send a more bigger message to the viewers and make them go away and think about what had happened. But apart from that i enjoyed all 117 minutes of it."
"magic_ravz","8","0","0","28 May 2008"," An powerful portrayal of genocide, some improvements though
","Based on the true story, Hotel Rwanda is a film centred around the genocidal acts that took place in Rwanda during 1994. Don Cheadle gives a riveting performance as Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a European-owned hotel in Rwanda, who created a secret refugee camp for the Tutsi people during the brutal genocide committed against them by the Hutu people. While the killing happened all that the western powers did was ignore this atrocity. Cheadle gives some terrific acting and this film really opens the eyes of the western world when they refused to open it during these events. If you liked the movie ""Shooting Dogs"", which involves almost identical events but in a Rwandan school, you will enjoy this movie. The gripping tension in some of the key scenes keeps you on the edge of your seat. There is an all-star cast with cameos from Jean Reno and Joaquin Phoenix. However, I would not rate this 5 star as the cruel acts could be have been shown a bit more. I do not mean that it has to be vile and a gore-fest. But to really have a more deeper impact on the audience, a few more scenes could be used to show how the Tutsis were killed."
"bijit_jit","10","0","0","10 May 2008"," How this movie differs from Schindler's List
","Hotel Rwanda definitely is a top grade movie.But what makes this movie so special is the way the African unrest in 1994 was portrayed.Unlike Schindler's List(which is another 10 on 10 movie)this movie do not have too many violent scenes, but still manages to maintain the intensity of the subject matter.Schindler's List captures a lot of violence and has a negative way of building the tempo and intensity of the movie, whereas, Hotel Rwanda has a very positive way of building the tempo and intensity of the movie by concentrating on incidents where lives were saved.To site an example, there is a sequence where Paul(Don Cheadle) thinks his wife and children have jumped off the roof and killed themselves instead of getting butchered by Hutu machetes.However, later he found his family was safe.In this sequence, even if it were shown that his family was killed, it would have added to the intensity and drama which was building up.But that would have been the negative approach.Another such sequence is when Paul finds his son behind a bush all covered up in blood.Here also it could have shown that it was his son who was attacked.But later it reveals that it was not the boy's blood,it was the blood of another victim killed in front of the boy.Here also ,once again,violence was minimized, but without losing the impact and the viewer can always feel the tension and horror going around.Also, instead of showing the incident on screen,there is a conversation between Paul and a Red Cross worker where she narrates a horrible incident she has seen: an orphan child from her orphanage butchered to death in front of her eyes.This passive way of creating the savage environment of the riot is commendable as this makes the movie open to people who do not like explicit violence.The movie actually used just one incident where a Paul Russessabagina saves 1300 people with the riot in its background. Unlike Schindler's List, it id not use the riot itself with the main incident as a part of it.Personally, I feel this movie is something that is bound to touch a viewer's heart and something which lingers in your mind for a long long time after you have watched the movie.Hat's off! 10 on 10!"

Would recommend it to all who are tired of the run of the mill movies out there. The tale is of courage,of cunning, of survival and is true. How Paul tries to ""save up"" on favors for a rainy day, how conditions make him form a man out to survive into a hero of his own scale to save others. How he deals with having to juggle his position between the factions that he belongs to and that of his wife. In bits and pieces, it is all there. And the end is amazing. A worthy film that portrays what sick things can happen and how easily we all turn a blind eye. Well this film reminds and tells us we were there and we were blind as it happened.

","Hotel Rwanda, the true story of Paul Rusesabagina and his unyielding endeavor to save over 1200 refugees of both Huti and Tutsi parties, is a poignant cinematic work of art. Though IMDb classifies this Drama, Thriller, etc., the best way to sum up this movie would be Documentary - Interesting Documentary, to be exact. The movie definitely got its point across with unspeakable acting. It's wonderful for a class setting - in fact, I am a student that has watched it today in World History class.<br/><br/>Some may wonder why this movie was rated PG-13 at all; this movie obviously does not have sexual innuendo (with the exception of a few kisses here and there). One or two bad words were slipped out of anger and malice towards each other. It does not glorify racism nor violence; in fact, it shows clearly that violence is not okay. With the exception of a few historical errors, I trust this movie to be 100% legitimate in facts.<br/><br/>Before you rent this movie - be sure to have a box of Kleenex; you will definitely cry unless you have no emotion. The last 30 minutes of the movie are the most poignant and heart-wrenching - something about those refugees drinking water out of the pool and huddling together in times of strife is sad. Paul's final beseeching to the general is the climatic scene, executed with emotion. But most of all, the slides after the ending credits is what breaks you down the most.<br/><br/>This movie made me think about how malicious and selfish the UN as well as the US has been in that time. It just hit me after watching this movie that the situation in Darfur needs more help and could use it as well. I will be of age to have a voice in this country soon and will do everything to help save the Paul & Tatiana Rusesabaginas and Fendenses of the world.<br/><br/>Watch this movie with an open heart, a steady mind, and prepare to be changed."

","OK, I'm a little late to this, but I'm stunned that this film won no major awards. It is the most moving film I've ever seen (I thought about qualifying that, but actually, no). It shows the best and worst of humanity at once. Is it enough to make a man cry? If it's not, that man should worry. The Oscars in the year this was released went to a biopic of Ray Charles and a film about a woman who boxes. Even the Baftas ignored it. If you've seen this film, your irony-meter will be off the scale right now. 'We don't care about you', how true. Below is some relevant text to satisfy the rather bizarre length rule imposed on comments. History shows us that genocides can happen only if four important conditions are in place. There must be the cover of a war. Ethnic grievances must be manipulated and exaggerated. Ordinary citizens must be deputized by their government to become executioners. And the rest of the world must be persuaded to look away and do nothing. This last is the most shameful of all, especially so because genocide is happening again right now in the Darfur region of Sudan, and the world community has done precious little to stop the killings.<br/><br/>What is happening in Darfur is exactly what happened in my home country of Rwanda, which was left to choke on its own blood from April to July of 1994.<br/><br/>The United Nations took virtually no action during the genocide. A detachment of well-equipped peacekeepers, made up of less than one-twentieth of the American troops now stationed in Iraq, could have easily stopped the killings without risk and sent the powerful message that the world would no longer tolerate mass murders of civilians, a real expression of the phrase ""Never Again.""

","This is the shocking story of the genocide that took place in Rwanda in 1994 - while the whole world was watching. It is not only a black page in Rwanda's history but because of modern internationalization and media a black page in the history of mankind. One becomes aware of the worthlessness of life and the price that is paid for the colonization of Africa and its consequences. This film is a statement in itself, and remembers us of so many mass murders in recent ages. The superb acting by Don Cheadle who acts like a hero, but a very good cast overall support the story and message. Equally good is the storyline and involvement with the characters. This combined with the fact that violence is always on the background, but only seldom on the foreground (although there are some violent scenes, mainly the results are shown) makes this movie not a vampire movie... This movie should be in history lessons everywhere... with the full background story. But I'm afraid the words of Jack (Joaquim Phoenix) will also apply here: I think if people see this footage they'll say, ""Oh my God, that's horrible,"" and then go on eating their dinners.

","One of the great accomplishments of Terry George (In the Name of the Father, Some Mother's Son) in writing and directing this film was to show the atrocities being done during the 100 days of genocide without getting an R rating so that as many people as possible could see what happens when you don't have oil in your backyard.<br/><br/>Despite international news coverage of the violence as it unfolded, most countries, including France, Belgium, and the United States, declined to prevent or stop the massacres.

","""There will be no rescue no intervention for us. We can only save our selves,"" said Paul, the man who inspires the movie Hotel Rwanda to his refugees as he observes the rest of the world witness the horrifying situations that Rwandan Tutsis are in and did nothing. <br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda, a movie written by Keir Pearson and directed by Terry George, is based on a true horrifying event that happened in Rwanda and the attempt of one man, a hotelier, to save lives. The movie that is a drama and not a definite none-fiction documentary testifies to the power of one individual to make a positive difference. The movie opened with a radio station broadcast stating a high hatred towards Tutsi's: ""the Tutsi were collaborators for the Belgian colonists  they are cockroaches. They are murderers. Rwanda is our Hutu land..."" This broadcast takes us through the entire span of the genocide, which started in 1994 as a result of the Hutu president being murdered, which angered the Hutu military /Interahamwe. The movie which had an extraordinary balance between portraying massacres and telling a heroic family story had also space to place a mirror in order to reflect the political, social, international and religious daily practices of the Rwandans at the moment.<br/><br/>Paul, who turned the 4 star Hotel into a refugee camp, was played by Don Cheadle. Don in his other movies always gives the best performance you expect from one actor. However, on this one we witness an extra ordinary talent being portrayed. He is commanding and a quick thinker as he bribes the force that one day might burst and overflow what he cherished for a long time. At one scene, Don faces Rutaganda, who controlled the militia and was the food provider for the hotel. At the moment he witness this brutal inhuman thing but Don who had to keep his dignity, was also able to save his 1200 refuges by doing what he had came for.<br/><br/>Sophia as Paul's wife Tatiana had also done an OK job on her performance. She was the supporter and the lover of her man, but still too concerned for the protection of her family. Nick Nolte, as the UN peace keep, dose a marvelous job on presenting a considerate man who want to do more but his two hands are chafed by above force outside of Rwanda. In one powerful scene in a result of frustration, Nick blames racism for ignorance displayed by the western, which leaves the audience to say is that so? I meant people do things so they would get something out of it. May be Nick said it out of shame and gilt but the truth is by helping Rwandans, no one gets any benefit. No oil, No gold, nothing other than saving people's lives. That is what seems to be the reason.<br/><br/>The over all idea of the Genocide occurring is accurate, but as viewer I would avoid believing some of the scenes shown in the movie just like any other Hollywood movie. For instance at one important scene we see that a militia group how hated the Tutits and had no mercy for them, being convinced to take money instead in less than a minute. That seems unrealistic. So are some other things in the movie. According to www.fair field mirror.com/media the character of Colonel Oliver had not given the credit for his role trying to stop the violence. <br/><br/>The script of the movie is well done. When you watch, the movie there are no single moments that you don't believe the conversations; they have a real African accent and look. The pictures also make it believable except at one point the director chooses a verbal scene instead of a picture when the Red Cross worker described the horrible seen she had witnessed. Which seems that he did it for the purpose of keeping the theme of the movie, which is showing the family struggle instead of showing the horror that is happening.<br/><br/>George almost never shows violence pictures. There is no man getting shot or blood running on the floor but through out the movie you would feel like you had seen a almost a horror movie. The secret seems to be the effect of the music. In the movie, about 15-music track had been played and each with different group and individual and of courses each having a different effect too. The sounds sometimes seems like they are attached by a strong force with the image on the screen! Some of the music sometimes takes you to place that is horrifying and sorrowful and certainly some of the music and sounds, like the radio voice, seems overwhelming because it is disembodied and seems to exist everywhere. But the effect is what expected. Will some music like Mwali We! Provokes you to think to feel human and to care when the rhythm force you to move your body and the picture of kids dancing and imagination that someone out side that door is dying puts the guilt on you. Over all the music requires a repeated listening, but it also raise different feelings to the listener as tragedy and sorrow occurred simultaneously. <br/><br/>Overall, as I said before the movie holds a perfect balance between portraying massacres and displaying a heroic family story. To my thinking, this movie has the best pictures and carries a very important life lesson. I promise you might like it, as I enjoy watching it several times searching for an answer for a question raised by Dube / Tutsi ;""why are people so cruel?"" Who knows if you watch it, you might find why?"

","If it wasn't for Jamie Foxx's performance in the movie, Ray then Don Cheadle would've probably walked away with the best actor Oscar in the academy awards ceremony back in 2004. Having said that, for all of the hype surrounding Foxx's efforts and his portrayal of musician Ray Charles, it is Cheadle's performance as hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina that stood out that year, and it is a performance of which is by far the best he has offered on the big screen. I was at first sceptical about the casting of Cheadle- an Afro-American playing an African character because I was a tad concerned about how he'd be able to pull off an impressive and authentic accent. Though afterwards, my doubts about this were erased by the time I watched his captivating performance and he did manage to successfully pull it off.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda was breathtaking: previously dubbed Africa's answer to Schindler's List and based on a real life account of the infamous Rwandan genocide of 1994, it documents the efforts of Paul- a Hutu native, as he tries to forge a pact between the Hutu's and the tutsis and end the long running feud that has been taking place for a considerable period of time. As a result, he managed to save the lives of thousands of Rwandans, despite the West's failure to intervene in the case, as well as the lack of consideration given to their plight by the Western media.<br/><br/>The film is not so much a depiction of the actual events itself, but rather one's human interest account of the genocide from the perspective of Paul and his wife, Tatiana- of whom is wonderfully underplayed by British actress, Sophie Okenedo. She did herself justice in this film and it's good to see a British actress doing well in a movie that tries to convey a serious but damning message at the same time. I was disappointed when she didn't win an Oscar, alongside Cheadle himself as they were remarkable in their roles.<br/><br/>As for the violence in Hotel Rwanda, it is not overdone in a way that it is deemed gory. This is a drama after all and the characters's thoughts, emotions and feelings, as well as the brilliant acting had more of a resonance and impact during this film than the piling body counts of Hutu and Tutsi victims.<br/><br/>It takes a while for the film to kick into gear and yet once it does, you cannot help but be gripped by the suspense and drama of it all.<br/><br/>Although Hotel Rwanda deals with the genocide theme in a somewhat delicate and humanistic manner, it also raises questions regarding humanity, culture, race, family and morals. For whilst it is not just about the fact that the West ignored all pleas and all the warning signs, it is to painfully state how ignorance kills. Ignorance can be eradicated by means of education, knowledge and understanding but it can also destroy lives through lack of knowledge and understanding as well too.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent, beautifully shot and the scenery is great. The independent film is not your standard Hollywood fare, but that shouldn't put you off from seeing Hotel Rwanda.<br/><br/>It is brilliant and an emotional roller-coaster of emotions. If you haven't seen it yet, then i'd recommend it to those who love their movies"

Our media barely covers the wars, famines, droughts until millions of people are dead and then it seems like it is too late for the U.S. politicians to do anything. Great, great movie. Don Cheadle is a master actor. I wish I would see him in more films. Another thought I had about this movie is how it reminded me of the holocaust. America sat by and allowed 6 million Jews, Catholics and gypsies to die before intervening and it had nothing to do with the annihilation of the these people that got us finally into WWII.

","Unless these tragic incidents take place in our own country, we will see them unfold through our very eyes courtesy of CNN, et. al, and go on with our lives while shaking our heads in horror and pity but not doing much else. This is exactly what a reporter played by Joaquin Phoenix tells Paul Russebagina, the hotel manager of Les Milles Collines as Rwanda begins its inexorable plight into the horrors of racial purification -- the war between the Hutus and the Tsutsis.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, unless you saw the news back in 1994, you didn't and wouldn't even know of these events. It was virtually kept under wraps and only revealed when the death toll was unnaturally high. What HOTEL RWANDA attempts, and succeeds in doing, is bringing forth the absolute tragedy of a country driven to the extremes of decimating its own population in lieu of establishing the eventual dominance of the Hutus over the more ""esthetically pure and therefore privileged"" Tsutsis.<br/><br/>However, where the movie really makes its mark is when Paul Russebagina, the smooth talking, subtle Hutu man who as of now has been able to get people to eat out of his palms faces the stomach-turning horror: no one will come to his aid, no one will even attempt to intervene to stop the madness that is exploding all around him. The U. N. has turned its eye away from the situation. Belgian soldiers within the country are escorting only foreign citizens. Paul and those left behind will have to fend for themselves and hope to find a way out.<br/><br/>HOTEL RWANDA establishes the character of Russebagina as an essentially good person who gets caught in a situation that spirals out of control and forces him to face it head on: much like Clive Owen's character in CHILDREN OF MEN, or even Schindler in SCHINDLER'S LIST, his is a man who grows from being just an observer of sorts into a hero who goes beyond the call of duty while maintaining a brave face in the light of the sight of his people being massacred for the sake of genocide. Sophie Okonedo lends a strong support as Tatyana Russebagina, a role that could have been thankless but achieves a relevance all its own. Where Terry George's film succeeds is bringing a moral consciousness unto us, the people viewing this film which is a mirror of the events from over a decade ago without exaggerating the gore. It makes us aware that regardless of how distant these events might be unfolding, it's really unto us to lend a hand to those in need."

","In 1994, Steven Spielberg and the film, Schindler's List, won countless awards and honors for it's subject on the Holocaust and how one German businessman, Oskar Schindler, caught in the struggle helped save over a thousand lives. Like Paul in Hotel Rwanda, Oskar was a businessman who was seeking opportunity in Cracow. Just like Paul, Oskar saved a thousand lives from the gas chambers and concentration camps. While Rwanda is nowhere near Eastern Europe and is located in Africa, we know very little about Rwanda. In 1994, the Rwandan president was murdered leaving two ethnic groups, the Hutus, and the Tutsis as enemies again. The order was removed. The Hutus were incited by hatred, lies, propaganda, and direction from their leader to kill those ""cockroaches"" known as the Tutsis. By the end of the genocide, almost a million Tutsis were murdered. Paul is a hotel manager for a Belgium company, Sabena, who is put in charge. His wife is a Tutsi and he is a Hutu. The hotel has guests played by Nick Nolte who is a Canadian UN Peacekeeper unable to do anything because of red tape and Joaquin Phoenix is a cameraman for a news organization who risks his life to videotape the slaughter on the streets. For those sheltered at the Hotel, Paul maintains that it will be a safe place whether there is enough food, water, or supplies. Paul must bargain with the general who does not believe that he will be found guilty of war crimes against the Tutsis. The horrors of this genocide is not brutal because we don't see much blood but we see bodies lying on lawns and the brainwashed killers with machetes. Paul played by Don Cheadle definitely earned his Academy Award nomination as did Sophie Okeondo who was nominated. I wished it was nominated for best film of the year. Unfortunately, the western nations took their slow time in stopping the genocide. Rwanda does not have oil but coffee and tea. This story is about 1268 refugees who survived the genocide in 1994."

However, I am sure the situation was much worse than portrayed in the film, as in the film the violence was shown in a restrained manner.<br/><br/>Though in the film we get a happy ending of the main characters, we must not forget that most of the millions who suffered did not have such fortune.

I feel so detach to it.<br/><br/>Synopsis: A hotel manager Paul was force to housed over thousands refugees as there were genocidal and unrest outside of the hotel.<br/><br/>The good part of this movie got to be it was quite entertaining to watch and there is something happen all the time.

The sad part is when executed into the screenplay it wasn't that good and combine with really bad cinematography make this not such a good movie one hope to be. I guess if you watch it for fact it was fine but movie for movie sake it wasn't that good.<br/><br/>I got to say the whole film is very flat, though there are like two scenes that are quite moving but the rest was very ordinary and forgettable. The casting of Don Cheadle was a smart moves (otherwise this wouldn't close to be this famous), though he was the best in the movie his acting is barely average and the rest turn out quite bad specially Nick Nolte and Sophie Okonedo. The direction is average and nothing special and could have been much better. The score was all right too.<br/><br/>It was just an all right movie and that is all.

","Just throwing in my 10 points to add up to the total. I haven't seen 'Sometimes in April' yet, so maybe I will indeed scratch my head thinking that one's even better on the Rwandan tragedy, as some say, but right now I'm under the impression of 'Hotel Rwanda'. And I am already pretty sure that those who say this film is a 'light' version of whatever exactly happened are wrong. This film doesn't try to win an Oscar by using brutal pictures a lot to inscribe itself in the viewer's brain. (Though it will still make you feel the violence from time to time.) It's real drama. The background, the genocide, the war and all that, they are important factors, but the point is the drama of hotelier Paul Rusesabagina's family. To steal a US diplomat's words from the movie, you can see some 'acts of genocide', but you won't see 'genocide', at least not for most of the time. And you'll see acts of bravery, but not of the reckless type, not the kind of Hollywood heroism that is an euphemism for stupidity.<br/><br/>You can find those very strong scenes in this movie that are so powerful that they will have an effect on you no matter how many times you watch the film. One of those scenes pulls off nothing less than giving the audience a genuine laughter amid a sea of horror, genuine, honest laughter, not forced at all, not trying-to-be-satirical-when-inappropriate, and so not distasteful at all. Check it out. It's scenes like that that reinforce my impression that 'Hotel Rwanda' was in fact an outstandingly good film.<br/><br/>One picture that inexplicably stayed very long there in my mind. An RPF soldier firing after militiamen. We don't see where he is shooting. Just that he takes up one textbook shooting position after the other, feeling probably a little proud of himself not being just another peasant given a gun. This is a very small detail that you'll see only from a distance. Now, where you find such hidden values that is a good film. About another war-torn, structurally burdened state, where the warrior-minded have enough providers of the above mentioned textbooks who are ready to supply them from the outside.<br/><br/>Don't watch this film as a documentary. If you want insight gained from this film, ponder rather the analysis it gives of how a refuge can be kept safe in the midst of a structural war (think of 'satellites' and 'phone calls' and the like). As long as it is realistic in the treatment of that issue, it doesn't really matter how many small details it got wrong as to the rest of the conflict. It's focus is strong and that's what matters."

","It doesn't matter from where you look at it; ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a story about Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle); a hard working, committed, kind and devoted to his family man with a very big heart. It is also the true story of a massacre that took place in Rwanda because of a civil war with civilians incapable of defending themselves, which led to this number of dead people: one million.<br/><br/>A war with no real fundament, you could say; because it was something about the Hutus and the Tutsis and a lot of anger publicly spread by a radio station. Also a war where not many people could intervene, because Rwanda wasn't worth a dollar for the rest of the world at the time. During all of this mess, this man, manager of an important hotel, took in one thousand people from all over the world and he even accepted both Hutus and Tutsis. Being a Hutu, he was married to a Tutsi (Sophie Okonedo).<br/><br/>Inside his hotel, a UN division in charge of Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) could only afford four guards at the hotel's gates while outside the ""interahamwes"" were all over the streets looking for Tutsis to kill. A cameraman (Joaquin Phoenix) could get a shot of the army assassinating Tutsis with machetesCan you imagine all this? <br/><br/>There's not much more to the movie than the recreation of this events, but what recreation and what an accurate vision from everyone involved in it. Terry George, writer of the wonderful ""Hart's War"", deals with war again in his script; but together with Keir Person, they succeed in showing us how hard reality is, in words. They introduce us a world dominated by bribery, distrust and the ever-present racism. <br/><br/>George also directed the picture this time, luckily with the compassion needed to shoot a theme like this one. The camera (a beautiful cinematography by Robert Fraisse) goes to the streets, to the houses and the shelters but it doesn't need the direct blood and violence I'll probably witness in ""Apocalypto"" when I watch it. <br/><br/>Performances are also quite effective. Nick Nolte (watch him in ""The Good Thief"") is superb as the Colonel who knows his limitations and can't break the rules. He has a couple of great moments discussing with Cheadle's character. Jean Reno has a nice little part and Sophie Okonedo also achieves some moments of true moving brilliance when talking to Cheadle.<br/><br/>Cheadle is, however, in the end, the star of the show. In the best portrayal of his career, the actor assumes the responsibility of being on screen all the time. He does it embodying this man I talked you about completely, with all the characteristics I mentioned above and an accent so flawless that you think of him as another Rwandese actorIt's fantastic."

The film does so much more than make you cry incessantly for the most part of it; more than anything, it involves YOU. It makes you enraged and disgraced, to know that the international community stood by and did nothing for these people.

Who would have thought that all those atrocities were ever possible in the late XX century? If that movie would not have been so successful maybe we would not know today about the events in Rwanda. It's sad that some people need to make great movies so that we can learn about good and evil, about what's right and what's wrong! Somehow we always forget about wars, about holocaust, about all the children killed for no reason, except the fact that they carry the blood of an undesired ethnic group. Watching the film today I felt I would so much preferred that I was dead so all those children in Rwanda would be alive today, not slaughtered like pigs. But I can not turn back the time. When the events happened I was 12, and at that time nobody informed us in the media about Rwanda. Till recently I did not know that in my country the Holocaust took one of its evil forms and I felt like I was a total ignorant. But I discovered that there are many like me, much many, and I think now it's my duty to tell everybody these events, ask them about their opinions and try to change these opinions if they agree with those of the manslaughterers from the movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion I think that the human life is priceless, I don't know how children screams while they're being cut into pieces can be ever supported by a normal human ear, I don't know how it's possible to exterminate an entire nation and I can not forget such things.

","This film is best described with two seemingly unrelated adjectives - beautiful and gut-wrenching.Both these adjectives can in fact be used to depict the two faces of human nature as shown in this outstanding film.A harrowing account of the true-life genocide that occurred in Rwanda in 1994, 'Hotel Rwanda' is a remarkable effort in every sense.Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina,the manager of a Belgian-owned hotel in Kigali,Rwanda,gives an exceptional,career-defining performance.The dignity he brings to the part,and the determination and resourcefulness of his character make for truly compelling viewing and I often found myself choked with emotion as I watched one disturbing sequence after another unfold.Supporting performances by all are excellent, with a special mention for the amazing Sophie Okonedo.Terry George's direction has the required lucidity and delivers solid solar-plexus punches as the story moves along at a (surprisingly) brisk pace.At the end of it all,we are left with a deep sense of regret at our insensitivity towards anything that doesn't directly affect us.Cinema this moving doesn't come along everyday and I recommend it highly for all discerning viewers out there."

But I do know that I am a relatively average 17-year-old who loves movies and I was inspired by this movie in a way only a few other films have.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle, a Best Actor Oscar contender for 2004, gives his all to his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager that sheltered hundred of refugees during the Rwandan genocide of 1994. Hotel Rwanda is more about Paul's story than the massacres in general, and that's not a bad thing. Seeing this catastrophe through the eyes of a man in Paul's position means that we are party to key figures: a U.N. Colonel (Nick Nolte) who wants to help but is constrained by the limits of his orders, a spoiled general (Fana Mokoena) who provides military protection for Rusesabagina's refugees in response to flattery and bribery, and an American journalist (Joaquin Phoenix) who delivers one of the key revelations of the movie: ""I think if people see this footage, they'll say 'Oh, my God, that's horrible.' And then they'll go on eating their dinners."" Africa is too far away for it to be of any concern to people like us.<br/><br/>But all these characters take back seat to Paul in the narrative; they occasionally provide obstacles, such as when the general refuses to give any more police support until Paul bluffs desperately, but the movie belongs to Paul and, inherently, to his family. Don Cheadle plays Paul as a man whose family is more important to him than anything else; his first and foremost concern is for his wife and children and there are moments where he must choose between them and the other Rwandans in his care. His wife, Tatiana, is emotionally played by Sophie Okonedo as a compassionate woman who, even as strong as she turns out to be, feels she needs her husband in order to survive. The love between Paul and Tatiana is one of the anchors in this movie, and thanks to the screenwriters and Okonedo, Tatiana is just as well-developed a character as Paul.<br/><br/>While Hotel Rwanda may focus in on this one man and his heroism, the movie manages to skillfully indict the outside (white) world for not taking the initiative to interfere in this conflict. The question of whether or not we could have done anything is moot in this movie; when faces as human as these are painted onto the problem, it seems like we at least should have done something."

It made me sickened, seeing the roads scattered with bodies, seeing the callousness of everyone in it. The whole world turned their backs on the country when it was in need. The movie did show, what I think, is an accurate account of how people acted during the time. I've only read one book about the genocide between the Hutsus and the Tutsis and that was more about the groups in Sri Lanka so it can't really be compared.<br/><br/>The movie was very well done and I'm glad I saw it but I can see why some people wouldn't want to see it. It's so real that when you're done watching it you're disgusted with everyone. I especially feel like the few blurbs on the news and in the newspaper that glossed over the situation is a sick joke. Never had I heard about the gravity of what happened until I saw the movie. Millions of people died and it seems the rest of the world just didn't care. Even here in Canada (which is normally interested in world issues, not just our own) dropped the ball.<br/><br/>Anyone who failed to report the war and what was happening was almost as much at fault as people doing the killing. Because, if we had done something back then, then maybe so many people wouldn't have died.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie I was left feeling emotional and I think a large part was Don Cheadle's acting.

","Hotel Rwanda tells the true story of one man's determination to hide over 1000 people during the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Watch as his country, his family and everything around him falls apart.<br/><br/>This film was destined for greatness. The subject matter is so grave, so serious, that only a really bad film could have lessened the impact. And this is not a bad film, but rather a very good one: solid directing, great music, great acting and imagery.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle is the main character. The only bad thing I can say is that he bears a striking resemblance to Tim Meadows, but that's not Cheadle's fault. Every tear, every cry of anguish and each loving embrace seemed real to me. And he definitely came across as someone who is African at heart. (I have no idea if Cheadle is African, American or European, but he could have been Rwandan.) I was confused by the appearance of Nick Nolte and Joaquin Phoenix. They could have been distracting from the overall film, as they were the only mainstream actors in this otherwise sea of unknowns. They weren't, though. Phoenix had a small role, yet quite powerful. And Nick Nolte was the shining star, playing a Canadian military man who was the only person who cared about the Rwandans. (His speech in the bar about the difference between Africans and n*****s rings very true, and sadly will for some time.)

The film was rated R before petitioning for a PG-13. And I'm so glad they did, because the message inherent in this film should not be missed out because someone is ""too young"" to understand. Hatred is universal.<br/><br/>Watch this film, and if you have the heart, make the extra step: speak out against the genocides in Rwanda and other war-torn African nations."

","This movie kept me on the edge of my seat from go to woh. Not only is it an important story to know about (it's based on real events in our recent history), but it's delivered to the screen with panache.<br/><br/>Those who, like me, feel long since overdosed on screen violence, will be happy with this. Even though he could easily justify a violent portrayal because the horrific events really happened, the director protects the audience from the harshest visuals. Instead the emphasis is much more on the build up of events, and the characters' responses as the drama unfolds.<br/><br/>It left me with the oh so important, but oh so unpleasant understanding that This Could Happen To Me - to you, to us. The way such extreme events crept up on ordinary good people is a precious education for the viewer. <br/><br/>The best thing? Sophie Okonedo. She is nothing less than brilliant. What a classy performance. I sometimes find myself watching actors respond to terrible events thinking, ""In real life they would be more upset - they'd be wailing, going out of their mind."" Sophie delivers emotional truth in extreme circumstances like no performance I have ever witnessed. Remarkable, unforgettable and incredibly generous."

","I recall seeing the previews for this and thought ""Oh God, they CAN'T make a Hollywoodized version of this tragedy."" I had read Fergal Kean's book ""Season of Blood,"" which detailed the horror and violence of this event. Kean was a correspondent for the BBC and provided perhaps the most detailed account from a Westerner's perspective. The book is harrowing and hard to get through. It's not pleasant, and with the images from his account still haunting me, I didn't trust Hollywood to do things right. <br/><br/>Thankfully, with Don Cheadle in the lead, and director Terry George at the helm, actively recruiting the involvement of the actual Paul Rosesabagina (portrayed by Cheadle), there was a responsible effort to NOT exploit the horror. I also think it was a good move to edit this to a PG13. Some scenes push the rating limit, but restraint allowed the events to emerge and not get overwhelmed by the violence. This film should be seen by young people, especially those who entertain themselves slaughtering thousands in realistic video games. <br/><br/>The DVD has a strong commentary by both Director Terry George and Paul Rusesabagina that is truly enlightening. This was an embarrassing event for the World, and the fact that the UN and Clinton Administration did not classify this as a ""genocide,"" despite what news footage showed, is shameful. As I understand it, and as discussed on the commentary, if a genocide is recognized, the UN is REQUIRED to act and put it to rest. But politics of the time intervened. The Clinton Administration was still stinging from the mess in Somalia, and the UN really doesn't amount to much without the US providing military logistics.<br/><br/>A good companion piece to this is HBO's film ""Sometimes in April,"" but it's far more brutal in its depiction of genocidal scenes. For a written account, find the above mentioned SEASON OF BLOOD; A Rwandan Journey by FERGAL KEANE, winner of the 1995 Orwell prize and published by Viking. Amazon or eBay should have it.<br/><br/>I'll show Hotel Rwanda to my kids, but I'm waiting a couple years until they are both over 13, since I think the age rating should be heeded. The character of Paul Rusesabagina as portrayed by Don Cheadle is truly a heroic one. Here's a guy who didn't set out to be a hero, he just took responsibility. Scenes with his family are truly painful to watch, and anyone with children can relate to scenes of children gone missing and the desperate search for them. This film is a nightmare, but since it happened, and we know we don't learn much from history, it's good to see the ""other"" side of war. This is bigotry at its worse, on par with the Holocaust. Had the victims been white, I'm sure the reaction from the UN and the West would have been far different. Thankfully, Hotel Rwanda doesn't wear accusations of racism on it sleeve, but it's clear, especially when white tourists are hand-escorted from the crowd by UN Soldiers, even nuns carrying children, the black children pushed from their arms.<br/><br/>This is certainly not a fun, dinner & date movie. It's not meant to be. It's quite a downer. I'd put it on par with The Killing Fields, Under Fire, and Salvador. There are a few films out there that can present serious events responsibly. Hotel Rwanda is one of the very few. No Rambo came to save everyone in the end. Tom Cruise doesn't hop from a tank or Porsche with a thumbs up and toothy grin. This story doesn't fit the Hollywood FORMULA. <br/><br/>Tragically, I don't think we've seen the final chapter to Rwanda's sad story yet. Many Tutsis had no choice but to return to their homes, many the site of the slaughter of loved ones, only to endure neighboring Hutsis returning, the same who actually killed their relatives. What writer can create such an ending? The New Yorker covered the ""homecoming"" of both victims and murderers a couple years back. I don't recall any follow up. <br/><br/>This film should be seen by young people. It shows how bigotry unchecked does destroy us as a species, and we cannot be defined alone by pigment or cultural heritage. It's cheesy, but we all bleed red. Thankfully, Hotel Rawanda chooses to not focus on the blood, which lesser filmmakers might have done."

","Films don't get much more powerful than this riveting story of a man who saved 1,000 lives during the devastating genocide in Rwanda in 1994. Director Terry George wisely lets the story and brilliant acting by Oscar-nominated Don Cheadle as Hutu hotel owner Paul Rusesabagina and Sophie Okonedo as his Tutsi wife do the talking. See Hotel Rwanda, not just because you'll be viewing one of the best films of 2004. Go see it as an act of penance, for our collective sin of omission, as a reminder not to be indifferent. <br/><br/>""In a way, to be indifferent to that suffering is what makes the human being inhuman. Indifference, after all, is more dangerous than anger and hatred. ... Indifference is not a response. Indifference is not a beginning; it is an end. And, therefore, indifference is always the friend of the enemy, for it benefits the aggressor -- never his victim, whose pain is magnified when he or she feels forgotten,"" said Nobel Prize-winner Elie Wiesel. ""Not to respond to their plight, not to relieve their solitude by offering them a spark of hope, is to exile them from human memory. And in denying their humanity, we betray our own."""

Set on the eve of the Hutus' genocidal massacre of the Tutsis in 1994, the film's about the bravery of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who harbors hundreds of Tutsis from slaughter. As Rusesabagina, Don Cheadle delivers a real throat-choker, and his performance is even more poignant by dint of being based on reality. Sophie Okonedo is also effective in the film.

","Hotel Rwanda is a film that left me speechless at it's end. This true story tells of one human being's selfless guile that saved nearly 1300 lives in war ravaged Rwanda in 1994. Paul Rusesabagina and his family faced certain, cruel death as he called in every favor owed him by friends and enemies alike, and he sheltered these children, women and men in the luxury hotel he managed. Living in a society where tribal distinctions can be deadly, Paul had to think on his feet, as he faced down a marauding Hutu military committed to the annihilation of all Tutsi's and Tutsi sympathizers. Paul was Hutu but his wife Tatiana, and therefore their children, were Tutsi. Hope, in the face of overwhelming terror and complete abandonment by governments and institutions, including the UN, is the prevailing theme I was left with. Though I still have to question our humanity as I watch the bloodshed continue in the Sudan. ""Hotel Rwanda"" delivers the body blows that will take you out of yourself, at least for a while; then you are reminded that the human spirit is powerful.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo deliver startling portrayals."

","There are certain movies that, with equal parts skill and, yes, manipulation, get you thinking about what kind of a person you are, and ways in which you might have failed people around you. Based on the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who sheltered more than 1,200 Hutus and Tutsis during the 1994 Rwandan massacre, Terry George's ""Hotel Rwanda"" -- beautifully constructed and directed, with a career-defining performance by Don Cheadle and exceptional supporting work by Sophie Okonedo -- is one of those pictures. ""The Passion of the Christ"" was the movie most alleged Christians were hyped up about this year, probably because it allowed them to feel self-congratulatory about their willingness to wallow in their savior's suffering. But ""Hotel Rwanda"" is the picture that really captures the essence of Judeo-Christian values: It takes the measure of our compassion for our fellow human beings, and demands that we hold ourselves accountable for the things we might have done and didn't."
"Alex-372","7","0","0","31 July 2006"," Some Comments
","A lot has already been said about Hotel Rwanda. Don Cheadle stands out as always, because he is one of the greatest actors of his generation - right up there with Jeffrey Wright and John Seymour Hoffman. Therefore, I only have a few points to add.<br/><br/><ul><li>The name of the movie is a play on Rwanda's other name, the ""Land Of A Thousand Hills"", or in French, ""Pays des Milles Collines"". The refugees are housed in the Milles Collines Hotel, or Thousand Hills Hotel. Therefore, Hotel Rwanda.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The cast, although often excellent, is miscast because they are not Rwandans. In fact, half the cast have Zulu/Nguni clan surnames (Dube, Ndlovu, Sithole, Khumalo, etc.). I imagine it was filmed in South Africa? Durban, perhaps? :) This makes the comparison between Hutus and Tutsis a bit irrelevant though. Sophie Okonedo is not a Tutsi, but biracial and Nigerian/English. This is a minor point and not to disparage her acting achievement, but with the repeated statements that Tutsis have 'lighter skin' or 'longer noses' etc., it actually plays into the misconception of the 'difference' between Hutus and Tutsis.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Hamitic Race Theory, which is at the basis of the original discrimination by Belgian or German authorities is not clearly spelled out. It is not only applicable to Rwanda, but also to the present conflict in Western Sudan (Darfur). The pro-government militias are portrayed as 'white Arabs', horse or camel riding, where the population of Darfur is portrayed as 'Black African', and sometimes even Christian and Animist. This is the revisiting of the once extremely widespread Hamitic Race Theory, the theory that maintained that all culture in not only Africa, but Asia and the Americas should be explained by the diffusion of a mythical white race (which could be Black, Asian or Native American looking whenever it had to be). At one time, anthropologists tried to find the remnants of this race of 'blackened whites'. In some regions like South Africa, this theory is still taught in schools. Any nomadic, tall, cattle herding people (like the Masai, the Dinka or similar people) were classified non-Black and Hamitic and superior to the agricultural population of 'true Negroes'. The fact that 'superior' herders had the worst land, and 'inferior' farmers had the best land, which white settlers coveted, was of course an added bonus and an extra assurance of the popularity of the theory. Masai good, Kikuyu bad. Tutsi good, Hutu bad. Etcetera, because this kind of schism was repeated all over colonial Africa. People with bad land were pronounced to be 'superior', and people with good land were classified 'inferior', without any sense or irony or contradiction. This also has to do with the way colonialism functioned, which was no different than the way the Romans governed their newly gained territories - divide and conquer. A minority was picked out and proclaimed to be 'superior', and they were given privileges (education abroad, positions in local government, they were allowed to keep some land) and used to govern over the majority.</li></ul><br/><br/>Don't believe everything you hear on TV, but do your own research. The literature is there for all to read."
"outerspaceextasy","10","0","0","22 July 2006"," A Great Drama
","This dramatization of a true story hits a few nerves and deflates the chest with its portrayal of survival and hope amidst murderous insanity.<br/><br/>Paul Rusesabagina (Oscar-worthy Don Cheadle) is the manager of a posh urban hotel catering to foreign tourists, diplomats and Rwandan officials. He, a Hutu, and his Tutsi family enjoy a crisp, comfortable life for his dedication, but it won't last.<br/><br/>Rwanda's ethnic tension roils as rebel Tutsis sit down to peace talks and militant Hutus preach reprisal, rallying against neighbors. Paul lives in denial and clings to his belief that a return to peace and order is inevitable, but his hopes are shattered when the president is assassinated and a radio call to ""cut the tall trees"" signals bloody abomination.<br/><br/>Rusesabagina must use his wits, connections and resources to save those he can from slaughter while his U.N.-protected hotel quickly becomes a haven for more than 1,000 trapped refugee Tutsis and Hutus labeled traitors. But he will be left to struggle for their fates alone when the order is given for the U.N. to withdraw.<br/><br/>Those unfamiliar with the history of Rwanda's genocide find here in the film smoothly integrated seeds of understanding, from the racist stupidity on which the Hutu/Tutsi ethnic separation was founded to the basics of who-what-how-where-why. The film's treatment is balanced, though it does teeter toward condemnation of the West for its inaction amid bureaucratic tangle. But given the record of history 혰 no intervention and more than a million people slaughtered 혰 it's a fair lean.<br/><br/>Of course, this isn't a mere history lesson. Director Terry George does a superb job of drawing a core narrative from unspeakable tragedy and peopling the story with bold characters to powerful effect. The story of Rusesabagina's desperate heroism is a strand of faint light cutting through the fog of bloodletting and provides a well-centered perspective on all aspects of the travesty. It is an intriguing story, and all characters aligned with it are richly rendered, whether they be refugees, executioners, the politically declawed U.N. Col. Oliver (Nick Nolte) or complicit General Augustin Bizimungo (Fana Mokoena). Cheadle inhabits the role of Paul Rusesabagina terrifically; scenes between Paul and his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) are particularly striking, lending the film much of its emotional heft.<br/><br/>Given the severity of the subject, Hotel Rwanda could have easily been overwhelmingly graphic. Thankfully, George chooses to imply the violence rather than spatter the screen with it. That's not to say the film isn't intense. Scenes of evil's aftermath, murder, mob rage, general savagery and countless near misses 혰 all the more potent for their reality 혰chill, haunt, horrify and churn. Thankfully there are brighter moments of appropriate levity and good outcomes, comforting viewers who would otherwise be swept up from the theater floor as simpering, crumpled-up knots of American guilt.<br/><br/>Much like Schindler's List, George's Hotel Rwanda is an earnestly crafted portrayal of survival in the face of annihilation. Just be prepared for its impact."

","Drawing similarities to Spielberg's Schindler's List, Hotel Rwanda tells the true story of a hotel manager (Don Cheadle in a riveting performance) who saves the lives of hundreds of Tutsi refugees from genocide at the hands of the Hutus. This harrowing picture of the evils and triumphs of the human heart portrays both the insanity and the self-sacrifice that mankind is capable of mustering. Directed by Terry George, the film brings to light an event that most people either ignored or forgot about. With nearly one million murdered, the brutal conflicts between tribes in Africa are a warning against the idea of anarchy as a viable alternative to current government.<br/><br/>The performances: Cheadle's strength is at the heart of his character in Hotel Rwanda, a film that leaves little room for interpretation. His Paul is a man whose courage and fortitude amidst unspeakable violence communicates a dignity and humanity that presents an effective counterpoint to man's propensity to do evil. This is a moving, even terrifying, performance from a consummate character actor that finally has the chance to shine on his own. His versatility as an actor has allowed him to give one of the most harrowing efforts of the year. Sophie Okonedo was little known outside Hollywood insiders, but she makes a huge splash here as Don Cheadle's emotionally distraught wife during the Rwandan genocide. Amazingly, she steals most scenes she's in, so visceral and convincing is her work opposite Cheadle. Her cries of desperation are so harrowing that it startles the audience several times throughout the disturbing film. During the final sequences, when she is reunited with loved ones, the power of her earlier work is compounded, registering with viewers in a powerful way. This is a remarkable performance."

That no one interfered is not so much sad as much as it is infuriating. To think this is still happening today is a frightening sign of the times.

","This film could easily beg for comparison to a film such as ""Schindler's List"", however, as wondrous as ""Schindler's List"" is this film offers, for me, a more complete and satisfying look at universal tragedy and the small pieces of humanity within it.<br/><br/>Director Terry George would have likely failed miserably had he chosen to make a film based upon the Rwandan genocide of nearly 1,000,000 Tutsi's. The sheer scope and intensity of the tragedy would have made for a nearly impossible screenplay that would have, inevitably, dwelled upon immense violence and tragedy and hatred. Instead of attempting to encompass the entire scope of the Rwandan experience, George's film wisely focuses on one hero within the tragedy...one man who stood up to it and made different choices for the good of all.<br/><br/>Rusesabagina is played with understated power,focus and stunning clarity by Don Cheadle in what is, without a doubt, the performance of his lifetime. Throughout the award season I have been a loud and active advocate for Paul Giamatti's performance in Sideways"", however, let me state this without hesitation and without any doubt. Don Cheadle absolutely, 100% deserves the Oscar for Best Actor. Having seen nearly 80 films during 2004, I have not seen a performance come close to this intensity and tenderness and complexity and power. Cheadle, quite simply, nails every aspect of this character in a performance that leaves me shaking my head thinking to myself ""How did he do that?"" Giamatti's performance was magnificent, but Cheadle's performance leaves me speechless.<br/><br/>As his wife, Sophie Okonedo, begs to be considered as a Best Supporting Actress. Knowing that her husband, a Hutu, is safe from the genocide, Okonedo's performance as Tatiana, a Tutsi, is nothing short of wondrous. As mother and wife and sister and friend, Okonedo's Tatiana is a woman of fierce determination, uncommon loyalty and remarkable strength.<br/><br/>Along with these leading performances, Terry George offers us tremendous production design, excellent pacing, awesome cinematography and a remarkable score. Once again, it is important that this film never resorts to trying to ""sell the drama"" through intense violence or special effects...George trusts this material implicitly and wisely uses smoke and fog and distance shots quite often in creating scenes that are violent without becoming histrionic and overwhelming.<br/><br/>Likewise, George offers brilliant timing in giving the audience moments of levity...human moments of tenderness between Paul and Tatiana...human moments between Paul and the various military players...small, intimate moments between family members that remind us so deeply and powerfully of the humanity within this immense tragedy. These little moments are interspersed throughout the film and are timed perfectly. The film is constantly moving and emotional and life-changing but never feels completely overwhelming to the point of alienating the audience.<br/><br/>George, who also co-wrote this script, has written such films as ""The Boxer"" and ""In the Name of the Father."" George reportedly envisioned Cheadle for this role from day one, despite investor's desires for the likes of Denzel, Snipes or even Mekhi Phifer. I cringe at the thought of either of these three actors in this role...perhaps there is an argument that it would have made more money, but Cheadle clearly owns this role and creates a film that demands attention. Denzel, perhaps, would have given a solid performance here BUT Cheadle is simply masterful beyond anything Washington could have offered."

It deals with Rwanda's civil war, and shows us how a single person can change permanently so many other's destinies, other than his and his family's. It also gives a very important message in an absolutely non-rhetorical way: war is the worst the human being can do and/or have. No winners, only losers. The movie also criticizes the rich West (Europe & North America) which cares about countries which can make worse our standard of living, but does not care at all about so many other countries who suffer a very bad social, economical, political situation.

And about the fear of the innocents that is a result of it. And it is about a world not willing to stop violence as long as it does not affect our oil-supplies; our trade-routes; people of our believes or color; our own interests. The movie does not really show all horrific things people do to one another, but it shows us enough to have a good picture of it in our minds. Fortunately it is also about the bravery in many of us, the kindness in our hearts that very understandable only survives if we take care of ourselves first, but leaves room for others. So much we can ask from each other. Help yourself, but never forget the others. For the others are you as well. It is in Rwanda where a piece of me and you has died.

","Don Cheadle's acting was absolutely stunning. I don't know who got the Oscar that year, but Don deserved it 100%. The film itself is OK, but it gets the point across...tells the story enough for people who get a basic knowledge of what went on in 2004. If that sparks an interest then maybe people will want to learn more.<br/><br/>The Rwandan massacre is something that really affects me, the people were murdering their own friends,colleagues...even family, simply because they were not of the same tribe. Millions of people murdered in cold blood, people chopped up in cold blood and left in the street or lining the roads. Barbaric...that'd never happen in a civilised country would it? or would it! This was a country where the people lived in relative comfort, many had nice houses and were well fed and clothed. People seem to have a mental image of everyone in Africa being wasted through hunger, with tear stained faces and barefoot....but no, this wasn't the case. It could happen anywhere, Just think about what could happen is the Protestants and Catholics in Ireland were all fired up and one side decided to wipe out the other.....Or put it on a bigger scale, America and Canada. We all call ourselves civilised, anything could happen....<br/><br/>I recently watched a documentary recently where a woman lost her husband, all his family and all her own family. She now runs an organisation to care for orphans of the atrocity. This is what is left of Rwanda...brave people just getting on with life, while the so called 'civilised' countries look on and occasionally sympathise with them....in fact, most people don't even know what happened - or even care for that matter.<br/><br/>Why did the UN pull out? why is no-one talking about it now? because the people don't seem to have a strong enough voice that makes people sit up and take notice, they need more films like this to be made, they need a big time director who empathises with them, to make a big noise...Stephen Spielberg did it with Schindlers List, another film about genocide.

","How can a film lacking espionage, demons, and meaningless frontal nudity not interest me? Hotel Rwanda shines in murky Hollywood with compelling characters, fantastic writing, and a true plot ignored in its own time. Hotel Rwanda deals with the rising of the Interhamwe forces whose prime directive is to slay a fellow African tribe, the Tutsis. This crisis is severely slowed when a fast-acting hotel manager, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), provides refuge to hundreds of marked Tutsi.<br/><br/>Paul faces many conflicts while avoiding direct conflict. He is a known Hutu, and the Hutu make up the Interhamwe. He knows he is frowned upon having a wife of Tutsi birth, but he denies his heritage for the betterment of man in general. Paul Rusesabagina must also keep the Mille Collines appearance as a 4-Star hotel. Paul battles defiant staff, constant tragedy, and thinning supplies throughout the course of this gut-wrenching tale of kindness.<br/><br/>The historical value of this is something our planet earth should recognize. The genocide piqued UN interest in 1994. Officials were sent to Rwanda with strict instructions: No Shooting. This seemed a little ridiculous being as trained soldiers had to simply witness the purge of a people. Whether or not the collective world cared or not can be debated. But what can't be denied is that if Rwanda was going to gain nuclear armaments, or fall to Communism, you would have seen the whole situation cleared up with the entire United Nations at the helm. I personally liked this film because it serves as more of a social commentary than just another ""Based on Actual Events"" movies we hear so much about.<br/><br/>One of the most powerful scenes, in my opinion, was as the folks recording the massacre needed to be evacuated. Upon entering a bus bound for the nearest airport, the cameraman with a Western perspective (Joaquin Phoenix) murmured ""Jesus Christ, I'm so ashamed!"" This is when the severity of this tale sank in. Someone not even living there their whole life was forced to be another bystander with protests that wouldn't be heard. Though I was a ripe age of four and barely grasped the theory of an all-day school at the time of this monstrosity, I too look back in disdain on the people who wouldn't aid a struggling nation.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this isn't a movie with intense wire-fighting or thugs being thrown through the wall. It's a look back on a tale with a thin, though important, chapter in our world's history. Don Cheadle delivers the performance of a lifetime as the harrowed Paul Rusesabagina. This is a movie that will make you think. For a very, very long time. Like the Mille Collines itself, this movie is spectacular. Two Thumbs up."

","When a film chills to the bone, it is easily among the best of the year, and that's exactly what this film did to me when I saw it: chilled me to the bone. It's rather disturbing that so many people have no idea what happened ten years ago in Rwanda. I know I knew limited things about it. I knew people had died horrible deaths and that's about it. Seeing this story unfold about one man who wants nothing more than for he and his family to survive is something that everyone needs to see. Don Cheadle is that man and his work here left me speechless. I say the same thing regarding Sophie Okonedo. They had such great chemistry together and when apart their acting chops were just as strong. Terry George has done a great thing by bringing this story to the public. We are so selfish and we take so much for granted. This movie will make you realize that and so much more. Best scene: Paul staying behind and not leaving with his family."

","I was asked to watch this movie for a school assignment so naturally i thought it would be boring and dull. Boy did i get a shock when i started watching it! I discovered that Hotel Rwanda has to be one of the best movies of all times! The superb acting and real representations of how the genocide would be make the movie terrific. It's a very emotional movie and at some stages you find your self on the brink of tears. Other times your body is full of hatred towards those cruel and horrific Hutus. I highly recommend this movie as its an important part of understanding the cruelty of this world and learning to stop and do something to helps those struggling throughout the world. God didn't create this world to let people suffer you know! He made it for good reasons. We need to act now and help the world to enjoy this wondrous place. :)"

","This is the true story of a hotel manager called Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) who harbours Tutsi families in a hotel from certain death (at the hand of the Hutu). Initially, Paul's focus is to save his own family. However, as he realises the extent of the massacre of the Tutsi people he tries to save as many as he can. He has the opportunity to leave with his family at the expense of the Tutsi that he is harbouring, but has the moral integrity to refuse.<br/><br/>This film is an exploration of how one man's humanity is able to shine so bright when those who surround him have lost all sense of humanity themselves. Paul goes above and beyond what anybody could have expected of him. He uses his personal wealth, bribes people to gain favours and risks the lives of his family to do the right thing.<br/><br/>In my opinion the themes of this film are very reminiscent of Schindler's List. They are both examples of films which show the difference that one man can make. If you sometimes despair at what a mess humanity is making of the world, I recommend that you watch this film to show that there is always hope."

","I had just finished watching Hotel Rwanda and I had read some of the user comments while doing so. Normally I gravitate to the ""Hated It"" section on movies that I like, and some of the comments made surprised me. Currently I am studying Western Imperialism (and the European control of Africa)in AP European History so I have some background info on this topic.<br/><br/>I do not know what people who didn't like this movie expected, because I was content with the material it covered. Honestly, I believed the project was quite ambitious, yet when I found out it was about the story of one man and those around him I was relieved. Because the writers focused on the main character, my heart went out to him. There were times I could only imagine what was going on in his head, and how much fear he could be feeling (made possible only by Don Cheadle's good acting). I KNEW that many people were slaughtered. I KNEW the backstory of Rwanda, and I KNEW there were separations between the Rwandans. <br/><br/>I, personally, needed a reason to identify with these refugees. I felt sad when I learned about it in class, but this movie gave me a visual and really showed me the dire hopelessness and destruction of the situation. I didn't want another history lesson and I really didn't want to see people die the whole time. I wanted to see the courage and faith of those who lived through it. The facts came together for me and came to life through the characters.<br/><br/>And by the way, it is no coincidence it was released on the tenth anniversary of the Rwanadan Conflict, and it should be no surprise that genocide like this is still going on. And yes, Europe and America were the superpowers, yet still looked on and did nothing. I don't care how others disagree. I felt (and feel) guilty, even though I was a child at the time. After seeing the movie I was baffled by the simplicity of the matter,and after reading reviews I was baffled at how many people took offense to the reality presented in this movie. Not only is this 2 hours of entertainment, you are meant to leave thinking. And if you left hating the movie, ask yourself why. Truly ask yourself the real reason why."

","The events in Rwanda between the Tutsis and the Hutus happened when I was in high school. I didn't know much about it then except that it was a horrific event. ""Hotel Rwanda"" did an incredible job telling the story to the audience and showing the ruthless and gruesome nature in which the Hutus treated the Tutsis. No person with a pulse could help but be moved by this movie. As a human being first and as a Black person second, I was grief stricken to see how people from the same country and of the same color could relentlessly kill based upon a stamp on an I.D. card. This movie showed how hate can drive humans to behave like animals and it showed how kind and merciful people can be as well. In this movie there was bravery, cowardice, honor, humiliation, kindness, and ruthlessness. I'm no film critic, but I could not find anything I disliked about the movie, just things I disliked about the event."
"rmax304823","7","0","0","25 February 2006"," Ambitious, successful TV-docudrama.
","The story is familiar enough in its outline that I'll pretty much skip it. Basically, Don Cheadle's character, a hotel manager in Rwanda during the genocide, manages to save most of his family and more than a thousand Hutus who would otherwise have become victims in the slaughter.<br/><br/>It's sometimes reminiscent of parts of ""The Killing Fields"" and ""Salvador,"" but it's more modestly done. No grand, sweeping shots of ten thousand extras; no repetitive shots of machetes hacking up innocent people. It's the story of one ordinary -- well, maybe extraordinary -- guy who wheedles, bribes, and blackmails until he gets his charges out into neighboring Tanzania.<br/><br/>Yet, though we see little of it, the horror hangs palpably in the atmosphere. Cheadle's character is driving a van full of supplies back to his hotel in the middle of the night and the van begins to bump and lurch on a suddenly rough road. Cheadle gets out and discovers he's been driving over piles of corpses which cover the road as far ahead as he can see.<br/><br/>The UN forces are present but almost (not quite) impotent. I lost track of who was doing all the killing -- there is the army, the rebels, various factions -- it hardly matters. The Hutus are killing the Tutsi children so as to wipe out the next generation. It's difficult to tell how this differs much from the Serbs raping rival women in order to impregnate them and produce a next generation that is at least half-Serbian.<br/><br/>Perhaps half a million people were killed in Rwanda in 1994. The rivers and waterfalls were choked with naked and mutilated bodies. And little attention was paid by most of us, just as there is little attention being paid to events in Darfur as I write this. Our general view of human nature is that we are flawed but perfectible. Maybe we're just flawed. Maybe what we need is a signal of surrender, the kind dogs have, in which the loser rolls over on his back and the victor straddles him, looks around, and growls. Alas we have no such signal. The hand of the Intelligent Designer shook.<br/><br/>Cheadle's performance is better than just good. He's VERY good. He darts about wearing the same expression, wheeling and dealing, being reasonable, until we think that's all there is to him. Until there is a scene with a corrupt general who swigs out of a bottle of single malt scotch and muses about his visit to Scotland. ""Good golf. I wonder if I will ever visit there again. Do you think so?"" Cheadle, meanwhile, sweat pouring down his face, has been frantically stacking bottles of scotch in a crate to bribe the general, paying no attention, and he replies unthinkingly, ""No,"" then looks up and adds quickly, ""I mean there are many things I believe we should all do in the future."" The scene ends with Cheadle's man who embraces realpolitik finally losing his temper and shouting wide-eyed at the general that some day there will be an accounting for all this and who, if not Cheadle, will be around to testify for the general. The transformation of the character from polite and subservient to angry and threatening is shocking. And it is hard to believe that Cheadle could have been one of the undercover Narcs in ""Traffic."" He's exceptional.<br/><br/>His wife, Sophie Okonedo, is compellingly beautiful in a most ordinary kind of way with her plump pouting lips, her Egyptian eyes, and her narrow-shouldered vulnerable frame.<br/><br/>But, really, all the performances are pretty good. If there were a temptation to turn the white folks into villains, it was successfully resisted. I'm not sure -- I'll have to look it up later -- but I don't believe the distinction between Tutsi and Hutu was created by European colonials. Probably the measurements and all that took place, and perhaps the laying on of hands ceremony, but if I remember the Hutu and Tutsi spoke different languages and were of different somatotypes to begin with. Not that it matters much.<br/><br/>The movie is both gripping and instructive. A great candidate for showing in classes on international affairs and social change. Throw it into a philosophy class while you're at it. Let's see what they make out of human nature."
"EUyeshima","10","0","0","20 February 2006"," Human Face on Little Known Genocide...Devastating Viewing
","The thought of almost a million people killed over a 100-day period is beyond imagination, but that is exactly what happened a mere ten years ago in Rwanda when the dominant Hutu tribe slaughtered the minority Tutsi tribe in a civil war that drew little media attention, and much worse, minimal help from the United Nations peacekeeping forces. The killings were the most brutal possible, as the Tutsis were murdered one person at a time. Just like Oskar Schindler, Paul Rusesabagina is the unlikeliest of heroes, as this soft-spoken family man and savvy negotiator is put to the test in the posh HÃ´tel des Milles Collines, which he manages in the capital city of Kigali. Against absurd odds, he is able to provide refuge for nearly 1,300 Tutsis and consequently saved their lives. Written by Kier Pearson and Terry George, this remarkable story has been directed powerfully by George, who makes the wise decision to focus on the plight of Rusesabagina and his family rather than take a more epic approach to what would have been too overwhelming to view in full force. Their situation is compelling enough given that Paul is a Hutu and his wife is a Tutsi. Consequently, there is less emphasis on the actual killings and the political leaders involved, though enough is shown to leave a lasting impression. The prospect of death always feels imminent as the story whittles away all the parties who could have helped the Tutsis but chose not to.<br/><br/>Generally a dependable supporting player in grade-A Hollywood pictures, Don Cheadle is an inspired choice to play this reluctant hero, as the actor economically portrays a man used to making deals to get what he needs for the hotel and then uses this skill in response to the shocking events to pacify the Hutu general in charge. In fact, most of the film consists of his increasingly desperate negotiations as the stakes continue to climb, including making a devastating choice to stay at the war-torn hotel while pushing his family onto a truck that could mean their escape. Cheadle plays these key scenes with minimum fuss and makes them all the more emotionally resonant, in particular, when he has a delayed reaction to seeing corpses strewn on a fog-blanketed road and weeps uncontrollably as he is dressing to bargain yet again. Matching him every step of the way is the superb Sophie Okonedo, who transforms the standard wife-and-mother role of Tatiana into something quite transcendent. Effective in much smaller roles are Nick Nolte as Colonel Oliver, the commander of the U.N. peacekeeping force; Joaquin Phoenix as a cynical photojournalist; Cara Seymour as a compassionate Red Cross worker; and Hakeem Kae-Kazim as the wily Hutu general George Rutanganda.<br/><br/>The DVD has two excellent documentaries. The first is ""A Message for Peace: Making Hotel Rwanda"", one of the better making-of featurettes given the participation of the real Paul Rusesabagina, who reasons that the lack of global, specifically American, support in 1994 for the Tutsis had to do with the devastating U.S. losses suffered in Somalia and the fact that Rwanda has no bargaining chip of economic value, i.e., no oil, no natural resources other than coffee and tea. The second, ""Return to Rwanda"", movingly follows Paul and Tatiana Rusesabagina back to their native land after living years in exile in Belgium. He even participates in the audio commentary along with George and singer Wyclef Jean. Strongly recommended, in fact, essential viewing of a reenactment of a massive genocide swept under the rug by the Western media."

","My... oh my... there are no words to describe this. Words just seem redundant... even irrelevant. EVERYTHING else seems irrelevant right now by the way.<br/><br/>It's in the middle of the night and I have just watched the only other film that has ever left me in a state of TOTAL SHOCK, the first one being Schindler's List.<br/><br/>In fact, that was - in a sense - a less shocking film due to the simple fact that we already know so much about the Holocaust. The whole point of Hotel Rwanda is that here is a genocide of similar proportions... that has passed us by. We have seen the Holocaust survivors share their stories, but we have not yet understood the full magnitude of the Rwandan massacres.<br/><br/>In short: nothing can prepare you for this.<br/><br/>I simply do not know what to say or think. I CANNOT even think after seeing this. It is just... unreal. Nothing anyone says or does can ever make this film justice. This is right up there with Schindler's List as one of the two most important films ever to be seen.<br/><br/>The film treats the subject with all the respect of craftsmanship required. As with Schindler's List, it avoids the pitfall of over-saturating the viewer with blood and gore, and chooses the far more emotionally powerful way of conveying the terror by focusing on individuals, relations. But even though the story of Paul Rusesabagina has many resemblances with that of Oskar Schindler, Hotel Rwanda consciously steers clear of the obvious pitfall of becoming a copy of Schindler's List, and treats those similarities in a rather passing way.<br/><br/>It is a film that whacks you in the middle of your soul.<br/><br/>The scene in the beginning, when Paul Rusesabagina drives through the night during the first blackout, manages to create such an eerie sense of looming terror using only the slightest of visuals, that it in itself should become a case study for all aspiring film makers. I could feel the terror in my MOUTH.<br/><br/>And... where were the Oscars?? I agree that the 2005 Best Actor in a Leading Role, Jamie Foxx, did an outstanding job in Ray. But I am not joking: nominee Don Cheadle's portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina in Hotel Rwanda kicks the you-know-what of EVERYONE nominated that year, put together. Don Cheadle's is a performance Jamie Foxx couldn't even DREAM about. Don Cheadle could blow a few Jamie Foxxs out of his nose.<br/><br/>Accent: SPOT on. I was SHOCKED (here's that word again) to realise Don Cheadle is an American: I had not heard of him before, and was totally convinced the lead role was played by an African actor since he sounds exactly like my Central African friends - until I read the info here on IMDb!! And he is such a... NORMAL person, giving full credibility to the story of someone forced into doing unusual deeds. SHAME on the Academy for snubbing this unbelievable work; it must have been because they knew who Ray Charles was but not what - or WHERE - Rwanda is.<br/><br/>The same goes for the rest of the film - even down to the accent of the Sabena people. I happen to live in Belgium... and I can assure you that I could have listened to the actors playing Sabena officials with my eyes closed and thought they were Belgian straight away!! Academy, go find the dialect coach of this film, INVENT a category for him/her, and give him/her a shiny Oscar for it retroactively!! And for the rest of you: Do not make the same mistake we all made in 1994. Go see this movie. Tell the story. Never forget. And make sure it never happens again.<br/><br/>Must-see? That's only the first name. This film has left me FLATTENED. I am out of breath. And lost for words."

It was Belgians who originally divided the Rwandans to the upper and lower class to mirror the society they were used to in their own country.

This is an emotionally charged drama that will ignite strong emotions within you; whether it be sadness, anger and disappointment.<br/><br/>The storyline itself is powerful and moving, and is portrayed very well in this movie in that every bit of the Rwanda refugees' suffering was depicted in it (e.g. drinking water out of the swimming pool because they couldn't get fresh water without attracting the Hutu militants).<br/><br/>In this movie violence plays a vital role in portraying the suffering of these Rwandan refugees; hence giving its MA rating. Bodies were depicted, killings were depicted; all to give the movie intensity and depth in portraying the horrors that occurred in Rwanda over 10 years ago. I have to admit, the death toll at the end it all was shocking.<br/><br/>This movie is perceived differently by different people.

I've heard many positive reviews for this film and it made me go out and watch it, but I did not expect it to have been this moving and have such an affect on me. During the course of our lives, we view many films that make us laugh, make us cry, make us think and make us feel, but nothing has ever made me cry, think and feel more than this movie, and truth be told I don't think any film will ever be able to reduce me to tears and break my heart and inspire me at the same time than this film. Paul Rusesabagina, (the man who the movie is based on) deserves more credit than what he has received. His work in saving the lives of 1268 refugees fleeing the violence is an act which more people need to know about.

The most dramatic scenes were always happening from a certain distance. That made the film even stronger. It's a nice example of how it is possible to make movies about violent themes with sense and sensibility.

","I did not go to see ""Hotel Rwanda"" of my own free will, but I am glad I did go, and you will be too. ""Hotel Rwanda"" tells the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu man living in Rwanda. Paul is married to a Tutsi woman named Tatiana and they have two children. When the president of Rwanda's plane is shot down, Hutu extremists go on a rampage and kill around a million Tutsi's. ""Hotel Rwanda"" shows the carnage that occurred. It also shows one man's courage to stand up for what was right and to protect innocent people's lives - even by risking his own. In opening up his hotel, Paul Rusesabagina saved almost a thousand innocent Tutsi.<br/><br/>Anyone with a heart will feel some extremely strong emotion when they see this movie. It is not the film for everyone. But everyone should see it. It doesn't matter if you want to see it or not, you should. Don Cheadle (who was nominated for Best Actor at the 77th Academy Awards) is perfect as Paul. He portrays the emotions that the real Paul felt and he fits the role like a glove. Sophie Okonedo (who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the 77th Academy Awards) plays Paul's wife, Tatiana and does beautifully.<br/><br/>""Hotel Rwanda"" makes a point of showing the carnage that occurred in the 1991 genocide in Rwanda, where the weapons of choice were machetes. But this movie isn't just about teaching people about what happened over a decade ago. It shows that genocide can happen at anytime and any place. Genocides are not limited to the Holocaust of WWII. There is even one happening right now in Dafar, Sudan. In ""Hotel Rwanda"", one character makes the point the we see these things on television, say how awful it is, and then go right on eating our dinner.<br/><br/>This is a movie everyone should see. It will be painful, but it will be good for you. It will make you think. No one should go without seeing it. It really is an important lesson for everyone in the world.

When i was watching this movie i remember Schindler List... so i started thinking... Schindler was German and even though he saved Jews, Mr. Rusesabagina was Hutu and he saved too people that were in need. so, my conclusion is it doesn't matter your color, it matters if you have a heart and in what are your beliefs. Movies like that need to be shown cause otherwise people wont be heard. We need to learn with their mistakes. But talking like this i just remember that we must remember that u really did the apartheid was the white man( Belgians)-when they entered in Africa they colonized some countries and divide tribes, and put some of the tribes that weren't friendly with one another as neighbors, and that is how this mess started. Apartheid happen to in South Africa, and we have a model of peace, Mr. Mandela. We need to hear our own voice, we need to hear everybody voice. Because life is worth, and priceless. This movie is really good, the actors were incredible astonish. Don Cheadle really enter in the character. I just loved this movie for what its represent. The director was pretty amazing."

","I was a little suspicious of this subject in George's hands given how some of the facts of his previous wok had been distorted for dramatic effect. I'm not sure if he has indulged himself again here, but I would not question the power or message the film conveys. <br/><br/>But I wonder how many in the current anti-war movement ask themselves what exactly they would have had the west do in this, or any similar, situation given their shameful queasiness when confronted with uncontrollable atrocity and human rights abuses, such as in Iraq, Afghanistan and, in this case, Rwanda. <br/><br/>It seems when faced with corrupt, insane murderous extremism such as practised by the likes of the Interehamwe, the Taliban, the Baathists - and currently the Janjaweed in Sudan - only force will do, and complicity in the status quo to preserve self interest is unacceptable. <br/><br/>This thinking is, of course, a neo-conservative cornerstone and underpins much of its foreign policy theory - to its credit. In 1994 Clinton stood idly by and history shamefully glosses over this when it comes his presidency. Indeed he would have done the same in Bosnia had the British among others persuaded him not to. <br/><br/>It is to our shame that while the west intervened in the Balkans Rwanda was left to implode, and equally depressing that the current (Tutsi) Rwandan leader, Paul Kagame, shows all the signs of playing to type as another despotic, militant for whom power is a means to an end, and something to be abused, as he conducts similar excursions into neighbouring DRC.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, this film should make audiences think and not forget the words of Dalliaire when Paul proposes a toast when the troops arrive."

","The events portrayed in Hotel Rwanda happened only a few years ago, yet few people are aware fully of what happened. And this is where Hotel Rwanda differs from Schindler's List, a film that portrayed well-known events that happened many years ago. It's an important difference in my view.<br/><br/>This is the only movie that's every gotten to me - unlike most movies that set out to upset/sadden the viewer, this one doesn't need violence or a divorce case; the shock here comes from the portrayal of humanity and the single most overwhelming feeling at the end of the film is one of shame."

I'd never heard of this movie, just happened to catch it on the Movie Network, and it was one of those rare experiences where I couldn't stop watching.<br/><br/>The movie is really documentary in style, and makes you feel, sickeningly, like you are there. Stomach churning, revolting to think what man can do to man, people who are so similar killing each other.<br/><br/>You will think it is sad to hear the Western Reporter comment that the two women could be twins, even though one was Hutu and one was Tutsi, you understand the evil in the hearts of some Africans. But that is nothing compared to the UN General's declaration that ""We Think you are DIRT"". His declaration, of course, was not his personal opinion, but simply a condemnation of how the West treats even the worst crimes in Africa.<br/><br/>That is when you realize that the evil there is borne of two peoples with a history of hatred, but the evil borne from the West has no excuse. The poor black people in Africa are entirely left to their own means, to let what will happen, happen. Even UN help on the ground is withdrawn.<br/><br/>And it would take a fool not to see that this is still going on -- as the west, and the US especially, protects its own interests in Iraq, and ignores current genocide in Darfur, it almost makes one ashamed to be from the West, or it made me feel that way at least.

","Hotel Rwanda was an excellent movie to watch, an inspiring movie. The story happened more then ten years ago, in 1994 in Rwanda, Africa.

I would highly recommend everyone to watch this movie at least once. The message that this movie gives out to the viewer is that everything/every person, no matter how big or small, no matter how rich or poor, is important for life on this earth. After watching the movie, one quickly realizes that we are all human beings, deep down inside, we all want the same thing- love, peace, and happiness, and that we are all just one race- the HUMAN RACE.

Paul, a businessman and Hotel manager is forced to take people into his hotel, a UN safe haven and no go zone for the Hutu rebels.<br/><br/>A compelling story with powerful performances especially by Don Cheadle who plays Paul as the protagonist. This film shows us the true meaning of compassion and tyranny as two opposing forces on the ontological spectrum of our existence as humans.

"itamarscomix","8","0","0","11 November 2005"," Mesmerizing, Breathtaking
","Hotel Rwanda would have been a fantastic film without Don Cheadle; but his performance gives it so much. It's hard not to be reminded of Liam Neeson's portrayal of Oscar Schindler, but Hotel Rwanda has just the kind of human believability that Schindler's List lost quite quickly. Cheadle is touching, believable and inspiring in this role, and I for one am looking forward to seeing more of his work in the future. It's nice to see some famous faces popping in on Hotel Rwanda  Nick Nolte, Jean Reno, Joaquin Phoenix  but these are all cameo appearances, and it's the less familiar actors, Cheadle first and foremost, that give their whole and make it the fantastic experience that it is.<br/><br/>And yet, the actors aren't the focus of this film, or at least not all of it; Hotel Rwanda is practically a documentary, and excluding a few sentimental moments, it makes no dramatizations and no beautifications in presenting the horrors of the massacre in Rwanda. If at times the film seems to drive the message home a bit too forcefully  and it often does; Hotel Rwanda leaves very little to our interpretation, and that sometimes interferes with the drama: I had a bit of a problem with characters uttering lines that explain what we should have figured out for ourselves, like Joaquin Phoenix saying 'I'm so ashamed' to nobody in particular just after spending several minutes showing just how ashamed he is  it's all part of the director's intention. Hotel Rwanda doesn't make excuses for itself: it refuses to leave any viewer indifferent, and it refuses to let you twist its meaning. The message is so plain and strong that it cannot be ignored and overlooked. The film is just enough shockingly brutal to make sure that we get it. And we do; it's a depressing, powerful experience, which makes you as truly ashamed as Phoenix's character was of the kind of horrors human beings are capable of, and of your own inability to interfere.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda never had a shot at the Oscars  it's just too frank and too straightforward for the Academy to stomach. But it might just be the best movie made this year. At any rate it's an important film, a film that needs to be watched and demands every bit of your attention. It's a true masterpiece that will probably be remembered as a classic for many years to come."

","I first heard about this movie when I was in college. The class I took was called Genocide literature... most of it was focused on the Holocaust, but the genocide that struck me was the one in Rwanda. No one ever talks about these things because no doubt it's a very hard subject, but the thing that sucks was the fact the Rwandan genocide was never shown on the news or the fact that the United Nations did very little in Rwanda.This movie about a hotel manager who saved over a thousand Hutu and Tutsi refugees is very much like Oskar Schlinder who saved over a thousand Jews during the holocaust. If you want to see more about genocide I strongly recommend that you watch Schlinder's List (this movie has many similarities to Hotel Rwanda) and Ararat (this one is about the Armenian genocide that happened during World War I). I give this movie a 10 out of 10 because it was very well done and the fact that there were some excellent actors."

Not one person who has seen both Ray and Hotel Rwanda has said that Foxx was better than Cheadle. He was robbed of the best actor Oscar in a big way. I almost threw up when I saw that the Academy had given the Oscar to Foxx over Cheadle, but then again, it is the same Academy that gave Titanic a sweep in the 1997 Oscars, so I can't give them much credit for recognizing good movies.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle does an incredible job in Hotel Rwanda: his acting is so emotionally charged that I almost cried during my first viewing, and trust me, I usually have tear ducts of steel.

He does a magnificent job given the resources available. Some of the scenes in the film are so horrendous that they caused me to gasp.<br/><br/>I am not sure how much of a political statement the film intends to make, but surely the viewer will notice that the world turned its back on the killings - we are all responsible for the results.

The film, a true story, is set in 1994 when the Hutu and Tutsi's began a bloody civil war. The main character is Paul who works in a fancy hotel. His wife is a Tutsi and her race is the target of the Hutu who intend to kill every single one. With the UN pulling out and the world deserting them, Paul ends up hiding about 1000 Tutsi's inside the hotel. This is not a pleasant film to watch, I sat there full of dread waiting for the next horrible thing to happen. There is one scene that is even more horrifying when you remember that it really happened; Paul and Gregoire are driving through fog along a very bumpy road. The bumps turn out not to be the result of poor maintenance but hundreds of bodies littering the road. The acting is fantastic - I am regularly surprised by the talent of child actors, and this movie was another where the children we very believable.

It makes you understand that a country is made up of individual people, that each one has a story and a choice. It shows how quickly things can get out of hand, how easy it is to divide a people, how tragic the consequences. This movie doesn't hold back and sugar-coat the brutality and drama. The massacre was of unspeakable proportion. But Hotel Rwanda also tells of awesome courage, real deeds by real people. Just as shocking it is to see the bloody brutality of the war, it is even more amazing to see the steely resolve of those people who decided to do the right thing come what may, even at the risk of their own lives.

","I have yet to see this film but I would like to comment on the first pre-release poster I saw on a huge billboard. The image was very minimal and stark. A black background with a horizontal side-view of a shiny, scuffed machete blade. The only text being a very amateur looking 'Hotel Rwanda' in gold coloured Times New Roman font. Why was this image so powerful? Firstly I could see no clues as to what this poster was advertising, apart from the title obviously but the image itself didn't look like other movie posters, there was something nonconformist and more real about it. No airbrushing, no stylised fonts - just a stark, quite unsettling image of a weapon designed to cause a lot of damage. As much as the poster shook and to some extent impressed me because of it's originality, I thought it was tad insensitive but perhaps that is good for westerners who know so little about what happened. A few days later I could no longer see the original poster, it had been replaced with a more acceptable Hollywood style image, still depicting the machete blade only with airbrushed sad faces of the central characters inside it. That kind of killed my curiosity a bit but nevertheless I'll be renting this out when I have some money. Oh and I rated it 8 to be polite as I haven't seen it yet!"
"gja2677","10","0","0","30 August 2005"," Fantastic Film, I urge you to see this
","Most of the reviews that you will see about this film will refer to it as this year's Schindlers List, and in many ways it is. But to just apply a label like that to Hotel Rwanda is to do the film an injustice. Whilst both films are similar in plot and inspired by the heroic actions of real men, they should both be viewed as a film on their own terms.<br/><br/>For starters Hotel Rwanda is a much more intimate affair than Schindlers List as it focuses on Paul and his family. Most of the action in this film is confined to one locale, which adds to the feeling of isolation from the outside world. And therein lies the major differences between the 2 films and the events they depict. The holocaust in the 2nd World War was easy for the rest of the world to overlook (I know it sounds terrible but remember at the time there was no internet, no 24 hour news coverage, no CNN, the true enormity of this horrific slaughter only came to light after the event. In Rwanda, the outside world just didn't care, and if the truth is known, we still don't. We live in a world where a news story can be reported instantly, and yet we still choose to ignore the problems of a country like Rwanda. We go to war over fictitious stories of weapons of mass destruction in the guise of a humanitarian mission, but where was our humanity in Rwanda, or in Ghana or in any of the other countries where atrocities such as these happen on a daily basis.<br/><br/>The troubles that plague a place like Rwanda exist in our own countries, our own cities, our own towns, our own neighbourhoods, these are not just problems that are localised to Africa. Racism and intolerance exists everywhere, they are just more extreme in some places. This film highlights the fact that these are real problems happening to real people. It gives faces to the countless statistics that are so easy to ignore, when a person has a name and not just a number it makes it harder to distance ourselves from these atrocities. Yes this film is full of violent and horrific images (although it is never explicit it is mainly implied), yes this film is unbearable tense in places, yes it does make you angry and ashamed that our governments have sat by and done nothing (Nick Nolte's comments about Aficans is one of the most chilling in recent history) But this film is ultimately uplifting, it is full of hope and it reminds us once and again that one man can make a difference.<br/><br/>Yes this is a message movie and it is based on true events, but it is also funny, moving, tense and inspirational. The acting is first rate and you will end up thinking about the implications of what you have seen for days to come. In short it is a substantial cinematic achievement, absolutely stunning."

"highclark","9","0","0","24 July 2005"," The tragedies of today are tomorrow's bargain matinée
","When Terry George decided to make this film he did so in order to tell the story of one man's struggle to protect the lives of his family and of those taking refuge under the roof of the hotel he managed. The manager, Paul Russesabagina (Don Cheadle) awoke each new day to find an ever changing set of rules to follow and new rulers to appease with bribes. Paul only learns about the massacres taking place outside of the hotel through radio broadcasts, photographers, medics and UN peacekeepers. <br/><br/>I don't believe it was crass (as it has been stated on some reviews) to focus on the story of an individual who survived the massacre as opposed to the lives of nearly a million who were murdered. I think the viewer gets the idea that a genocide is taking place, we feel it as the boundaries surrounding the hotel become breached and any semblance of protective help is being pulled out of the country. In fact, one of the most heart wrenching scenes takes place during an evacuation of all non-native people. On the bus to safety we can see every type of person on board who isn't a Tutsi. Even dogs are allowed on the bus, just not any of the Tutsi people. As the bus pulls away from the hotel, the gravity of the situation is all very clear to those left behind. And as this is the story of the incredible survival of Paul Russesabagina and those he was able to save from a certain death, his story becomes all the more remarkable.<br/><br/>Terry George has helped to shine a light on a massacre that went largely unnoticed or ignored by millions of people. He did so by focusing the story of the movie onto one man's struggle for survival. Perhaps by making this movie he may have also helped to make us more aware of our place in the world at large, so that we may better shape any upcoming acts of genocide to occur in the future.

I really don't believe that Amazon.com put any malicious thought into the shopping link for the movie consumers that surf IMDb, the link is a completely automated provision that is supplied to every movie in its database. But you could understand that someone, perhaps most people, would be offended by it. I'm sure the header I've thought up for this movie review will offend someone, but I can't say that was my truest intention. It may be a cynical thought, but it happens to be true.

I believe Terry George had the best of intentions, I don't believe he made his movie to be crass.<br/><br/>The important lesson to be learned is that of learning any lesson at all. Even after watching ""Hotel Rwanda"" and being deeply affected by it, I wonder if I'll be able to live outside of my own head. I hope we have learned, but I realize that there was a time when the world at large looked the other way while a million people were slaughtered; now they can click on a link and 'Shop Hotel Rwanda'. 9/10 Clark Richards"
"underfire35","10","0","0","22 July 2005"," An Important Film About An Often Ignored Subject.......
","When it became apparent, in 1994, that genocide was impending in the African nation of Rwanda, much of the west deemed the people of that impoverished country ""unworthy"" of aid or resources. On the part of the United States, Rwanda was low on the list of priorities; fresh from the Bosnia conflict, and interventions in Haiti and Somalia, the US did not want to risk involvement there. A small unit of UN peacekeepers were deployed, but suffered under heavy restrictions. They were given little money and outdated equipment. When Rwandan president Habyarimana's plane was shot down in April, the dam broke and Hutu flooded the streets out for blood. The minority Tutsi were considered the enemy and were targeted by roadblocks and constant radio broadcasts calling for their extermination. Moderate Hutu also came under the blade of the machete (the preferred weapon of the masses). What started as essentially a social conflict, or what most thought a prelude to civil war, erupted into chaotic slaughter amongst a poor and uneducated populous. Bodies lay strewn in the streets, in the houses and rivers. Even before the violence reached its apex, and the term genocide became unavoidable, the world powers seemed to have forgotten Rwanda and left the country to burn.<br/><br/>It is in the city of Kigali, during this period, that the film HOTEL RWANDA takes place. It focuses on the real life story of the manager of a five-star resort named Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), who has found himself integrated into the ""style"" of the west. He procures fine cigars and expensive whiskey for his foreign visitors and for the military elite who frequent the hotel. He is a Hutu married to a Tutsi woman, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), their children being of mixed blood. When the violence of April 1994 reaches his doorstep, he does everything he can to save his family, but finds himself a part of something larger. As the situation worsens, and the UN forces diminish, Paul uses his money, limited resources, and social contacts to protect the hundreds of people who sought the hotel as a refuge. He quickly realizes that there will be no intervention; the scenes involving Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), the frustrated UN peacekeeper, are pointed as he explains to Paul that the world does not care about him or his country. It is hard to deny that elements of racism played a part in the decisions of world powers and Paul feels betrayed by the false prophet of the west. In one of the most poignant scenes, Paul watches as foreign nationals are evacuated from the hotel. A busload of white faces pulls away, and with them the security forces, leaving the defenseless group of Africans to meet their fate. But events leave little time for self reflection, as there are almost hourly threats against the hotel and the people inside. Eventually the payoffs and bribes no longer work and Paul is left only with words, which he uses to play on the fears of men like General Bizimungu (Fana Mokoena), creating a sense of power he does not really have. After words fail, only hope remains.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle, who plays Paul Rusesabagina, is truly memorable. It is an important performance, and rare, where the actor ceases and only the character remains. Observe the scene when, having returned with supplies, Paul is overcome by what he has viewed on the roads. Cheadle is mesmerizing here, but he is just as nuanced in the smaller moments which makes his breakdown all the more effective and real. He does not falter for a moment. Sophie Okonedo is just as good; she is strong and avoids the ""woman in peril"" clichés so prevalent in film. It is Nick Nolte who reminds us here that he can be an actor of great depth when given the opportunity, and the entire supporting cast helps immensely. HOTEL RWANDA marks a departure for director Terry George, who is from Northern Ireland, and has worked almost exclusively with Jim Sheridan on stories about that region. Here he creates tension without gimmicks and allows the characters to develop. He puts a human face to the abstract bloodshed of Rwanda during the massacres, but avoids preaching or over sentimentalizing the harrowing subject matter. The cinematography, production design and music help George in recreating the time and place. HOTEL RWANDA seems effortless in its portrayal of the events, but these are, in fact, the hardest films to make.<br/><br/>It was difficult for me to imagine a film about the genocide in Rwanda as having a PG-13 rating. In a way it is good because the film will reach a wider audience and shed light upon a recent atrocity which was ignored at the time and has been largely forgotten since. Having seen various documentaries on the subject, read participant's accounts and seen chilling photographs of rivers choked with corpses, the true scale of violence was staggering. HOTEL RWANDA does not quite capture the brutality and horror of the events where mobs of people used sharpened car parts and bicycle handles to kill Tutsi as well as Hutu ""traitors."" It instead chooses to focus on the personal story of Paul and his efforts. He is a brave man who saved the lives of many through his efforts, although chance seems to have played a large part. The film should also help us look ahead to the events in the Darfur region of the Sudan where many of the same things are happening today and which has been obscured by other world events. The message of HOTEL RWANDA seems to be that something like this can happen at anytime, in anyplace, and that each instance is as worthy of our attention as the next. I hope this film will continue to have an impact but in the long term it is people, not films, that will make a difference. 10/10"

About Jean Reno in the movie ,he seems a bit rigid in acting,I think he should be more passionate .The art direction is good.Terry did a great job.The screenplay is good too.the music is OK,Jean Wycle sung the song well. anyways,I am going to show my family this movie."

","So how do you go about making a movie that explains, in enough detail to please everyone, the effects of hundreds of years of European influence, the modern day influence of arms sales from competing European nations to various warring factions, the influence of the UN, United States, civil war and what caused them, etc. etc. - and all of it in a time period that people will be willing to sit through? I think the events dealt with in this movie are far more complicated in their history and causes than people know and some of the criticism is outrageous. I'm waiting for the ""UN is a Trojan Horse on our shore's"" comments to start. A UN Propagand film - are you serious? and as for the accuracy comments<br/><br/>so the makers of this movie did what hundreds of other movie makers have done in the depiction of complicated events, they used composite characters and altered the time line to make the movie flow. there wasn't one or two Hutu generals - there were a dozen or more and he had to know what to bribe each of them with to get cooperation and protection - but it would have been too complicated to try to depict all of them.<br/><br/>I don't think this movie is the new Schindler's list but I think they did a masterful job depicting the horror these people were faced with and their miraculous survival despite the threat from a murderous mob that was in real life right outside the gate of the hotel."

","Finally, a movie about human evil that doesn't involve the Holocaust, slavery, Southerners, or Germans! <br/><br/>There were two types of depravity in the film - the Hutu militias and the apathetic world that stood by and did nothing knowing full well what was happening.<br/><br/>The movie features some memorable acting performances. Don Cheadle was marvelous and thoroughly believable as a dignified man of strength that had to juggle the demands of protecting his family, his hotel, his people, and his identity. Sophie Okendo, who plays his wife, was equally superb as was Nick Nolte in a limited role as UN peacekeeper that really takes his job seriously.<br/><br/>Second, the movie was thoroughly riveting from beginning to end and managed to maintain the suspense throughout - we never really knew how this was going to end for the Rusesabagina family and yet we really cared and hoped for the best against all odds.<br/><br/>There was a moment in the film in which I cried but whether it was because of the horror the Tutsis experienced or because of the depravity latent in the heart of all mankind, I do not know.<br/><br/>There are two moments which will stick with you. First, the memory of the bombastic radio speaker challenging the Hutu militias to ""cut the tall trees down"" is a haunting angry voice of intense evil.<br/><br/>Second, the memory of the unwitting ""friend"" that spoke so callously about completely annihilating all Tutsis. When Paul indignantly retorts something like ""surely you can't think you can kill all of them,"" he replies ""Why not? We are half way there already!""

","This is probably one of the best films I have ever seen. It was hard to watch because grown men were killing children. This amount of history, courage, suffering, and triumph is incredible. Hotel Rwanda was a very important film and it will stay with me.<br/><br/>I am shocked and angry there was no coverage of this atrocity. I can't believe someone could make a decision to not call this ""genocide"" and not attach ""newsworthy"" to this event. The writing was excellent but the acting was unsurpassed. Sophie and Don really captured the realism and fear from this terrible massacre. I saw Ray and Foxx was great. But my vote would certainly go to Don Cheadle!! This movie is worth watching. It's very disturbing. But you can learn a lot from the DVD behind the scenes look with the real Paul. He goes back to Rwanda and actually sees the lime-coated real human remains of the children and adults killed in 94'. This heroic tale should have received much more recognition for every aspect of production. This movie has a great pace, acting, writing, art-direction, and cinematography.

","This was a really powerful film. The word that leaps to mind is dignified. A film about the genocide in Rwanda could have taken a lot of roads to hit you in the gut. What impressed me is that you don't get a lot of graphic shots - actually no graphic shots. There is less blood in this film than most episodes of CSI. The film assumes you are capable of understand the horror of the event without showing it to you. Don Cheadle has worked in crap like Mission to Mars, Ocean's 11, and Swordfish so the way he pulls out his role Paul Rusesabagina might shock. He really brings out the character who isn't some crusading hero but a normal man who brings the same talents to saving Rwandans that he used to serve guests at his hotel. He plays the role with such grace and ease that the character is wholly credible. The film's biggest emotion for me was less one of sadness than anger. Listening to an actual US State Department broadcast talk about ""Acts of Genocide"" get interrupted by a reporter asking, ""How many acts of genocide does it take before something is genocide."" was maddening. You realize how little effort- manpower and money- it would have taken to avert the killing of almost a million Rwandans but the world sat by and did nothing but make noises at the UN. Pitiful."

To decide whether to hate a person and wish them dead based upon such a (seemingly) insignificant mark left me feeling cold and a little sick.<br/><br/>This story is filled with such aberrations.<br/><br/>When we picked this movie off the shelf, I had a small idea of the atrocities in Rwanda and was prepared for a story reminscient of the ""The Killing Fields"". It that regard, it was predictable. However the empathy for the characters, played so well, each emotional high and low broadcast from their faces like a bright light, left me tearing up when pulled into the dark drama of genocide in Rwanda.<br/><br/>This story demonstrates the full spectrum of the human condition; compassion, greed, hatred, respect, love, dignity and the sheer force of will made available when facing the extinction of loved ones.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda does not demonstrate more than cursory lesson in the circumstances that led up to the strife, but it does show you what humanity is capable of doing - for good or evil - as a result.<br/><br/>Watching this movie left me embarrassed by my lack of knowledge or involvement in such heady themes, and ashamed of how the world treated our brethren in Africa.

The actor Jon Cheadle did an exceptional job at replaying the life of Paul Rusesabagina and helps the viewers get the real feel of the situation that Paul and his family experienced. The film has such power that it brings tears, sadness but also hopefulness. I had no real idea of the massacre that occurred in Rwanda and the film really helped explain the conflict and the horror that many of the people suffered during the experience.

","This movie was excellent. My AP world history teacher showed it my class to teach us about the events that happened in the Rwandan Genocide. After watching this movie, all 95 students in her three AP classes were talking about it. Many cried and others teared, but this was not unusual. The movie's intensity definitely proved to be powerful when it sent dozens of high schoolers in to tears. Many scenes made even the boys in the class look away. This movie was an excellent movie in that it really made its viewers more aware of the genocide in areas far away from where we live. Of course, a more contemporary problem is in Darfur. The starvation, raping and killings that occur there are very similar to the atrocities in Rwanda. So by watching Hotel Rwanda, it has definitely made more people feel more involved in the problems not concerning themselves. The anger that the viewer sometimes feels during the movie helps them now to take action in a problem that they can fix. So instead of mourning or feeling sympathetic towards the Rwandans for something that happened almost a decade ago, people can do something about the problem in Darfur NOW! Overall, this movie achieved its purpose, which was to inform people about despite the atrocities that occurs in areas far away from where we are, our intervention can still help them.

Dave is probably eating his words now. I have rarely seen a performance that was as realistic as Cheadle's as Paul Rusesabagina. I can't say that I know Mr. Rusesabagina, but I sure felt like I knew him after this film. Cheadle makes the character believable because he is able to convey the character's personality not only by his delivery, but the by subtle nuances not often seen in film. I couldn't imagine any other actor in this role, and Mr. Cheadle really carries this film forward. Though I give kudos for director Terry George for not only bringing this hard story to life, but doing a terrific job with the directing, as well as the other cast members, Cheadle is the one who carries this film. On a side note, many would like to compare this to ""Schindler's List"". While the subject is similar in that one man saves thousands, you realize that Mr. Rusesabagina probably had a harder job because while Mr. Schindler already had some clout with the Nazis, Mr. Rusesabagina had no real sympathizers and had to use any resources he could while his own life and family were in danger.

And just as real, as history has shown. This is a tale that the whole world should have seen while it was happening.

","""Hotel Rwanda"" tells the true story of the genocide that occurred in the mid 90s between the Tutsis and the Hatu's.

His story is fascinating and Cheadle is amazing.<br/><br/>What could have been a very depressing film, what we get instead is the story told from a different point of view. Paul was considered a traitor by his people because of his efforts. Paul risked his family, his life, and his freedom to help thousands of people because he believed it was the right thing to do. The militia didn't see it that way, as Paul was constantly on the defense and risking his life. Throughout the whole ordeal, he constantly used bribery, favors, and lies to get whatever he needed.<br/><br/>Cheadle, who has been very good before steals the whole movie. His acting covers all kinds of range. You see his pain as he tries to balance all these things and he knows that none of it may do any good. he deserved his Oscarnomination and in my book he should have won.<br/><br/>I was worried that this movie might be a depressing film like say, ""Killing Fields"".

"Leafsman_69","8","0","0","18 May 2005"," Finially the massacre in Rwanda has been brought to the world's attention, only 11 years too late.
","Hotel Rwanda is one of those few cinematic masterpieces that you can recant over and over in your mind, to your families, friends and educators. The movie depicts the desperate situation of a nation torn by civil war and genocide between two major tribes in 1994. However the main focus of the movie deals with a hotel manager who desperately tries to save his family and refugees from the slaughter occurring beyond the hotel property. Normally I am aggravated when a director goes out of his way to give his film a pg-13 so preteens can see it, thus increasing profit. however this movie's rating is highly justified. Everyone deserves to see and care about what had happened in Rwanda, because the world leaders and media at the time of the atrocity certainly did not. With the recent production of numerous WWII movies, the holocaust has been brought to light while the Rwandan genocide had been swept under the the rug, until now. Done Cheadle did a superb job in his role that made me feel like i was right there with him. He is very under-rated and i feel he can out-act even the best such as Denzel Washington. Nolte plays a Canadian UN field leader who is obviously modeled after the Canadian war hero Romeo Dellaire whom attempts to bring the crisis to the international authorities' attention and in return tragically gets his squad of UN peace keepers reduced. This only adds to the desperation of the situation. The movie touches on the personal lives, politics, religion and culture of Rwanda during this short but dark chapter in human history. Much of those who were able to change the outcome of the situation at the time deserve to be shamed by this movie. So many times has society claimed that genocide will never happen again, but i think what society really means is that it will never happen to ""white"" people again. Such a statement can draw this review allot of criticism, but I feel it taps into the darkest part of the human soul where self denial and racism are clearly present. Hotel Rwanda deserves all the accolades it receives and will be shown in homes and classrooms for years to come.

As Wycliffe Jean sang, ""Why can't the countries of Africa be the United States of Africa?..."" When we people of color begin to love ourselves and each other, no matter what the shade of the skin, then we will reject anyone who provokes discrimination amongst ourselves.

","***minor spoilers included***<br/><br/>All it takes for evil to prevail is for good men to stand by and do nothing. <br/><br/>The genocide in Rwanda is a stain on every western nation that claims to hold to ideals of justice and freedom. While U.S. diplomats debated terminology, nearly one million Africans were systematically slaughtered. A self-crippled United Nations was forced to stand by and watch as even its own forces were murdered by hate-filled thugs. Is that a slam on the United Nations? No. Any problems that the United Nations has are directly linked to those member states that compose its ranks. If the UN was ineffectual in Rwanda it is because the United States, France, Germany and other member states made it so. The Bush administration has shown that a nation can get a job done if it wants it bad enough. In 1994, in Rwanda did anyone really want to stop the killing bad enough?<br/><br/>Why did this atrocity happen? It happened because, in the words of Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), the people of Rwanda were not even n***ers. They were Africans. They were worthless. That is what western nations thought of Rwandans in 1994. I would like to say that is not the case any longer, but I cannot. Here is it in the year 2005 and U.S. diplomats are still arguing about terminology and innocent people are being slaughtered in the Darfur in the Western Sudan. See, we can talk all day about how we as a nation stand against tyranny. But apparently, with many western nations, there is fine print. We stand against tyranny, restrictions apply, not valid in all 50 states, results may vary.<br/><br/>""This is ethnic cleansing, this is the world's greatest humanitarian crisis, and I don't know why the world isn't doing more about it."" BBC - http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3549325.stm<br/><br/>Colonel Oliver would have answer for that question. It appears that not much has changed in the decade that has passed since the Rwandan genocide. <br/><br/>All right, I shall get off my soapbox now and get to the review of this movie. Hotel Rwanda is the true story of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a Hutu who risked his life and that of his family to save over 1200 tutsi refugees, by sheltering them in the hotel he managed. <br/><br/>The acting is superb and Cheadle shows just why he should be considered as one of the best actors of his generation. He plays Rusesabagina with a restrained dignity. Rusesabagina is a man who knows how to get things done. Bribes to officials are an everyday fact of life for him and he knows how to play the system to get what he needs for his hotel. When violence breaks out and the killing begins, he is forced to use his talents to not only save the life of a large group of refugees but the life of his own family eventually. <br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix has a small but wonderfully played part as cameraman Jack Daglish who is able to shoot footage of some of the atrocities as they happen. When Daglish is evacuated along with the other Europeans in the hotel, he speaks for western nations, saying ""I feel so ashamed."" At least that is what the leaders of these nations should say. Nick Nolte's Colonel Oliver is a man trying against all odds to make a difference but who finds that the system knocks him down and stamps on him at every instance. Nolte plays him so that we almost start to feel the man's weariness just by looking at him. <br/><br/>You really cannot come away from this film and not be affected. If you come away not feeling a sense of outrage, you must be a republican. Even though the atrocities that are depicted in this film do not hold a candle to what actually happened, director Terry George is able to get us to feel the outrage, as well as the helplessness and the impending doom these people must have felt as they wait to see if they will be able to escape death by machete purchased for a great deal: 10 cents each from China. It is a slow-burn. <br/><br/>These days, the title of hero gets slung around far too often. I started this review with a paraphrased quote from Edmund Burke. Good men stood by and let this atrocity happen. In Rwanda one man, at least, did not stand by. For 1200 people the evil did not succeed. They survived because one man refused to give in to fear and hatred. One man did what was right. That man is a hero. That man is Paul Rusesabagina.  Deanna Carmichael  www.2-hours.com"

This movie also shows one we can do under stress it shows how ignorant hatred can be if we let it escalate to something were we hate someone simply for one fact. Don Cheadle acting was up to par and the realism was good with the AK-47 and the RPG that were used in the time. Something that got me was if they got back on the bus or it left without them. Also I was not aware that it was the FRench who supplied the Huto army. This was a surprising fact. Also what I liked was the sense of comedy that sprung up at tense moments. What I felt to be the most powerful was the scene with the bodies on the road. It shows what Pele do when it is supported by others. I believe that many of them felt that they did not want to commit genocide but if they did not they would be killed as well. I feel that this movie deserved Oscar over Million Dollar Baby"

The story was told fantastically with Drama, Romance, and brief periods of action.<br/><br/>Characters: 9.5/10 The characters in this movie are actually believable and follow the stories of real people.

","I saw Ray. Jamie Foxx was good. However, Don Cheadle was superlative in his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina. A severely underrated actor, Cheadle took on this role as if it were his own life. I can go on and on about how his performance in certain movies (Rosewood, Boogie Nights, Traffic) have either been ignored or down-played. Oh yeah, the rest of the movie - this movie should be required viewing by anyone involved in US diplomatic work in Africa (particularly Darfur / the Sudan) right now.... I can't believe how much I kept seeing the story of Darfur in this movie. Intentional? I don't think so. The DVD did include Cheadle imploring viewers to take action with respect to Darfur, but I think that's because the tragedies occurring there are so similar to what happened in Rwanda and the Western (""Developed"") world's response to both is deplorable. Anyway, good acting, good direction, incredible story (truth is stranger...). I have to say the presentation of the slaughter - the fact the movie did NOT contain blood-and-guts violence they could've probably gotten away with given the nature of the story. The use of tension and the threat of violence that surrounds them always makes the movie meaningful and poignant. All in all, this movie should be required viewing for anyone with a soul."

A co-worker who saw it (and this guy watches all kinds of movies) told me it upset him and made him think. Thinking, real thinking, is like kryptonite is to Superman for most people. So I knew something good had to be involved. This was a very dignified film in that it showed the nobility of a man (Paul) putting himself on the line for family and friends. When American television has shown me so many dumb parents and single parents to whom life is a materialistic game I found Paul Rusesabaginaas as refreshing as cold spring water in the desert. And even though I know the murders of so many people with machetes had to be a gruesome sight I appreciated not being subjected to the usual special effects waterfall of blood and gore. I believe it was a good thing that director Terry George was able to retain control and pick Don Cheadle for the lead role instead of someone like Will Smith. Smith is OK but would not have been the best choice for this part. Hotel Rwanda helps restore meaning to the word ""artistry"". It is an oasis in a celluloid wasteland. Everyone should see it."

","This movie is not what I expected from a movie with such a subject. You hear about genocide all the time, the UN colonel says it and I think the news team says it, too. But words alone won't do, not in a movie. All you see is a few hundred bodies scattered on the street. There are no close ups, almost no scenes where you actually see how the Hutu shoot someone and there is only little blood (genocide and no blood? Hallo?!). And as for the role of the UN I can say this: Colonel Oliver behaves like a small child whose lollipop was taken away. You get the impression all they do is standing around, waiting for some other team of soldiers who protect the citizens. This is so ridiculous. I was too shocked at the image of the UN to be shocked when I should have been. Furthermore the movie shows a short time span, so you don't get the context in which this war takes place. Only once it is mentioned that the Tutsi (who are now slaughtered) suppressed the Hutu. But of course the Hutu are the bad guys and we are not to like them. At this point the movie pushes the audience's sympathy in one direction. Although Hotel Rwanda is not a documentary, I would have liked to think about the conflict and decide who is right (if indeed anyone is) and who is not myself.<br/><br/>There is one scene that really stunned me. After Colonel Oliver has learned the Quick Reaction Force won't stay, he talks to Paul. He then says something that made me feel ashamed. We don't care about what happens in Rwanda. Personally, I don't even know where this country lies and I didn't know about what happened there in 1994 until I saw the movie. Maybe this is the real theme of the movie. Our attitude towards conflicts in Africa or pretty any country in the world apart from our own and the ones next to us. We see the news, say how terrible war is and that was it.

","This is one of the better films that I have seen lately, and well deserving of the Academy Award nominations that it received. The film stars Don Cheadle portraying Paul Rusesabagina in a role in which he was nominated for Best Actor, also well deserved. The story is a retelling of the true events which occurred in 1994 during a Rwandan uprising which the Tutsi population of Rwanda was almost annihilated by the Hutu militia.<br/><br/>Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle) is a hard working Hutu, who serves as the Hotel Manager of a Belgian five-star hotel, the Hotel Milles Collines, in Rwanda. He is married to Tatiana, a Tutsi, played by Sophie Okonedo. Paul lives in a neighbor populated by both Hutu and Tutsi. As the movie begins, tensions are rising as altercations between Hutu militia and Tutsi rebels escalate. Rumors start circulating about a possible Tutsi coup, as Hutu military soldiers begin rounding up possible Tutsi spies in Paul's neighborhood.<br/><br/>A full fledge genocidal war against the Tutsi population is ignited when the plane with the Rwandan President, a Hutu, is shot down by Tutsi rebels only hours after a peace treaty between the Hutu militia and Tutsi rebels is signed. Paul's neighborhood as well as much of Rwanda becomes the battle ground for the war, where only bribery, blackmail, and payoffs are your only survival.<br/><br/>Paul is able to get his family and a van full of neighbors back to his Hotel in hopes that United Nations soldiers will protect these refugees. However, just the opposite becomes apparent. The U.N. soldiers are forced to take no stand on the situation before them. What's even worst, at one point of the film, the U.N. forces arrive at Paul's hotel in mass only to help to evacuate the European guests stranded there, thus leaving behind the Rwanda refugees to fend for themselves without any protection whatsoever.<br/><br/>Paul becomes a one-man army whose only mission is to save the lives of these people. He is forced to plead to foreign nationals, manipulate generals, bribe the Hutu militia, and grovel to U.N. peace-keepers. He is willing to do whatever it takes in order to keep the atrocities, which are occurring just outside his hotel compounds, from entering their confines.<br/><br/>This story is brutally told; it's both gripping and ghastly. Director Terry George pulls no punches; and emotions run rampant as scenes such as ""the U.N. forces departure leaving Rwandan refugees behind at the hotel"" just tears at the heart. It's a story of how one man overcomes insurmountable odds to make a difference, and it's graphically depicted. Again, this film is not for the squeamish; however, I highly recommend seeing it. http://farisreel.com"

It shows us, who leisurely visit the movie theatres, how lucky we are and how much of the world's horrific events go unnoticed except to those who live in fear for their lives. Coming home, I don't think I will ever be able to look at a news report ever the same. Those few seconds of flickering light upon a screen from a news station will never fully convey the depth of the events being shown. What the news is, is really a medium to which we should be stimulated to seek the truth of the matter and hopefully be moved to do something or help in some way. To go and say that this film should have won a lot of awards and be heralded as the best film of the year would not do it justice. Don't get me wrong, the film and its cast and crew are incredible.

We see a tiny slice of the horror but the actual figures of 1 million deaths leaves the audience feeling that we were spared - due to budget constraints I imagine - as this is a fairly low budget effort.

","I saw this one yesterday, after a long day of work at the local theatre. I expected a lot of this one, and what I saw was even better. From the beginning until the end I was emotionally involved in the movie, and it never bored me a moment. --SPOILERS-- In the middle of the movie, when people arrive at the hotel, children being carried in helping hands, buses arriving, this moment -when you hear the African children chant- is one of the most gripping scenes ever captured on film, I almost cried how emotional this scene was, and it repeats itself when all the white people are being evacuated and the blacks look at the buses, completely helpless, being abandoned by the rest of the world. What a great piece of cinema! This will stick in my mind forever. The only thing that makes this not a top 20 IMDb is that I was waiting for such a moment to finish the movie, which stood out. The movie ended a bit to early for me. I missed something at the end, a feeling that leaves you in awe when the movie ends, I didn't felt the emotional impact the movie gave me in the middle of it. Rusesabagina will always be remembered as a great man, who saved the lives of hundreds, but still, the movie hasn't pushed hard enough on that emotion of being the 'hero' he really was during his life at the end. Maybe it's just me, but that's how I left the movie. Nonetheless the best drama I have seen since Mystic River. It could have been one of the greatest movies ever if George had worked out a more emotional impact in the end, but like I said, maybe that's just me. 9.5/10 great movie! Watch it!"

","Hotel Rwanda is one of the greatest films ever made. You just have to experience it first- hand. It is the most authentically ""human"" films ever made. The acting is outstanding, and the film reveals our own personal flaws and corruption, as well as the honour and complexity of those who choose to resist corruption and hatred.<br/><br/>The lead actor incredible, and the film is stocked with real African people in minor roles, and as extras. Early in the film, we are shown how the definition of Hutus and Tutsis was imposed by Belgian colonialists. This is a difficult concept to grasp and explain, but this film makes difficult concepts easy to grasp. Most Westerners have very little idea of what genocide really is, and this makes it plain in the most gripping way. I could barely move once the credits began to roll.<br/><br/>Not only does it deal with colonialism, it highlights the ongoing Western ignorance towards this horrible genocide - while not ignoring the internal African social problems of revenge and corruption. It is a heart-wrenching, and true to life examination of one of the greatest human tragedies in history.<br/><br/>This film is not just ""acting"" - the emotion is so obviously real. That's why I say it is the most human film ever made. there is almost no artifice, it shows life with warts and all, and even managed to inject some humor into a bleak situation.<br/><br/>This film will bring any decent human being to tears, and definitely qualifies as an all-time cinema classic, a rare achievement in today's climate of disposable films and shallow acting. Every person on Earth should see this film."

","Terry George's Hotel Rwanda is a deeply compelling film about the Rwandan civil war that resulted in an enormous genocide (over a million dead). It is the true-life story of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), a Hutu hotel manager who sheltered over a thousand Tutsi refugees from the other warring Hutus. People have complained Hotel Rwanda isn't brutal enough and too selective in its view of a much larger genocide. Although I concede that it may have benefited from its original R rating, the latter seemed intended. Hotel Rwanda does show the genocide as a whole but its also a personal story.<br/><br/>Paul has a few helpful people to look to: a Red Cross worker (Cara Seymour), a sympathetic hotel owner (Jean Reno), and two cameramen recording footage (it also leads to the film's most brutally honest realization that people will look at this footage, say ""Oh my god, that's terrible"", and keep on eating their dinners). However, these aren't alone enough to stop the machetes of the Hutu. And since he is married to a Tutsi, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), his family is in constant danger as well.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda works just as well as an account of man who in desperate times becomes less concerned about himself and more about helping others. The most obvious comparison would be to Oscar Schindler. Paul bribes Hutu officials with beer and money, hides Tutsi orphans, and is frustrated by the United Nation's inability to physically fight back the Hutu forces. The poignancy of the character is helped by a quiet and dignified performance by Don Cheadle, one of the best I have seen all year. Sophie Okonedo is also great if not a little more underplayed.<br/><br/>It may hard to swallow at times, but this is the point. Hotel Rwanda is a reminder of just how much pain human beings can inflict on one other and how much good one can bring to another."

","Having just seen this movie a few hours ago I still can't fully put into words how much this movie touches the heart. Don Cheadle turns in a masterful performance as Paul Rusesabagina. Sophia Okonedo gives a solid performance as his wife Tatiana.<br/><br/>I was only 12 when these incidents were happening and I do not remember them well, but I do remember all the coverage here in Canada because of Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire's constant pleas for international help in Rwanda. Dallaire I'm pretty sure is the basis for the Nick Nolte character in the film (the character wore a Canadian Flag patch on his uniform).<br/><br/>Cheadle's performance combined with the terrific direction of Terry George works wonders in helping the audience sympathize and feel for Paul who really was a reluctant hero type, but in the end did what he had to do.<br/><br/>This movie is about a genocide and there are some disturbing images, including one scene that takes place on a roadway. I won't reveal what happens, but it will be hard not to look away when you see it. This film is PG-13 and the violence is limited, but powerful enough that it still tugs on the heartstrings of the viewer. There are many real-life videos of the genocide much more gruesome than the movie depicted.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda worked great on two levels, first it displayed just how cold and destructive hatred can be and secondly it powerfully demonstrated that the rest of the World refused to help when it should have. How could all that killing be ignored? It just baffles me to know so many people could have done something and so few did.<br/><br/>It's rare I review a film that I can find no flaws in, but Hotel Rwanda is an exception, the film is very well done. Some have said Cheadle's accent comes of as a little corny, but it didn't bother me at all.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda has few explosions, no lengthy martial arts fights, no car chases and no scantily clad women. If you want to see that, you know where to go. However, if you want to see an excellent movie about how destructive human nature can be, see this film.<br/><br/>I guarantee you won't be disappointed."

","Don Cheadle has been operating just below the critical radar for many years. Known to many in supporting parts, his first starring role in a major film (""Hotel Rwanda"") is incontrovertibly a tour de force. Much ado is made in the critical press of the likeness of ""Hotel"" to ""Schindler's List"". Be that as it may this is a welcome addition to filmdom, a veritable eye-opener with a distinctive air.<br/><br/>Filmed entirely in South Africa, director Terry George captures the feel of Kigali, a city in the center of a country in the center of Africa. Little of the veld, the jungle or desert is seen here; this is a country of hills savanna about the size of Maryland supporting nearly eight million people (http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/rw.html); but that Rwanda lost upwards of one million in a widespread campaign of genocide in '94 clearly demonstrates the sheer horror of the 100 days between April and July that year.<br/><br/>As events unfold, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is manager of a fine establishment (Hotel des Milles Collines) that is poised on the edge of an unbelievable maelstrom of events  the death of the President, calls for unconscionable murder of civilians of the wrong (Tutsi) alignment and civil war. Amid the escalating chaos and insanity of the situation stands a kind calm soul thrust into such responsibility as cannot be imagined.<br/><br/>And imagination is the key. Throughout the story we find ourselves musing over the fact that we don't know such chaos; being pulled from your car to show your papers, seeming government endorsement of mass killing, neighbors ratting on neighbors, war within the city, displaced children, roving bands of thugs, the list of horrors goes on.<br/><br/>Things never unfold that black and white decisions can be made in such madness. And so we can only imagine we would behave or react as does Paul- his solid and basic goodness is what saves him, his family and more than a thousand he touches while Rwanda implodes. As each new decision must be made  where to put some orphans, how to handle a desultory staff, how to continue the flow of supplies into the hotel, how to handle his family, how to react to demands of local political and law enforcement, we watch him spin, not on a downward but an upward spiral, rising above all those about him.<br/><br/>Director George says that ""...but I think what we set out to do is tell this modern day African hero story in a way that ordinary people will relate to him, and see that if they can tap into a moral courage, that they could possibly be Paul. He's not a superhero, he's not somebody outside the conceptualization of ordinary people. That was the primary objective, and also to show just the strength of his love story and the family unit, and then this thriller element of the whole story itself. And finally, the political quagmire and the intensity and enormity of the genocide itself. And I think on all those levels, we've done pretty good."" (http://movies.radiofree.com/interviews/hotelrwa_terry_george.shtml).<br/><br/>Good indeed.

","The title ""Hotel Rwanda"" is somewhat misleading and a misnomer. No actual Hotel Rwanda figures in the story, which centers rather around the Hotel Mille Collines (so named because Rwanda is known as ""the land of a thousand hills"").<br/><br/>In another sense, however, the title is entirely apt and appropriate, since what happens at the hotel is a microcosmic reproduction of what happened in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, and throughout the country in 1994 -- the genocide of one million members of the Tutsi ethnic minority, as well as moderate majority Hutus.<br/><br/>""Hotel Rwanda"" sketches in the background to the bloodshed without overloading us with expository material. It manages to explain, in a few quick strokes, the legacy of colonialism and ethnic division that led to tragedy on a national scale.<br/><br/>Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is the Rwandan manager of the Belgian-owned Hotel Mille Collines. He finds himself in the midst of a dangerous, violent and explosive situation, and faced with the personification of evil and the heart of darkness. His response is initially to hope that the storm will be short-lived. Ultimately, however, he must react and respond and become a force for the triumph of goodness and love. He comes to realize that it is not enough to protect his wife and children, his family. He must be the guardian angel of all who turn to him for help, and embrace the family of man. As the film's tag line aptly puts it, ""When the world closed its eyes, he opened his arms."" ""Hotel Rwanda"" suitably conveys the horror of genocide, without erring on the side of excess, of gore and bloodletting. The film balances this horror with the beauty of love and kindness, devotion to duty and a sense of responsibility. Moreover, the film shows how, even in a maelstrom of madness, human beings keep their sanity and perspective through the gift of gentle humor.<br/><br/>The Eagles' song ""Hotel California"" says, ""You can check in any time you like, but you can never leave."" But ""Hotel Rwanda"" leaves us with the feeling of hope that even the darkest night of inhumanity gives way to the brightness and warmth of a brand new day. And, as the film suggests, ten years after the nightmare of genocide, Rwanda is indeed seeing the sun of justice once again."

For anyone who needs to understand the severity of the Rwandan Genocide that occurred in 1994 or to see how it now parallels what is becoming the next Rwanda in the Western Sudan today, this is the movie to see. I would not recommend it for anyone under the age of 15 not because of the visual violence, it is not entirely full of gore or blood, but the feelings that it invokes from the audience may be more than a 14 year old or anyone else who is younger could deal with. No one in the theater left the room without crying at least once. It is a must see for anyone who is concerned about Human rights, and how to avoid such atrocities from ever happening again."

","Don Cheadle gives a great performance as Paul Rusesabagina in Hotel Rwanda, a film that documents the slaughter of a million Rwandans at the hands of their own countrymen. This is almost an African version of Schindler's List, as we witness an unwilling businessman suddenly thrust into the position of savior to a high number of outcasts with nowhere to go. Watching Cheadle's performance is like watching a drowning man try to keep his head above water, and I mean that in a good way--there are situations that look absolutely hopeless for Rusesabagina, but he finds ways to keep people alive at the last second. Nick Nolte gives a good performance as the exasperated Colonel Oliver, a man that is handcuffed with what he can do, but ends up being noble to the end. The scariest role is that of the anonymous radio voice coming over the Rwandan airwaves, encouraging the Hutu natives to wipe out the Tutsi minority. Cheadle is a very good actor, and this is his best role to date."

","I am not one to feel for movie characters as I usually tend to see through the script and skip on through to the next scene of events. Ever rarer do I actually go to the cinema to see a movie.<br/><br/>However I am so glad I saw this one tonight.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda is an emotional train ride that for two hours will keep you glued to the screen/seat often with your jaw gaping thinking ""oh wow"". That is really the most anyone will be able to mutter during the screening as from the get go you are captivated by the cinematography and cast presented in this production.<br/><br/>One element that completely drives this movie into the high echelon of anybody's collection is that it is a true story. There is little artistic twist and even if there was any you really were unable to tell. All of the events occurring on screen are believable and make the viewer feel like you are actually there. Several times I really thought that if I turned my head I would see something on the screen akin to what I was expecting to see and it did happen in the movie right when I glanced back to the screen. It is not predictable, it simply creates the atmosphere that you can bond with what is going on. You are no longer some distant set of eyes starring at a movie reel, you are there. Few movies have ever been able to convey this feeling.<br/><br/>The representation of chaos and serenity is almost painfully beautiful. It is so fake, yet everyone knows it but keeps carrying on. The characters realize that what happens outside the hotel yet they cannot do anything about it. The only thing that stands between them and eternal oblivion is a building and a handful of militarily helpless UN soldiers. The several times we are taken for a ride outside the hotel the other side of the movie is right in your face. Again, there are no dramatic sequences, no extended WW2 type zoom in death shots, just a camera showing you the reality. The reality that is closing in on the people in the hotel. Horrors of a large scale civil war massacre are depicted in a touching manner flowing in nicely with the overall tempo of the movie. Nothing feels out of place or pops out of nowhere to confuse you. The storyline remains simple and linear not burdening you with trying to figure what just happened. There are no complex flashbacks used to basically clue you in. Quite the contrary. The less you know the more you will enjoy this movie. It tells you all you need to know right there, when you need to know it.<br/><br/>The tension that the script creates is incredible. Again this was one of the few movies ever that had me doubting what will the outcome be. You really don't have time to think ahead, it doesn't follow a cookie cutter script made for the masses. It is a movie, yet it is a first person documentary seen from the third person perspective.<br/><br/>The cast itself was an interesting assembly of people you have seen before. Do not be surprised if you exclaim ""I've seen this person"" playing a somewhat untraditional role. It really works out great. There is a lot of African talent used in this movie so there isn't the crazy hysterical fake emotional trip usually associated with Hollywood. In fact, a lot of the extra cast acts just like you have seen in the shows about world poverty where they would go in a camp and show you what it really is like. A lot of does not feel like a movie so you are really left to enjoy it for what it is and take it as you wish.<br/><br/>Some argue that there is a political message however I find this to be highly speculative. Yes politics are plugged in but that only helps illustrate the sheer exasperation the characters go through. Certainly the message of the film is lose terms is that while the world refused to care, one man decided to do just that. Thought it is not really aimed against anyone in particular. It makes you think, but not in a propaganda like manner.<br/><br/>The story of a man, the struggle of a family, the indifference of the world mixed in with human savagery collide and yet work together to create a drama that stands above the rest. It will be hard to forget this movie as every single person can somehow place themselves in it at some point and think, ""yes this can happen to me, to my hometown"". The question is, what will you do about it and who will be there for you?"

","I am sure that my general reaction is like most reviewers -- a remarkable film about a horrific episode in human history brought to life in a most intense and rewarding experience -- but I thought I'd approach it a little differently. We saw Hotel Rwanda in the theater on Saturday night and rented Gandhi on Sunday night, so for better or worse, the film drew comparisons with a multi-Oscar ""best picture,"" ""best actor"" extravaganza. And it fared well...<br/><br/>The plot and character similarities are striking. Both movies center around non-western men of color who have absorbed Western values (or at least the values the West pays lip service to) and ways of life, only to find them entirely lacking when they are most needed. Both men use their Western training to their advantage on their own to accomplish the seemingly impossible. And both men leave behind extraordinary accomplishments, but not unqualified successes -- the problems of the world are bigger than any individuals, even ones with greatness such as these.<br/><br/>The backdrops are also similar, though the emphasis is different. Hotel Rwanda focusing on the utter lunacy of internecine conflict, with the cold arrogance of the West as a secondary theme. Gandhi reverses these -- the struggles against Western imperialism is center stage, with Hindu-Muslim hatred (substitute Hutu-Tutsi, Serb-Bosnian, Israeli-Palestinian, Catholic-Protestant in northern Ireland, etc, etc, etc) surfacing only when the oppression of the British is lifted.<br/><br/>Somewhat surprisingly, I liked Hotel Rwanda more. Perhaps it is because Paul, Don Cheadle's character, is less God-like and thus more approachable than Ben Kingsley's Gandhi. It could be the difference in history; it could be the screenplays, or it could be that Don Cheadle was so incredibly evocative on the screen. I suffered with him, I commiserated with him, I plotted with him (tho he was ever so much more facile than I), and ultimately I was overwhelmed by his strength and courage because he was not God-like. Paul could have been you or me, but I doubt I could or would have done anything like what he did. And that is what makes this story and this movie's telling of the story all the more special.<br/><br/>Finally, there are moral questions galore lurking beneath the surface (another distinction between Hotel Rwanda and Gandhi, where we were always told ""this is what is right""). For instance, Paul gave up several opportunities to do great things for smaller groups of people. Had things turned out differently, his choices would have looked very bad indeed. So, taking away hindsight, were his choices right or wrong? How much does one risk for one's family in order to try to benefit an even greater good? Go see it. Appreciate it. It's special."

Like one character in the movie said, people in other countries will see this on TV and say it is so horrible, but then they will go out and eat dinner. This movie skillfully tells of the horrors - the conflicts between Tutsis and Hutus, the genocide, without overdramatizing it. It was more like telling the facts. It held my attention from beginning to end.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD................<br/><br/>I remember one scene is particular. Paul (Don Cheadle's character) and his van driver are returning to the hotel late at night and suddenly the road is bumpy.<br/><br/>Paul asks the driver to stop the van and steps out. Actually he falls out because he has just stepped on a corpse, and then the horrifying scene- he is surrounded by a very large number of corpses.<br/><br/>There are also some very warm moments in the movie- Paul's family, his friends, employees, acquaintances, and the 'powerrful' people- his relationships to them are portrayed beautifully. He uses all his negotiations skills to save lives of over 1200 people. Without him they would have certainly died. He was a real hero who never gave up.<br/><br/>The acting and direction were great. Don Cheadle is brilliant as Paul. I hope he will be nominated for the Oscar. He gets excellent support from the cast, and particularly Sophie, who plays his wife in the movie.<br/><br/>It is hard to describe in words how effective this movie is. All I can say is- Go see it."

Hotel Rwanda, a grim movie about genocide in Central Africa, shows how equally indifferent the world can be to human suffering on an even greater scale.<br/><br/>In 1994, the Rwandan government, controlled by the Hutu ethnic group, which accounts for a majority of the country's population, launched a vicious campaign to wipe out the Tutsi minority. Before the year was out, more than one million Rwandans were dead.<br/><br/>What was happening in Rwanda was no secret. News outlets were full of graphic and grisly pictures of Hutus murdering Tutsis, often with machetes, and fields and roads full of corpses. This time, however, the world did nothing. President Bill Clinton says it is the biggest regret of his political life.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda is about one man who did act, and by doing so, saved more than 1,000 lives. Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a luxury hotel. Paul has made a career of knowing how to understand and meet the needs of his customers and staff. He uses these skills to keep alive his family, neighbors, coworkers and others who come to him for help.<br/><br/>Cheadle gives a wonderful performance, Sophie Okenodo as his wife is equally good, while director Terry George does a terrific job at showing the horrors of what happened in Rwanda.

","Hotel Rwanda is a true story. Attempting to write a review of this movie seems pretty trivial, and can never do it justice. The bare facts are straightforward.<br/><br/>In 1994 in the central African state of Rwanda, approximately one million people, men, women, children and babies, were horrifically murdered by a savage and uncontrolled militia. It was an ethnic war, genocide, in which no one but a Rwandan could possibly have known who was who and why it was happening. The world stood by and let it happen. The foreigners and press fled, the UN did little. Amidst all the carnage and mayhem, one man, Paul Rusesabagina (marvellously portrayed by Cheadle), who had the very unheroic job of Assistant Hotel Manager, saved well over one thousand two hundred people from certain death by taking them into his hotel, and using his wits and his connections to keep the militia at bay and play one side off against the other, mostly with a combination of cash, booze and Cuban cigars. What started as an attempt to save just his own family, ended up in total heroism, and many, many people owe him their lives. The comparisons to Schindler's List are obvious.<br/><br/>What really surprised me, given the facts, is how little explicit gore there is in this movie, and I think it is a great credit to the film makers, that, by focusing on the emotions and relationships of the central characters, the movie accurately depicts the utter terror and desperation of the events, without forcing the audience to turn their heads from the screen in nausea. We are shown corpses, and the terror on the faces of innocent children, but little gut-wrenching special effects gore, thank god. This film is little short of a masterpiece and the performances are perfect. It should be compulsory viewing for everyone over the age of 14. I'm taking my teenagers next week."

","My 19-year old son and I saw this movie when it opened in New York.It's one of those stories, which is so powerful in fact that it need notlike so much of Hollywood's farebe over dramatized. Fortunately, director Terry George kept the storytelling simple and straightforward. As a result, the movie depicts the manager of the Hotel Milles Collines in Kigali, Rwanda, as a good man who rises to a state of grace under fire. <br/><br/>Early on, as ethnic tensions mount, there's a brief discussion about the ethnic differences between Rwanda's Tutsi and Hutu peoples. The physical differences are negligible. As one of the script lines says, ""They had to measure our noses to see if there was any difference."" But historically, the Belgian colonizers of this country selected some of the natives as colonial administrators, leaving the majority to do the their bidding. That's the difference.<br/><br/>As war breaks out, simple survival becomes a daily struggle. Hotel Manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle in his finest role to date) becomes an adept at sparing the war's refugees, lodged in his care after the Europeans visitors have been evacuated. While a few of the film's reviewers on this Board expressed disappointment over a perceived lack of drama, I'd argue they weren't watching or listening closely. The drama resides in the hotel manager's quality of thought and action, premeditating and improvising the stratagems that allow him and his wards to live another day. Stratagems of bribes, promises, favors owed and collected, words and deeds, which a book I once read termed ""the weapons of the weak."" Thank god, good people rise to the fore in the worst of circumstances, armed only with their wits and willing to pit them against guns and the men and boys who wield them.. <br/><br/>A long time ago, I heard an interview on the NPR show ""Fresh Air."" The guest described the ""ethnic differences"" between the peoples of the former Yugoslavia. Again the differences were negligible. But the guest noted, the racial distinctions were so similar that the different groupings (Bosnians, Croats and Serbs) often resorted to mutilation to eradicate the very appearance of similarity. <br/><br/>When Don Cheadle appeared as a guest on Jon Stewart's ""Daily Show,"" he noted it took 5 years for Terry George to raise the funding to make this film. Kudoes go out to him and (from the credits) the British, South African and Italian interests, which jointly invested in the production to bring this kind of story to light."

Each of the characters evolves as the movie develops. We see the superficial being peeled away to reveal the betrayed Paul, the impotent yet heroic UN captain and tens of other characters that will stay with you.<br/><br/>Don't go expecting to enjoy the movie rather go expecting to be moved deeply by it.

Whilst watching this film, the most important (but hurtful) emotional experience for me was the reliving of the pain I felt when I saw a documentary about Rwanda a few years ago. This movie really hurts - in a good way. But that will probably limit the business prospects. The good acting pulls you into it because you feel with the main characters.

","It's the most engrossing and engaging film in many years. Based on facts about the Rwandan genocide of the early 1990s, this film is heroic, dramatic, historical and burning with searing truths.<br/><br/>Now the story comes out for anyone to understand, the history behind the enmity between the Hutus and Tutsis, the two distinct African tribes of Rwanda. The story is told through the action of Kigali's 5 star hotel manager and his family. It is deeply moving, touching and fortunately the film spares the viewer of most of the war, though there are a few scenes that bring home the horrific facts.<br/><br/>There is very little of overt war and killing, it is in the background but not in front of the viewer very much. The story is about one man's heroism in the face of extreme adversity. The relationship between the protagonist and his wife is beautiful and real. The acting is transparent, it is so incredibly good that I felt I was watching the real thing.<br/><br/>In the early 1990s the civil war in Rwanda was well publicized in the press and the genocide became a world tragedy. HOTEL RWANDA gives us unforgettable insight and it is a film worthy of Best Picture, no doubt in my mind."

","I haven't gotten the chance of seeing ""The Aviator"" yet, but excluding that, ""Hotel Rwanda"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" are IMO, the two very best movies of 2004! Hotel Rwanda immediately took me in the very first 20 minutes of the film.. The passion Cheadle used in playing this role is remarkable, this being an understatement.. His strong performance only added on to the already amazing story of this tragic incident.. Playing as a Modern Day Harriet Tubman, his character took on a huge responsibility, caught between the rivalry of two tribes, He let some 1,000 people (give or take) take refuge in a Rwanda Hotel that he managed, and him being married to a member of the opposing tribe didn't make his situation any better.. me myself, being a young man, I am not ashamed to say that I cried a few times during my viewing, not only because of the circumstances of the situation, or not even because of the UN's part in this, But simply because Cheadles Character was Such a passionate man, such a strong man who had to make split decisions to protect a whole people, including his family.. The fact that this man really compromised, and cared about his people to an extent to which he did not see the difference in Tribes, they were all people, all African people who'm he felt obligated to protect.. The movie had very powerful scenes and messages, and is one of the most important movies since ""Rosewood"", Where Cheadle also played an important role.. Totally recommended, Rated R for emotional impact though, so beware.. this is one of my personal favorites, it seems as if 2004 has been a very great year for film..

","Don Chedal Is a great actor and he has done some phenomenal movies but none of them compare to this film about a Rwandan hotel manager who sheltered more than twelve hundred people during the massacres that happened in 1994.<br/><br/>I'll admit that I knew nothing about this event in history other than the fact that it happened. This film was an eye opener, a powerful look at one of the most devastating events in the history of the world. A dark part of the history of the world made worse by the apathy of the rest of the world. And how those who were being needlessly slaughtered where protected only by there own determination to survive and by the help of a few great men who risked everything to fight an impossible battle.<br/><br/>This is a film that should be not only experienced but remembered, it is something that could change you and how you view the world. This is a film that sends a message to all of us. We cannot simply ignore these atrocities, we cannot put our political and diplomatic agendas above the lives of innocent men women and children.

","I thought this film was fantastic. The directing wasn't perfect, but it was good enough. I like the script because it educated you about the conflict and provided some history to the two tribes. The background information made the movie all the more real, and put you in the middle of the situation. The only real weakness I saw was Nick Noltes performance as the conflicted general who was witnessing the atrocities but couldn't do anything about it. HIs performance was a bit clichÃ©. This movie may not have been technically perfect, but no movie has made me feel like this movie did, in a long time. And isn't that the point of a movie. To stir up emotion, to put you right there in the middle of the situation. This movie did that. And for that, I would give it best picture. Moroever, this is a topic that went ignored in the news media, therefore the American public is very uneducated about the situation.

","I just saw this movie, not knowing what to expect. I was absolutely blown away. This movie was well-acted, well-directed, and well-written- but even more importantly, it is a direct portrayal of true events. In reviews for this movie I have run across a few negative comments by the critics, and the main one has been that ""the movie is too much of a 'hero' piece,"" and to those critics I respond: yes! It is a hero piece! Paul Rusesabagina was a hero. But it wasn't just that. Nolte's character is a hero. And, even though these characters are seen as heroes in the film, they have their weaknesses. Cheadle's characterization of Rusesabagina is incredible; extremely strong, yet extremely human and emotional. This film is an amazing biography of a real man who lived through a real tragedy.<br/><br/>I admit I know very little of the facts on the genocide in Rwanda- and this is why I am thankful for a film like ""Hotel Rwanda"" to open my eyes to it. If there were one thing I would change about this movie, it would be to add MORE violence. It almost seems to me that the director skipped over the violence a bit to keep a pg-13 rating. It leaves the film a little lighter than it probably should have been, considering the immense gravity of the situation portrayed. Did you know that over 1 million people died in the fighting in Rwanda in 1994? To get a fuller idea of that 1 million people, this film should have been even grittier and more painful.<br/><br/>But, that aside, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is among the most realistic, painful, and amazing films I have seen. It wrenches the viewer's heart, to think of the injustices going on in our world. I would list ""Rwanda"" among 'life-changing' films, such as ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Passion of the Christ."" See this movie, and remember that it is all true. 10/10"

I must say that not only did Terry George and Don Cheadle effectively convey to movie-goers the sheer horror of these events, but they were also able to convey the sense that regardless of what was shown on the screen things were significant more horrific and troubling. This is a magnificent film not just because it depicts the deeds of a truly honorable and heroic individual, but also because the acting is outstanding and the script helps conjure up images that allow the movie-goer to momentarily experience the feeling of desperation and hopelessness of the Tutsi refugees."

","At a moment when the world is rallying to the cause of the Tsunami victims (and especially the developed countries), it is sobering to be reminded, as this film does so effectively, that the ENTIRE world averted its eyes 10 years ago when 800,000 innocent people were slaughtered in Rwanda 10 years ago. The desperate, unsought heroism of Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) is the foreground tale in ""Hotel Rwanda,"" and it is brilliantly and suspensefully told. But equally important is the background: abandonment of the Rwandan Tutsis by the Europeans, who sent troops to save only their own citizens, the United Nations whose soldiers (led in the film by Nick Nolte's anguished colonel) were forbidden to fire their weapons, and the United States whose euphemisms and evasions are recounted in the supposed radio interview of a State Department spokesperson. And, of course, the other African nations did in Rwanda what they are now doing in the Sudan -- nothing. This is possibly the most painful movie I've seen since ""The Pawnbroker"" of many decades past. It's hard to believe that this is the same Don Cheadle who played a homicidal maniac in ""Devil in a Blue Dress."" While most actors, even highly skilled actors, play versions of themselves in other films, Cheadle is an entirely different person here: dignified, highly intelligent, crafty, cool, emotional. It's a brilliant performance. One hopes that other major roles will be found for him. He deserves to be a household name. In addition to Nick Nolte, superb as the UN commander,credit must also be given to Sophie Okenedo as Rusesabagina's wife and to Fana Mokoena as Augustin Bizimungo, the corrupt head of the Rwandan Army who countenances the slaughter by the Hutu mob.

","In fact, just seeing the movie ""Hotel Rwanda"" will likely be one of the most stressful experiences you will have at the movies this new year. The movie chronicles heroic events that took place in 1994 in the midst of the horrors of attempted genocide. The hero of the movie, and of the actual events, is Paul Rusesabagina, played impressively by Don Cheadle. Paul is a manager at an upscale, Sabena-owned hotel who risks everything to save the lives of more than one thousand Tutsis. This is the group that was being butchered by the Hutu militia. It is estimated that a million or more Tutsis were killed in just a few months' time.<br/><br/>Prior to the outbreak of violence, we find Paul performing his regular duties as hotel manager. He gifts liberally to suppliers and military and others in power in order to guarantee that the hotel will be able to continue to fully serve its guests in the current climate. He also wants to know that he has friends in high places who will protect him and his family if trouble comes.<br/><br/>When the killing starts, Paul quickly learns that those he has cultivated in high places are not as dependable as he hoped. He and his family are in great danger after all. In addition, frightened friends and relatives turn to him for help. He initially resists but then allows them into the hotel while he uses all available resources to bargain with those that would do harm or would allow harm to be done. Soon orphans and others in fear for their lives come to his hotel for safety. Paul fights to save all those under his protection using every device he can imagine.<br/><br/>This obviously sounds like this year's ""Schindler's List"". However it is a much more difficult film to watch and it has some flaws. Initially, the film lacks sufficient exposition about the reasons for the warfare between the Hutus and Tutsis. There is a bit said about the origin of this class distinction in Rwanda and what it has led to. However, it was not nearly enough to keep us from wondering if we really understand the differences between the good guys and the bad guys. By the end of the movie, you'll probably figure it out, but that's a little late.<br/><br/>No question about the horrors that took place -- but this film forces us to endure cycle after cycle of promised escape that is undone by new violence. It is a bit too repetitive and hard to take. The film certainly does succeed in sharing with us the terrible atrocities that were committed in Rwanda. <br/><br/>See this ""Hotel Rwanda"" -- but steel yourself for the experience.

","First, the good. It was an inspirational film both in demonstrating the personal heroism and humanity of the reluctant heroes and the deep and abiding love between the hotel manager and his family.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film was apparently intended as a piece of political propaganda. Anyone familiar with the issues involved will find some of the points put forth by the film ridiculous and an insult to their intelligence.<br/><br/>The horror of war was, if anything, thoroughly sanitized. Over a million people were killed in the real war, and Kigali as the largest city was the center of much of the violence. Yet we see a few hundred corpses scattered about with no closeups, and few if any people actually being killed. This is not to demand a gore-fest, but if thousands were hacked to death by machete wielding tribesmen, why not grudgingly give into the reality and show how cruelly disgusting it was?<br/><br/>While the violence was clearly and overwhelmingly African on African, much of the moral outrage expressed in the movie is directed at the Europeans. And, of course, the Americans. As if it were our responsibility to save the Africans from themselves. Kipling would have been in full accord with the ""white man's burden"" concept underlying the moral themes of the movie. <br/><br/>This is furthered by an interesting piece of history presented on the origin of the Hutus and Tutsi. Guess who's fault all this is? Why, the Belgians of course. Never mind the fact that the area was originally held by the Twa who were conquered by the Hutus a thousand years ago and then taken over by the Tutsis probably 500 years ago, long before there were any Belgians around to muck things up. The film delivers the preposterous concept that all was love and Kumbaya until the Evil Europeans showed their faces and separated them intro tribes. Utter balderdash.<br/><br/>Then we have the UN. Forget the fact that UN peacekeeping forces on this planet have been found to be regularly engaged in the sex trade for children and common bribery. The UN troops in the movie are all Sir Galahad's from another planet, riding here and there to the rescue who's sole problem is that they are hopelessly outnumbered. I practically expected a ""Donate the the UN Support Group"" phone bank number to flash on the screen every time Nolte appeared. <br/><br/>While there is plenty of moral bashing against Europe and America there is no attempt whatsoever to ask the counterpoint -- why should it have been the responsibility of Europe and America to intervene in the middle of a massive tribal war? One can debate the point, and certainly good people can draw conclusions on either side of this issue. But the issue is simply never raised. It's all about how cowardly America and the French are for not sending in the Marines. And now that you mention it, why America and not China, Egypt, South Africa, Japan, Russia, or Germany? Belgium may have had historic interests there by certainly the US never had African colonies. How did we somehow become part of the select group of the guilty?<br/><br/>Overall, it was worth seeing, but only if you open your eyes and see the baloney sandwich you are being served, and hold your nose when you smell it.

Why should we give away our tax money to our armies to protect them, if we don't get anything out of it? Don Cheadle is really good in his part as the hotel manager, risking both his own life and the life of his family to save people of another ""race"". Nick Nolte makes another ""Nick Nolte"". The story is strong, but the best thing about it, is that you come to think about certain mechanisms, which seems to be stronger than the compassion you might find in yourself."

","I'm extremely surprised to find that this film is currently #51 in the best 250 films. People don't seem to understand that it is BASED on a true story. Just because it is about something terrible that happened, people instantly change their criteria for what makes a good film. At the end of the day, this film is still poorly directed; has poorly delivered, cringe-worthy dialogue; some kind of product placement in every other scene; two dimensional characters; glosses over the genocide by only referring to it and never actually showing anyone getting killed; has gaping plot holes; and for some reason tries to put the blame of what happened on the Europe and America. Surely, that should be enough to make anyone think a movie is terrible..."

","This movie has some good moments, but it's mostly spoiled by the constant hammering home of the message: the West is racist because it didn't stop the massacres. If you accept this premise, then you'll probably find the film moving and meaningful; if you don't, then you may find it manipulative and rather shallow. Don Cheadle's performance is very good, and there are several moments of real tension, but I couldn't stop feeling that almost everything in the movie was designed to bludgeon the viewer and provoke guilt. As for me, I don't think France should be the policeman for the world, and neither should the United States. I see no reason that a boy from Kansas should have to die in Africa, Iraq, or any other place in order to make it safer for its own inhabitants."

The real Rwandan couple lives in Belgium now.<br/><br/>2.Parallel Linkages: The movie has two parallel linkages:- <br/><br/>a. It is linked thematically to mainstream cinema movies which are on the specific themes of politico/military conflicts......where UN peace keeping forces were employed to restore peace. Other movies include Beyond No borders (Bosnia, Cambodia etc issue),Black Hawk Down(Pakistani/UN forces operating in Somalia) and Blood Diamond(Sierra Leon).<br/><br/>b. Also there are few ""conflict"" based movies in which the main characters use their influence and a ""place"" (factory/school/hotel) to help and save the lives of helpless people trapped in conflict. Three movies are particularly notable and Hotel Rwanda is one of them.<br/><br/>Firstly,In ""Schindler's List (1993)"", lead character Oskar Schindler uses his ""factory"" during WW-II to save Jews from becoming victims of Holocaust.<br/><br/>In ""Hotel Rwanda""(2004) ; lead character Paul Rusesabagina uses his ""hotel"" to save lives of children and people of Tulsi tribe from atrocities of Hutu tribe.<br/><br/>In ""Miral""(2010) ; lead character Hind Husseini, a lady operating a school Dar Al-Tifel in Palestine uses her ""school"" to protect and educate Palestinian orphan children. <br/><br/>All the above three movies are based on ""real life characters"".<br/><br/>3.

"johnnyboyz","7","1","2","13 April 2009"," Solid and quite frightening at times recounting of a desperate situation in 1994 Rwanda.
","One of the more common reactions to have in regards to a tragic, real life event played out on screen is one of great sadness – it's just a reactionary thing that something so horrible is even capable of happening to people who just don't deserve it. Hotel Rwanda is a film that is able to produce these sorts of reactions, but also feelings on a level of suspense and horror as certain scenes and situations play out involving people we have come to be quite fond of. The film is more of a re-telling of certain events than it is a study of anything in particular, although the protagonist of the hour does possess characteristics of great honour and courage at a time of need. In truth, Hotel Rwanda does feel a little bit stagey at times while at others, feels made for television. You do, also, feel as if you're being chastised as a Westerner – that something as horrific as this happened and you let it happen; but the film mostly offers positive vibes.<br/><br/>The hotel in Rwanda of which the title refers to is one owned by a certain Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle), a harmless but rich and quite successful Rwandan living with his harmless and equally rich family. He has a wife named Tatiana (Okonedo) and a few children. He runs a hotel and takes care of his employees as well as his family in good measure. Importing goods and taking care of those that need taking care of are the run of the norm and these things are the most he has to concern himself with. But that is about to change. The film breaks away from this supposedly 'idyillac' set up for a turf-war of sorts between rival tribes, named the Hutu and Tutsi, that goes back many years; although by the mid point, you feel the tribesmen are unconcerned with whatever legacy they're fighting for and just enjoy chopping up some other people, such is the manner in which the history and details of the rivalry is developed.<br/><br/>No matter, we're not here for a history lesson from yonder-century; we're here for a history lesson from yonder-decade, 1994 in fact. One thing leads to another and Rusesabagina's hotel quickly becomes Schindler's factory when push, not so much turns to shove, as it does cold-blooded execution by way of machete. Most of the locals not interested in the bloodshed want in, and it's Paul's duty to save as many as possible as the 'guest' list totes up. But can he save all these people and take care of his family? What about supplies? What happens if/when the U.N. pull out? All this occurs as the rest of the world look on, and Canadian U.N. higher-up Colonel Oliver (Nolte) pauses for thought now and again as well as pulling his gun from his holster and waving it around at times of supposed urgency.<br/><br/>Paul himself is a Tutsi and the early warning signs occur when he, in the passenger seat of a harmless van transporting him to his home, has a run in with a Hutu before the bulk of the bloodshed has begun. The warning and the hatred is planted in a fairly well done manner and it's all fine because later on, things will get really hairy. Like I said, the film is a re-telling of events more than it is a true study of anything. Paul is established to be this above-ordinary Rwandan living a life that 95% of Rwandans don't have the luxury of living; he has a wife and child and there's a lot of grief before the nice, clean hero is put through a grinder and we're all supposed to go 'Oh No! I hope no harm comes to him!' It's fine, but it's unspectacular and it doesn't really matter if the backdrop is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide; the Holocaust or some made up event a hundred years in the future when aliens come to Earth and enslave us.<br/><br/>What the film does do, in some retrospect, is demonstrate what people are willing to do in times of great distress. If Paul is willing to allow people into his hotel for safety and stay behind with the others deemed doomed when certain people have to pull out, then that is that but on the flip side there's a lot of greed in the film; a sense that 'sure, we'll help you out' but always for a price – a sort of 'what's in it for us?' mentality that the film sort of captures. But Hotel Rwanda is a very respectful and, on the broader sense of things, important film that will remind many people in the West of the situation that happened; a Western world that, as the film so very clearly points out, contributed hardly anything to, bar pull their own people out thus saving their own skins. If the film's overall goal was to recount the event that happened at that time then it succeeds and that is worthy enough of certain praise."

","This was a decent movie, with a really good story that people need to be aware of, but the screenplay and the technical quality of the movie is quite average, maybe below average.<br/><br/>This movie is a joke really, to be considered for awards when you consider it's terrible blue- screen scenes that are nearly Saturday Night Live quality, sets that are so low quality you can almost swear it's the same set that Let's Make a Deal was shot-on earlier in the day. Then there's how the plot is so painfully obvious after the first 10 minutes of blue-screen work. Like the ill-fated UN caravan ""saving"" a list of people that was carrying Don Cheadles family; obviously this was doomed from the beginning! Then you couldn't have the ""Family Jumping off the Roof"" scene that was so ineptly setup. <br/><br/>Cheadle, as usual does a terrific job, so what's new? Does this a great movie make? GIVE ME A BREAK. This movie borders on the verge of being a ""B"" movie it has so many problems, but because it's about an important topic everyone is SCARED of giving it a proper review. On a level of topical importance the movie is off-the-charts, but I'm sorry people, that's what documentaries are made for. I give the movie a 7 and not a six because it did do a good job of providing a personal and a national story at the same time, which is usually not done very well with most movies that try to achieve telling a story of such magnitude. But let's get this straight, this film is no ""Welcome to Sarajevo"", ""No Man's Land"", or ""The Killing Fields."""
"atwarwiththebarmyarmy","6","1","2","5 August 2006"," An horrendous, yet ultimately heartening story. The film doesn't do it justice.
","I hate to criticise this film. It's one of those movies you feel you ought to like, because of the subject - Paul Rusesabagina's story needed to be told, a tragic, desperate story, but also a story of remarkable strength.<br/><br/>Sadly, it seems that Terry George felt that the story would carry the film on its own. It doesn't. The screenplay is far too earnest - as if Messrs. Keirson and George believed we'd all be incapable of understanding what was going on. The direction is unimaginative (George does not have much experience as a director, and it shows). And both the character and performance of Nick Nolte are dismal.<br/><br/>There is a lot of scope for a genuinely vital film here, and it has its moments, but on the whole it comes out as a substantial disappointment. Comparisons with Schindler's List are obvious - and unfortunately, they show this film up for what it is. None of the energy, none of the inspiration, and thus, none of the power of Spielberg's film.<br/><br/>If you've been completely unaware of what happened in 1994, Hotel Rwanda is an honest introduction. But otherwise, it's a let down. There must be better studies of the horrific tragedy than this."
"Exiled_Archangel","10","1","2","23 June 2006"," The best English spoken movie I've seen so far
","Personally, I try not to watch anything made or even touched by Hollywood, or anything that could be considered mainstream, as I feel that would constitute the utmost treachery against the art of cinema. With such a sentiment, I end up staying away from most English spoken movies, unless synchronous recommendations come from a dozen or more people whose tastes I trust. This time it was different, I had to watch this movie for a Mass Media & Communication course project on globalization. Boy, I'll remember this professor with positive feelings until my last breath, because he made me watch this film! I would have never watched it otherwise, the sole reason being the spoken language, and now I think I'd have missed A LOT. I've seen a few other excellent English spoken films (American, British, or else), but this one outsmarts them all, by far too! <br/><br/>I had to come to IMDb and verify that the main actor isn't the actual person who experienced all this. Strangely enough, he hasn't even experienced any incident as such (most likely?), but his acting was so flawless that I even thought he could have been the real ""hero"" of the story. Are the others doing a weaker job? Hell no! Every single detail is simply perfect about the movie. I didn't see anything wrong even with the smallest roles, for example the soldier guys shooting around. The script stays true to the original as well, the soundtrack is perfect, the settings are well put, everything is just great!<br/><br/>Considering the topic the movie revolves around, it could very well have ended up being overly political. But that's also taken care of; the movie has a plentiful load of content that gives direct political messages, but in spite of the abundance and might of such, it doesn't drown the plot. Speaking of which, the plot encompasses an engrossing thriller, an astounding drama, and a heart-aching pile of romance, all embroidered with epic motives.<br/><br/>There must be more movies like this, holding the looking glass on the dirty deeds carried out by seemingly innocent corporate entities. Witnessing the consequential atrocities as such, triggered by the work of earlier missionaries, who supposedly went over to Africa (and to other destinations) to teach them civilization (whatever that is), I guess it's safe to assume that no one is anywhere as innocent as they seem.<br/><br/>The movie itself with its art and story, its political messages, the soundtrack, everything is wonderful. A well-deserved 10/10 from me.<br/><br/>Please go see this movie if you haven't already!"

"DeeNine-2","10","1","2","2 May 2006"," Well-told story of genocide in our time
","Paul Rusesabagina is Hutu. We see the word on his passport. His wife is Tutsi. She is in mortal danger. But Paul doesn't realize it yet. He believes that the violence threatened by the ruling Hutu against the once ruling Tutsi in Rwanda will not happen because the UN peacekeepers will not allow it, nor will the world stand by and watch the slaughter.<br/><br/>Paul manages a luxury hotel. He is a worldly-wise, efficient, suavely diplomatic man who dresses impeccably and who knows how to influence people with well-chosen gifts and flattery. His demeanor is calm and measured. He tells his driver that to give a government official or some other important person ten thousand francs is not as effective as giving him a rare Cuban cigar worth the same amount.<br/><br/>He visits a supplier to gain supplies for the hotel. While he is there a crate containing hundreds of machetes overturns. He is told they come from China at a cost of ten cents each and can be sold for many times that amount.<br/><br/>This is the first hint of the horror to come, and the way it is revealed is characteristic of director Terry George's calculated method. He has a story of genocide to tell, a story of criminal neglect by the West, especially by the United States under President Clinton who stood aside and allowed the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people to take place, as did the rest of the world through the UN. The next hint comes from government radio in which the Tutsi people are referred to as ""cockroaches."" This is most chilling because when one tribe or nation sets out to kill the people of another tribe or nation the essential element is to turn those people into something less than humans. The psychological trick is to make the killers believe they are killing vermin. One cannot help but recall the Nazi propaganda machine and its methods prior to and during the Holocaust.<br/><br/>Next we see in a scene at the hotel bar that it is really impossible to tell by appearance the difference between two young women, one Tutsi and the other Hutu. The Tutsi are said to be tall and to look down their noses at the Hutu who are said to be shorter and perhaps darker, but this is clearly a fiction. Even so, racial differences are invented and racism is inculcated into the mass mind. All of this is necessary because the slaughter is to take place using not bullets or gas chambers, but instead the cheap machetes from China. To get armies of young men to kill their neighbors and fellow countrymen, women and children with machetes requires the stirring up of a mass hatred of epic proportion and demonic intensity.<br/><br/>The personal story itself within this greater scenario is that of Paul and his family and how he was persuaded by a moral imperative that he himself felt to save hundreds of Tutsi by housing them in the luxury hotel he managed after the Europeans left. We see how he risked his life and family and how his courage and resourcefulness proved heroic. Terry George tells the story in a straightforward manner with vivid and deliberate detail. In particular there are scenes of carnage on a vast scale, including the chilling horror of the nighttime bumpy ride along the ""river road"" which was said by George Rutaganda, a sadistic man, to be ""open"" and the preferred route to take back to the hotel. The bumps in the road were the bodies of recently slaughtered Tutsi that the hotel van could not help but drive over.<br/><br/>The acting by Don Cheadle as Paul and by Sophie Okonedo who played his wife is outstanding. Nick Notle is effective in the role of a compromised and nearly helpless UN commander.<br/><br/>This is a message film. The message goes out to the whole world, and Terry George makes us understand that those people who were slaughtered could be people anywhere, in particular they could be middle class Americans or Europeans. He indicates that Western prejudice against black Africans in part allowed the slaughter to take place. By showing us the ordinary domestic life of Paul and his family at home, their love and affection for one another--their familiar humanity--we are made to share this horrific human tragedy and to realize that we could have prevented it had we only known or cared enough.<br/><br/>Will we care enough next time?--and there will be a next time, and a time after that and then another until such a day comes when the rule of law prevails internationally and people everywhere understand that we are all essentially the same and that the baser nature of our leaders must be controlled by law and justice.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

","'Hotel Rwanda' is a docu-drama about one of the most shameful events in modern history. It is about the genocide in Rwanda, that happened only one decade ago, and the hard questions that need to be asked about how this was possible, and why governments and international organizations did not succeed in preventing it should haunt the minds of the politicians and of any decent person on earth.<br/><br/>Still, this film is more about the human aspects of the conflict. As in 'Schindler's List', the action focuses on one episode figuring one noble figure of a real human, who succeeds to make a difference by saving innocent lives. Beautifully acted by Don Cheadle, the main character endangers his own life, and the security of his family, just because as a human he cannot behave differently. If we can be appalled by the dimensions of the Rwandian tragedy and the lack of humanity of the perpetrators of the crimes, the message of the film is basically optimistic, showing that human dignity not only survives in our cruel world of today, but also can succeed, can make a difference. If only all humans would behave like this ...<br/><br/>I do not believe that this film is great cinema, but it is important, and it must have been made. It features some good acting from actors like Nick Nolte and Joachim Phoenix, but its value lays in having told the story, in a direct and fluent manner. Because of it, less people can pretend that they did not know that this horrible events happened now, in our contemporary times."
"Ysman","7","1","2","4 November 2005"," The worst good movie I have ever seen
","So I finally get around to seeing Hotel Rwanda. A friend and I had a long standing engagement to get out and see this film however the forces that control these things conspired against that happening and as all movies eventually do, even good ones starring Don Cheadle, Hotel Rwanda left the theater. My friend and I would have to view something else.<br/><br/>As luck and fate would have it, Hollywood studios like to make as much money as they can on any given film and so they released Hotel Rwanda to DVD which allows viewing movies outside of the theater in your own home or place of convenience (forgive me if I am going to fast.) As I have a Netflix account and in that account I have a queue of movies, Hotel Rwanda was sent to me without me having to do anymore than point and/or click. Since it was sent, I felt obligated to watch - a fact that my wife hates by the way - while she has no problem stopping watching films already in progress, I, by some freak genetic mutation, must watch them to their painful end regardless of how long or asinine - much like the South Park episode where Cartman had to finish singing Come Sail Away whenever he heard the beginning of the song . . . but I digress.<br/><br/>For those not familiar: Hotel Rwanda stars Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who housed over a thousand Tutsis refugees during their struggle against the Hutu militia in Rwanda. The audience watches Paul's transformation from a man with style to a man with substance. (see the film - the quote makes more sense then.) So I watched IT - and here you are, dear reader, wondering how IT was. How do you think it was? Of course it was good, fine, Oscar nominated and all that. The story was heartfelt, Cheadle was stellar, impeccably shot. Heck, even the sound was good. And therein lies my problem - the film was all that I expected it to be and thus as I sit here thinking about it, I am terribly bored by it.<br/><br/>How horrible! I am an unfeeling boob! He should be gutted and hung in a public square to remind little children on how not to live their lives! And to all of these things I would say yes, yes, and yes again. But that doesn't make Hotel Rwanda any better at entertaining me (a funny side note, the aforementioned friend, myself, and my wife all went to see Amistad one evening and were so bored by the slave trade film that we fell asleep which incensed our more social conscious audience members.) The problem is that Hotel Rwanda is so paint-by-the-numbers Oscar caliber that I wanted terribly for some Sofia Coppola-esquire Godfather 3 performance or some random death to shake me from my stupor. I took to the Internet to see if I was alone in my thoughts. Here are some quotes from the IMDb: <br/><br/>larajane says: Watching with a friend, after ten minutes we had to pause the film because we decided we would be better served if we were more informed about what the basic facts of the conflict in Rwanda were. So to my shame, we had to read on the internet about what really happened, before we could continue. I say shame because we should have known, both of us were of an age when it happened to have taken more of an interest in world politics.<br/><br/>and this from Julie-Gefter: i am frustrated because nothing i can type can represent how powerful this movie is or how much it moved me. i can't comment on the amazing acting or cinematography or directing because the movie transported me.<br/><br/>and celiaricky loved the movie so much she ""ovated"" the director for 10 minutes - the lucky scoundrel: Just saw the San Francisco premier last night and it isn't a dramatization - it's much more of a documentary -- Hotel is extremely factual. CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS FILM! INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE! The Director and the story's protagonist were at the screening to answer questions. We ovated him for almost 10 minutes.<br/><br/>So there you have it - Hotel Rwanda was a good movie - a great movie by most accounts - that, I'd be willing to say if 'tweren't based on true facts would have been a nice little HBO original film. Cheadle is greatness - but watch Boogie Nights or Devil in a Blue Dress for a more impressive performance. And to all IMDb readers - I'm sorry I suck.<br/><br/>Movie notes: Hotel Rwanda is 121 minutes long and rated PG-13 for brief strong language, Oscar worthy depictions of human atrocities, and disturbing images. Directed by Terry George who has brought you other true life moving experiences such as A Bright Shinning Lie and the second episode of season one of the District. It stars Don Cheadle who is good in everything he does, on and off camera."

","I have no doubt in my mind that there isn't a single human being alive today that wouldn't do anything and I mean ANYTHING for his or her family. What this film highlights, IMHO, is that one of our biggest problems as a race is that we all have different definitions as to what our ""family"" entails. Some see it as those in their home, some as those in their country, some as from their own ideology, some as from their own religion, some as just themselves.<br/><br/>Think about what you consider to be your ""family"" and watch Hotel Rwanda.<br/><br/>That this movie did not win an Oscar is blatant proof of the theme running throughout its own storyline - the ""West"" plain and simple does not care. Apparently stories about a singer, a reclusive millionaire and a fictional female boxer are more important than that of Paul Rusesabagina, a real-life hero placed in an impossible situation by unthinkable circumstances.<br/><br/>To get an idea of the plot, think of a cross between Cry Freedom and Schindler's List. It may also help to bone up on Rwanda's young political history beforehand, though the dialog does much to quickly bring you up to speed.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle could very well become this generation's Sidney Poitier. The message of this film reaches out and grabs you by the scruff of the neck, not least on the strength of his talent.<br/><br/>Oftentimes a true story can be jazzed up a bit for the big screen, as I'm sure this, Ray and The Aviator were, in their own ways. Nonetheless, you would need a heart of pure stone not to be moved by Paul's turmoil after making his decision when chasing the truck.<br/><br/>There are very strong performances in support by Sophie Okonedo and Nick Nolte; even Joaquin Phoenix and Jean Reno accepted small roles in the hope that their names may inspire more to watch.

","I went and saw Hotel Rwanda recently. It was one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen in my life. It was so powerful, inspiring, and well done. Don Chedale acted amazingly as Paul, a hotel manager who saves hundreds of people from genocide in 1994. Don is on screen in just about every minute of this fabulous film, and each scene is acted with strength and emotion, and the fact that he was on in almost every scene while doing such an incredible job was alone enough to give Don a best actor bid at the Oscars. Jamie Foxx was great and deserved this award. While many, including me, might find this film disturbing, it really is uplifting at the same time, to see how one man can truly make a difference. This should have been in the Best Picture category, and I don't know why it is not. Great movie, I recommend it to any true movie fan. Rating-10/10 A!"

","Hotel Rwanda like any film of its kind, dealing with such huge subject matter (the slaughter of millions of Rwanda's people) has chosen to focus in on one story and use the human angle to explore the larger picture. So we have the story of one hotel manager who by saving his own family inadvertently becomes touched by the plight of many and turns the hotel into a kind of make shift refuge camp for the thousands fleeing the onslaught. Based on a true story the film is a classic one mans struggle against the inevitable with death the only other option if he fails in his plight. The film is well directed, scored and acted (special nod to Don Cheadle and the British actress playing his wife) my only criticism is that by giving the film a 15 certificate it almost dumbs down on the slaughter, not that I want to see loads of violence, but the bit we do see is so tame it never really has that much of an impact on you. It felt like a slap to the face when it should have been a hammer to the head. Saying that the story is still a harrowing one and not an easy thing to watch especially when you know it was the west who left those people to die. This like Schindlers list, Saving Private Ryan etc should be shown in schools a bitter reminder of history that should never be repeated."

","Hotel Rwanda is a powerful drama which invokes strong emotions on the atrocities committed in Rwanda in 1994 which the international community turned it's back on and ignored. It serves as a reminder to viewers not to take racial harmony for granted and to work towards preserving racial harmony as once it is out of hand, it can have a cataclysmic effect on the stability of a country.<br/><br/>The movie cast is top rate especially Don Cheadle who is truly inspiring in his role. The character (Paul Rusasabagina) he plays is a good role model. To me, he is the Best Actor and this is the Best Movie.<br/><br/>The movie has also brought the spotlight to Africa which urgently needs the attention of the international community to mediate in it's civil strife and to lift the entire continent out of poverty. I hope ""Hotel Rwanda"" will help renew interest in Africa and that governments worldwide will come forward to render their hand to prevent conflicts and other social problems from escalating further."

","Yesterday evening I saw ""Hotel Rwanda"" in theater. I had already heard great things about it, and after a while I was already expecting a bit too much of it, but when I saw it, it fulfilled all my expectations. I'm not the emotional type, but during this movie, I got tears in my eyes several times. Don Cheadle stars as Paul Rusesabanginan, it's his best performance in years! This was the role he was born for. I've also seen Ray and The Aviator and I have to admit, Ray was great, but when you compare Jamie Foxx with Don Cheadle's performance I don't understand why Cheadle missed the Oscar for best leading actor!

I was enthralled by the events and desperately wanted to know what happened to all the people in it. The film managed to portray the dilemmas and agonising decisions faced by the people involved with sympathy and understanding.

","Hotel Rwanda depicts the Rwandan Massacre of 1994. This film accurately shows us the inhumanity of this event in world history. The performances are to be praised. Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo are breathtaking, their performances engage us in the film.<br/><br/>The most important thing about this movie is the awareness that it creates in those who watch it and who did not know about the crisis in Rwanda. It opens up with the line, "" For your consideration"", because that is what the director is trying to do; inform us about this terrible event. I was too young at the time of this injustice, and watching this movie has made me realize how cruel this world can be. This film should be remembered as a triumph.<br/><br/>It's such a compelling story and I agree with some of the other reviewers in that it seemed like a documentary due to the realism of the film.

","After watching this movie the only thing really there to do is to applause the performances given by the actors. Don Cheadle gives the defining performance of his career and support from Djimon Hounsuo, Nick Nolte, Sophie Okenedo, and Joaquin Pheonix set this film's acting on a new level. The plot though is just not as emotional as it should have been. Every point were a gut wrenching powerful scene should have occurred this movie takes the quicker thrill route which does make the movie seem just empty at points. Luckily every scene were this is evident there are amazing actors around to back it up and keep the film going on. That is what really makes this movie worth the price of admission or rental is just to see these sensational performances. Though Nick Nolte really doesn't do anything for the film (as usual), his acting style does add a good feeling towards the films character analysis. The best part is watching Don Cheadle's character age and alter during the entire film. I highly recommend you jump out of your seat and head to your local theater as soon as possible. The acting in this film is just mesmerizing and the script is well designed for your average every day movie goer."
"pepperbendix","10","1","2","30 January 2005"," Hutus, Tutsis, Serbs, and Croats
","1993 -- Milisovec and his genocide programs bring tears to the world's eyes. Cries for US involvement mount as the Croat and Muslim victims of Milosivec are given increasingly human faces by US media. Looking at the faces, a single frightening thought strikes many of us at once. The Serbs are trying to exact the ultimate penalty from the Croats who they consider lower in God's food chain than cockroaches. Yet, to our eyes, the two ""races"" are indistinguishable. Still, as heartbreaking as this is, it took years for us to actually take action.<br/><br/>Now, take these same faces, paint them black, and put them in a part of French North Africa with which the English-speaking press and the US has little familiarity in a country whose name is spelled strangely. The Genocide is being implemented at a rate comparable to the recent tsunami. This is scary stuff, and we have no natural side and no history. Tutsi? Hutu? We can't tell the difference between them, and we don't care. Is this genocide or just more tribal warfare in Africa? Some Blacks killing some other blacks. Why would this be the business of the US? This is much closer the Killing Fields than it is Schindler's List in terms of the West's abandonment being central to how it played out. The Tutsi's were scapegoated and slaughtered so quickly, it was easiest to simply right off our losses and live to die another day. Small but powerful bits are contributed by the sincere-yet-ineffective Colonel played by Nolte and the wise-guy-macho newsman Jack played as appropriately impertinent by Joaquin Phoeenix. <br/><br/>Don Cheadle certainly we worked hard for the nomination. He is in practically every seen and the movie moves on his energy. <br/><br/>Sophie Okodengo matched him scene for scene in honesty, confronting torture, and summoning up one final breath when the brain is working as a slow trickle at best, hope had all but died, and you can't remember when you last slept. I think she is magnificent and will win a must-deserved Best Supporting Actress Oscar even though she's a relative unknown.<br/><br/>Cheadle's performance is the best lead in an historical drama since Paul Scofield essayed Sir Thomas Moore in A Man For All Seasons -- which in turn was the best ever. And, Cheadle's assignment was even harder in many ways. He needed to blend an everyman-side with his heroically extraordinary conscience side with a con-man side, then expertly add in impeccable timing with whistling-past-the graveyard humor and dashes of theater of the absurd. One additional thing I'd like to underscore is that Cheadle's Paul is NOT everyman. He has extraordinary intelligent, and excellent facility with people and intermarried and intermingles among tribes freely and openly in a society that had never truly accepted such boldness. But, he tries to deal with most people with the humility of an everyman because he understands it is the best way to be.<br/><br/>Unfortunastely, Academy dynamics being what they are, it is most likely that Okodengo's Oscar will have to serve for both of them, because it's Clint Eastwood's year (forget DiCaprio). And, like Joaquin Phoenix's Jack at the bar, Academy voters will have trouble not confusing Don Cheadle with Jamie Foxx. I don't mean this as a specific knock at the Academy. It is simply the nature of this particular beast.<br/><br/>Terry George already entered the recesses of truth within my breast and my brain with In The Name Of The Father. That marvelous film also dealt with injustices and holy wars promulgated in the name of irrational fear and hatred masquerading as patriotism. He illustrates here how he can immerse himself in the brutal realities of the unfortunate with even greater singlemindedness to create an even higher-quality movie. <br/><br/>As others mentioned, he also did a great job conveying the horror of the atrocities occurring without assaulting our senses with violence as Gibson did in the Last Temptation of The Christ. The scene where it dawns (quite literally) on Cheadle why George directed him, ""Take the River Road; it's clear"" conveys more horror and sorrow in its way while still managing to spare the audience its dignity. The movie also did a good job of demonstrating that seldom do the people who wind up being the perpetrators of unconscionable acts look or act like monsters when we meet them. The dynamics of the situation take a life of their own and suddenly transform otherwise good people into committing monstrous acts.<br/><br/>Most Highly Recommended: 10 out of 10."

A brilliant job capturing, on a personal level, the horror of the events (although, from what I understand, the horror was actually far worse than what we see in the film).

"meer123","Null","1","2","8 January 2005"," What will Bill Clinton think?
","This film, appearing roughly 10 years following the genocide in Rwanda, has important implications for anyone interested in international affairs today. Among other themes, it portrays the West's schizophrenic attitude toward what was happening in the country accurately through the characters played by Nick Nolte (Colonel Olivier), and Joaquin Phoenix (Jack). As others have written, Don Cheadle's complex acting performance as the manager for Sabena's flagship hotel turned refugee camp in the capital city Kigali, is both sensitive and powerful. But the real question here is: how many Americans will want to see a film about this subject? If more people do, it would decrease the possibility of the next potential genocide being disregarded as ""not involving US strategic interests."" One wonders what (former) President Bill Clinton will think when HE sees Hotel Rwanda, knowing what his role in history might have been had he and other world leaders acted to forestall the killing in time.<br/><br/>The film necessarily omits lots of things related to actual history, such as the neighbor-on- neighbor group psychosis that produced the vast amount of physical and psychic damage in the country. And the oversimplifications concerning the history of inter ethnic violence in the Great Lakes region is unfortunate but understandable. <br/><br/>However, on the balance the film will bring many viewers to the issue for the first time, and will help them understand why the challenges facing Rwanda in 2005 concerning national reconciliation and justice remain tragically elusive. In an age when we expect pushbutton answers to Tsunamis and genocide, this film shows why some problems take time, energy and tremendous creativity to solve. This is a very good thing.<br/><br/>See this film, and tell others to see it. Bravo to writer/director Terry George and writer Keir Pearson for making it. Just don't take the little ones -- while the actual blood and gore is kept to a minimum, the PG-13 rating is very generous, considering the general subject matter."

","I generally do not enjoy films that, in essence, put the moviegoer in the auspicious position of being heartless if they do not empathize with the main characters or the story. This film is one of my few exceptions to that rule, and it is impressive through every frame. The story is inherently dramatic, played out like a chess game with meticulous pacing and an Oscar-worthy portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina by Don Cheadle. The slight flaws in the film I can attribute to cultural differences which may cause certain scenes in the film to seem flawed based on my understanding of the Rwandan culture. Overall, it is an emotionally moving portrait of the Tutsi uprising and the struggle of Paul Rusesabagina to save his family and the lives of both the Tutsi and Hutu whom he had come to love as his own family.<br/><br/>9/10."

His accent, his emotions, his courage and integrity were impeccably executed.

Like another who reviewed this film our screening was also graced with the presence of Terry George and the man himself Paul R. I wish this film could be seen in every high school in the country. It is a reminder of humanity and how we can so easily lose it; as well as being a very engrossing story and film. <br/><br/>It's well done all the way around. Some I guess, may be scared away by the darkness of the story, but I hope that won't happen. The viewer gets much more than just the negative portraits of the genocide happening around the hotel. It has a lovely relationship with Paul and his wife and family, definitely some humor, and a total sense of it's time and place-- including the oasis of the hotel. A poster mentioned the line ""the world would watch and then go back the their dinner"" (or there abouts.)<br/><br/>The director mentioned that line in particular in our Q&A. It's not in the American version of this film. Joaquin Phoenix implies it, but it is not said directly.

","Riveting and compelling, this true story will challenge your heart and mind. If you didn't know it was a true story, and if history had not recorded the events of the Rwandan massacre of hundreds of thousands of people in a conflict between the Hutus and Tutsis (the blurry difference between which is expounded in a most creative way in the film), you might not believe what you see in the film. The story of Paul Rusesabagina's (Don Cheadle) reluctant courage is also true. Paul is the Hutu manager of the Belgian-owned Milles Collines hotel in Kilgali, Rwanda at the time of the Hutu uprising against the Tutsi ruling minority in 1994. In the film, we see just enough of the conflict to sense the impending massacre and attempted genocide of the entire Tutsi population by these radical Hutu militia. In an effort to save the lives of his own Tutsi wife and those of his mixed children, Paul ends up protecting hundreds of people who seek refuge in the hotel once all the Western guests have fled. Interestingly, any sense of condemnation in the film is focused on the West's complacency and complicity in the massacre and bloodshed that ensued when the UN and Western powers decided not to intervene in this first post Cold War ethnic conflict. Rating: 9 out of 10. After you see it, tell your friends Â– this film deserves to be seen."

","When I first heard about this movie I was very excited. Critics were comparing it to Schindler's List, which excited me further. But when I got to theater I realised that Hotel Rwanda was rated PG-13. I instantly knew it was going to suck. Generally, when you make a movie about a mass genocide in which nearly a million people died, your movie is going to be rated R at the very least due to massive amounts of blood and violence. Hotel Rwanda had nothing of the sort. The only time people actually got killed in the movie was when the family which the movie follows are huddled around a TV watching the news which portrays people being hacked by machetes from about 100 yards away. The rest of the movie featured people coming very close to death, but never actually getting killed. If you knew nothing about the mass genocide in Rwanda, and saw this movie, you would assume it consisted of a bunch of nancy boys running around not killing people. There is no blood in this movie at all. Comparing it to Schindler's List is like comparing Evil Dead to Legally Blonde - blasphemy. If you liked this movie then you are a mindless robot programmed by Hollywood to shell out eight bucks every time another blockbuster bore-a-thon comes along."

How film makers can create a film either by not carrying out their full research of a subject, or, even worse, by ignoring the stories of the victims themselves is deplorable, incompetent and extremely insulting to audiences and victims of the so-called 'true story' in question. The lack of integrity and shrewdness of the film makers and the profiteering techniques employed indirectly endorse the actions of their heroic war-criminal. It is no 'true story'!

","I was disappointed in every aspect of this movie. The events that were supposedly depicted, including the background of genocide in Rwanda, were insipidly portrayed, pure Hollywoood hokum. The casting was mediocre, especially Nick Nolte, but also including most of the smaller parts, although Don Cheadle and his wife were portrayed competently. It was an obvious attempt to take a single series of events--the actions of this hotel manager--and parlay them into a typical movie format, when the Rwandan genocide deserved, indeed deserves, much more significant treatment. The one redeeming feature of the film was its portrayal of the cowardly and bigoted manner in which the West dealt with the tragedy, but even that was done without impact. Not a major motion picture at all. A major disappointment."

","The west's terrible neglect of the Rwandan genocide is to our shame; but how did it happen? 'Hotel Rwanda' deserves credit for bringing this wrongly-ignored tragedy to our attention, albeit long after the killing; but it fails to really answer the question. A smooth, urbane hotel manager suddenly finds that half the country wants to kill the other half, and ends up trying to protect as many of his fellow citizens as follows. But the murderous violence comes out of nowhere, and perhaps cannot be truly understood through the perspective of a westernised member of the middle classes; and the widespread nature of the terror (a million people were killed in all) is not really captured. Although it's quite normal to personalise a story that seems too large to tell completely (think 'Schindler's List' for an obvious example), I found it hard to get a true sense of the wider society of which the hotel is supposed to be a microcosm (just as the one heroic U.N. officer we see appears equally without a context of his own). So while it's good this film was made, I found it only somewhat illuminating; though it also made me ponder how shamefully rarely black Africa is chosen as a subject for any sort of film."

You cannot write a critical review of this film, in plain words.<br/><br/>When I went into the theatre I partially regretted the fact that I hadn't done necessary research on the political issue of Rwanda the film is based on. I don't see the importance any more. Now I don't care about Hutus or Tutsis or what really happened in 1994, I only know that this is all about the blind hatred between two racially/religiously/culturally different groups of people. I live in a country which is not exactly alien to such conditions. In fact while watching the film I couldn't help remembering the Gujarat massacre and riots that happened in 2002. I am not comparing the two incidents, it is just my way to personally relate to this film.<br/><br/>I left the theatre with another thought. Whom do we call a hero? I thank Terry George, Don Cheadle and others for making a film on a true real-life hero, a breed which humanity is always struggling to produce. Paul Rusesabagina is a hero, perhaps more than Oscar Schindler who had always another choice and more favorable position that Paul. He is a hero that even you and I could turn out to be in necessary circumstances. Don Cheadle is magical, but perhaps that's my half-dead movie-reviewer self talking.<br/><br/>Perhaps someday I'll delete this comment and write something more informative and complete.

All that slaughter deserves a bit more than just calling the opposing tribes ""cockroaches."" At first, I thought of Cheadle as miscast for the role - too stoic and businesslike to be a savior, but he did grow on me a bit as the film ran on. By the end, I actually believed him.

","Whenever anyone mentions the Oscar-nominated (and hopefully winning) Hotel Rwanda, they (present company included) feel obliged to sing a parody of The Eagles's ""Hotel California"". Both are rather similar, actually. Both deal with destruction, whether it be small or massive, as is the case with Hotel Rwanda. I knew little of the Rwandan genocide (all of my information had come from a 6th grade teacher-her son was in Rwanda during the aftermath). Although movies can never not have a bias, I feel like seeing Hotel Rwanda was necessary in learning about something I otherwise wouldn't've. Plus, there's Don Cheadle.<br/><br/>Cheadle is Paul Rusesabagina, the owner of a high-scale hotel in Rwanda for rich white tourists. During this, the Hutus and Tutsis are in the middle of a genocide, leaving no one out of danger. Paul and his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) open up their hotel to any refugees (whether they be Tutsi or Hutu), as Nick Nolte comes in and attempts to shake off the heroin he shot up during the filming of The Good Thief.<br/><br/>Hotel Rwanda shows the true inhumanity man can have onto man. It opens up the door for people to examine how people treat each other. Showing how personally brutal this genocide was to the Rusesabaginas, and how it should have been to everyone else. The movie did an outstanding job of yelling at us Westerners for not really caring about Rwanda at that time (and we still really don't). There's not really much I can say on this movie. Everything stands out about it, especially Cheadle. If he wasn't up against Jamie Foxx for the Oscars, I'd root for him. But then there's the case of Sophie Okonedo. I really don't know what bugged me about her, but it just ruined the movie for me. Instead of this toweringly powerful film, it's just a very good one because of Sophie Okonedo. I really don't know what it was, but I recommend you see it and tell me.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10 Rated PG-13 on appeal for violence, disturbing images and brief strong language."

","First of all, can we have a decent movie without getting hit over the head with a ""political correctness"" club! This is a story of two African tribes murdering each other and the blame is placed upon the European colonists who originally ""elevated"" one tribe over another (because they had more Caucasian facial features) which ""created"" the bloodbath. Then the ""white foreigners"" were blamed for supplying them guns! Then the ""white governments"" were blamed for not doing anything during the genocide, because ""they didn't see Africans as worthy of their time and concern"". There is a similar situation in Iraq, after Saddam has executed thousands of people and everyone is protesting our involvement. The film was well acted, and very good, but enough of the insidious attacks on our culture! If there was a message here it is that people, regardless of race, are responsible for their choices and actions. It was infuriating to hear that millions of innocents were slaughtered by fellow Africans and the Westerners are to blame. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the individual to choose to kill or not. Enough already!"

","do not see ""Hotel Rwanda"" ever. and by ever i mean never ever. not in theaters and certainly not when it comes out on DVD. do not rent it. do not watch it at a friend's house. if it is ever screened on television...change the channel. now you might be wandering what is so bad about this movie, and to be perfectly honest it wasn't the worst movie i've ever seen (cough-""Armageddon""-cough), but it was without a doubt one of the most disappointing releases in years. what works me up so much about this particular film's suckage is the buzz surrounding it; three Oscar nominations - THREE!! don cheadle was fine, but that was about it. i don't give kudos to performances that beg for them, and this would be such a case. the story that the film explores, the rwandan genocide of 1994, is in itself a captivating subject. however the way in which this conflict is presented in this film plumbs all the depths of my bathroom sink. but the cardinal sin of this clunker is doubtlessly the writing. i might only feel this way because i personally have an interest in screen writing, and because it is my belief that you can only make a good film if you start with a good screenplay, but in any case, the dialogue and pacing in ""Hotel Rwanda"" just plain blows. i can't count how many times i rolled my eyes during one of cheadle's characters monologues. i could go on forever but i...i just need to stop. i suppose i'll finish by telling you, the reader, that i really hate this movie because it did have promise. there were moments where i almost felt a twinge of compassion for the characters and events on screen, and that is why this is the most frustrating release in a long time. +_+_+_+_3/10_+_+_+_+"

","I saw an interesting true story without much suspense or action but the genocide itself is dramatic enough. I discovered HOTEL RWANDA because its high votes and the good critics on IMDb. Don Cheadle delivered a respectable performance here. Cameos for Joaquin Phoenix and Jean Reno. The picture was okay but the film minutes could have been reduced. I don't like movies that are running more than two hours because I don't have much time. Anyway if you are looking for a true story don't miss it. It's a shame that on this massacre the UNO was helpless and all the Western countries too. I'm asking which kind of sun is shining on this UNO. There were many facts that let me without words. I was also impressed how the hotel manager Paul bought lives with money. Standing ovations to Paul Rusesabagina the great hero that saved so many innocent lives. We all should take an example from him. My final vote is 6/10 but please don't get me wrong. <br/><br/>If you liked it I highly recommend TEARS OF THE SUN."
"dbborroughs","7","1","4","7 August 2005"," A great inspiring story weakened by bad casting
","This is the true and inspiring tale of one man who tried to do something when his country descended into madness and genocide. Don Cheadle is masterful as our hero and he was deserving of an Oscar and not just a nomination. Its is thanks to him and most of the rest of the cast that we have as good a movie as we do. The problem, for me, with Hotel Rwanda is the casting of Nick Nolte as a UN peace keeper. Every time that Nolte appears on screen I'm pulled out of the movie. No longer am I in Rwanda but on a Hollywood set and big name actors are trying to act. Its distracting and it almost ruins the movie since it takes several minutes after each of his appearances to calm down enough to once again get lost in the story. Nolte aside, this is a great movie and should be seen , not only because its a record of what transpired, but also because its a damn good movie."
"siglo_xx","6","1","4","23 July 2005"," Overrated
","Not a bad movie, but you know, I didn't really feel much for the characters in this film. While the story is reasonably compelling, you see the leads sipping wine by candle light after all the tension occurs and they're left in the hotel to manage the chaos. I mean, come on. What's that all about? <br/><br/>Way too Hollywood to actually produce compassion for the true story at hand. Everyone seems to go nuts over this film, both at IMDb and other sites (such as rental), and it's yet another film I feel is overrated by at least 2 out of 10 stars. I gave it a 6. It doesn't suck, but it's not all that great either. <br/><br/>I didn't find the acting all that supreme to be honest, and while the story was important to be told, it wasn't told in a way that provides one with feeling for the actors or whom they''re portraying. I didn't feel as sorry for the characters as I did in many other movies, such as Salvador, The Killing Fields, etc. They were far better films, in my humble opinion. <br/><br/>While this movie had its moments of sadness, it would often spoil the true story with these displays of 'wine by candle light', which I found to be complete nonsense and totally unrealistic given the circumstances. Tantamount to drivel. I didn't really think the movie got going till around 50 minutes into the film. Sorry, but I'm a huge movie person and I simply can't agree with the majority here."

"fooltank77","6","1","10","9 February 2005"," I am happy this film was made, but... (Spoiler Warning)
","Terry George deserves much praise for being able to make this movie about a difficult time in the recent history of the world. Prior to seeing this movie I knew very little about the conflict that took place in Rwanda, and thus I am glad to have seen this movie to learn about the horrors that took place there in 1994. However, as a film itself, I believe Hotel Rwanda is very flawed. Everything in the film is milked hard for melodrama, which may be understandable given the subject matter. Nevertheless, I found the handling of this instance in time to be largely heavy-handed. Also, the characterization of many people in this movie felt very black-and-white, such as how the Tutsi Rebels were given somewhat of a hero treatment towards the end, despite the fact it was they who assassinated the President (though maybe it was not the rebels, the movie doesn't make this clear). Additionally, it states at the film's conclusion that the Hutu Army eventually fled to Congo as a happy-ending coda. But what went on in Congo after that? More chaos. The film fails to mention that many of the problems in Rwanda continue to exist in the African continent. Hopefully this will change, though whether it will in my lifetime appears debatable.<br/><br/>On a more positive note, I do think the performances were very good, with Don Cheadle giving a very compassionate portrayal of the beleaguered hotel employee who strived to keep those around him safe."

"logatherum","5","0","1","14 October 2016"," Good film
","Hotel Rwanda was a well- made film, with some famous actors. It was interesting to see Hollywood actors in a film that seemed foreign, although it wasn't. I did not know very much about the Rwandan Genocide, or the history of other Genocides. Overall, I liked this film, but it was definitely not my favorite because I did not understand it as much as I did the other films; I found myself lost during some parts. My favorite character was Paul because he was so determined. Paul was such a big part in this movie, since he showed that he was not only a good person and hero to his family, but those living in the hotel.His issues made my stressors and issues in my life feel like nothing. Not only was dealing with the genocide, but he was living in the middle of it, AND had to manage an entire hotel! Although it was not his fault by any means, It must've killed him to see all of the families and their children sleeping in the hallways of his hotel every time he was trying to get by them. He must've felt some responsibility and guilt for them having to sleep on a cold floor, especially since he had a wife and children of his own he probably thought of when he saw these people. I also liked his wife, Tatiana a lot as well, because she was so devoted to Paul, and she seemed to keep him in line. I liked that she was a loving wife and mother, but also was not afraid to die for her kids or Paul, since she was so tough. Although we saw struggles of both Paul and Tatiana through their eyes, I would've liked to see more of the kids' struggles and how THEY viewed what was going on. I kind of wish that there was more interaction between the kids at the hotel and Paul and Tatiana's kids, because they were a big part in the movie too since they were so vulnerable. The difference in this movie compared to most of the others, was that there was not violence in the sense that the community was so troubled such as guns and gangs, but because of war and the genocide. So what is the crime really like in Kigali, Rwanda? The crime that is most prominent today is theft and vandalism, at a rate of about 36%, which is considered low.Next, at a rate of 26%, is drugs and people dealing drugs. Violent crimes are less common than petty theft. Interestingly, violent crimes are less likely to happen to a foreigner than a local, as well! A study done in 2015 shows that there has been an increase in robbery in homes, but it mostly happens when people are not in them. Overall, Kigali is a pretty safe place, compared to the other countries in the films we have watched."

Anyways, we have a butt-head of a landlord of sorts and a man we're supposed follow throughout this movie adventure. among other things, there is plenty of filler and such that I can't really go into detail without spoiling plenty of the movie.

"snord-94860","4","0","1","16 April 2016"," A forceful message
","Sadly, this movie just didn't do it for me for a number of reasons. I knew coming in that with this type of movie, depicting an horrific historical event, that it is a difficult line to walk. Many movies make the message too heavy-handed, utilizing ""message-based- dialogue"" that doesn't feel believable. Then there are others like Schindler's List that masterfully demonstrate the horrors, yet remain cinematic masterpieces. I heard so many good things about it from friends and saw the cast and thought that it was going to be good, but left feeling a empty. First, I did not feel the chemistry between Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo. From the opening, I didn't feel much of a connection between them and although they kissed and ""do"" what a married couple should, there was something missing. Secondly, I thought that the editing was a little odd in a couple places. For example, when Cheadle and Okonedo are on the roof at night, there is a part that it unnecessarily cuts to the guns shots over the city. It wasn't anything that helped the movie, but left me a little distracted. Thirdly, I have to complain about the theme of the movie being preached through a megaphone. All good art has to allow the viewer to reach for their own conclusions, invite them in and allow them to interpret. When any art form forces a certain feeling or message upon the viewer, it is insulting to them because it comes off as the director or writer don't trust the audience to reach the same conclusion. This was done mainly through the dialogue. So many of the lines seemed forced in order to get the message that the genocide was bad. This was also done with all the pictures of the dead. The last thing I want to do is offend anyone by downplaying how horrendous this event was, but I believe it should have been represented in a more tactful way. Many times, less is more. Let the audience come to that conclusion without it being shoved down our their throat. However, given all these things that I didn't like, I did enjoy some parts. The individual acting of most characters was good (Phoenix, Mokoena, and Kgoroge to name a few). I also thought that the cinematography was good. The lighting used to help the essence of each scene come forth was well done. Finally, I enjoyed the sound design. It did a much better job of subtly stating the mood of the scene and brought me in as a viewer to interpret with it. Positives: Good sound design, some good acting, and good cinematography. Negatives: Forceful theme/ message, lack of chemistry between leads, and distracting edits in some parts. Conclusion: If you want to watch a movie that tells you how to feel about genocide and war instead of inviting you to develop your own thoughts, you'd probably like the movie."

","I watched this movie the other day and it was a knee-slapping, roaring, hilarious film. One character, named Paul, gets a huge load of customers for his small Rwandan hotel. The movie plays like a classic sitcom, with shenanigans committed by nearly every guest at the hotel. One of the funniest parts was when some guests didn't like the hotel water or something so they drank from the pool! Later there was a huge party, but it got out of hand and I think someone threw a firecracker at the hotel, comically freaking everyone out. I gave this movie a 9/10 because Paul's wife tried killing some guests or something with a flashlight, which wasn't really that funny. In all, this movie is a great film that surpasses even some classic comedies. I would review the actual plot instead of jokes, but I'm trying to avoid spoilers. Anyway, I highly recommend this movie to any comedy fan."

"SpitztheGreat","8","0","1","14 June 2009"," A very good film
","Much has been said about this film, both good and bad, and I want to try and add my measured response to the film.<br/><br/>To cover the basics: this is a movie about the genocide in Rwanda in the early 1990s. The main character shelters hundreds of innocent refuges in a large luxury hotel as chaos breaks out around the city. He uses his extensive political contacts to keep the murdering militias at bay while seeking a way for the refugees to escape.<br/><br/>The movie is gripping and intense from the start to finish. The characters are easy to identify with and well cast. The director does a wonderful job at creating an environment of impending doom and chaos. Most importantly this movie depicts a very important chapter of history and records it for future generations. Much like Schindler's List this is a movie that all should see so that the world never forgets what happened.<br/><br/>As a movie it does have it's flaws however. It drags on a bit too long and as a result some of the tension is lost. Repeatedly throughout the movie it seems like the bad guys are about to be victorious only to be thwarted at the last second (literally, the last second) by the main character. The combination of repeat last second saves gives the movie a strong feel of The Boy Who Cried Wolf and the omnipotence of the main character. It's hard to maintain tension when you've seen the same conflict resolved multiple times in the same manner by a character who seems to be able to deliver anything.<br/><br/>This issue should not keep anyone from seeing this movie however. For the subject matter it's pretty easy to get into, which was one of my main worries coming into the movie. Highly acclaimed for good reason this is a movie that won't do you wrong."

","I had seen a little bit of this film in college, and of course I knew the lead actor, so I was very eager to see it. Based on true events, this film is set in Rwanda during the historical genocide (deliberate and systematic extermination of national, racial, political, or cultural groups), a civil war between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples. The protagonist caught in the situation is real life hero, manager of Sabena HÃ´tel Des Mille Collines, Paul Rusesabagina (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Don Cheadle) - Hutu, along with wife Tatiana (Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls' Oscar nominated Sophie Okonedo) - Tutsi, and their children. Paul saw his responsibility to save as many people as he could, the majority being Tutsis, by sheltering them in his hotel, and bribing (with money and alcohol) police for protection. In the end, even after being taken out of the hotel, the UN Peacekeeping forces, led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), convoy them to reach safety behind Tutsi rebel lines; Paul managed to save 1,200 refugees. Also starring an underused Joaquin Phoenix as Jack Daglish, Desmond Dube as Dube, David O'Hara as David, Cara Seymour as Pat Archer, Fana Mokoena as General Bizimungu, Hakeem Kae-Kazim as George Rutaganda, Tony Kgoroge as Gregoire and an uncredited Jean Reno as Sabena Airlines President, Mr. Tillens. Cheadle gives a magnificent Oscar-worthy performance (he lost to Jamie Foxx in Ray), Okonedo also gives very good support, and the film itself has all the right elements to make it quite a powerful drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Song for ""Million Voices"". It was number 90 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!"
"AshokePrabha","9","0","1","2 July 2008"," A heart moving make.
","Saw this movie today. I heard about this movie a long time back. With those high praises about this movie and the outline story in mind I started watching the movie. Until the half I was not moved much inside the movie. But when Paul tore off his shirt and tie it started feeling like real world. Excellent performance by Don Cheadle.<br/><br/>History: The historical genocide (3 million people) of 'tutsi' race people by 'Hutu' race people in Rwanda happened in 1994. This happened becos the President who was a Hutu was assassinated by the 'tutsi' militia which triggered this genocide. The wikipedia history page on Rwandan 'tutsi' and 'Hutu' race division reads that this racial difference was a long existing one for centuries. Both people look same. Both race people are genetically from Africa. i.e. the two races are not as contrasting as blacks and whites in South Africa. The racial conflict was enforced becos the Belgium rulers picked the highly skilled, fair skinned, long nosed Rwandan people among them and classified them as 'tutsi's in order to have a good subordinates in their rule of Rwanda. This overrode the original racial differences. This divide and rule tactics of Belgium led to the ever lasting struggles between these classifications.<br/><br/>The story is based on the true events happened in 1994 in Rwanda. True story of an high class Hotel Manager in Rwanda who fought all odds and saved many 'tutsi' and 'hutu' people's lives (about 1200) during this genocide by giving them shelter at his hotel. How he tried to wade of the surrounding dangers of Militia attack.. How he managed..and what happened..etc.<br/><br/>The movie gave me lot of insights into the life of people in tough times. How third world countries like Rwanda are similar to my country India in many aspects.. How as simple and as silly as a 'long nose' and 'fair color' is enough to cultivate a differentiation and hatred among people. The technical part of the movie is flawless. Photography, music, editing(the van returning-on-morning-frost scene). Above all the direction. There should definitely be some motive behind the news that this movie did not get to any Oscars.<br/><br/>I was much moved by the great deeds of Paul on behalf of humanity. Please watch this movie and show it to your children. It is true that people born into different races. But it is also true that race is just skin deep; and underneath, every human is having the same blood, heart and mind. When people start to realize it someday then will there come a change."

","Hotel Rwanda is perhaps one of the best films I've seen to date. The film shows how bigotry can move otherwise decent people to commit unspeakable atrocities against those who they view as different. It inversely also shows people of goodwill will challenge those who perform genocide/murder against those who they consider different and guilty of murder. Such is the case in this film. The concierge/manager of a Rwandan hotel pays bribes, pleads, and goes' as he has to in order to save innocents from genocide.<br/><br/>Like many of us who grew us in the United States I have met many who define racial issues as a Black/White issue. Well the truth is that prejudice can bring out it's ugly head under any issue.

I hope to see his career flourish, and to see him in more dramatically exciting and intellectually and morally challenging films like this one.<br/><br/>The film moves at a fast clip, and hints at the horrors of the 1994 Rwandan genocide without rubbing the viewer's nose in those horrors.

This really feels like a *movie,* not a documentary or a sermon.<br/><br/>There were a few flaws in the movie, that did not diminish its quality.<br/><br/>Nick Nolte plays a distorted version of the Canadian UN Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, author of the genocide memoir, ""Shake Hands with the Devil."" Dallaire has complained publicly about Nolte's performance, and he has a right to. In a downright embarrassing scene, a hammishly overacting Nolte, lips aquiver, tells Paul that the reason the Rwandan genocide is happening is that the West regards Africans as -- and here, Nolte uses the N word.<br/><br/>This scene is simply false. Westerners did not orchestrate the Rwandan genocide. The killers must take responsibility for their killing. The West has been criticized for not stopping the genocide, often by people who decline to mention that the Rwandan genocide took place over, roughly, a hundred days, at a faster rate than the Nazi holocaust, during which almost a million people were killed, largely by their own neighbors, by machete, in a landlocked African country called ""the land of a thousand hills."" The logistical problems presented by the above situation were all but impossible to overcome. Further, many people, including leftists, were burnt out on ""humanitarian"" military intervention, in the wake of Somalia. (George Bush's war in Iraq will similarly impact future assessments of the advisability of ""humanitarian"" military intervention by one country in a distant, and badly understood, country's internal affairs.) Too, ""Hotel Rwanda,"" in underplaying the genocide, and making itself an easier film to watch, failed to communicate the horrors of the Rwandan genocide. Some viewers will feel grateful for this; others might not.<br/><br/>In general, though, ""Hotel Rwanda"" is a fine film featuring, in Don Cheadle, a megawatt star doing his best work."

","I am a bit surprised that those who write here have not seen how this film is reminiscent of Schindler's List, but rightly portrayed as current and urgent, as opposed to the safety of a long gaze and reflection back in history. I am not a Don Cheadle fan, but if he continues to turn in performances like this (and ""Crash""), I may become one.<br/><br/>The brutality and greed of chaotic modern Africa are aptly addressed here, and realities of circumstance make the main character's courage all the more palpable than, say, silly Hollywood action flicks might have us believe the nature of courage to be.<br/><br/>The only reasons I did not give that tenth star were that I thought Nolte a bit long in the tooth for the role he was given, and the fact that many scenes are dark and hard to discern. I believe that both of these were intentional; the aging struggling colonel, and the sweaty dank feel of breaking news. But, I might have enjoyed it more if they would have been moderated in degree."

The only way to stop it is to get off your rear and do something about it. You can google Sudan genocide or Darfur Genocide(Darfur is the region where the killing is taking place. For those unaware of the situation let me fill you in. The Sudanese government is killing non Arab black people in the region. As of now there are no US troops, no European troops and saddest no UN troops. Please read my post and go on to one of the many sites on the internet to sign a petition to president Bush to send troops into Sudan. President Bush when asked about the possibility of a genocide today said ""not on my watch"". As of now 9 million have signed a petition urging him to send help. If you like or dislike the movie it doesn't matter, just take the message delivered and go help."

In Sudan, the Janjaweed troops: white Muslims are killing black Muslims. It is a similar situation in Hotel, a very painful movie describing in almost no graphic images, the horror on such an event as a genocide for no apparent reason. In the movie, nobody really knows who to trust, but Paul trusts only in himself and survives.

","A powerful subject. Real people. Real events. Seems like a formula for success, right? Well yes, but almost not quite. For those unaware of the 1994 Rwanda genocide or its details, it's an amazing chance to look from the inside out instead of the outside in. Unfortunately, save for a few scenes and the panic in people's faces, we don't really feel the full impact of the slaughter. Over the course of several months, approximately 800,000 men, women, and children were butchered simply because of their fictionalized ethnicity provided by the Belgian colonialists. That's a lot of zeros. And yet, from the movie, it feels as if a few of those zeros are missing.<br/><br/>Still, it does not detract from the seriousness of the subject or the quality of the film. Hotel Rwanda is, by far, one of the better movies out there. The acting is good, despite the fact that I can't stand watching the fellow who plays Romeo Dallaire, the UN general, as he clops about like a plow horse. This film has the ability to open eyes and bring attention to the genocide, which is the most important thing about it. If we are aware of such atrocities, we have the ability to learn from the past and prevent history from repeating itself.<br/><br/>Powerful? Yes. Real? Yes. Good? Definitely."

","Regarding the fact that most people don't know that much about the massacres in Rwanda, this movie was necessary to show the shocking things that happened and the rejection of help by the western countries. However, I don't think people bring the critical acclaim the motion picture - not the documentary - needs: Many actors and actresses did a rather poor job, especially Nick Nolte was really disappointing in my opinion. I appreciate the directors job for delivering a movie with tension and the information every viewer needed, but after the parts couldn't make me believe they really happened because of the in some scenes crappy performances by the UN-Guy and Paul's wife which just let me realize that even if these things happened, they don't seem as real as they could if the actors would do a better job. That sucked the special quality out of a masterpiece: Great shocking film with information everybody needs to get, some errors in the performance that this story does not deserve."
"noilie","7","0","2","12 August 2005"," Excellent Film
","I really wish people would stop gushing about how GREAT this film is, how it made you CRY, MOAN, WEAP, GENUFLECT, etc. YES, I agree that the film is brilliant. It GETS one's attention. IT is a story powerfully told. Unfortunately, it also inspires a general sense (to my mind, and after reading some of the posts here) of armchair philanthropy. Stasis. Inactivity. It is great that there is a film that takes Africa and individualized Africans figures, seriously as its primary Subject, tells the story from an African point of view. This is the first mainstream film (to my mind, that has done this). Africa, as a concept, is most often seen as a massive, dirty, backwards ""Heart of Darkness"", unexplored unless by prying, objectifying news cameras (starving children with snot running out of their noses etc.) The fault doesn't lie with the film (it is quite firm about its contempt for the ""West's"" strategic lack of agency). The problem lies with people like YOU, quite happy to sing the film praises, but not much else. There is a post further down that (flippantly) refers to this film as ""This year's Schindler's List"". What a cheek! Yes, this may be one of those ""never forget what happened film's"", but while the Holocaust recedes ever further into history, atrocities of similar proportions still happen on this continent (I am a South-African). The speed and force with which the ""Rwanda"" happened forced the West (retrospectively) to sit up and listen. Although slower, other protracted battles/hotspots(a misnomer no doubt coined by that beast CNN) continue to shock the mind out of comprehension. Angola, for example only recently (three years ago) ended an over twenty year civil war (see, in Africa its ""on again: and ""off again: so no-one really knows how long these things last and whether or not they ever truly end, case in point: Sudan. The list goes on. To list ""issues"", rant-style, here would be counter-intuitive, to my mind. Go find out.<br/><br/>Hopefully there will be more films about African SUBJECTS in the future.<br/><br/>Most of the major supporting actors are South-African (and they all give performances as good as Cheadle's). It was mainly filmed in and around Soweto (in Johannesburg, where I live).<br/><br/>Calling this film ""this years Schindler's LIst"" is, to put it lightly, unconscionable. Think ""historically specific"" next time, hey? Rant Over.<br/><br/>Do something from your end. Find out how. Avoid condescension."

Absolutely everything is stereotypical ""drama movie"" setup, drilling into our heads how ""sad"" we should be. Secondly, Paul (the main character) is not a hero. He does the absolute least he can all through the movie unless his wife yells at him to do more. He is a coward and I felt completely unsympathetic to him.

The foreign power put the 1s in control and pretty soon they think they are really superior to the 2s. The 1s kill a million of the 2s (calling them cockroaches) before the 2s rise up and push out the 1s.<br/><br/>While all of this is going on, a particular 1, played magnificently by Don Cheatle, becomes a Schindler of sorts and saves not only his family and other 1s but a bunch of 2s as well from the militia/military 1s before escaping behind the approaching ""rebel"" line of the 2s.<br/><br/>Unbelievable?

","I'm surprised at the amount of praise this movie receives; through the Oscars, on this website. Only 23 negative responses, and most of the comments are around six. Well, I'm going to have to lower the number, people. I'm stickin this puppy at around four. Why? I'll tell you.<br/><br/>Granted, the story is ""moving"", but it feels very well worn and very familiar and like a million other movies of its ilk, but a different territory. None of the people I saw it with (seven others) enjoyed it and the general synopsis was that a documentary would have been sufficient to convey the power of the story; the story of Rwanda, that is. There are some very good performances, especially Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte, but the problem is that the movie is ultimately a feel good drama that churns along a very familiar path. It's another ""hero"" story, which is fine (the hero tries to save a whole bunch of his people by keeping them in his hotel; ultimately making big sacrifices at the expense of his own potential survival), but not when so much of it is cheapened by oversentimentality, emotional manipulation and characters that have very little depth. I didn't find his wife to have much depth. She is the poor suffering wife. That's it. We see them in various intimate scenarios while this genocide is ravaging the country, and for some reason we are meant to care. I just couldn't. It seemed like cheap romantic scenes thrown in to force us to feel. I couldn't. If anything, they slowed down the film. The story really felt like ""Rwanda 101"" a way to give us a sanitized version of what happened in 1994 in a simple way, full of overwrought dramatics. It's also yet another movie that has non-English speaking people speaking English with each other for two hours. For me, that automatically cheapens the story because you can basically see the minds at work behind that one: let's make a movie that is palatable for the American public, instead of having their original languages spoken. What's wrong with subtitles? Some of my favourite movies have subtitles. I realize many people don't want to read subtitles, but considering 90 percent of the movies made outside of North America, which already have trouble getting exposure, have subtitles, I think it is out of respect that people initiate themselves into the subtitle world because I can honestly say that subtitles have not ruined my appreciation for a single movie. Also, if we are to experience the true, authentic nature of the world of these characters, isn't their language incredibly important?"

When I the theater i thought to myself about why the world never did anything to interject. At the time this went on my father was in the Army and i was unable to vote. Why did you people not act? My father asks why as well he was willing to go there and give his life in order to stop the mass genocide. I blame the fact that this movie is so empowering on the failings of those that had a voice during that time. If you are one of thoughs people then i hold you responsible for not acting. As the movie displayed individual people did act and made a difference, why didn't the individual people here make a difference. Namely Bill Clinton, he could have done something about this but he was afraid of political opinion with out the backing of the UN. He was a afraid of another Somalia event, which by record wasn't really that bad, it's the basic fact that America doesn't except that when one joins the Military the are forced to sign a paper stating that there is the possibility that they will get in harm's way and that the will possibly die because of it.

Personally, I think it should have gone further, as this would have created an even more dire and urgent picture. And in this movie, as opposed to the such films as the Passion of the Christ, the brutality is all modern reality, not based on any religious intent.<br/><br/>The music score is AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL, and shows how a bad score can really tear a movie apart, in my opinion. It was like listening to music from the Lifetime or Hallmark channel...truly bad and misplaced. If they had gone with a more sparse, ethnically appropriate score, it would have pushed Hotel Rwanda over the top, but instead makes some scenes awash in maudlin-ism and near Ewok village-level cheesiness. When the score stands out this way, you know it's bad. One should never be paying attention to the music like this, and it undermines the fine performances.<br/><br/>All in all, a great experience.
