","Flashdance is one of my Top Ten Films.  I don't care that it has no twisting plot.  I don't care that Jennifer Beals used a body double.  I REALLY don't care that it's a chick flick.  I love this movie!! Some people, after seeing Flashdance, choose to see a movie about exotic dancing.  For one reason or another, I see a movie about chasing dreams, taking chances, and maximizing life.  <br/><br/>Jennifer Beals' character Alex Owens's dream of attending a formal dance school and becoming a ballerina is the central theme of the film.  Her friends Jeanie and Richie are aspiring figure skaters and stand-up comedians, respectively.  However, Alex is the only dreamer receiving any encouragement.  Her senior citizen friend Hannah, a former ballerina herself, gives Alex practical advice and unconditional faith.  Jeanie's father openly criticizes Jeanie's dream as well as her beau, Richie. Richie, a cook at Mawby's Bar, is put down by his boss for wanting to go to Hollywood and being a comedian; ""You're too short.  They don't let short people into Hollywood.""<br/><br/>The sub-plots facilitate Alex's dream to create a captivating story.  To support herself (and possibly, to keep life interesting), Alex holds 2 jobs: a welder by day and a dancer at aforementioned Mawby's Bar during the night. Her welding boss Nick takes a liking to her and pursues her.  Alex resists his charms but gives in eventually.  Johnny C., the sleazy strip bar owner continually tries to lure Alex into dancing for him.  As mentioned before, Alex's friends Jeanie and Richie have dreams of their own, and we see where their dreams take them.  <br/><br/>The factor that made Flashdance a hit was the music, of course.  ""What a Feeling"" took away an Oscar for Best Song.  ""I'll Be Here Where the Heart Is"", sung by Kim Carnes (""Bette Davis Eyes"") fits Alex's personal-crisis scene perfectly. <br/><br/>The first time I watched Flashdance was 4 years ago; I bought the video knowing I'd like it.  After 20+ viewings, I still love it.  Flashdance is for anyone who has a dream but not the courage to pursue it."

","What makes a good film for me is that it is enjoyable, entertaining, gripping, likable and emotional. Flashdance without a doubt ticks all these five boxes. Flahdance is a very retro, cheesy entertaining film that is at no point boring and never drags, and is also a very clear symbol of the great 1980's and the night club exotic dancing scene of the time. Jennifer Beals puts down an amazing performance, as a dancer and as an actress. I guess the story comes down to the fact that reality bites, that life is tough, but if you push hard you just might make it.<br/><br/>All in all, Flashdance despite its few undeniable faults is a very decent and enjoyable film in my opinion. As it mostly meets all of my requirements I am happy to give it a positive review. This film is one of the quintessential 80's films, that works well as a symbolic artifact of its time. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves 80's.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 7 out of 10."
"San Franciscan","Null","95","129","17 October 2002"," A surprisingly charming film!
","So here's this movie ""Flashdance"" which has been staring me in the face for years, both in pop culture for over half of my life and on the video rental store shelves, and yet I've never gotten around to checking it out until now.<br/><br/>I was fifteen when this movie was first out and popular. I heard the soundtrack, of course, and loved it to pieces... but I had never been able to watch the movie because it was rated R.<br/><br/>I had grown up having it be, in an odd sort of way, both a part of my life and at the same time *not* a part of my life. I was familiar with its music, images, and even its basic plot outline, but had never seen the movie.<br/><br/>And as an adult, I felt extremely dubious about checking it out. Over the years, I had heard that people either loved it to pieces or hated it. I've heard critics both call it uplifting and fun while others called it nothing more than a string of glittering little music videos strung together on an extremely thin strand of plot (a creation device for a LOT of MTV-era movies such as ""Top Gun"", ""Footloose"" and ""Purple Rain"").<br/><br/>To add to my confusion about whether or not I should give it a try, I had had the same experience with ""Saturday Night Fever"": I grew up loving the soundtrack to pieces but having never seen the movie... and when I finally did I felt utter disappointment at first, discovering the film to be far darker than expected. Oh sure, I later liked ""Fever"" okay (actually, I should use the term ""appreciated"") but still preferred the gorgeous soundtrack to the actual film that was the basis for its existance.<br/><br/>Would I have the same experience with ""Flashdance""?<br/><br/>Tonight, I finally decided to, as one character in the film puts it, ""hold my breath and take the plunge"".<br/><br/>As it turns out, I found it to be a surprisingly charming, entertaining and uplifting film. I was fearing it to be something raunchy, but at it turns out it has a very special, starry-eyed sweet innocence that is difficult to define.<br/><br/>The performance of the equally starry-eyed and innocent Jennifer Beals helps, of course. She brings a wide-eyed sparkle and hopefulness to her role, plus a determination to keep her life on the right track precisely as she feels it ought to go without any major morality screwups, and this adds a wonderful flavour of hope and childlike wonder to her character Alex that just simply grows on you.<br/><br/>Now, it IS true that there are a few flaws here and there, and a couple of editing flaws as well. Plus, the other characters aren't really as developed as hers (but they are developed just enough to demonstrate to her personally the various dos and don'ts regarding attitudes to have while pursuing a dream, voices for her to observe and learn from representing both directions). But none of that matters because the film has a charm all its own. Looking at it today, I can easily see why so many out there loved it: its a beautiful and very encouraging little film. It has a heroine whom anybody could relate with and like; it has wonderful music in it; it has a delicate and lighthearted touch to it which, language and a couple of scenes aside (such as the film's most heartbreaking scene in which Alex saves a desperate friend from throwing life away in a strip joint (a sequence which only lasts about two minutes long--but it's sad and disturbing, not ""Oooh, let's put this in to grab male members of the audience!""--which is most likely the only ingredient to earn the film its R rating)), is nevertheless still so pure and true that it could have come straight out of a '70s-made Walt Disney Productions movie (!!!); it's touching and moving... and, of course, it has dance sequences which are fun to watch.<br/><br/>In other words, it was a comforting and uplifting movie released during a time when people, youngsters with career goals in particular, needed one. And if anything, folks still need movies like that out today. It's a happy little film with a happy ending which isn't overdone or unconvincing, and precisely the sort of flick which should be perscribed to those suffering severe depression. Heaven knows that I myself certainly felt encouraged about my own career and life in particular after watching it!<br/><br/>It might not be for everybody, but if the above description I've written voices the sort of movie you personally enjoy then do yourself a big favour and give it a try. Chances are that if you are as naturally starry-eyed and hopeful as Alex is--and believe me, *I* certainly am--then you will easily relate to this delightful little fable."

","This musical movie shows several unsuccessful people who had dreams that they eventually gave up on. We see a cook, who wishes to become a comedian and follows his dream to Los Angeles only who have his dream crushed. We also see a skater who follows her dream to skate in a big show, but falls several times causing her to give up on her dream.<br/><br/>We also see Hanna a former ballerina who never became the star, and is mentoring a young lady named Alex. Alex is played by Jennifer Beals, and is a welder working for Nick (Michael Nouri). Alex also works as a FlashDancer in a bar at night, expressing herself in various costume dances,to music in front of a large appreciative audience.<br/><br/>As Nick gets involved with Alex we find out her dream is to become a ballerina, but she has no ballerina training and is fearful of the judgment and possible rejection in auditing for a ballerina company. She also saw dreams of her friends being crushed by reality, and feels it will happen to her. There is a quite a internal struggle within Alex regarding the audition for the Ballerina company.<br/><br/>The power of Music is a key element in the movie. Alex's father once told her, ""if you close your eyes you can see the music"". This statement is key in the outcome in the movie. This meaning music can make you see, feel and sometimes do powerful things. There is an important scene done to the song ""What A Feeling"" a powerful uplifiting song."

","No movie can sparkle if you don't! Dull serious people may not care for this movie of a lovely young woman driven to accomplish,despite hardships and heartbreak. But good music, good chemistry between the romantic co-stars, great dancing, an optimistic tone, make this a gem. ""Rocky"" with a dance motif and female star. Unless you're irretrievably burdened by life or just don't like good-looking women who achieve, you'll be cheered by this fine romantic flick."
"JamesHitchcock","6","57","91","14 January 2004"," Lively Popular Entertainment
","In recent years there have been a number of British films based on the theme of working-class people who find fulfilment through their cultural activities; examples being Educating Rita (the first and most distinguished), Brassed Off, The Full Monty and Billy Elliott.  Such films are frequently described as `quintessentially British' or `something that we can do and Hollywood can't', whereas the truth is that twenty years ago Hollywood was indeed making very similar films, mostly centred upon dancing, such as Saturday Night Fever, Dirty Dancing or Flashdance. Whereas these American films may not have had the covert (or, in the case of Brassed Off, highly overt) political message of their British counterparts, they nevertheless concentrated on differences in social class far more than Hollywood movies usually do.<br/><br/>The heroine of Flashdance, Alex, is a young woman who works as a welder and whose main joy in life is dancing. She moonlights as a dancer in a local nightclub, but her great ambition in life is to become a ballet dancer. The film tells the story of how she achieves that ambition, as well as the story of her romance with a wealthy middle-class divorcee, set against frequent dance sequences as Alex and her ice-skating friend Jeanie go through their paces. The climax comes with a scene in which she auditions for a place at a prestigious ballet academy and treats the judging committee to a bravura display of breakdancing. (Would a ballet school really be prepared to offer a place to a candidate whose dance skills owe more to the disco than to Swan Lake and who seems completely ignorant of balletic idiom?)<br/><br/>The film has its weak points. Although the plot is not as non-existent as some reviewers have felt, it nevertheless tends to take second place to the showpiece dance numbers; at times, it felt as if I were watching an extended series of pop videos. Potentially interesting themes are ignored; for example, Alex is a practising Catholic, but this seems to be a plot device to enable scenes set in the confessional to be used as soliloquies in which she can air her emotional problems. No attempt is made to explore the possible conflict between the demands of her religion and her sexually provocative dancing or her love for a divorcee.<br/><br/>The acting is undistinguished; Jennifer Beals makes an attractive and personable heroine, but it is clear why, despite the success of this film, she did not go on to become a major star. Her acting is too weak to enable her to carry a film; certainly I felt that she would be out of her depth in one that depends more upon plot and less upon song and dance. The other characters are little more than ciphers, with the exception of Hanna, the old lady who acts as Alex's mentor. I could certainly have done without the tasteless ethnic jokes told by Alex's comedian friend.<br/><br/>
Yet, despite its faults, I enjoyed this film. Its redeeming feature is the zest and energy of its dance sequences, set to some well-chosen music such as Laura Branigan's Gloria or Irene Cara's title song. It may not be deep or significant, but it is an enjoyable, well-made piece of popular entertainment. 6/10."
"bbhlthph","7","49","88","3 November 2003"," Flashdance clearly provides what many viewers want
","There are already many comments on this film in the IMDb database, and I had no intention of writing another until to my surprise I noticed that it was frequently being replayed on several different local TV channels. Flashdance is a very outdated movie that has never appealed to most film critics, so I felt this was sufficiently unusual to justify an attempted explanation.<br/><br/>	Since the DVD of Flashdance was released, it has appeared for hire in many small local convenience stores and service stations that only maintain a very small rack of films for hire Clearly although it is now very much of a period movie, it continues to retain an enormous appeal for many of those who have seen it before. Personally I have watched our tape of Flashdance more often than most of the other tapes we have at home. This is not because it would be my first choice, but because it is a film that my wife loves to watch again and again; whilst I find I can view it repeatedly more readily than many of her other favorite tapes, so when we are discussing what to view and have rejected a number of other possibilities we tend to turn back to Flashdance. This reinforces the comments already made in your database about Flashdance being a ""feel good"" movie for which most people seem able to ignore the faults and just enjoy the music, the dancing and the romance. (It also features ""Grunt"", a very appealing dog, who remains one of the reasons why my wife is always ready to rewatch this film.) As a film Flashdance is therefore something of a paradox. Originally the final product was not very highly regarded by the studio and only received a limited release. This was severely panned by most of the critics, and  not surprisingly the film initially received very little support from the public. The reviews and the low attendance led to plans to withdraw it from circulation early, but before these were implemented the audiences started to grow and continued to increase until cinemas showing the film were mostly packed out. Clearly those few who saw the film at an early showing started telling their friends to ignore the critics and see it. This escalated exponentially until the film finished up as a major hit. In commenting on this film it would be equally invalid to ignore the very real concerns of the critics or the equally real appeal it had, and still seems to have, for most of the public.<br/><br/>	The story is trite - a female welder in a steelworks dreams of being a ballet dancer and practices her dancing in one of the local bars at night. Here she meets and starts to fall in love with her fairly young divorced boss. With his support she is able obtain an audition with a major dance company who are essentially only interested in her dance training, and lose any interest they may have had when she says she has never attended a dance school. However she proceeds to audition for the very bored selection committee and gives an electrifying free dance performance that in true fairy story tradition brings the committee to its feet. Some critics have complained that doubles replaced the star Jennifer Beals for this sequence, but this is surely not important - the real question is how effectively the film plays, and this sequence has rightly been very widely admired. About the time the film was released, modern dance companies were being formed alongside traditional ballet companies in many major cities in North America and this sequence certainly added to the appeal of the film at the time, but it is decidedly not the only reason for watching it.<br/><br/>		I could spend pages criticizing the screenplay in several different respects, but other comments in your database have already done this, and these criticisms are ultimately not damming. The important thing is that the film maintains an ongoing flow which sweeps most viewers along and earns it a place as one of the finer musical comedies to have been released in the past quarter century. The object of a film is to entertain the public and in ranking Flashdance I feel I must base my rating on its undeniable success in doing just this. So 7 out of 10."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","5","40","72","1 September 2007"," An 80's iconic movie
","I know how much Flashdance became such a huge hit of the 80's, it defined a whole new generation of clothes, behavior, and dance moves. That's what made Flashdance so special. Now I was born in '85 so I kinda missed out on these things, but I understand it's importance. I just bought this movie yesterday, it was back to back with Footloose, two iconic 80's movies, and I watched Flashdance this afternoon. While this film defined a huge part of the 80's, it was an average film with a simple plot. The acting and story is just pretty average, but it's a cute and fun one.<br/><br/>Alex is a welder by day, but at night she is a sexy exotic dancer who grabs the attention of all the men. But she has big time dreams to become a ballet dancer, she has promised her grandmother that she would apply to the top ballet school and try to get an audition. But Alex is always intimidated by the other ""proper looking"" dancers with tons more experience than her. She falls in love with a fellow co-worker, Nick, who wants her to make it just as badly. She goes through rough times, but she just wants to make it and will do anything for that chance.<br/><br/>Flashdance is one of those must see movies if you wanna see the important films of the 80's. I just wanted to see what this movie was about since it's such a huge part of film culture. Jennifer Beals actually did a great job as Alex, she was absolutely beautiful and made the character very likable. While this film did not live up to my expectations, it still was a good film. It has an awesome sound track and really is a lot of fun to dance too. Now excuse me, but I wanna try to take my bra off without removing my shirt, lol.<br/><br/>5/10"
"benjmarshall","Null","30","54","16 June 2004"," Nostalgia
","As other users have said this film is very dated, but not necessarily bad. It was looked upon as a bit of fluff that was very successful in the box office. So now, it would come across as nostalgic (in the same vein as Dirty Dancing). But the thing I do like about it, is just that. Adrian Lyne perfectly captured the time, a post disco era when Break-dancing and Synth Pop were all the rage - Who could forget the FANTASTIC theme song, sung by Irene Cara (Fame) and composed by Synth Pop genius Giorgio Moroder (I feel love - Donna Summer among many others). So what if Jennifer Beals wasn't a great actress? So what if it wasn't her dancing? (Think one of them was a break dancer from ""The Rock Steady Crew"" - see? All about the era!) she was a good looking girl, and this was a harmless bit of fun at the time."

","Sure, Flashdance will never make the AFI's Top 100, but it has an infectious charm. Jennifer Beals is really only so-so in the leading role, and her leading man Michael Nouri is no better off, but it doesn't matter. What does matter here is the great music! Really, the whole film is played like a 90-minute ad for MTV! Laugh at the dopey plot and listen to the great tunes. Great film to earmark the 80s."

","Although I've long known, generally speaking, what this movie is about, I never saw it when it came out in 1983 or 1984, because I was too busy ""living"" the 80's (yeah, right, whatever that means!). But I just saw it recently, in its entirety, the other night on TV.<br/><br/>I don't know, maybe it's the current sorry state of affairs of the world today that made me want to watch this film, just so I could revisit the ""happy days(?)"" of the eighties, when, although the world was also in a sorry state of affairs, at least there was an underlying pretense of hope and glory, a pervasive (albeit childlike) adherence to the belief that wishes DO sometimes come true, miracles CAN happen, and for every ugly frog there IS a beautiful princess waiting to kiss him...<br/><br/>This movie sucks, bigtime... but it also rocks! And that, people, is the honest to God truth. This movie is so bad it reeks of the stench of the very phoney-baloney on which it is based (and we all know how awful THAT is). BUT, it also rocks you to your very soul, and hey, how can you possibly fault a movie that dares to offer people (and not just young people, but ALL people) that little thing called HOPE??? <br/><br/>I hope you don't take my ""critique"" the wrong way... Honestly, I don't think the movie is really all that good, but the message, and the feeling, and the spirit of this movie, are all very wonderful and infectious indeed and should NOT be discounted. It makes it a wonderful movie. Strange, isn't it? If those of you reading this are parents with up-and-coming kids, make them sit through this film!! Make them watch it!! I guarantee you, at least there is not a single scene in it where some teenager just HAS to have sex with a baked pastry object!! <br/><br/>Finally, let me comment on the fact that many in filmdom have dissed Jennifer Beals over the fact that a stand-in dancer performed various or several of her dance segments. Well let me just mention, that at the very end of the film, in the credit roll, there is a disclaimer that states: ""The people and events in this film are fictional. Any similarity to actual people or events is unintentional."" So, with this in mind a stunt double performed some of the dance steps!?? I was shocked, shocked to find that stunt doubles are used in Hollywood!!"

Just check out all the dance studios<br/><br/>and comedy clubs full of wannabees. Most of us have dreams or had them.<br/><br/>When I first saw this movie I was 23 and I was full of hopes and<br/><br/>ambitions.

"HalRagland","1","11","19","27 July 2008"," A 94 Minute Music Video
","I give ""Flashdance"" a lowest rating of 1 out of 10 because it's nothing more than a series of music videos with a movie short surrounding the music videos, in order to clock in as a feature length film. Since when does that count as film? Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, an aspiring 18-year-old dancer, who, incomprehensibly, has a job as a welder in a Pittsburgh steel factory. Not a line of work most older women find their way into, much less 18-year-olds fresh out of high school. Meanwhile, at night she works as an exotic dancer, who never actually takes off her clothes, in a greasy spoon bar called Mawby's. Yet looking at the well choreographed and well polished dance routines the girls do every night at Mawby's, you would think they were working at the best casino on the Las Vegas Strip.<br/><br/>Alex ends up having a predictable romance with her boss, Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), who is about twice her age. After resisting Nick's advances, because going out with the boss isn't a good idea, she wastes no time in going all the way with him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job, which makes no sense given how it is likely to look to Alex's co-workers.<br/><br/>When Beals isn't being doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie, her character spends most her time throwing temper tantrums. Alex's dream is to get an invitation only audition at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably, when her boss/boyfriend helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of, she's throws one her tantrums. She angrily tells Nick she isn't doing the audition because of his intervention, and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the makers were thinking when they were making this.<br/><br/>Of course, Alex does eventually get her audition at the Conservatory. She puts on a dance routine before the Conservatory board that is so ridiculous that you would think it was in a movie marketed to the MTV generation. Oh yeah, it is a dance routine in a movie marketed to the MTV generation.<br/><br/>I don't think I can judge whether or not Beals can actually act well on the basis of what I saw in ""Flashdance"". This is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written, that I don't think it is a fair litmus test of her acting abilities.<br/><br/>You have to hand it to the makers of ""Flashdance"" though. This movie is proof that the poorest film making can be covered up by a slick marketing campaign. In this case a best selling and award winning soundtrack and music videos for said soundtrack in heavy rotation on MTV. If they had devoted more of their energy to the writing of the script, then they might have been able to come up with a plot and a story with characters that I cared about. Instead what we get are stock characters put in ridiculous scenes any viewer with a functioning brain can't take seriously. A truly forgettable ""film""."

","I was a sophomore in college when this movie came out and I had never actually seen it until last night. I finally decided to watch it because I like good dancing and because the movie had such cultural impact. After seeing the movie I am completely baffled by how it had any effect other than putting people to sleep.<br/><br/>The story is pretty preposterous when you think about it. Does anyone actually buy the idea that that beer joint full of gnarly old steel-workers and teamsters could keep their clientèle with the high concept dances that those girls were doing? They would have all been over to Zanzibar faster than you can say ""performance art"". Can you imagine the reaction of the real life versions of that audience to that bizarre TV watching No theater dance thing that she did? Please.<br/><br/>It seems plausible to me that there could be a woman that worked in a steel yard and was also a dancer--after all both are physically demanding jobs. But I didn't buy for a second that THAT girl worked in a steel yard. And I didn't buy for a second that I was looking at a real steel yard. Steel work is dangerous. You don't keep your work area looking like a junk yard and not end up loosing a limb. I love some of the inane shots like when two welders are sitting in the big corrugated tubes welding. What the hell are they doing in there? Or when she is cutting six inches off of a rusty steel bar with a cutting torch. She was obviously board and just started cutting random things up.<br/><br/>But story holes like that can be overlooked if the movie is fun or at least stimulating in some way. Flashdance doesn't offer anything to balance it, however.<br/><br/>The dancing horrible. It is the spastic twitch-and-pose style that ruined American musicals until...well are we really over it yet? The sensuality that the movie tries for is ruined by Jennifer Beal's complete lack of personality. I mean I am a 42 year old male and when she was supposed to be eating lobster my only reaction was to think that she should get a lobster bib.<br/><br/>You can't really get behind Alex and her dreams because her character is so stupid and shallow. The dog had more going on than she did.<br/><br/>The love affair is flat. It comes across as nothing more than a boss with the hots for one of his workers. Zero passion.<br/><br/>Even the final scene where she dances for Orville Redenbacher and some other stiffs is unsatisfying because the panels reaction is so unbelievable. What serious dancers wouldn't roll their eyes at Alex's lame cheerleader routine? In short the movie had nothing but leg-warmers and large sweatshirts. Oh, yeah, there is a good chunk of nudity when Alex ""rescues"" her friend from being a useless erotic dancer (a laughable bit of hypocrisy). Other than that the movie is a waste of time. I wish that the MST3K crew were still in business. This would make good fodder for them."

Just the scene when the girl skates and falls/fails twice while Gloria plays and Laura Branigan laments in the sonic background among luscious synthesizers is probably the finest cinema has ever offered to me. I know it was a commercial Hollywood industry movie aimed at teens and exploiting the breakdance fad but there was heart in it. I don't know who gave this movie its heart but I know it's there cause I felt it last night."
"Sober-Friend","8","2","2","1 April 2018"," A Culture Phenomenon
","Watching this film screams 1980's. However this film to me is just as entertaining now as when it was first released in 1983. <br/><br/>Alex is a welder by day and dancer by night. Her dream is to be able to enter a dance academy but she is afraid of not only getting in but even applying freaks her out. Alex at times is very mature for her age but at times she acts very immature. <br/><br/>The dance sequences in this film along with a great characters and great original soundtrack made this film a huge hit.<br/><br/>I am shocked that this film never got a sequel. Even more shocking is hasn't ( as of 2018) there has not been a remake."
"style-2","Null","10","18","31 January 2005"," What a feeling. What an icky, sticky feeling...
","*Flashdance* -- what a feeling. What an icky, sticky feeling, like cotton candy that you can't get off your fingers -- total Eighties swill that has failed to congeal over time. So many funny, and so many dreadful moments that peck at the memory like a relentless chicken: Jennifer Beals dancing frenetically in place to the unbearable ""Maniac"", removing her bra without removing her sweatshirt, digging her foot into the guys crotch under the tableand the fashion statement  it is one of those rare movies that has a huge impact on fashion. Who among us wasn't ripping our sweatshirts to shreds and wearing legwarmers? Well, maybe not all of us, truebut she was certainly the most stylish welder to come down the pike in quite awhile. But *Flashdance* is not anything so much as a two hour music video about achieving your dream. Winning Oscars, Golden Globes and Grammys, the soundtrack was a huge success. Selling 700,000 copies in two weeks, not only for the title track, but for the regrettably aforementioned ""Maniac"" by Michael Sembello, ""Romeo"" by Donna Summer, and ""He's A Dream"" by Shandi, the soundtrack, along with the look, still haunts aerobics studios today. ""When you let go of your dream, you die."" But he's wrong  when you listen to dialogue like that, you die."
"jimu63","Null","16","32","17 October 2002"," Flashdunce
","I just watched ""Flashdance"" for the first time since it came out and my opinion has not mellowed over time.  I dubbed it ""Flashdunce"" then and it remains ""Flashdunce"" now, a film so lame, inconsequential and annoyingly dumb that it actually made the comparably silly ""Footloose"" look like ""Singing in the Rain"" by comparison.  Actually, I'm being too hard on ""Footloose,"" since it actually had a plot, some interesting characters, and a point-of-view (to say nothing of a POINT), as opposed to the pointless and silly ""Flashdance.""<br/><br/>But then why should I be surprised?  ""Flashdance"" was co-written by notorious flop-meister Joe Eszterhaus, who followed this up with the intelligent ""Jagged Edge,"" then dropped such neutron bombs as ""Basic Instinct,"" ""Showgirls,"" and ""An Allen Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn"" on an unsuspecting public.  At least ""Flashdance""'s seemingly untalented director Adrian Lyne went on to redeem himself with the ""Play Misty for Me"" rip-off ""Fatal Attraction,"" to say nothing of ""Lolita"" and the superior Richard Gere-Diane Lane starrer ""Unfaithful.""  Here he directs the nonexistent story as a serious of brain-numbing music videos, in which the lead actress (Jennifer Beals, who followed this up with an incredibly forgettable film career) is replaced by an obvious double in the dance sequences and then the audience treated like a bunch of idiots when the filmmakers denied a double was used and refused to give her credit for her obvious hard work.  I have long contended that the incredible success of films like ""Flashdance,"" which were written in crayon and cynically slapped together without a thought as to whether the plot makes sense or not, have led to the increasingly abysmal state of Hollywood films which are terribly written and forcefed to a braindead audience of Pavlovian dogs who are trained to drool and devour garbage like this.<br/><br/>Okay the plot:  Beals is Alex, who dreams of a career as a serious dancer. She's only 18, yet she works as a welder by day and an exotic dancer by night.  And by exotic dancer, I mean one that doesn't remove her clothes and gets no more dirty than dousing herself with water and shaking her fully-dressed booty at the audience.  She ends up romancing her wealthy boss, helping out her loser collection of friends whenever she can, and visiting a little-old-lady friend who acts as a defacto grandmother to her. Can you see where this is going?  Will Alex get an audition to the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance?  Will she fall in love with the boss?  Will he help her get an audition?  Will she get mad at her meddling boyfriend/boss, even though she meddles in everyone else's life? Will she see him with his sister and jealously break up with him without even asking who he's with?  Will ""Grandma"" die?  Will she pass her audition? Do we care?<br/><br/>Incidentally, not once does the film answer the most obvious question: just what the hell is a flashdance anyway?  And why did audiences care so much about so little?  Even at 94 minutes the film seems padded.  As for nightmare double features, imagine this:  this film was eventually paired with another megabomb from 1983, the Sylvester Stallone-directed ""Saturday Night Fever"" sequel ""Staying Alive,"" which was rightfully considered the worst film of 1983 (""Flashdance"" being runner-up).  Pity poor Cynthia Rhodes, the beautiful and talented ingenue who is best known for co-starring in the infinitely better ""Dirty Dancing.""  She appeared in both ""Flashdance"" and ""Staying Alive.""  Now, that's what I call a bad year.  (no stars)"
"keren-7","1","18","37","29 June 2006"," Trashdance - lewd, sordid and painful
","I'm a dance teacher and was looking forward to some good dance routines in this film. How sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience. <br/><br/>I had major problems with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex extremely repellent. Beals' face is so young, sweet and innocent, and this very incongruous with Alex's very disturbing lewdness, especially in that disgusting restaurant scene. She also has the temper tantrums of a toddler. It is very difficult to believe that Nick would keep coming back to such a moody teenager after her frequent rantings and ravings, especially after she opens the door of a moving car and chucks a stiletto at him, opting rather to walk home - in the middle of the road - with only one shoe!!!. And what about after her idiotic behaviour after the night at the ballet. In fact, the whole romance was very disturbing - the 30 something year old man going after a girl who looks about 16. Yuck. <br/><br/>As for the dancing, I'm afraid this 80s style is totally dated. What on earth was that TV dance sequence about in the club? Who was supposed to be dancing? I wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in drag! And even that famous final sequence is pretty disappointing, especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company. The camera shots of her leap actually ruin it's effect because you can't see what she's doing. And what on earth was she doing when she went past each of the panel pointing at them? And as many other comments have pointed out, she would NEVER get into a ballet company on the strength of that audition - perhaps that's why they don't actually say at the end whether she was successful or not, the closure is the fact that she overcame her fear in the end. Of the 'Flashdancers', I actually thought the best sequence belonged to Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You could see that she was a real dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is of course if you can get past her appalling costume and makeup. <br/><br/>There were two good bits in this film - the ballet dancers stretching when Alex goes for the first time to apply for an audition - they look so lovely and classy, and at least this helps to underline the difference between her current dance career and the one she aspires to. The other good scene was the break dancing in the street. I also liked the ice skater's parents, they were funny.<br/><br/>Some other random points - who was Hanna and how did Alex get to know her? What was an 18 year old doing living in a converted warehouse all alone? How did she afford that lovely barre and all the furniture?Where were her family? Was that scene in the 'nude' club really necessary? The person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a Disney film needs their head examined. And anyway, what happened to the ice skater? <br/><br/>Many people said the film was poor but they liked the message - don't give up hope, keep on trying, and your dreams will come true. Watch ""The Little Mermaid"" instead."

","Okay - the dancing is done by someone else, the script has a bunch of flaws (dialogue being almost the worst), and the basic premise is absurd - an 18-yo dreaming of starting a career in ballet? (In ballet, you're just about approaching the peak of your career at 18.) <br/><br/>However, the movie has some heart-grabbing moments, the score is wonderful, the girls are pretty, and the moral of the story (keep on trying until you win) is as true as it ever was. This is probably the worst movie you'll ever have a wonderful time watching.<br/><br/>As a past professional dancer, I probably watch this movie about once a year. It's an essential part of any dancer's library, regardless of its flaws."

","Jennifer Beals stars in this guilty pleasure dance classic released in the 80's entitled ""Flashdance"".Michael Nouri and the late Sunny Johnson co-stars. This was an early partnership of partners Jerry Buckheimer and Don Simpson.It was an early film as well directed by Adrian Lyne.<br/><br/>The beauteous Jennifer Beals in her film debut portrays Alex,a Pittsburgh woman who works two jobs as a welder by day at a steel mill and an exotic dancer at night at Mawry's. Then,he meets the owner of the steel bar in Nick Hurley and develops a romance with him.In it,we get to see Alex tries to get into the Conservatory to become a dancer. Will she make it despite her lack of formal dance training? Your guess is as good as mine.<br/><br/>This was obviously a memorable film that earned a lot of money in the box office.It also has great themes such as striving for one's dream no matter how difficult and to never give up despite the odds as well as obstacles achieving them. It was release in a decade when Americans were experiencing lots of economic difficulties. Despite being a cliched and predictable movie,many did enjoy it back when it was released as it gave many hope during difficult times.<br/><br/>As for the performances,Jennifer Beals did a fantastic job despite having to portray a thin character.She was obviously beauteous and charming. While it was evident that she never did any of the dancing in the movie - those were done by doubles such as Marine Jahan and Crazy Legs, the viewer will definitely enjoy the movie and would probably cheer for her character to succeed."
"Desertman84","7","4","6","13 October 2011"," Flashdance Is The Ultimate Guilty Pleasure Classic
","Flashdance probably launched the guilty pleasure classics of the 1980's for which future dance movies such as Footloose and Dirty Dancing followed suit.It was smashed by the critics at the time of its release due to many formulaic movies themes applied to it but it managed to gross more than $100 million at the box office.<br/><br/>The movie was the first collaboration between Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer,the producers of Tom Cruise movies,Top Gun and Days Of Thunder.It stars Jennifer Beals as Alex,a Pittsburgh woman with two jobs as a welder and an exotic dancer wants to get into ballet school.The other stars in the film includes Michael Nouri and Lilia Skala.The film was directed by Adrian Lyne. <br/><br/>The story involves teen-age Alexandra ""Alex"" Owens works as a welder at a steel mill in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during the day, and as a dancer at Mawby's bar in the evenings. She lives alone in a converted warehouse with her pet dog, Grunt. Despite a lack of formal dance training, she aspires to be accepted by a prestigious dance school, the fictional Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance and Repertory. During one of her performances at Mawby's, she attracts the interest of Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), her boss at the steel mill, and he learns that Alex is one of his employees.<br/><br/>Alex goes to the Conservatory to ask for an application form for an audition, but runs out of the building when she realizes that since she lacks formal training and professional experience, she would have to leave much of the form blank. Alex's dance teacher and mentor is a retired ballet dancer named Hanna Long (Lilia Skala), who encourages Alex to pursue her dream of becoming a professional ballet dancer. <br/><br/>After Jeanie falls twice while auditioning for an ice show, she loses confidence in herself and becomes a dancer at The Zanzibar, where she performs in the nude, and Alex goes to the strip club to rescue Jeanie. Alex and Nick become lovers, but he has an ex-wife named Katie (Belinda Bauer), and they have a hostile encounter in a local restaurant. Nick uses his contacts at the Conservatory to secure an audition. Just before the audition, Alex goes to Hanna's house and learns that she has died. At the audition, Alex falls at the beginning of her routine, but starts over and completes the routine successfully. In the final scene, Alex runs out of the Conservatory building with a smile on her face and is hugged by Nick, who gives her a bouquet of red roses. She gives a rose to him, and the film ends with a freeze frame. The ending of the film does not say directly whether Alex wins a place at the Conservatory as a result of her audition.<br/><br/>The movie is characterized,just like what I've said in the first paragraph by numerous elements of guilty pleasures that a viewers seeks in an entertaining movie such as romance,teen-age memories,formulaic themes,predictability,interesting characters, great choreographed dance scenes, and sequences in the style of music videos.Aside from that,it has many memorable original 80's songs classics such as ""Maniac"" by Michael Sembello;""Lady, Lady, Lady"", by Joe Esposito; ""Gloria"" and ""Imagination"" by Laura Branigan; ""I'll Be Here Where The Heart Is"" by Kim Carnes and the Academy Award-winning ""Flashdance... What a Feeling"" by Irene Cara.Of course,the final dance scene at the audition is also worth the mention.<br/><br/>In terms of acting,Jennifer Beals shines in her film debut as Alex.She gives an electrifying performance despite the lack of depth given to her character.Also,she is very engaging as we do care for her character to succeed in her aspirations as a dancer.<br/><br/>Overall,Flashdance can be considered as the ultimate guilty pleasure classic.It was made not to please the critics but to please the audience who wants to relax and would prefer not to go into deep thinking but rather seek pure entertainment when watching a movie.With this objective,the movie delivers."

","Oh boy I just saw this movie on TV after of few years. It is still entertaining but cornball. I remember when it first came out, it was a major hit. And Jennifer Beals was still passing for white. I am glad to see she is not doing that anymore. With movies such as All Saints and shows like the L Word. People actually aspired to be strippers after seeing this movie. Since all it was is a cleaned up stripper movie, not a dance movie. I still think that Flashdance phenomena is still going on to this day. Ever since that movie came out every stripper is a stripper because they use the Flashdance excuse, they are aspiring dancers who are paying for college..school. It is hilarious. The movie is kind of creepy now that I am older but at the time I thought nothing of this 35 year boss chasing after his 19 year old employee. Talk about a lawsuit waiting to happen. Also no way in Pittsburgh will there be a 19 year old arc welder. That is a very good job which takes years to master, a big union job. She surely could afford to go to any school she wanted if she was making welding money. And that bike would of been gone a long time ago with the bad weather Pittsburgh has in the winter. I liked that she did have friends too many of these movies the women seem to have no friends. But just boyfriends and perhaps a family member. And they all got along. I liked that. It was very sad that the actress who played Jeannie, Sunny Johnson, died the next year. She was very popular at the time and I remember being shocked. Jennifer Beals is very engaging in the movie, Micheal Nouri is creepy and entirely too old for her. It was a joke at time when people use to do Jennifer Beals imitations with her running in place to the music Maniac because it was the only scene in the movie you actually saw her face while she moving. What was distracting about the movie was the dance doubles, they did not even have the same body type and in the last scene, the one that is suppose to be the showstopper, that took away from the movie. They actually used a man named crazy legs to do the break dancing spin And you can see it! I was happy to see Cynthia Rhodes who is a real dancer..why didn't they use her for the lead since she could really dance? Since she married Richard Marx she hasn't been seen. I almost forgot about her. She was all over the place in during the 80's. I am happy to see Jennifer Beals career doing well. She really has picked good edgy roles. All in All the movie is very entertaining. Not The Red Shoes , but good for what it is...fluffy, not to be taken seriously. But Nouri is too old for that girl."

","It was a very 80s movie -- the music, the dance, the way people look in the movie. I have only watched it once, and that was more than 10 years ago when I was a kid going to a primary school in Beijing. I am Chinese and I grew up in Beijing, so I don't know how much my opinions reflect the typical audience. This movie made a very deep impression on me. It was in the late 80s when I watched it, and it, along with other movies, introduced me to American culture. And I was just fascinated. I remember for a while everybody in China was doing breakdancing, partly because of _Flashdance_. I realize it is not a very good movie, but for me this movie brings back memory of the 80s, when my friends and I first learned about American culture, and how we tried to learn everything about America as we grew up."
"Theo Robertson","4","8","16","5 January 2005"," A Bad Way To Sell Records
","This movie was Jerry Bruckheimer's idea to sell some records . No seriously it was . The thinking behind it is that if you made a film full of pop songs you could stick the tracks on a LP , sell it and make even more money for the studio . You could also release a few tracks as singles and intercut the promo video with clips from the movie so that when MTV play a track you're actually getting free advertising for the movie . This is a good business deal but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about Hollywood movies from the 1980s and I rate the mid 1980s as the poorest time in artistic terms for American film making and FLASHDANCE opened the door to this "" Let's make a 90 minute pop video instead of a movie "" type film making<br/><br/>Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens a dancer who works as a welder to make ends meet and right away logic disappears with this career choice . Welding is a fairly sophisticated trade , it's not something you walk into and learn in five minutes . There's other gaps in logic like ballet dancing and "" flashdancing "" being somehow similar . ie if you apply to be a ballet dancer and do some hot , dirty flashdancing the male judges might want to meet you after the audition but you won't get the job . it's kind of like saying that screen writing , novel writing and play writing are somehow the same when they're not <br/><br/>But I guess none of this mattered to Jerry when he asked director Adrian Lyne to make the movie . Actually Lyne almost makes a very sexy movie , JenniferBeals is very sweet and innocent looking . Fortunately I sussed out why her face is brightly lit in close up while her silhouette is darkly litin long shots except when the camera cuts to close ups of her heavenly toned body . That's because a body double is used most of the time and frequently the body double is a man ! I bet there's a few naughty boys who are feeling guilty not to mention slightly disgusted to know that"

","I guess my review is aimed for female audiences. Sometimes, you just feel like watching a love story, production values be damned.<br/><br/>Alex Owens (Jennifer Beals) is Pennsylvania steel mill worker by day; exotic dancer by night. This is all meant to delude her, and pass time, until she finally gains the courage to follow her dream of going to dance school at some posh ballet academy. We see that she has the talent, but she doesn't have the courage to follow through. It seems her friends share the same experiences--figuring out how to make their mark. Cue Nick Hurley, Alex's boss and soon-to-be love interest, who is her last bit of hard encouragement to finally audition for the ballet school. Of course, you can probably guess how it ends. The story is quite cliched.<br/><br/>Flashdance is probably best remembered for the dance numbers, particularly the finale, though the ones performed in the club--which have an air of music video style--are quite cool to see. And yes, as another viewer mentioned, many are probably familiar with a few hit numbers on the soundtrack ('maniac' and 'what a feeling'). But shucks, if you're just a sucker for romantic movies (particularly those of the 80s), then you'll likely enjoy this one. It doesn't take anything too seriously, but at least the characters aren't so annoying and obnoxious. It is just a simple, pleasant story about a girl who falls in love, and is encouraged to work hard for something she wants and that, if she constantly doubts her abilities, then nothing will become of it and that ain't too cool."

","Pittsburgh welder (Jennifer Beals, easily the best looking welder I have ever seen)/night-time exotic dancer dreams of a better life by becoming a ballet dancer. She has nervousness and inferiority complexes galore, but she is a good person with a good heart and soul. Soon she finds love from her day-time boss (Michael Nouri, who knows she is a stripper) and constant encouragement from him and an elderly German lady (the priceless Lilia Skala of ""Lilies of the Field"" fame some 20 years before this was released). Typical situations occur with soap opera-styled results and a smashing soundtrack that represents the very best the 1980s had to offer in the way of cinematic music dominates the action. What a feeling! ""Flashdance"" is pretty tame by director Adrian Lyne's standards (think ""9 1/2 Weeks"", ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""Unfaithful""). This fact does not really benefit or take away from the picture though. The characters are likable, but seem so phony and under-developed. For a time though every girl of the age wore those shirts that hung off one shoulder and every man wanted to be cool like Nouri and be with a hot woman like Beals (ah, the 80s). And of course naturally everyone had to have that soundtrack (which of course was highlighted by ""What a Feeling""---the runaway Best Original Song Oscar winner for 1983). The movie is full of pop icon aspects, hot sounds and hotter songs. But when watching the film, you will wonder when is that song I love so much going to be played. Well don't fear, after about 110 minutes of drivel-heavy dialogue your wish will come true. The microcosms of the 1980s in the motion picture business---what a feeling! 2.5 out of 5 stars."

I really love the last part when the lead actress when ahead with the audition in this prestigious theatre. Despite the fact that she never had any dancing in her entire life, ( which she is required to fill up in the audition form, and she do not have any dancing shoes ) she still went for it. Her moves were marvelous, combining the moves of break-dance, ballet, street-dance and most importantly, flashdance. Even though she failed 1 or 2 times in the audition, she take her chances seriously and she was accepted by the judges. So I would really recommend this show to everyone, whether young or old, male or female."

","The definition of the word ""Movie"" states that a movie is: ""A contiguous series of video frames (and optionally synchronized audio) that are displayed fast enough to provide the illusion of motion. A frame rate of 30 frames per second is a typical target for a movie."" that said, I really don't see why people pick on this movie because it doesn't have a plot. I'd understand if people don't like the plot, but to those of you who think FlashDance's a joke because it doesn't look like a movie, I say gimme a break. This picture has a simple plot, perhaps, a story about a wielder/dancer going for her dream and falling in love with a man might not be enough for a lot of viewers. however, the movie en-powered itself with what is arguably the best ORIGINAL movie soundtrack of all time, I think someone mentioned earlier, if the studio was to release every song on the sound track as a single, then everyone one of them could have topped charts. And, those who didn't like the movie also complained about acting, well now, I personally thought there was great acting on Jennifer's part. I think, maybe what people do not see is that, given the plot, there was only so much to act for, so instead, she created an attitude, which translated into the music, the cloth, and everything else in the movie. and that, made the movie an icon. The fact that Flashdance made a huge impact on people(hell, it defined a whole generation!!)just like any other memorable moving pictures, is more than enough for me to say it's an excellent movie."

","This is the kind of movie where everything is a prelude to the climatic  sequence with the ""Oh, What A Feeling"". Jennifer Beals is cast as the  main star of only her second film. The rest of the cast is a group of  little known support players. Biels is the star and this remains her  best film.  The climatic sequence is the main draw to this film. The viewer forgets  almost everything else in the film once you see it. I say almost  because the most often published photo graph of Beals pulling that long  shirt over her buff 20 year young body does get a lot of attention & is  memorable to be sure. That photo was used to sell tickets.  This very much early 80's period piece is an OK movie with a great  song. It is not a classic film but if this were your blind date, you'd  enjoy the date but unless forced too, you might fore-go a second one."

This was one such film.<br/><br/>One an initial level, I admire it immensely artistically – it's beautifully shot, and the lighting is amongst the best I've ever seen, hazy, dim, soft and warm, it really added to the atmosphere. And then there was just the catalogue of amazing scenes, from the strobe dance in the club against the white background (an epileptic fit waiting to happen, I'd have thought it'd warn you on the box), the scene outside the club in the driving rain when she drags out the semi-naked Jeannie, the dance in the spray at the start and of course the final audition.<br/><br/>The acting is great, too, especially Beale, who is extremely empathic whilst remaining feisty and full of character. The story moves quick and visually the film is very distinctive. Some scenes seem pretty risqué for the time, though never forced, and the dialogue is excellent and well delivered. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is pretty perfect too, most of it written by Moroder so that's to be expected. The way the songs connect with every scene is so skillful and understated. They also got all the little things right, such as locations and choice of shot. One of the most perfect films I've ever watched. The only criticism is the ending, which is abrupt. And it also feels very 80s, which I think is a good thing but some may find aspects dated."

People wonder where the style changes come from, well they come from movies and this one Changed Life, Dance and style as we know it today. The movie had a kind of vibe that let you know to ""follow your dream"" and enjoy your life, love and most of all Dance. It added the love of your elders mixed with the life of the young.

It is almost like the movie was created to go around the music.  <br/><br/>Jennifer Beals plays a lonely, attractive, yet scared 18-year-old woman, even though she acts much older.  She is mature, intelligent, strong, and full of life.  Any man, including myself, would go gaga for a woman like this.   But, most importantly, she chases her dream.  It is this part of the movie that I feel captures the entire film.  The main character, as well as other side characters, chase their dreams even though they are all scared to death of failure. Some of them do fail but some succeed in varying degrees. They all chase what they want out of life and that is truly the message of the movie. The ending you will have to witness for yourself but every time I see it I get goose bumps.  It makes me feel like I can do anything I put my mind to. Excellent film.  Highly recommended."

"bob the moo","Null","4","8","28 December 2003"," Memorable images and a few catchy tunes do not a good film make
","Alex works at a steel plant during the day and as an exotic dancer in the evenings to try and make money to get by.  Her ultimate dream though is to get into an exclusive dance school and train to become one of the top ballet dancers.  Even though it seems impossible her boyfriend encourages her and she trains hard and sticks at it to make her dream come true.<br/><br/>The reasons why this film was so popular and has remained so well known are bewildering to me.  The film's main selling points are the few catchy tunes (`what a feeling' being the most memorable) and pop music video images, these are the things that have stuck in the mind (and been repeated in other music videos) but the film itself lacks anything of substance whatsoever.<br/><br/>The plot is very weak.  Another user compared it to Saturday Night Fever with the genders swapped but that is just unfair, Flashdance has no plot to speak of and, when it does try to act events and depth to the characters it just doesn't work.  Instead it frequently just falls back on dance numbers in the strip club or footage to music of Alex welding or somewhat.  The striptease dances are a total joke - I'm not sure what they were seen as then, but now, when lapdance clubs are the mainstream for men and women, the over-designed things that go on in the club here are just silly and certainly wouldn't draw the club of working men that supposedly pack the place out.<br/><br/>Beals is pretty poor apart from looking good semi-dressed.  As a welder she looks so out of place it's funny, and delivering her lines she feels just as unnatural.  I would love to say that she did such a good job dancing but a lot of that was picked up by Marine Jahan (who clearly didn't do enough for a credit!).  None of the rest of the cast make any impression at all - Nouri's boyfriend is bland and all the rest are working class clichés to a man.<br/><br/>Overall this film is all style and no substance whatsoever.  Why it was so successful or has remained so well known is a mystery but must be down to a few memorable scenes that stick in the mind and work as music videos rather than anything else.  If you haven't seen this film then what would probably be preferable for you is to track down the video for Jennifer Lopez's `I'm Glad' (she released it on dvd single) - it is basically the film of Flashdance with all the memorable scenes put into a montage for the one song.  It is shorter than the film, sexier than the film and has almost as much substance."
"hunkyguys85","4","4","8","9 September 2001"," SPOILERS Could've been better, could've been worse SPOILERS
","SPOILERS, BEWARE!!!  Flashdance is a fair movie, in my opinion.  Some things do confuse me about it (e.g. Jeanie asks Alex how long it took for her to get so good at dancing; Alex replies ""About 25 years,"" isn't Alex supposed to be 18?) and some things do fascinate me about it (I LOVED the spins!). Overall, though, it intrigued me.  When this movie was made, I wasn't even born.  I didn't really experience the eighties (I was born in '85) and I have to wonder: sometimes Alex would just run in place a bit, or throw herself all over, not really dancing, just banging in to things, tossing her head back, and waving her arms-was this considered ""dancing"" back then?  If it was, I'm not sure I could've standed it.  The spins, the flip, the fluid movements were great, but some of it-my neighbor's toddler could've done better!  Also, if Alex is a welder during the day, wouldn't she be tired after a hard day's work?  When she doesn't go to work for nearly a week, wouldn't she be laid off?  Living in a warehouse-I can almost see it, but not quite.  It doesn't seem right that she's a welder, owns a warehouse house, AND is trying to get into ballet.  None of it really makes sense.  I shouldn't be too judgemental considering my own background, but please. Maybe Jennifer Beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder, I don't know.  But either way, they could've picked a better actress.  The actors were fine.  I even liked the romance.  You make your own decision.  But mine is-rent it once, don't see it again-it isn't worth it."
"tedg","Null","5","11","26 September 2007"," Thugs do Pretty
","There are dirty, moneygrubbing thugs in this movie, not ashamed to make money from sex. They operate a strip club, from which one of the characters is ""rescued."" This movie is made by the same sort of moneygrubbing thugs (Gruber, Peters, Bruckheimer) , and there's no doubt that sex is at the top of its values. It has essentially no story, only a series of setups. Its clearly designed to sell music, which then was LPs.<br/><br/>And yet it works for me. The reason is that its cinematic, a and finely so. I'm usually pretty tough on films that feature dance, unless the camera itself dances. This one doesn't. But what it does have is crisp editing and superb, absolutely superb lighting.<br/><br/>I think dePalma started this and did the stuff that works, the storyboards, the lighting design. I imagine he supervised the scouting of the dirty sets where we see smoke, glow and sparks. I imagine he worked out the tricks where the face is occluded so that we can swap our actress with real dancers, several of them.<br/><br/>So you can find three things to like here: the fold where the smarmy guys are in the movie, the fantastic lighting, beginning with the very fist shots, and the dancing. It almost seems as if the dancing came after the major cinematic decisions. It was unusual for the time: more energetically sensual. Tight in energy but lose in inspiration. All of the dances have an on screen audience, but one: the ""manic"" dance. That lack of on screen audience after the deliberate inclusion of one invites us in. <br/><br/>And this dance is photographed differently. We don't see the whole body: we see parts, and while the camera doesn't spatially move, it does temporally. The editors dance. The visual rhythm invokes voyeurism, identification and syncopation all at the same time. This is significant movie-making, hidden in a rather trivial-seeming wrapper. <br/><br/>Gruber at the time advertised this as ""Rocky with a woman,"" but there's no resemblance story-wise. There is with the energy though.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"colorsflashing","4","2","3","5 January 2019"," Not the worst film ever....
","There are worse films out there. There are.<br/><br/>This one is a little like ""Showgirls"" in that 1) it is not a good movie; 2) it didn't do much for its star's career (although unlike ""Showgirls"" it wasn't a total career-ender); 3) the lead character is someone with serious temper/behavioral issues, who can be seen running into traffic after pitching a fit; and 4) Joe Eszterhas wrote the screenplay for both. The big differences are that ""Showgirls"" has better dialogue and is not boring, and its premise is more believable. It also has significantly more nudity and is rated ""X,"" but the fact that we don't have to watch Nomi at confession makes up for that.<br/><br/>In this movie, Alex (Jennifer Beals) is an 18-year-old welder (?- how did she get that job??) at a steel company in Pittsburgh, and apparently rides her bike 40-50 miles every day. So she is very physically fit, but smokes. We don't know anything about her background or her actual family. She lives in an abandoned warehouse that has no other tenants but does have running water and utilities. She has a little old lady friend Hanna (Lilia Skala) who was once a ballet dancer. At night, clearly not wearied from her welding job, Alex dances at a local bar called Mawby's, where the dancers have fancy stage sets, fancy outfits, new routines every night, and don't have to take off their clothes. You know, a completely typical blue-collar bar. Her 35-year-old boss Nick (the luscious Michael Nouri) sees her dancing there and woos her, and eventually they decide to go out. Across the way is the evil pit of depravity called ""Zanzibar"" where the dancers have to abandon all hope and be naked, and is run by ""Johnny C,"" who looks to be the poor man's version of Robert De Niro.<br/><br/>The movie tells us, ""when you give up your dream, you die."" Alex has dreams, as do her friends. One friend, Jeanie, is actually a talented skater, but messes up at a competition held at a poorly-lit ice rink. Nick says she will do better next time, but Alex informs him that there won't be a next time, without further explanation. I guess in this world, if at first you don't succeed, you are consigned to laying on your back on a table at the Zanzibar, allowing drooling drunks to eyeball your crotch as you move your legs in circles, until Alex shows up, drags you (mostly naked) out to the street, and yells at you that that isn't dancing. Another friend, Richie, wants to be a stand-up comic, and thinks the road to success is telling Polish jokes. At one point he takes off for Los Angeles to seek his fame and fortune, but apparently when he doesn't become a big star in 5 days, returns to Pittsburgh, more of a loser than when he left. Technically Jeanie and Richie are not deceased, but since they failed at their dreams and will never pursue them again, their drab future in their insignificant lives in blue-collar Pittsburgh is a metaphor for death. I do not know if this movie was very popular in blue-collar Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>At 35, Nick (Alex' boss) is a socially powerful millionaire, and is on the board of the ""Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance and Repertory,"" where Alex aspires to become a ballet dancer, even though she has no idea what is involved, and even though it bears absolutely no resemblance to any dancing she ever does. Or even any practicing that she ever does. When she goes to the PCDR to pick up an application form, she is standing in line with other people. They are wearing pointe shoes (really? to go get an application?) while she is wearing her clod hoppers. On her way through the building to get the application, she has to pass multiple ballet dancers who are extremely white, who are in what appears to be a museum hallway, practicing their bends, and apparently communicating with each other silently, perhaps with telepathy. To paraphrase Mozart from the movie ""Amadeus"": people so lofty they look as if they zh*t marble. The presence, and numbers, of these heavenly, taciturn creatures evidently intimidate little miss welder half to death, and she flees to Hanna's house, and lies about getting an application. Guilt over her lie causes her to go to church, and we are forced to sit through her awkward confession (not the only time in this movie, regrettably).<br/><br/>Nick discovers that Alex wants to be a ballet dancer, and using his clout, instructs the snooty applications office secretary (Lucy Lee Flippin) to make sure Alex gets an invite, which humorously almost causes the secretary to choke on her sandwich.<br/><br/>Well, there's a bunch of meaningless back-and-forth when Alex finds out that she didn't get the invite all by herself, yadda yadda yadda. But then Hanna dies, and as Alex tearfully holds Hanna's ratty old pointe shoes, she realizes that she actually has to make an effort to pursue her dream, and unlike her friends, can't just give up at the first sign of adversity. This of course leads us to the famous climax, where Alex dances for the PCDR committee. Although she doesn't dance ballet. But dadgummit she is going to show those pompous, cold people real, passionate dancing! Bring them out of their shells! Point at them in turn! Show them there is life and talent teeming outside of the silent marble halls which they inhabit! And indeed, after a false start, she has them tapping their toes, and even the snooty secretary is won over.<br/><br/>As I said at the beginning of this review, there are worse movies. This is just a lot of illogical fluff, and as others have pointed out, is really just music videos strung together by a weak story. Could have been worse, but it also could have been a lot better."
"Fluke_Skywalker","7","2","3","15 January 2016"," What a feeling
","Astronaut John Glenn once said (about seeing earth from outer space) ""To look out at this kind of creation and not believe in God is to me impossible"". I bring this up because I more or less said the same thing when Jennifer Beals first lifted up her welding mask in 'Flashdance'. Wow. But she's more than a pretty face. The material may only be thimble deep, but Beals brings just the right mix of energy, grit and old fashioned spunk to the part and instantly gets us on her side. That she was only 18 at the time is mind boggling. No, it's not her dancing, and this is painfully obvious on a large HD TV, but she does just fine with the dramatic heavy lifting, such as it is.<br/><br/>Born out of the BIG Bang that was MTV, 'Flashdance' became a phenomenon in 1983. Marrying the visual style of the former with an old fashioned underdog tale in the spirit of Rocky, it captured people's imagination and remains a well loved guilty pleasure for many. So much so that it recently inspired a musical in the UK that has since traveled the U.S. as well.<br/><br/>It does one no good to hold the film up to any sort of deep scrutiny. Just put on your legwarmers and go with the beat. What a feeling."
"brookega","Null","2","3","11 February 2001"," Time changed my view on this one
","OK, being a child of the '80s, of course I loved the movie the first few times I saw it. Suspension of disbelief is much easier at 13. Now, being 30, I just rewatched it, and my perspective is quite different.<br/><br/>How did I not notice before that the male lead ""Nick"" is a total stalker?!?!?! He first hires a guy to find out who ""Alex"" is after he sees her dancing. He hunts her down at her job at the steel mill, and she brushes him off. Not convinced, he waits for her outside the bar where she dances at night, and when she refuses a ride from him, he follows her home. After they get together, he watches her go into the Ballet Company, and even after she tells him to go to hell, he finds out where her audition is, kidnaps her dog, and waits outside the building for her. OK, that is just creepy.<br/><br/>Adding to the creepiness is that she is only 18! 18 YEARS OLD!!!! He's like 40 something. It's almost like a weird father/daughter thing going on. EEEWWWWW."
"hwesz","10","1","1","8 June 2020"," Love this movie
","I absolutely love this movie! It chronicles the story of a young women encouraging her friends to try and succeed (or fail) at their passions while she waits on the sideline for her big chance, afraid to take the plunge at her own dream.<br/><br/>Alex is a beautiful woman who works in a steel mill by day, but at night dances which is her true passion. She longs to be a professional dancer and pursue her dreams of being on stage but is too afraid to go out and get it. She is a loyal friend and encourages her pals to go out and give it their all while she stays stagnant.<br/><br/>In pure 80's fashion, the movie plot isn't a masterpiece (imagine how they remade footloose in the 2000's and it seemed odd and very out of place) but I find it to be genuine and kinda heartfelt as you root for Alex throughout the film and watch her pick up her friends to dust them back off so they can get ""back on the horse"" so to speak. I recommend this movie to everyone and anyone, although you have to keep in mind the timeframe in which is was made. It's a great movie...but it's not all that good."
"patriciogl10","8","1","1","4 December 2019"," A great '80s film.
","Flashdance is a good film, carried almost entirely by Jennifer Beals acting performance and dancing performance. Despite these acts being the central appeal of the film, there is also a nice story set to serve as context that encourages the pursuit of dreams, in spite of reality constantly knocking on the door. It was a daring move to showcase a female steel worker moonlighting as an exotic dancer, it was courageous to show a female lead working to jobs on her own, with no male support whatsover, she's her own woman. Adrian Lyne has always portrayed smart,
determined and brave women in his films, Jennifer Beals' Alex Owens being one of his firsts.<br/><br/>Primarily known for its dance audition scene, along with some exotic dance scenes famously displayed in Irene Cara's What a Feeling music video, although this film is much more than just dancing, it's about the passion of it, giving all that it takes to make it professionally, to have a unique opportunity and seize it, about standing up on your own two feet and chasing your dreams.<br/><br/>It highly evokes nostalgia, because it screams 80s, that's why is so enjoyable, apart from the dancing. So revisit, re-live it, or watch it if you haven't, I wouldn't call this a classic but it's a well-known '80s movie that deserves to be seen."
"breckstewart","6","1","1","10 April 2019"," The Music and the Dancing is What Matters
","I was a teenager when I saw this movie and since I didn't go to a movie house very often in those days (even less now), of course the movie had an impact on me. But what I remember mostly from my perception back then was how great the music was and how the dancing was out of this world.<br/><br/>This said, I hadn't seen it since then and I wanted to watch it again with an adult perspective to review things properly. It might be unfair to judge Flashdance with our modern eyes since as an audience we are so much more sophisticated being deluged with special effects and amazing technical achievements in movies then we all were in the 1980's.<br/><br/>But even as a 15 year old and not knowing much of anything about editing or technical aspects of movie making, I remember that I instantly noticed that the dancing was not done by the same person. This is no big secret now and is even mentioned in the trivia here but Marine Jahan was the one who danced in most of the sequences that were supposed to be done by Jennifer Beals. I recall being startled at just how carelessly they had filmed Marine in medium shot with her face clearly visible in many segments inter cut with a few shots of Beals in close ups to maintain the illusion.<br/><br/>I also remember an award show in those days where they finally exposed the truth that Marine Jahan was the dancing double and she even performed a dance routine that blew me away. I can just imagine how frustrating it must have been for her not even being credited here or anywhere else for her work. Her dancing is amazing and I don't know why they couldn't use someone who could act the scenes as well as dance but I guess we're talking about a different era.<br/><br/>Today of course, they would find an actress who can dance or a dancer who can act and they do exist. This brings me back to the ultimate frustration I felt with this movie. Cynthia Rhodes has a small part as Tina Tech one of the dancers and I will never figure out why they didn't give her the lead part of Alex Owens. Not only was Rhodes gorgeous and an amazing dancer (her one big dancing scene is the highlight of the movie to me...) but she could also act. She deserved that part but I guess Beals had something that the producers preferred.<br/><br/>I have to say that I was disappointed in Jennifer's performance. For some reason, I didn't connect with her portrayal and even though she is the lead, the fact that I keep seeing someone else's face every time Alex dances pulls me out of the story which by the way, isn't much at all. Nothing really happens and except for the dance scenes which are spectacular, nothing else attracted my attention.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my final point. This is I think one of the very first movies that was truly made successful by the soundtrack. The music is of course the main star of this movie and on that front, they struck gold. Even today, those songs are so powerful that they uplift the so-so movie into the stratosphere.<br/><br/>So a 6 star rating felt fair because even though this is by means a great movie and should mostly be viewed as a collection of music videos, the dancing and the music makes it an enjoyable depiction of an era gone by and I for one can respect the fact that this became such a monster hit that it defined a whole generation."

However, at its core, it has heart, soul, and passion. It also has the drive to send its message clear, stay close to your dreams, but try to make it a reality. Do what you love to do, and you will never have to work a day in your life. I felt the movie depended way too strongly on the dancing and the music, which left what remained of the film hollow and weak. And Jennifer Beals just wasn't a strong enough actress to pull this off. Can't overlook it. Sorry. All in all, I think Flashdance served its purpose for its time, it made a lot of money, and love it or hate it, but you can't knock it...it's an iconic film of 1983."
"justin-fencsak","6","1","1","13 February 2018"," What a feeling!!!
","When Flashdance first came out nearly 35 years ago this year, it became a surprise hit at the box office during an era when MTV was dominating young people's minds and the top film at the box office was a return of a Jedi, complete with Ewoks. It's still popular to this day thanks to countless tv airings, and the music video style editing that was a hallmark of the movie. That, and the soundtrack, which parts of it are on spotify. Jennifer Beals plays a small down girl working at a steel factory in Pittsburgh when she gets the job as a dancer. She then falls in love with the guy of his dreams while facing personal issues. Anyone who has seen the popular Peanuts cartoon ""Flashbeagle"" will see where it came from."
"iquine","3","1","1","1 November 2017"," Better Soundtrack Than Movie
","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>With a story as thin as a White Castle burger, the story gets totally squashed by the vibrant and avant-guard dance scenes which are over the top 80s in style. The director failed at evoking any emotion from the young protagonist dancer who tries to work her way from, believe it or not, a welder to getting accepted to a prestigious dance school. The failings lie within a story that is choppy, unfocused, poorly paced and edited. That being said, there is a killer break dancing scene and I give it credit for actually focusing on the dancing, more than other 80s dance-focused movies, which are boldly memorable. Lastly, why are there so many scenes of people walking down industrial train tracks in the 80s? There was a random scene of that here too."
"moonspinner55","6","4","9","26 March 2006"," A nice piece of movie-candy, though with some gross, inappropriate humor...
","From the soundtrack music to the break dancing to Jennifer Beals' big poof 'do, everything about ""Flashdance"" looks and feels like old news. Even the steel mill setting is passé (most of the steel mills in Pennsylvania went under due to Japan's steel at cheaper prices). However, at the time of its release, ""Flashdance"" was a piece of movie-candy, with a romance subplot between welder/dancer Beals and boss Michael Nouri that is exceptionally sweet. Lilia Skala has a pleasant supporting bit as a former ballerina and the late Sunny Johnson (who died while this picture was still in theaters) shows echoes of Sharon Tate in ""Valley of the Dolls"": vulnerable, naked, and touchingly doomed playing Beals' ice-skater friend. Unfortunately, there are some really ungainly jokes in the film (re: 'honkies', small penises, Polish jokes, a gross lesbian joke, and a real stinker about cockroaches in hamburgers), but the basic outline of the picture, corny though it may be, still works a little magic. It's hard not to get worked up by the propulsive editing in the final scenes and during Beals' ""Maniac"" number. But looking at it now is just a little bit embarrassing. **1/2 from ****"

"Silverzero","Null","3","6","15 August 2003"," Tacky, outdated 80's dance flick falls flat in the test of time.
","The dance flick- after the professional death of the musical, the `dance' genre took over in the late 70's with `Saturday Night Fever'. Of course the main problem with this new type of movie was the fact that the music would soon become outdated as times and attitudes went by. And `Flashdance' is the epitome of this doomed genre. Cheesy music, tacky clothes, big hair, fuzzy images- 80's enthusiasts only. <br/><br/>In fact the only times in which this is actually good is when Irene Cara's Oscar winning song swoops onto the soundtrack. So, a good 90% of `Flashdance' is absolute drivel. The limp narrative bumbles along and is weaker than one would have imagined. Perhaps it would have been a better picture had it focused on the protagonist and she alone. But too much attention is put on supporting characters and their boring stories.<br/><br/>
Weak, unimaginative, thoroughly formulaic directing styles don't help matters either. To put it as bluntly as possible, there is little if anything good about this perceptibly low-budget film. The main character (Alex) isn't interesting or unusual enough to be worthy of anything more than a passive attention. Alex is nicely, though not brilliantly, portrayed by Jennifer Beals. The (then) 18-year-old actress shows talent but has completely wasted her potential on made-for TV movies ever since. Meanwhile, the unrecognisable supporting players, a who's who of `Where are they now?' are the cinematic equivalent of walking, talking clichés. I could go into depth about how mediocre they are, but I just couldn't be bothered.<br/><br/>
If you have photosensitive epilepsy, I advise you to stay away from `Flashdance'. You will either have a seizure or you won't make it out alive. One scene carries on with gratuitous strobe lighting for what seems like 10 minutes. Even if you're not an epileptic, you should stay away. Of course it eventually dances its way to a feel-good end that was semi-parodied in that Geri Halliwell music video. It leaves a good-taste, but doesn't compensate for the unforgivable dross that proceeds. <br/><br/>A flat, shallow effort from everyone involved, the only saving grace is an above average turn from Jennifer Beals and Irene Cara's `What a Feeling'. I could go on for another while, but I'll summarise with this statement. `Flashdance' is a near dancing disaster. My IMDb rating: 3.8/10."

","OK. Let's face it, folks - If you actually took away Flashdance's ""Giorgio Moroder""-driven soundtrack, as well as the impressive dance sequences where the uncredited Marine Jahan doubled for Jennifer Beals (who couldn't dance her way out of a wet, paper bag) - Then (Yes. Indeed) this dull-edged story about an 18-year-old welder-cum-dancer (Can you believe such a preposterous scenario as that?) would have been a major flop-eroo like no other. <br/><br/>Released in 1983 to great fanfare - Flashdance was produced on a relatively modest budget of just $7 million. Yet. In its first year, alone, it actually grossed over $200 million, worldwide, at the box-office.<br/><br/>And, speaking about anyone seriously thinking about taking up welding as a means of employment - Believe me - It's definitely one of those super-unhealthy trades where one is up close and inhaling all sorts of noxious fumes and gases, non-stop. Yep. Being a welder will fry your brain in not time flat."

","I really can't fathom as to why this was such a box office smash. Yes. It has an amazing soundtrack, it's flashy, glossy, glitzy, and hip, but there isn't much story to speak of. It feels like a feature length MTV film, with all of the arresting images, but I wasn't sucked in from the story. Alex's character (Jennifer Beals) isn't given nearly enough detail as to why we should root for her. All we really know is that she lives in a small town, and works for her money, and she wants to be a dancer. I didn't buy her as a welder, either. I would have liked to see more of her downfalls. Jennifer Beals is the heart & soul of this movie, yet it focuses much more on glitzy images, more than a coherent story. The love story between Beals & Nouri is extremely clumsy and laughable at times. Michael Nouri can't act worth a lick, and neither can Beals, but at least she looked fantastic. Whether she had a double or not, watching Beals practice a dance routine to one of the best songs ever, Maniac is extremely sexy, and it was probably my highlight of the film. With all the sweat flying, peaks at her gorgeous flesh, and her amazing body, it's hard not to notice. Jennifer Beals swears a lot in this movie, and throws a rock through Nouri's house window at one point (!) It's the 80's, so this style of movie is to be expected. I loved the 80's, but I cannot figure out why people flocked to see this movie. There is nothing special about it what so ever. I realize it's about living the dream, but it's all so routine and shallow. It's worth watching for the sake of the gorgeous Jennifer Beals, but it's pretty average stuff. <br/><br/>5/10"

","This movie tries to pass off a stretching scene as a dance sequence. By the way, it is not a good idea to bounce when stretching, that's how muscles get pulled. Actually I was hoping Jennifer would pull a muscle, but she doesn't. Showing an endless tight shot of a butt jiggling to music isn't really a dance sequence either. From the movie it's obvious that Adrian Lyne understands the difference between cheerleading, gymnastics and actual dancing. On the positive side there aren't enough movies made about welders, so I gotta give credit to writer for coming up with that profession. Although a more interesting premise would have been about a ballet dancer dreaming of becoming a welder."

","I don't remember watching Flashdance(It's a chick flick right) but my opinion is pretty much on par with the general consensus- Flashdance is a perfect example of a movie that's better known for its impact on pop culture than for what exists on celluloid. It is not a particularly good film, nor is it memorable on its cinematic merits. It proffers cheesy drama, amateurish acting, and a staple fairy tale plot. But it was a huge success. Part of that had to do with the music - the soundtrack album was amazingly successful. The movie became a pop culture touchstone, much like Saturday Night Fever in the late '70s and Dirty Dancing in the late '80s. With the Musical all-but-dead in this era, melodramas containing song-and-dance elements were able to capitalize on the opening. Given Flashdance's popularity in 1983 and its continuing name recognition during the quarter-century since its release, it's surprising that Hollywood has not yet gotten around to remaking it. It's probably only a matter of time. Only for musical lovers."

From the first second onwards it blasts 80's synthesizer-sound in your eardrums, you see the typical hairstyles and clothes (that you would instantly relate to that era in your head). It's just a perfect emulation of that period of time, i felt like i was there, totally immersed and ready to go. <br/><br/>So regarding the atmosphere it was just perfect for me. In addition Jennifer Beals as the main character Alex Owens delivers an enchanting performance. She acts in a natural and relatable way, i was with her from the beginning till the end and felt all of her struggle to become a professional dancer. Her female role also struck me as rather atypical. She works in a man dominated job, she is living her life on her own and takes the active part in her relationship to the male love-interest. <br/><br/>It's impressing how dynamic and fast-paced the movie is, there is not a single moment that leaves you bored. To me it represents a perfect example of a feel good movie.<br/><br/>Even though i seem to only have praise for it, i am completely aware that there are multiple doubtful performances and that story-wise it has not that much to offer. It's not something you think about for days or something that leaves a deeper and lasting impression inside of you. But it leaves you with a smile on your face, with energy in your feet and makes you ready to dance yourself.<br/><br/>Yeah I know that all mostly sounds like I am an all-out fanboy, but what should you do when you catch the Feeling?"

","So this movie, the first film I saw at the Chinese Grauman's upon moving to L.A., has one of the great 80's soundtracks of all time, in addition to a standard Cinderella story of a struggling dancer who wants to get out of her nighttime exotic dancing job into one of the big dance schools in Pittsburgh. She works as a welder to make a living and deals with all sorts of sexual harassment which she handles like a pro. She's certainly able to take care of herself and nobody's going to mess with her unless she wants to be messed with. She's Jennifer Beals, a sort of here today, whatever happened to them tomorrow sort of star who hasn't quite had the A list career she started off with, but then she hasn't quite faded into obscurity either. I found her very likable and wanted to see more of her, but if there's anything in her career that she'll always be remembered for, at least as a cult actress, it will be ""Flashdance"".<br/><br/>This has a rough around the edges feel to it with its Pittsburgh street life view, and director Adrian Lyne (""Fatal Attraction"") gets much of the gritty side of that Pennsylvania city quite right. She has the right man (the handsome Michael Nouri) and the right attitude to succeed in finding her dreams, so what a feeling you know she'll have once that dream is achieved. She also has her own real life fairy godmother (Oscar winning Lilia Skala), so there's never any doubt that this will have the standard Hollywood ending. Kyle T. Heffner is amusing as Beals' struggling stand-up comic pal. While a decent actress with presence, Beals does not do her own dancing which gave this film some bad press when it came out with all of the out of work dancers/actresses possibly more qualified for the role. The music is fun, the energy filled with a really retro 80's atmosphere, and in spite of being cheesy when I look back on it nearly 35 years later, I have fond memories of it."

","It takes practice to probe ourselves for insight of how we felt about something, it's not easy. Easier to numb ourselves, watch and forget it afterwards, but in this way we never really know anything. This is also in a roundabout way the point behind musicals, easy to be numbed, takes practice to probe and push yourself to create something that is true.<br/><br/>The enemy of the protagonist in the musical or dance film then is compromise, mediocrity. It's the nagging worry that life will never amount to something, it will be drowned in routine—the antidote is dance, love, staging the circumstances that will permit purity of expression. In the musical this usually took the shape of showmen and women fighting to stage a show that sublimates the difficulties, this is also the case here, but with a twist.<br/><br/>A final show is promised early on, a dance audition that makes or breaks her future (she thinks), failing which she's going to become just another 9 to 5 person chasing after the next bill. The place is glum Pittsburgh, she works in a factory by day. Around her we see the people who have been numbed by failure, lost their color—the failed comedian, her ice-rink dancer friend who ends up on the floor of a sleazy titty bar after a bad performance.<br/><br/>They could have done something here. A bleak urban landscape instead of Broadway, the factory as the place where self is constructed to be only another cog in the machine—and yet in this place, dance, expression, sexuality. Her latenight show (she's an exotic dancer by night) struggling to find purity and truth in the midst of cheap thrills, still exhilarating in spite of how viewers consume it. Can dance become routine? Does it matter how the viewers see it?<br/><br/>Their twist was something else. The final show is always postponed and the fight to stage it and dream to be someone are dredged from a pseudo Cassavetes desperation about life instead of using the snappy cadence of the musical. A bit of dance in the beginning and end and the whole middle is an hour of wallowing. The idea must have been, first make the viewer bleed, serve us 'reality' instead of a musical fairytale.<br/><br/>But what I see is no less of a fairytale. <br/><br/>A materialism about the difficulties but when it comes to the last release, the dance audition, we go back to the snappy, idealized Hollywood dance we expected all along. She triumphs of course. An awestruck committee member claps childishly at how good. The slice- of-life was merely an idealized style, a trope rather than commitment, so that it manages in one swoop to kill both the fun and the honesty. Terrible."

","Last thing Flashdance page needs is another review, but I felt so compelled to write one, and I will keep it short. As someone not even born in the 80s I have only heard about Flashdance, but I knew the song before watching the movie. <br/><br/>Sure the storyline feels sappy and the dialogue at times is very cliché; I don't want to give any spoilers I rather suggest you watch it before reading others' comments to get a feel of it yourself. But I guess what draws you in is not only the amazing song selection that works so well with the movie's rhythm but also Alex's character overall. She is very relatable, dignified and so much soaked into her own world of dreams that she takes you there with her. Here as far as the acting goes, I can say that Beals does a fine job; you can tell she feels Alex in her bones. I loved how comfortable Alex seemed in her own skin and surroundings meanwhile feeling isolated and lost. <br/><br/>Would I watch it again? Maybe just to watch Alex's character and see some of the dance sequences. Yet, I recommend watching it to everyone else, as it is already a part of pop culture history."

It's really tied with the 80s and that's its charm: It's about ordinary people, who work hard (for the money), have moral beliefs and have sex in intimacy. So it's the total opposite of nowadays pictures that involves lazy upper classes people, who believes in their own justice and wallows in luxury!<br/><br/>So, it was refreshing to see this young woman riding her bicycle, helping her friends, doing a man job for living and pursuing her dreams. I really like the setting in Pittsburgh, as it was not glamor. If you cut all the musical sequences (and there's a lot), you have a very fast movie that goes for the main thing so it's not boring. The dance sequences are enough diverse (classic, street, club) to not be dull as well and they are well directed with good songs: ""what a feeling"", ""Maniac"" and ""she works hard for the money"" are really hits that are still highly audible today! I can't remember any other movies with so much good songs ! Lyne is a good director as he gives excellent frames and deepness and uses new technology (the strobing effect for example).<br/><br/>At last, Jennifer was an amazing newcomer: she was really good here and it's a bit a pity that she has such a strange career. She had the right to even refuse the sequel, but with her, it would have been interesting to discover what finally her character has done of her life!<br/><br/>For sure, there are some problems: it's a bit unrealistic (her accommodation, the ideal boyfriend driving a Porsche and having a long arm). But there is also a lot of humanity: all her friends failed or died so we really care about her fate!<br/><br/>So, i rate the maximum (10) and i hope people will follow me as well!"

I was maybe expecting too much but, anyway, all I really enjoyed is the dance scenes and the theme, which are both excellent and cult. Apart from that, I was not moved at all by the love intrigue which does not add anything particularly transcendent to the movie, in my opinion. What i liked, however, is the constant tension between femininity and masculinity throughout the whole movie. Even though the movie is not clearly feminist, the way it depicts women's role in Society sparks-off a slightly feminist undertone at times : female characters are definitely struggling with males' tendency to dominate, which may explain the sometimes ""manly"" attitude of the protagonist."

","I saw this movie as a child and knew it was terrible then, yet I couldn't take my eyes off it for a second. This is the rare movie that is so bad it is unforgettable; elements from it instantly entered the pop mythology of the 1980s. An entire generation (whether they saw the movie or not) became familiar with the welder-by-day/dancer-by-night conceit, the creative-bra-removal scene, the ""Maniac"" running-in-place dance workout, and (of course) the interpretive dance involving gallons of water. Film critics may not have been enchanted, but you don't get such scenes in every movie.<br/><br/>Every so often, a low-budget ""sleeper"" movie comes out and becomes a runaway hit; generally, such movies are blue-collar musicals. They are about the ways in which struggling lower-class people use song and dance to break away from their squalid lives. (Examples--""Saturday Night Fever"", ""Grease"", ""Dirty Dancing"", ""Full Monty"", ""Billy Elliot""). This movie could be a parody of that genre, but it is played (and was taken) straight. A dewy-eyed female welder, Alex (whose hair, makeup, and wardrobe are always impeccable) finds artistic release at night through her performances in the oddest nightclub in movie history; the dancers thrash around and gyrate under strobe lights while never removing so much as a sock--yet the place stays in business despite competition from a ""real"" strip club up the street (whose sleazy promoter keeps trying to poach away Alex and her friends). Yet Alex isn't fulfilled by this--she longs to study classical ballet and be taken ""seriously"". To that end, she keeps almost-applying to a local dance academy, urged on by an elderly former ballerina (Lilia Skala)--this unlikely friendship is actually one of the most likable and believable elements in the movie. It's less a movie than an extended rock video--everything is soaked in 1980s ""atmosphere"" and scored to Giorgio Moroder hits. Strange, I know, but not all movie love is explicable."

","For all the fame this movie got when it was released, when I saw it years later I found it quite lame. As I saw in the critical reviews at the time, the dancing and music were good while the plot was stupid. They were certainly right about the last part. The characters and storyline were hardly believable, especially all the inexplicable temper tantrums from Beals.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the music and dancing weren't very good either, and the movie actually was pretty boring. How it got so hyped is one of the Great Unanswered Questions. Recommendation: give this movie a pass and see the far superior movie ""Footloose"", from the same era but better in every respect."

","As a movie Flash Dance was not a great film, but what this film did was appeal to the masses. When the movie came out in 1983 I was living in Pittsburgh, where the movie was filmed and based, and dating a ballerina, so the movie was near and dear to my heart. The plot was totally unbelievable, the sets were unrealistic and the people were too shallow, but still, our generation suspended reality and just enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>Through the years I began understanding what an impact Flash Dance had on my generation, it especially hit home when I met my future wife in New York City and saw pictures of her and her sisters during that time period. Their hair was modeled after Jennifer Beals', their dress and many of the things they did developed from the movie. An entire generation of young women embraced the 'big, curly hair' look, the off the shoulder sweatshirt and tank-top look and wearing tights and ankle warmers, much to the enjoyment of the men around them. Jennifer Beals' big eyes, brilliant smile and joy of life became endearing qualities that only a lucky few women could properly emulate, I still enjoy that look today.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful movie where one should not criticize the fine technical details, instead the viewer should just sit back and enjoy a very nice feel-good movie."

","Flashdance (1983) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>A tough Pittsburgh girl (Jennifer Beals) works as a welder by day and an exotic dancer by night so that she can save up enough money to try and get into a ballet school, which is her dream. The young woman has hopes and dreams for the future but she feels that her background might keep her out of such a high class school. It's easy to see why FLASHDANCE was such a hit when it was released as it has the early 80's written all over it. Director Adrian Lyne adds some style and flash to the picture but the screenplay is pretty much full of clichés and is way too predictable from start to finish. With that said, Lyne at least helps keep the film moving at a good pace thanks to the style he adds to everything. The film at least offers up some great cinematography and there's no doubt that the director does a nice job during the dance sequences. The editing and pacing to the sequences bring out the style and help make them quite memorable. Another benefit to the film is the performance from Beals who is quite believable int he role. I thought she perfectly nailed the part both physically as well as mentally. I must admit that during the final act I was really turned off by the character herself but at the same time Beals really made you believe and feel for this person. I think this is where the screenplay does something right in the fact that the character is well detailed. What I didn't care about was the rather hockey love story with her boss, the predictable relationship with the elderly woman and the preaching to her friend subplot. There's quite a bit going on in this film and a lot of it is just one giant cliché and it's way too predictable for its own good. I'm certainly not expecting Bergman out of a mainstream flick but a little drama would have been nice. Still, there's no question that the film has its appeal and is worth watching."

Now I was born in '85 so I kinda missed out on these things, but I understand it's importance. I just bought this movie yesterday, it was back to back with Footloose, two iconic 80's movies, and I watched Flashdance this afternoon. While this film defined a huge part of the 80's, it was an average film with a simple plot. The acting and story is just pretty average, but it's a cute and fun one.<br/><br/>Alex is a welder by day, but at night she is a sexy exotic dancer who grabs the attention of all the men. But she has big time dreams to become a ballet dancer, she has promised her grandmother that she would apply to the top ballet school and try to get an audition. But Alex is always intimidated by the other ""proper looking"" dancers with tons more experience than her. She falls in love with a fellow co-worker, Nick, who wants her to make it just as badly. She goes through rough times, but she just wants to make it and will do anything for that chance.<br/><br/>Flashdance is one of those must see movies if you wanna see the important films of the 80's.

Jennifer Beals actually did a great job as Alex, she was absolutely beautiful and made the character very likable. While this film did not live up to my expectations, it still was a good film.

She was also a top teacher in New York at the time, with shows running in Las Vegas, Reno and Atlantic City, also Toronto. She had also worked on Broadway. She was signed and spent about six weeks on the movie. The producers would not give her any of the music to work with, and as a musical choreographer, this would not do. They couldn't give her even a sampling of what it would sound like. After six weeks, she was bored to tears, and quit, going back to teaching crowded classes. Her career continued as it had been, but if she had stayed, she would have been famous or infamous, but the movie would have been completely different in tone. The Beals character would have really danced like a showgirl, with class, style, and hot, hot, hot. There would have been no running in place, no aerobics, fitness class moves with no rhythm or funk. Alas, we shall never know how it would have turned out. Jennifer Beals would have still needed a dance double, though, for the moves I'm talking about.

","Oh, what a feeling I had when I watched this movie. Instead of making me believe I could dance right through my life, this film made me want to sleep right through it. I usually enjoy musicals involving many astounding hits from the 80s, but still, the sheer star power of Joan Jett and the Blackhearts performing 'I Love Rock and Roll' was just not enough for me this time. Though what I enjoyed most was that funky dance music that came after Joan...It was sooooooooo FUNKY!<br/><br/>But funky music aside, there was not much else to enjoy in this film. I felt empty as I watched Kyle T. Heffner perform the role of Ritchie. He subtly reminded me of Mike Damus and the funny, hilarious and extremely corny jokes he told. Oh Mike, if only you were old enough to play Ritchie back then.<br/><br/>
But getting back to me, often, all alone I have cried silent tears full of pride. So I thought I could relate to this film because I too was once a dancer like Jennifer Beals, sadly it was much more of a difficult road to acceptance for me. Yes, Flashdance ended on a positive note, and I can only hope that one day I could be like Alex. But digression is something I do often, so let's get back to my review, I give this film 5 out of 10 because the story was rather weak, and the acting was so bad, I felt I could have acted all the parts out better than them...except maybe the part played by Jumbo Red.

","So there I was an 18 year-old U.S. Army private newly stationed in Fulda Germany, still to afraid to wander outside the gate of the base into a foreign country.  So what was there to do but to go to the post theater and watch a movie called `Flashdance'?  (Later on after I ventured outside the base and became comfortable with my surroundings I also saw this flick in a German cinema).<br/><br/>
	Well I've always had a predilection for dark haired, dark eyed women anyway, so when the preternatural pulchritude that is Jennifer Beals (and her dancing body double) filled the screen I was in elysium.   For that dreamy hour and a half, Jennifer filled the romantic void of a lonely, girlfriendless kid who was very far from home.<br/><br/> 	This film has been too often dismissed as plotless; a charge that is not only unfair but also unobservant.  The story of a young girl struggling with the vicissitudes of her life (as well as her friends) and trying to fulfill her dream of becoming a renowned dancer is as much, or more, of a plot as many standard Hollywood projects.  And if one looks closely there is even occasional symbolism (though possibly not intended by the creators) such as the wayward friend falling in the gutter after her dirty money and the final scene where Alex (Beals) gets up after falling during her audition, unlike her ice-skating friend who gives up after a similar occurrence.<br/><br/>
 	I know that the music and trendy aspects of the film (break dancing-MTV like music sequences) made the movie a target for `cash-in' critics.  But I think that a second look by these detractors would reveal a charming storyline, with strong (though not realistic) characters.  In fact one of the movies great plusses is the development of the folks that surround Alex (the elderly and dear Hanna who encourages her dreams, her problem-possessing friends that serve to enhance Alex's amiable self, the aging club dancer that profoundly affects her at the movie's close, the degenerate rival club owner, and even her homely dog) all of whom are presented in clear-cut (though predictable-which is what is called for) scenes that establish their purpose.  None of these characters are superfluous and all add to the story.<br/><br/>
Add to this some extremely apropos music (the title track may be the most inspirational show tune since the theme from Rocky), a great sense of direction which adroitly goes from over the top to subtlety (such as the scene when Alex first tries to turn in an application to the conservatory which uses a shot of the shoes worn by the women in line, as well as inaudible whispers to drive the scene), a VERY funny punch in the stomach, and an ending that is uplifting and you have a great romantic movie."

","Alex Owens (Jennifer Beals) is a welder by day and exotic dancer by night. However, neither of these things satisfy her so she decides to try and fulfil her true passion by enrolling in a ballet school.<br/><br/>Let's get one thing out of the way fairly early on - Flashdance is not a particularly good film. It's a film that opens up with a story, but it's a story that is never really expanded upon - director Adrian Lyne fills much of the running time up with montages that are mostly a cross between music videos and fitness workouts. The film also contains way too many scenes which seem to exist merely to elongate the running time - such as the 'ice skating' scene and the rather random scene where a police officer and a member of the public are directing traffic whilst dancing. From a technical point of view these things are quite impressive, but they have absolutely naff all to do with the story and consequently add very little to the picture.<br/><br/>Whilst Jennifer Beals was never going to win any awards for her performance here I actually thought that she did show moments of greatness; her scene with Michael Nouri about halfway through the film where she seemingly cries on cue was a good piece of cinema and Lyne takes full advantage of this moment. Although her performance here is hit and miss across the board, Beals is never less than charming at any given point in the film - she's adorable, charming and easy on the eye and she really does light up the screen whenever she's in front of the camera. Sadly this never really extends to her chemistry with Nouri and their romance is never convincing and this aspect clearly weakens the film slightly.<br/><br/>Although the film is filled with lots of excellent technical moments it's the story that really lets the film down as it seems to only be used to start and end the film - there's very little of substance in between. For this reason it's going to something that lovers of cinema or lovers of a good story are going to have a hard job caring about. Having said that it is perhaps passable as a date movie or may even work for those who can't resist a bit of 80's cheese (which this film reeks of BTW).<br/><br/>Where the film really stands strong is in its technical areas such as Choreography and Editing (which it receives academy nominations for). Whilst it's mostly good, sadly some of the hard work is undone in the final dance scene where it's pretty obvious that a body-double is used for some of Beals' scenes - check out the moment where she dances right in front of the judges where you can quite clearly see that it isn't Beals doing the dancing!!! <br/><br/>Despite some of the negatives it is a passable film, but with a story that's practically non-existent throughout its running time it's a pretty unmemorable film even though it is mildly entertaining at times."

Self-taught she dreams of entering a ballet school, something seemingly impossible given lack of any recognised dance schooling. In true fairy tale fashion we glide through specious drama involving an elder ballerina, a piteous stand-up comedian slash cook, a waitress turned stripper and the inevitably beguiling rags-to-riches princess meets her prince.<br/><br/>Whishing through a tirade of dance sequences (including two ice-skating routine) about 30% of the movie consists of musical numbers, whilst the remaining runtime is rudimentary adhesive pretending to tell a story, with the dramatic excuse burdening the lead actress Beals, who has endless enamour and childishly vampiric sex appeal. The dances themselves are undeniably the highlight, most dimly-lit and featuring fast-editing montage, aimed predominantly at hiding the fact, that all sequences were performed by doubles. Inadvertently this gives ""Flashdance"" a surprising allurement, which came to be deeply influential to future cinema and video-clips, making the movie carry much more weight in filmmaking history then the banality of its story would even deem possible."

","Re-watched Flashdance recently and felt compelled to write a bit on this early 80s dud. Every time it seems I re-watch this movie it gets worse and worse as I recognize how trite and pathetic the cardboard story and dialog is. It doesn't hold up as a good movie in today's cinema. There's a bare bones plot about following one's dreams, but essentially the movie is about 45min of story and 45min of MTV-style cuts. Jennifer Beals is energetic and certainly in outstanding shape for her quasi-interesting dance machines, but her acting and more to the point the movie's script is dirt poor and woefully dated. The final number featuring the theme song showed a stand-in and stunt double plopped in for almost half the number. Can't recommend - but maybe - for nostalgia's sake. Check out Saturday Night Fever for a better nostalgia trip."

","Spoilers<br/><br/>The good story in this movie is about the power of the human spirit and how it overcomes any odds. <br/><br/>Jennifer Beals, who I considered world's hottest woman, between 1984 and 1989, stars as Alex, a welder by day and an interpretive dancer in a club by night. Alex has an unstated dream of becoming a ballet dancer. She meets her welding supervisor Nick after he catches her act in the club. He likes her, and they date. She expresses her secret dream of doing ballet to him. He gets her an audition for her dream of joining a ballet company.<br/><br/>She finds out in the middle of the Fort Pitt tunnel in Pittsburgh that Nick got her the audition and goes into a rage at him, stopping all traffic under Mount Washington (""Stop the Car Nick!""). She refuses to go to the audition and goes into a big depression. Prior to the audition day, after she has not shown up for work in a week, Nick talks to her and tells her she is using him as a scapegoat for her real problem, which is her fear of performing poorly in front of all those well trained dance/ballet people. He then makes the true statement, when your dreams dies you die. Effectively he was telling Alex, you got to go and give it your all or you'll die inside. She then deals with a death of a relative, and has time to think about things. <br/><br/>Realizing that Nick had a belief in her that went beyond their relationship and Nick was also risking his reputation by telling the ballet company to take a look at her, and Nick has no say in which dancer is selected during these auditions, she shows up compete with the better trained dancers for the spot. She puts on the Irene Cara song, ""What A Feeling"" and dances showing her tremendous love for dancing. It has no resemblance to ballet, but the people judging can feel her incredible exuberance for dancing as she brings them alive and the movie audience can also feel this. You want to cheer when she runs gleefully out of the audition and jumps for joy to tell Nick she blew away her better trained competition and made it into the ballet company."

","""Flashdance"" is an iconic 1980s film, memorable for its terrific music, the collarless t-shirt and sweatshirt, and some fabulous dancing. It also launched the career of beautiful Jennifer Beals.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about ""Flashdance"" is that there's really not much to it at all. It's a bare-bones story about a Pennsylvania welder (Beals) by day, men's club dancer at night - the dances are sexy and creative performances without nudity, money being thrown at you, etc. The boss of her day job (Michael Nouri) sees her dance and falls for her. She wants to audition for the Philadelphia Dance Repertory Company but she has no real training, she's just naturally gifted. She's encouraged by an elderly friend (Lilla Skala).<br/><br/>The reality is it plays like a bunch of music videos. The photography relies heavily on the use of shadows and silhouettes during the dancing, which is quite effective.<br/><br/>The acting is so-so; Michael Nouri is fine, but he doesn't have much to do. Cynthia Rhoades, a fabulous dancer who retired after marriage, is pretty and credible as a friend. Beals, who put her career on hold to finish college, is sweet; her acting improved over time. None of the characters are particularly well developed - it's all dialogue in between the music.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, ""Flashdance"" is an exuberant film that appeals to the youth in all of us, that ""take your passion and make it happen"" mentality, with all that music making you want to get up and dance. There were three different dance/acrobatic doubles used for Beals. I can remember it was a semi-scandal when the woman who did most of the dancing was revealed; the studio kept it quiet and didn't credit the dancers.<br/><br/>A light, fun film that gave the '80s some great music and fun fashion."

","""Flashdance"" from 1983 is a poor movie. To me it seems just like a bunch of music videos played after each other, and the already plain story obviously suffers from this. Jennifer Beals stars as Alex Owens, a working-class girl working as a welder during the day and as a dancer each night. Her dream is to obtain a place in a prestigious dance school. One night her boss at the steel mill, Nick, (Michael Nouri) sees her dancing in the club, and he immediately becomes attracted to her. You can probably guess the rest of the movie yourself, thats how predictable and ""seen-before"" it is.<br/><br/>I can see why the feature is loved by someone though; I found Beals charming as Alex and Nouri quite alright as Nick and I loved the soundtrack, which is amazing and got a well earned Oscar. It doesn't hurt with beautiful and sexy leads, 80's spirit, music and dancing either. A typical teen-movie.<br/><br/>One star for Jennifer Beals, one for the eighties and Flashdance's teen-appeal and two stars for one of the best movie soundtracks ever. 5/10"
"joltjohn","6","1","3","13 December 2002"," a good date night movie (you can make out between the songs)
","I just watched ""Flashdance"" for the first time and it is a film so lame, inconsequential and annoyingly dumb that it actually made the comparably silly ""Footloose"" look like ""Singing in the Rain"" by comparison. Actually, I'm being too hard on ""Footloose,"" since it actually had a plot, some interesting characters, and a point-of-view (to say nothing of a POINT), as opposed to the pointless and silly ""Flashdance."" which was like ""Rocky"" with a dance motif and female star.<br/><br/>I hope you don't take my ""critique"" the wrong way... Honestly, I don't think the movie is really all that good, but the message, and the feeling, and the spirit of this movie, are all very wonderful and infectious indeed and should NOT be discounted. It makes it a wonderful movie.  It is a story of energy, of feeling and of life The story seems utterly predictable and rather contrived, and the characters are weak. The music (which I *do* remember well from that time) is still excellent, and some of the dance routines are inventive. Others were pretty bad. like the  closing dance routine which is as bad  a dance scene as you'll ever see in any movie. The final dance scene In ""Footloose"" was much better. also  did you know a man was actually doing that twirly move and that Jennifer Beals didn't dance at all, actually they used about four stunt doubles).  For a dance movie, Flashdance doesn't show that much dancing. Even the gorgeous Jennifer Beals (and her dance doubles doing all those dance numbers.( I wonder if she has that huge curly perm -although fashionable at 1983 - only to shadow the face of her double. ) couldn't hold my interest. As short as Flashdance was, I was looking at my watch about halfway through.<br/><br/>The best parts of this movie are the  ""music videos"" and the soundtrack in the film is fantastic, it makes you the feel, the passion come alive as it drives the story and gives it a soul. It is that fantastic soundtrack that makes that, and the whole film for that matter, simply come alive. Beals is one of the few reasons to watch this movie. She is not bad at all as an actress! And she is sexy, cute and pretty. She has a very attractive smile and shows sometimes a very sexy body language. The worst parts are the dance performances which destroys the whole movie. Also the dialogs wasn't really good or interesting.  Unfortunately, there are some really ungainly jokes in the film(re: 'honkies', small penises, Polish jokes, a gross lesbian joke, and a real stinker about cockroaches in hamburgers--this is funny??), but the basic outline of the picture, corny though it may be, still works a little magic.<br/><br/>SPOILERS, BEWARE!!! Some things I really don't like about this movie: It seems that she is the only female working at the mill.  Also if  a female co-worker started dating the male boss a lot of people would think she was doing it to get ahead and not cheer them on like in the movie.  Why would any reasonable ""male"" go to a club just to see women dance in skimpy clothes.  I can see that going to any regular nite-club.When she first dances to the song ""maniac"" and they cut to shot of her dog it looks like he is getting ""excited"" watching her.   That  scene with the traffic cop, what what that all about?  Some things do confuse me about it (e.g. Jeanie asks Alex how long it took for her to get so good at dancing; Alex replies ""About 25 years,"" isn't Alex supposed to be 18?)  Also, if Alex is a welder during the day, wouldn't she be tired after a hard day's work? When she doesn't go to work for nearly a week, wouldn't she be laid off? Living in a warehouse-I can almost see it, but not quite. It doesn't seem right that she's a welder, owns a warehouse house, AND is trying to get into ballet. None of it really makes sense.<br/><br/>To summerize, Flashdance will never make the AFI's Top 100, but it has an infectious charm. Jennifer Beals is really only so-so in the leading role, and her leading man Michael Nouri is no better off, but it doesn't matter. What does matter here is the great music, especially that title track that may be the most inspirational show .tune since the theme from Rocky. Really, the whole film is played like a 90-minute ad for MTV! Laugh at the dopey plot and listen to the great tunes. Great film to earmark the 80s. Short on plot, but big on rock and roll and performance, especially by Beals, who excels as a welder (and semi-erotic dancer) who has dreams of ballet. I guess I'm recommending the film. I still find myself humming the title song."

","I've seen Flashdance about 15 to 20 times during my whole life since 1983. And all the times I've seen it, it was in the Spanish version. Yesterday I saw the original version and I just couldn't believe how different it was from what I've been watching all this time. While in the original version, Alex seems to be a candid 18 year old girl trying to find her dream, in Spanish her voice makes her look like a much older and experienced woman with an empty life. From what I have noticed about the film production, it is indeed a low-cost movie whose success had nothing to do with its editing, set-ups or actors. I would say that the thing that definitely made a hit out it was the music. I don't think this movie is outdated at all nowadays. In fact, I would say that a remake of this movie would be a hit at the box office. However, I don't think it would be such a good idea to place Jennifer Lopez as Alex, like some people say it would be."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","4","0","1","7 May 2020"," Royalties... what a feeling.
","Let's not beat about the bush here: 'Flashdance (1983)' is nothing more than a cash-grab, designed specifically to feed off a cycle of royalties. The intention, even as described by those making the movie, is for the film to sell the soundtrack, which then sells the film, and for the soundtrack to be played in public (via, essentially, pre-made music videos), which leads to further free marketing and brings in a hefty royalty cheque. As such, the piece is pretty much as bare-bones as you can get, its thin story stretched over the ninety minute mark simply so it can be classed as a 'feature'. It's about an eighteen-year-old woman who works in a steel mill by day and dances in a non-nude exotic club by night and... well, that's about it, actually. There simply isn't a proper plot. Instead, the flick moves through short-lived subplots that don't amount to a cohesive whole. I mean, the protagonist's ambition is to be a ballet dancer but we only really see her attempt to do this twice. There's no real drive to her oft-promised but never delivered arc, as she seems quite content with the life she lives and doesn't actually come across all that many obstacles. In fact, whenever she reaches a small hurdle, she throws an absolute fit and acts as if she's starring in 'Fatal Attraction (1983)'. This would be fine if the piece were willing to explore her inner demons but it seems as though it actively goes out of its way not to. There's just nothing all that interesting about the picture. It's shot in an utterly inoffensive but generally effective way, it has a few decent dance sequences (with some really bad doubling, I'll add) and it is, when it comes down to it, absolutely watchable. However, it's neither engaging nor entertaining. The best thing about it is its custom-made soundtrack, which has a number of genuinely good songs on it (including 'Flashdance... What A Feeling'). Of course it is, though; that's the only part that received any real attention. 4/10"

In reality this shallow epic works best as pseudo-sequel to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner - another film featuring animated mannequins posing in clouds of smoke, sparks and steam.

Don't be fooled by the perfunctory romance or vague tale of ambition, this film exists to sell the soundtrack and not the other way around. Also Kevin Smith clearly stole his Jay and Silent Bob characters from the creepy bouncers in this film."
"connorbbalboa","2","0","1","26 September 2017"," Style over substance, galore!
","Style-over-substance films usually annoy me. When those movie are as bad as Flashdance, I just want to ask the people who made them what they were thinking. Actually, this was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, who are well known for making films of cinematic gloss, but nothing with real humanity. The story is so simple, the whole thing is probably 50 minutes too long. This is basically Rocky if the story has dance scenes for filler, the numerous subplots went nowhere, and the characters weren't appealing.<br/><br/>For a story, Jennifer Beals plays a young girl named Alex who wants to be a professional dancer, and not just to dance at a small nightclub. By day, she works as a welder at a steel mill; shocking since she is only 18. The steel mill boss's son falls in love with her and later tries to help her get into the professional dance group that she yearns to be a part of, if only she had more confidence.<br/><br/>Everything that I highlighted in just three sentences is everything there is to know about the main story. Everything else is just music video-inspired dancing scenes (which, unfortunately, are mostly performed by Beals's body double instead of Beals herself) set to popular 80s songs, and subplots that go nowhere or are resolved in five minutes. For one thing, Alex sees the boss's son with his previous wife, she gets mad and throws a rock at his window, but the next day, he explains why his ex-wife was with him in the first place. Later, her friend joins a sleazy strip club, and Alex forces her to leave after three minutes. There is even an old woman who is Alex's friend, and conveniently, was also a famous dancer. Not enough time is spent on the relationship they have and the film never establishes how they met.<br/><br/>The acting is average at best, with Beals giving the warmest performance of the whole cast, and most of the characters act like old stereotypes, such as the pathetic friend who makes useless jokes (which leads to another sub-plot that goes nowhere) and the aggressive jocks who have eyes for the main heroine. Alex herself is also the victim of the horrible screenplay. Close to the beginning of the film, she actually does come close to signing up for an audition for the dance group, but she backs out because she is afraid. Not a good enough reason? Well, the film still has an hour and fifteen minutes left, and if she did get her confidence at that moment, it would be nothing more than a short film.<br/><br/>I have very little to say about Flashdance because the film offers so little. I guess the dance scenes are well shot, and Beals performance makes things a little more tolerable, but everything else is quite awful. Even some of the 80s songs are poor. This is easily one of the most uninteresting pieces of nothing ever made."

","Love musicals. Love dramas. Love a lot of films from the 80s, despite being aware of some of my friends who consider it one of the weaker decades for film. While there are certainly far worse musicals, there are also far better. 'Flashdance' is not without its moments but overall left me not completely feeling it.<br/><br/>Where 'Flashdance' is most successful is in the soundtrack and dancing. The soundtrack is toe-tappingly infectious and is infused with a lot of energy. This is particularly so with ""What a Feeling"", wonderfully sung by Irene Cara, which won a worthy Oscar and became an iconic hit of the 80s. ""Maniac"" is a close second. The dance sequences are clearly strenuous, while also being high-octane in energy and having surprising grace.<br/><br/>That is not to say that it doesn't have other good things elsewhere. Adrian Lynne directs very well, capturing perfectly the post-disco visual mood and general atmosphere of the time. 'Flashdance' looks good too, being cleverly shot and atmospherically lit and designed.<br/><br/>However, the acting is really not great. Jennifer Beals seemed too lightweight for a pretty lewd character, and when showing a more aggressive, harder side it comes over as annoying and like she was uncomfortable doing it. She does fare better than Michael Nouri, whose character is obnoxious, bland and clichéd, all of those accentuated in Nouri's acting. If the rest of the cast are not being mentioned, it is because their contributions were not memorable.<br/><br/>'Flashdance's' script is a complete mess. Cliché-ridden, cheesy and often tasteless. The story is vastly overshadowed by the film's style, music and dancing, it is barely existent and what there is pretty dull and preposterous, too often the opposite of feel-good or charming while the sordid-ness also feels over the top. Nice message, if not exactly new, but the very frothy and severely underdeveloped romance belongs somewhere else entirely.<br/><br/>Overall, has good points but am not completely feeling it. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

","I give this a reasonably high rating of 6 or 6.5, but that is with some serious caveats. First, more than half of the charm of this movie is nostalgia. If you grew up in the 80s, this movie was cutting edge for a teenager. It captured the feeling of energy and mania at the time in the music scene. On the upside, the characters are sympathetic and you can care about their story if you can overlook the ridiculousness of a few aspects of it. The downside includes those ridiculous aspects, and the fact that the story romanticized a lot of bad things. Like pretty woman, it gives the illusion that if the ""bad girl"" gets vulnerable enough, a sensitive man will save her. In Pretty woman its a prostitute, In Flashdance its a stripper. In real life, its just not true."

","Released in 1983, ""Flashdance"" is a drama/music/romance film starring Jennifer Beals as, Alex Owens, an 18 year-old welder in Pittsburgh who dreams of being a professional dancer and longs to be accepted into a prestigious school. She dances at a nightclub in her spare time, which is contrasted by the strip club across the street, owned by a sleazebag who tries to lure the respectable dancers into his seedy lair (Lee Ving). One of her friends aspires to be a figure skater (Sunny Johnson) and another friend a stand-up comedian (Kyle T. Heffner). Meanwhile her tall, dark and handsome boss takes a liking to her (Michael Nouri). <br/><br/>This is an entertaining dance flick with the requisite early 80's soundtrack. All the dance sequences were performed by the uncredited French dancer Marine Jahan, who later sued the producers for not crediting her (the brief break-dancing scene was done by a dude). While the wide-eyed Beals and Jahan are in top shape and comely enough, I favor Sunny (the skater).<br/><br/>I was impressed by the quality characterizations for a relatively short sports movie. I call it a ""sports movie"" because that's essentially what it is – ""Rocky"" with a female protagonist and dancing instead of boxing. I also like the Pittsburgh locations. Despite my positive feelings, the less-popular ""Heavenly Bodies,"" which came out 9½ months later and stars cutie Cynthia Dale, is superior IMHO. <br/><br/>The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles. <br/><br/>GRADE: B"

The camera-work is surprisingly professional though. The editing in this movie is incredibly clunky, jumpy (unintentionally visible and not supportive of telling the story), and the editor keeps repeating the same shots far too close together and too often to be for the purpose of either building momentum or getting a point across. Rather than being a stylistic choice, this seems to be an example of clumsy editing - rookie film student stuff. I lost interest at the 18-minute mark when the writers decided to extend the plot merely by postponing the inciting action of the last act (applying to the school) due to nerves. But I kept watching anyway, so here's the rest: The majority of the film consists of an insipid attempt at a romance story between the protagonist and her wealthy boss. The protagonist is wholly un-compelling. The side characters (an ice skater/stripper and a cook/racist comedian) are uninteresting, mildly offensive, and a general waste of time. The love interest is just a bit creepy, and not just because he's waay too old for her.<br/><br/>Recommended for people intent on watching all 80s dance movies, no matter how poorly made they are.<br/><br/>Content notes: Lots of filthy cussing and some racist language, some partial nudity, soily perverts acting pervy, one brief fight scene."

","From director Adrian Lyne (9 ½ Weeks, Fatal Attraction, Jacob's Ladder), this film has probably one of the most recognisable dance routines ever put in a film, I had to see if the rest of the film was any good too. Basically Alexandra 'Alex' Owens (Roger Dodger's Golden Globe nominated Jennifer Beals) is an eighteen year old who works in a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania steel mill as a welder by day, but by night she expresses her true passion for dance, exotically doing so in Mawby's bar. Despite no real training, she has taught herself plenty of moves, and dreams of becoming a professional (ballet) dancer, starting with enrolling at Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance and Repertory. At Mawby's bar, she attracts the interest of her steel mill boss Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), neither have met each other, and she has friends at the bar who have their dreams of fame as well. Waitress Jeanie Szabo (Sunny Johnson) wants to become a professional ice skater, and her boyfriend Richie Blazik (Kyle T. Heffner) is a cook who wants to be a stand-up comedian, we see them both try their hand at these career choices. Alex did plan to go to the Conservatory to sign up for an audition, but she realised with no training she hasn't got enough qualifications, but her dance teacher and mentor, retired ballet dancer Hanna Long (Lilia Skala) encourages her to go ahead with trying to keep going. We saw Jeanie fall twice at her skating audition, and after losing her confidence she turns to dancing at The Zanzibar, a strip club where she performs nude, but Alex rescues her. Nick and Alex have become lovers, he does reveal he has an ex-wife named Katie (Belinda Bauer), and arguments do settle, and he is able to get Alex an audition with his contacts at the Conservatory. Despite being a little mad with Nick getting an audition for her, and suffering the death of Hanna, Alex soldiers on an turns up for her important audition for the dancing school. She does fall and need to start again, but she confidently performs a great routine to the Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Irene Cara title song ""Flashdance...What A Feeling"" (number 55 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), and the end of the film sees running happily out of the building to hug Nick and freeze frame. Also starring Lee Ving as Johnny C., Ron Karabatsos as Jake Mawby, Malcolm Danare as Cecil, Philip Bruns as Frank Szabo and Micole Mercurio as Rosemary Szabo. Beals makes a pretty and quite admirable character, the film has a good soundtrack, not just with the title song, but the other memorable song, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated ""Maniac"", indeed the final routine scene, recreated by Geri Halliwell for ""It's Raining Men"" among others, is the reason to watch, but overall, not a bad musical drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Score for Giorgio Moroder and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Giorgio Moroder, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, and it was nominated the Razzie for Worst Screenplay. Worth watching!"
"ILuvPrincessDiaries2","3","0","4","10 February 2011"," Not as good as I was expecting....
","So, lately I have been seeing all the 'great classics' of the musical and dance era. I started with Grease, (and accidentally saw Grease 2), Saturday Night Live, Dirty Dancing, West Side Story, and the list goes on. I must say Dirty Dancing and Flashdance got nearly the same rating, but I think we all know which is the greater of the two films. Where Dirty Dancing (and most of the other movies) had at least one good song and one to two great dance scenes, I found that Flashdance didn't really have either. Yes, the one song Jennifer Beals does her audition for the dance company to in the end is pretty good, but not memorable. The dancing was only OK, and no songs were a must have on my ipod.<br/><br/>The story line however, was another matter. At first they started out slow, fleshing out the characters, but then I felt as is they threw this approach out the window and flew about pitching random scenes that were not memorable, nor on the whole, necessary.<br/><br/>I also had a problem with the nudity (which I confess I was not expecting)and the swearing felt almost forced, as if they were trying to make it a better movie with curse words: the verdict? They failed.<br/><br/>In my opinion, if you want to see good movie with good dancing and music, see Dirty Dancing, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers or Grease. You will be much more satisfied."
"dwpollar","3","0","2","31 August 2010"," Fair simple, rocky-type story...
","1st watched 8/27/2010 -- 3 out of 10 (Dir-Adrian Lyne): Fair simple, rocky-type story about a young woman from Pittsburgh who is a steel worker by day, a dancer by night, and wants to get into a local dance school following the example of her grandmother. Jennifer Beals plays the busy and feisty 18 year old with the dream in this Adrian Lyne directed video-like story. The movie is full of music and video snippets without a whole lot of dialogue and this fills up the movie instead of a story. You never really get a chance to understand the characters because of this choice by the director. You understand what the characters want, but you never really get a fully-developed ""why"" for any of the characters. There are some other minor characters that carry dreams as well -- like a cook who wants to be a comedienne at the local bar where the Beals' character dances. So the real purpose of the story is to show you not to stop reaching for your dreams, but the shallowness of the characters do not help you care. Beals is sexy and enticing at times but is never really given much of an opportunity to act, and when she's given it she doesn't do it that well. The boyfriend, played by Michael Nouri, is just an older middle-aged guy honkering for a younger chic and the Beals' character fits the bill for him. So, overall, you have a very shallow movie about reaching your dreams and never giving up that just doesn't quite cut it despite some good music and OK dancing."

"dust-7","Null","0","1","31 October 2006"," Influential classic, not just for its day, but still flawed.
","Spoilers! Very influential film, at the time, about a PA girl from Altoona who grows up to be a stripper/ballet dancer, with a personality so split it looks like a different woman doing the dancing - but, of course . . .<br/><br/>The stand in for Beals, Marine Jahan, is not listed in the credits. She's listed here on IMDb, but only if you know enough to scroll down to the bottom of the ""other crew"" list. No mention is made of her in any other on-line store for the vid or CD! From that, it's as if she never existed. In addition, supposedly another woman performed as the bike rider, and a man performed the flips (according to a couple of Usenet messages I found). From that standpoint, clearly Cynthia Rhodes, who later starred with Travolta in a less successful dance film, and then later with Swayze in Dirty Dancing, steals the show as 'Tina Tech'. But part of the criticism of the film might be that the dance numbers seem almost sparingly employed, that more of Rhodes could have been written in, and that the courtship of Nouri and Beals almost drags at some points.<br/><br/>On the other hand, to call the women strippers, while true, misses the point of the sort of acts found at Mawby's, as opposed to the evil Zanzibar. These are virtuoso dance interpretations cut into the degrading ethos of a strip club. This is Jezebel in a hundred variations, doing her belly dance in the tent, with uncluttered pre-drum n bass dance music and one note 'crying' guitars as 'mood enhancers'. It's the music video, as from Easy Rider, and many films before, in parts. And here it's just in parts, too. The cleverer it gets, the more pretentious it seems, as with 'Beals' final number against the white tile wall. Even Rhodes' performance seems a little silly. And the water splash on Beals has been parodied so often that to review the film, today, one is tempted to call it silly, as well. At the time, it wasn't a cliché. And what Rhodes did seemed something new, as well. Beals, in a recent interview, very widely copied to various sites on the net, remarks that she saw the influence of this little film in young women all over the world, at the time, not only in some newfound desire to become a dancer, but that trendy meant torn 'Alex' garb and the suggestion of good life for a young girl in a dust choked, ear-shattering mill or machine shop.<br/><br/>The film makers attempted to be true to steel town, no doubt. And there are many shots of the dank atmosphere, but also the almost cozy mill, welding there, and machine shops covered over in dust and grit and mostly unused, as the light streams in again in an almost comforting, artistic fashion. It's cold, more than dusty. But it's difficult to convey that on screen - without icicles or snow banks, perhaps. So it's really, kind of warm. And it's still, when walking through the rooms of grinders, when frolicking in the abandoned mill. And the 'dancer's loft doesn't seem so disgusting as Nouri's character seems to suggest when first invited in. The mood set is one of quiet and gentle isolation, perhaps in some sense to suggest that of the dancer alone before an audience. Or that might be unintentional. And so Beals comments on the effects of the film, are understandable. The young women saw what was on screen, whatever the film makers otherwise intended.<br/><br/>The plot isn't so much filler as a number of key scenes in the 'dancer's life, from the Zanzibar owner's assault in the parking lot, to Jeanie's falls on the ice and subsequent fall to the Zanzibar, literally on her back, to the radiator breaking as 'Izod'/Ritchie bids his goodbye, for the moment, and so on. The scenes are carefully designed and lit. There's a music to much of this non-dance filler that seems to hold up perhaps better than some of the so often parodied dance numbers, from now over 20 years ago. (In real life, the actress portraying Jeanie unfortunately died shortly afterward, I believe from a rupture strangely similar to that which in real life also killed the woman singing that very song as Jeanie ice dances).<br/><br/>All the actors command the screen very well, if not necessarily with much depth. It is difficult to believe that Beals is a welder, for ex. Yes, it's possible - maybe. To the witness on the stand - but you DO allow for the remote possibility, do you not Mr . . And as a remote possibility, sure. The film almost works because of that 'fantasy' aspect, where the women who hang with Alex are all strikingly beautiful. That's already a step away from any reality. Then there's the question of how did the former ballerina and Ziegfield dancer, Alex's/Beal's teacher, train the stripper to be a ballerina? Her audition before the panel is the sort of heavy, bouncy thing the strippers at Mawby's would be famous for, not what someone applying for the city ballet would perform. And of course, as mentioned first here, it is just annoying and distracting to see the noticeably different appearance of the stand-in, Jahan, from Beals. This surely was a complaint of the film, even at the time. And it's still something that takes one out of the story, and back to the reality of just watching some movie. Beals may have fit the role of doe-eyed manipulator for this film. But to see her, and then another 'Darren', back and forth from scene to scene, is what perhaps hurts even more than the rest."

","Having just watched Flashdance for the first time, I can't appreciate the effect that it obviously had at the time on so many of those who've commented here.  But looking at Flashdance from almost 20 years later, it doesn't seem to have worn well.  The story seems utterly predictable and rather contrived, and the characters are weak.  The music (which I *do* remember well from that time) is still excellent, and some of the dance routines are inventive.  Others were pretty bad.  The closing dance routine is indeed fabulous, but much too short -- for a dance movie, Flashdance doesn't show that much dancing.  Even the gorgeous Jennifer Beals (and her dance doubles) couldn't hold my interest.  As short as Flashdance was, I was looking at my watch about halfway through.  One viewing is plenty for me. 4/10"

However, this young woman has aspirations- and burning passion to make it big. This was Jennifer Beals shining moment in this little film that simply says ""Take your passion, and make it happen"". Oh yes, there is a grit to this film, and it takes time for the story to develop. But when Alex Owens meets Nicky,(Michael Nouri) a man she ultimately trusts, things get interesting. The soundtrack in the film is fantastic, it makes the feel, the passion come alive as it drives the story and gives it a soul. The workouts this young woman goes through are incredible, and it is that fantastic soundtrack that makes that, and the whole film for that matter, simply come alive. It is the message and the music that makes this my favorite film, and the ending gives me a rush of emotion every time I watch it. Oh, and her dog, Grunt, is so ugly that he's cute!"
