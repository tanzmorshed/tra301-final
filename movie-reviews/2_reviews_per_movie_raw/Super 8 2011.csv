","Super 8, derivative and disappointing at its best, can be summarized using elements from the other sci-fi/thrillers that Spielberg either directed, produced, or exec-produced.<br/><br/>Some annoying kids find a map (Goonies) – including a fat kid who likes to eat (Goonies) – and they come up against the military which is trying to track down an alien on the loose (E.T.).<br/><br/>The creature has created issues for the townsfolk who express concern at a meeting with the sheriff (Jaws) and they eventually have to evacuate because of a made-up disaster (Close Encounters).<br/><br/>The alien, who is a really a spider (Arachnaphobia) that has been collecting items so that he can get home (E.T.), has the ability to make a psychic connection with humans (Close Encounters). One of the kids has a seemingly useless obsession that winds up helping to save the day in a climactic sequence (fireworks here and inventions in the Goonies) however the creature is much too smart to fall for such a trick (Jaws - ""he's either very smart or very stupid""). An old guy, who is an expert on this creature (Jaws) winds up dying while the army shoots through the town and tanks roll (War of the Worlds).<br/><br/>Then the characters put the story together in one long expositional scene and we are not really sure how they figured it all out (Minority Report). It seems the monster is really a misunderstood good guy (Goonies) who makes a connection with our hero (ET, Close Encounters) and then flies home (E.T), but not before a lot of missing people are returned (Close Encounters) and lots of appliances fly around (Poltergeist).<br/><br/>The End."
"ghomeishy","6","235","334","9 August 2011"," first 80 minutes : great!!! last 30 minutes : horrible!!!
","I have never seen a movie which could be divided to two parts of ""absolutely amazing"" and ""boring and childish"". The first 80 minutes is awesome, I was shocked by how good this movie was as I had seen some bad reviews on IMDb but then the cheesy part kicked in and ruined the whole thing. <br/><br/>First thing that comes in to everybody's mind when they see the first scenes is that this movie is so similar to et! The style is the same, the theme is the same, it even happens in the same era with the same kind of neighborhood which is kinda cool and nostalgic for my generation. Super 8 seems like a fan-made dedication to Spielberg but it just didn't work quite well. <br/><br/>From the actor's performance perspective; Elle Fanning's performance was breath-taking, and she saved some scenes. She's got potential to be a big star in the future. Kyle Chandler on the other hand was just plain and simple awful. He made the whole thing look kinda funny and stupid. <br/><br/>From special effects and sounding perspective, I'd say it was stunning. One of the best I have seen in the genre in years as you would expect when you see Spielberg's name on the screen. There's this big scene at the first half an hour into the movie where you just get nailed to your sit due to the load sound which should have been annoying but it was not. It was awesome. You don't see this in Germany often but after this specific scene, the audience gave Abram an standing ovation!!! It was awesome. Of course at the end, everyone was angry because he ruined the whole thing with a very cheesy ""et-like"" ending but all in all it was worth the money, better than most of the movies in the last 6 months, I would say. <br/><br/>I'm giving it 6/10 because first of all, I expected so much more from the creator of Lost and second of all, the last 30 minutes is really bad and the ending is just pure garbage. They used some cgi stuff which was very impressive but didn't quite go with the theme of the movie and was really inconsistent. All in all, it doesn't deserve the crap that it's getting in the reviews but it quite doesn't deserve the praises either. It's only OK"
"lcofeer5","8","279","401","11 June 2011"," When you see a bike fly, walk out of the theater and make up your own ending
","The film is about a town mystery looked through the eyes of children. From the early part of the movie, you feel like something powerful and dangerous is lurking around and is going to jump out on you at any moment. Ever-multiplying questions tease your brain and a suspense is building up at the back of your mind right up to the end of the story. <br/><br/>The acting was very convincing and drawing although the movie suffers from its mediocre ending. A few times I felt that the logic and the flow of the plot were a bit unrealistic and artificial. I wish that the story was focused more on the mystery and the children's reactions without all the insignificant distractions and one-dimensional minor characters. <br/><br/>After being disappointed by a series of recent movies, this one was refreshing and heart-fluttering. It flings us back to the adventure-seeking and truth-chasing time of our childhood. If you are into tantalizing sci-fi thrillers like this movie, I recommend 'Somewhere carnal over 40 winks' as your summer read."
"still_the_dre","6","352","527","19 June 2011"," I was expecting so much more...
","I don't make movies or review them. I am simply someone who loves going to the movies and have seen more than I can count. I was waiting for Super 8 for about 6 months. I saw the early trailers, was involved in the viral campaigns. I was amped to go and experience another great JJ Abrams film. <br/><br/>Like many reviewers I started on a high then at about half way my opinion of the movie had gone down a lot. <br/><br/>I watch a lot of movies and like to think I know a good movie when I see one. For me it's simple. Was it interesting? Was it entertaining? Was it original? This is what makes a great movie to me. Super 8 was not a great movie.<br/><br/>The best way to describe Super 8 is take ET and put it in a blender with Cloverfield. But it just doesn't feel like it blended how it should have.<br/><br/>The are too main stories...little kids having adventures, growing up and falling in love. Other the other side a monster attacks the city cloverfield style. The kid parts are filmed in a very ET 80's cinemas style. The alien parts are modern with CGI and at times it honestly doesn't feel like you are watching the same film. <br/><br/>Don't even get me started on inconsistencies of this movie... like a man driving into a speeding train derailing it and SURVIVING? lol... seriously?<br/><br/>Super 8 feels very much like a fan made dedication to Spielberg but it just didn't quite work. <br/><br/>I will say the kids were excellent actors and I would have been more entertained just watching a movie about them with no alien. Elle Fanning out acted every one, even the adult cast. She proved to be an amazing young actress portraying a maturity far beyond her age. But with the other characters I had no real emotional attachment to them. I didn't feel sorry for the alien, was I supposed to? <br/><br/>Like I said I am simply a movie buff and to me this was not anything special. I'm surprised by all these 10/10 reviews, because this movie had nothing new that you haven't seen in 50 other films. I think it would have made 2 great separate films, where they could have taken their time to build the story. Combined though I would say wait for DVD."
"eevaivilo","9","18","22","8 October 2019"," Magic
","Look, I'm biased. When I first saw the movie in 2011 while I was still just in middle school, I was enamored. Now, 8 years later, as a film student inspired by this movie, I can honestly say that it still holds up. A lot of the love I have for this movie is purely fueled by nostalgia, but even aside from that, the thrills and heartstring tugs this movie delivers still stand up to the test of time so far. This movie is always going to mean the world to me, and I hope someone out there sees this and gives it a shot. It's so criminally underrated and under-appreciated."
"bruce-149","6","474","731","14 June 2011"," Been there, done that
","As an homage to the Spielberg films of the 80's, this movie succeeds. As a piece of original entertainment? Nothing happening, folks. Now, if you're a kid and have never seen The Goonies, Jaws, ET, War of the Worlds, and Cloverfield, you may think this film is absolutely wonderful. And judged through the lens of cinema history, it may well be looked upon as a culmination of all that came before.<br/><br/>Let's just hope that the future is filled with something in rare supply: originality.<br/><br/>It's not that I wasn't entertained, it's just that I expected something more.<br/><br/>And I suppose that's another problem with getting older. There aren't as many surprises left in the world."
"theSTEARMAN","Null","6","6","28 June 2011"," Good, but not great due to underdeveloped alien subplot.
","First of all, when all is said and done, this is a ""good"" movie. It's not GREAT, but it's definitely good. Secondly, and most importantly, it's totally worth seeing. Elle Fanning (Dakota Fanning's little sister) is simply ah-MAZING in this 'coming of age' story between a group of friends of a small Ohio town as they struggle to complete their own Super 8mm movie and deal with their own personal dramas on the side oh, and an alien is running a muck around their town.<br/><br/>""Wait a minute What?????"" If that last bit seemed a little out of place to you, it's because it feels that way in the movie. Granted, the mystery and intrigue of the alien subplot does add some suspense and excitement, filling in the gaps of what would otherwise be a ""Stand By Me"" drama, but if I can be completely honest here – I think I'd rather have seen that instead.<br/><br/>It's not easy for me to say this, especially because I have an affinity for aliens, sci-fi and action movies in general, but I honestly believe this movie could have won Oscars hadn't it been for a poorly animated CGI alien reminiscent of ""Cloverfield"" (JJ Abrams other alien flick) running around like a warped spider and kidnapping the townspeople one by one.<br/><br/>The very first time we really get any hint of an alien presence is during a train wreck. No seriously, it's a TRAIN WRECK. The kids are filming a scene for their movie outside an old train station when suddenly a man in a pick-up truck decides to play chicken with a giant train carrying air force cargo. The eminent crash that follows is the most over-the-top, ridiculous thing I have seen in a long time. It goes on for what felt like a good four minutes and is riddled with explosions, close calls, and never-ending firebombs coming from nowhere. I watched it with a friend of mine and when the scene was FINALLY over we both looked at each other and laughed out loud in the theater. It's during this never-ending fireworks display that we first get a glimpse of the ""secret cargo"" in question. Only portions of this alien are seen in the shadows for mere fractions of a second, and this same visual strategy is played out until the climax of the film.<br/><br/>To boil down about 20 minutes worth of exposition to its essence, this alien is just trying to go home. (E.T. anyone?) But, of course, before he can do this he must rebuild his spaceship and eat a few people along the way. Oh, and did I mention that these super cool things that the alien does all happen in fragmented portions on-screen? Yup, you never actually get to see him building his spaceship, nor do you actually see him eating anyone. But then again that's probably a good thing because at the end of the movie when you FINALLY get to see this thing in all it's glory it turns out that it's just a cartoonish CGI character with weird legs that looks pretty stupid.<br/><br/>With all the amazing technology we have today, I was shocked to see this Spielberg/Abrams summer blockbuster churn out a SyFy Channel, miniature Cloverfield-looking, big legged, half-rendered insect of an alien running around like an idiot. It was just plain lazy on the part of the animators. Seriously, the T-Rex in Jurassic Park back in '93 kicked this alien's ass! The only redeeming alien scene in the entire film was at the very end when the alien bonds with the main character 'Joe Lamb' and looks upon him with his own, human-esque eyes. But, unfortunately, the emotional impact of this scene is tainted with an awful, awful, awful ""I understand you"" monologue Joe has with the alien just before this happens. After the monologue is over and the alien lets Joe and his friends go, his friend 'Cary' delivers the line, ""Wait a minute what???"" That's exactly what I was thinking, Cary.<br/><br/>OK, so enough about the dumb alien stuff – let me tell you about what's AWESOME about this movie (never thought I'd use that phrase) <br/><br/>1. Elle Fanning is awesome in it.<br/><br/>2. The entire kid entourage was cast perfectly and also had great chemistry with one another.<br/><br/>3. The story of these friends making a movie and the drama surrounding their own personal lives was extremely entertaining, heart-felt, and by far the best part of the entire film.<br/><br/>4. Great production values and the story is constantly moving forward and never gets dullcheesy at parts, yes, but never dull.<br/><br/>I think if I were a kid, I'd probably love this movie. But as an adult who has seen his fair share of films, I have to say that I felt this one stopped short of being great because of the underdeveloped alien subplot. In the film the kids were filming their own movie about zombies; perhaps zombies would have worked better than using an alien? Or maybe still, take out all that supernatural crap and make it a true-to-life adventure story about these kids making the film and wind up in some sort of Goonie adventure. I don't claim to have the definitive answer as to how to make this film better, but I do know that I hated that damn alien.<br/><br/>Oh, and one final note (and I'm specifically addressing this note to Mr. JJ Abrams here): STOP USING THOSE STUPID CGI LENS FLARES SO MUCH!!!! If you use them every now and then, it creates atmosphere - if you use them all the friggin' time, it's just plain distracting."
"ryanslice","4","174","265","9 June 2011"," Supremely disappointing and shallow
","Although I could create an extensive list of cliché one-liners, obvious inconsistencies, and totally unrealistic occurrences (even for a PG-13 sc-fi movie), the underlying reason that I will influence friends to not see this movie is because the plot was weak and shallow.<br/><br/>First of all, there are actually 4 subplots that a viewer has to juggle between!<br/><br/>1) A budding romantic relationship between the two main (middle school) characters 2) Mending a tense father-child relationship(s) (also with both main characters) 3) A group of early teens helping the alien return home and... 4) A son finding a way to cope with the loss of his mother *I might not have deemed 4) as a plot line if it wasn't for the intentionally-dramatic ""letting the alien take mom's locket"" scene as the last scene in the movie*<br/><br/>These plots were all given fairly even amounts of attention and while they did have some connecting, because there is not much screen-time or time dedicated to deepen dialogue within the individual plots, they all come off as unimportant.<br/><br/>While it does have a fair amount of suspense, the action sequences are typical at best.<br/><br/>Overall, just a flat-out poor showing by high profile names (and a $45m budget).<br/><br/>Like I mentioned in the beginning sentence, there are so many things that just don't make any sense. But the biggest question I had walking away is why did the Air Force end up killing Dr. Woodward??? There was no reason for his murder whatsoever! (Not considering the fact that he was still alive after a head-on collision with a speeding freight train). It's almost funny how drastic that decision was by the ""evil Air Force Sargent,"" Nelec."
"chris-76-20944","5","159","247","9 June 2011"," Trying to be what it's not
","This movie wants to take you on a ride, it wants to take you back to a time and a place where the world was that little more innocent.<br/><br/>This movie wants your heart to skip a beat when danger is near, and wants you to lose your breath when the heroes are in peril. <br/><br/>This movie wants to be a lot of things, but ultimately there's just something missing. You feel like a spectator just waiting to get involved, but as the movie creeps along and goes through the motions you begin to realize that the sidelines are as close as you're going to get.<br/><br/>There's virtually no back story to what's on board the train and when do finally learn more about it it's then too late to care. The father and son have both been impacted by a traumatic and life-changing event, but aside from a few passing encounters we don't ever really feel their pain. <br/><br/>There are some moments in the movie that stir something deeper down, but they're over almost as quickly as they begun and you're back to the bleachers watching a fairly boring, simple story unfold. <br/><br/>I think what is at fault here is the plot - it's seemingly non-existent. The director has taken a bunch of things that on their own sound like a great recipe, but some vital magic got missed from the mix and it just never comes together like it should."
"hollo-peter","8","120","184","26 June 2011"," Spielberg's and Abrams' outstanding cooperation
","I remember being only one of the handful of people in Budapest who wanted to see this film in original version (i.e. English audio, no subtitles) on one hot Friday evening in the summer of 2011. It is a shame everything gets dubbed in cinemas in Hungary these days. Nevertheless, it is lucky for us that there is always a place somewhere in the capital where the theatre shows American films in the form they were intended to be presented to the audience.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in 1979, if I am not mistaken. As one could expect from Mr Spielberg the era is presented meticulously. Movie posters here and there, kid listening to his Walkman, old cars driven on the streets and of course the children trying to shoot their dream movie with the use of a Super 8 camera.<br/><br/>I do not remember when was the last time I saw children acting superbly. Although the main character's father, the deputy in the town, has a vital role, as well, he is not in the focus and we are more interested in seeing the kids' struggle to finish the film even after the derailment of a train and the subsequent appearance of the US Air Force.<br/><br/>I am not lying to you: I was afraid Spielberg would not be enough to make it a successful movie and J.J Abrams would only mess up the story. If you think about it: Cloverfeld meets the Extra Terrestrial? Come on!<br/><br/>Yet, it works! It is a wonderful piece of work which, yes, most of the time reminds us of the small alien who wanted to go home but it's been almost 30 years since then so should it really be a concern that someone tries to borrow elements from a successful movie?<br/><br/>I was stuck to my seat the whole time and was eagerly waiting for the end of a wonderful journey. If you did not like the trailer there is no point in ruining your evening. However, if you did like it and E.T. was something that makes you remember your childhood vividly, give it a try, you will not regret it!<br/><br/>I give it a solid 8 out of 10. Well done, guys! Hope to see the result of your further cooperation sometime in the future."
"guitaresee","1","187","310","17 June 2011"," Not Super Great
","I created an account just so I could do my duty as a citizen of the world and warn others not to see this horrid piece of garbage called super 8. Save yourself 2 hours of life and 8 bucks and do anything else.<br/><br/>Here is the plot summary: a group of annoying kids (with the squeaky- obnoxious-puberty voice) are trying to make a movie. They witness a train wreck and capture an alien on camera. They run around for 70 minutes yelling profanities and telling each other to ""shut up"". Dogs run away. Lights flicker. The military gets involved. There are numerous explosions. The alien is going to eat people. The main kid tells the alien through a psychic connection ""you can survive hard times"" and the alien builds a spaceship and leaves. <br/><br/>Very slow moving, nothing ties together. Extremely BOOOOOORRRING.<br/><br/>As mentioned by others, the characters are like those from ""The Goonies"" and ""The Sandlot"". To make this movie: Take the token fat kid, small annoying blonde kid, nerdy kid with glasses, and a normal kid and throw them into ""War of the Worlds"", give them fireworks and watch what happens. <br/><br/>The end of this movie is very similar to ""Knowing""... yeah...<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was just plain awful. I honestly do not know how any reasonable human being could give this movie an 8/10."
"TourettesPersonal","8","232","405","11 June 2011"," Mixing Their Trademarks
","The concept of ""Super 8"" is combining the elements of J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg. The trailer made you think it's like E.T. plus Cloverfield. Well, it's true. There is nothing new about ""Super 8"" but it brought us back to the good old classic times, it's funny, it's exciting, and it's amazing.<br/><br/>""Super 8"" is another intriguing monster movie by J.J. Abrams. Yes, you really wanna know what it looks like but I'm not gonna tell you. The sad thing is it's not as intriguing as Cloverfield. But It's easy to ignore that problem because there is something better than being another Cloverfield. It feels like you are watching a good old classic movie. Great characters, Good old fashion score, and kids intrigued by the situation.<br/><br/>The story is really about the characters' zombie movie making and the family tragedy while there's a monster attacking their town. The monster is like the background or the subplot of this film. But the movie still got suspense. The movie is indeed beautiful and plenty of heart. The movie is just nostalgic stuff. It's not trying to be new. It just wants to show how J.J. Abrams is inspired by Steven Spielberg's movies.<br/><br/>There are some amazing scenes in this film. Example, the train collision was breathtaking. The movie sure has a lot of humor. It's like a relic to the old family movies. The CGI is good enough. The performances were good. The kids gave a lot of personality to their roles.<br/><br/>""Super 8"" is a J.J. Abrams film with Spielberg's trademarks all over it. It's not a blockbuster that has a lot of action and less talking. This movie is made in old fashion style. Yep, this movie is nostalgic if you saw Spielberg's old movies and it's good to see another one like it.<br/><br/>Note: There is something interesting in the credits. You might wanna check it out."
"Nooch007","10","216","382","4 June 2011"," ET meets Goonies meets The Sandlot
","I was fortunate enough to see a screening this morning in DC. I had pretty high hopes for it from what I saw from the trailers. I don't lean one way or the other when it comes to Abrams, some of his stuff I like, some of it I don't. Super 8 is one that I loved. <br/><br/>In the current era of CGI laden, soul-dead adventure flicks, Super 8 distinguishes itself by having heart. There is an authenticity to those kids in the film, a familiarity in their conversations. It reminded me of when I was a kid. It was like ET meets Goonies meets The Sandlot. And the film that they are trying to make within the film, and their obsession with ""production values"" draws a lot of laughs. <br/><br/>The friendship between the kids in the film really resonates, and the emotional elements of the film totally deliver. One of the most poignant scenes in the film has nothing to do with whats in the train car, or the air force, and anything like that....rather, its a scene that takes place in Joe's bedroom as he sits on the floor talking to Alice. <br/><br/>Now, as much as I loved the film, it is not without some flaws, mostly in continuity. Also, I would have liked a little more exposition for some of the characters, I would love to know more about Alice's father. That being said, I am forgiving on those things because the movie hits its mark everywhere else. <br/><br/>Surely it will draw its comparisons to ET, and the other early Spielberg works, but those comparisons will always be unfair. Those films came at a different time. And the people who see Super 8 today, have changed since they first saw ET, or any of those other films. I am just glad the generation of younger people will have this as a generational film for them, as I had with those other great adventure films. <br/><br/>All in all, Super 8 was a terrific film experience, that will leave you with a smile on your face."
"rpbourne","1","112","193","20 June 2011"," I guess the name Super Bad was already taken
","I went into the theater having heard some Luke warm to bad reviews but was unphased. What do the critics know. The movie starts of kind of slow, with a lot of unexplained tension and drama that is later explained but never really makes much sense. The set up of the lead kids mom dying and it being the drunk father of the female hottie's fault is elaborate but does little for the movie. <br/><br/>At the end of the movie as the alien is trying to get away, he is at the same time causing the armies tanks and weapons to go crazy, launching tank shells and mortars all over the town. You don't see any of those kill anyone but they do enormous destruction and probably kill a larger number of people. Yet the music is triumphant and we are supposed to feel good for the alien. ""Yay he was imprisoned for 20 years, that gives him the moral high ground to destroy a town and kill whoever he likes. The US government is bad!"" Umm sure, this movie has some identity issues.<br/><br/>The kids characters were just awful charactertures. I wanted to vomit each time one of them showed up on screen again. <br/><br/>Finally got to love the simply awful physics. What happens when a 3000 ton train hits a 2 ton truck? Most of the time the truck gets flattened and the train moves on without slowing or any damage. Even if the train had been derailed, it likely would have just slowly ground to a halt. Cars would not fly through the air. The twisted wreckage and explosions were just Hollywood playing with themselves and their 45 MILLION dollar production cost. Seriously this movie could have been made twice as good for one tenth the cost. Ever watched the end of ""Back to the Future 3"" It works pretty much like that, except with the Delorian being replaced with a truck"

Reminded me of Ang Lee trying to put a personality behind The Hulk. So many loopholes in this movie , we are to believe the thing kills its victims, okay it doesn't, what does it use them for? Just too predictable. We see the thing getting out of the train in the first bit and we have to almost wait an eternity to see its ugly head again, and its not worth it. For all the hype that was thrown its way it hasn't delivered, and anyone comparing it to ET, get a grip , a bit of bottle and see the doctor. The movies are poles apart."

"ungy357","10","211","396","9 June 2011"," One of the great ones
","In 1979, in the fictional town of Lillian, Ohio, a preteen boy named Joe Lamb is trying to cope with the recent death of his mother, who was killed in a factory accident. Much to the frustration of his father, the town's deputy sheriff, Joe copes by immersing himself in a project lead by his best friend, Charles. That project is a horror film, shot on a SUPER 8 camera, and Charles has enlisted the help of not only Joe, but the rest of his misfit friends, and has surprised everyone by talking Alice Dainard, the prettiest girl in school, into playing the hero's wife. On the night of the first big shoot, the would be filmmaker witness a train crash. Pretty soon, the town of Lillian is swarmed by military men, who won't tell anybody what is going on. Abrams and Spielberg may be the only two people in Hollywood who still know how to keep a secret, so I won't spoil that by going into the plot too much further. But I will say that Super 8 lives up to every bit of hype and expectation surrounding it. This is a beautifully crafted, emotional, funny, scary, thrilling movie that enthralls an audience the ways Spielberg's 80s classics did. And this is coming from someone who has been accused of ""worshipping"" Spielberg. Abrams has recreated the look and feel of vintage Spielberg expertly, down to the last detail. For a Spielberg fan, it's an absolute joy to behold.<br/><br/>But Abrams somehow manages to do this without completely sacrificing his own unique voice as a filmmaker. It's got the twists and turns of Lost, the personality of his Star Trek, and, like most Abrams projects, a leading lady who propels the whole thing. In this case, it's young Elle Fanning, who, as Alice, projects such a genuine combination of childlike innocence and ahead of her years maturity, that you can't take her eyes off of her whenever she's on screen. The entire cast is terrific, especially Joel Courtney as Joe, and Riley Griffiths as Charles, but Fanning steals the movie. We become completely involved with these characters in a way we rarely do with adult Hollywood heroes. I found myself caring every bit as much about the budding romance between Alice and Joe as I did the more spectacular events of the film.<br/><br/>And it is spectacular. Abrams and Spielberg give us action/suspense scenes that evoke Spielberg's classics Jaws, Jurassic Park, and E.T. They also come as close to the emotion of E.T. as any film of this type has done since then. Super 8 is the kind of film for which the cliché ""You''ll laugh, you'll cry"" was invented. If you're a child of the 80s and complain that they don't make movies the way they did when you were a kid, well, Abrams and Spielberg have done exactly that.And Michael Giacchino further establishes himself as one of the best film composers to come along in years. His score soars with emotions and build suspense in the vein of (of course) John Williams.<br/><br/>I also have to take a moment, as former amateur child filmmaker, to talk about how well rendered that aspect of the story is. It certainly added an extra level of enjoyment for me that I vividly remember the days of trying to make my own blockbusters with nothing but a camera, a few friends, and wildly overactive imagination.<br/><br/>It's worth mentioning, by way of warning (especially to parents) that Super 8 is rated PG-13 for a reason, namely the intensity, and for an E.T./Goonies like tendency to have the kids swear. Most audiences will get past this, but certainly some will not, and I'm absolving myself of any complaints. <br/><br/>Movies like this are the reason I love movies. In an age when trailers give away everything, Super 8 unfolds before us, capturing us in its spell, and never letting go. It's an unforgettable movie experience. A film to be treasured,"

On the one hand, I expected a typical Spielberg style kids vs. monster type flick, on the other, I have been disappointed by Abrams before with Cloverfield.<br/><br/>So, for the first three quarters of the movie, I was actually enjoying the ride. At least this time, Abrams managed to make characters that I could care about. I was able to suspend my disbelief and go along in spite of many problems with physics and continuity. As the story went on, the unexplained bits and pieces of the plot began to wear thin.<br/><br/>Basically, if you read the negative reviews on here you will see the problems with this film; the complete rehashing of so many Spielberg clichés, multiple goofy continuity problems, and poor plot exposition and so on. I actually could have overlooked most of this for the positives, if it weren't for the particularly flat ending.<br/><br/>The rest of the film had enough great production values, character development and a great feeling of an old time 50's monster movie I really was having fun, until it got toward the end. They just couldn't pull all the plot elements together in a satisfying way. Worst yet, the ending fell totally flat. Where there should have been some tension building with a good climactic scene, it just kind of ended, plop, that was it, very unsatisfying.<br/><br/>I don't understand the trend with filmmakers like Abrams, Shyamalan and a others these days. There is a tendency to have characters with strong but contrived story lines, where the plot exposition is so minimal and choppy that it is difficult to actually develop an emotional connection with them. Then, it is difficult to tell where some of their motivation comes from. Ultimately, these characters act in ways that seem inappropriate under the circumstances. Anyway, I just tire with this kind of half-ass story telling. These guys need to watch some classic Hitchcock, Lumet, Reiner etc. and get some tips on plot and character development.<br/><br/>Bummer, this was so close to being a really good movie, if not great, it just needed better storytelling and a decent ending."
"gergear","6","47","81","14 June 2011"," Super 8.....super... hmmm just OK!
","I really wanted to love this movie. Having grown up in the 80's blessed with so many classic Spielberg movies the thought him making one with JJ Abrahams was tantalizing. Unfortunately, it seems that by working together they have simply produced a compilation of all there best ideas which when put together into an entire movie simply don't wash. There were so many ideas taken from past Spielberg movies, Jaws, Close encounters, ET just to name a few. Then into to the mix comes JJ with his Lost / Cloverfield (which I love) mystery monster adult story. The result is a continued battle between a touching, funny, kids Spielberg movie with a confusing, alien monster that kills soldiers and has unbelievable power which as the story unfolds becomes absurd as to how the Army ever had control of it in the first place. This simply did not at up at all! To keep it simple these two movie styles should be kept separate. When they are combined together there is not enough of either to satisfy. Through the majority of the movie I just sat there thinking I've seen this before, I know what's going to happen next, it was better in the eighties. Cloverfield was far better, The Goonies was a classic, ET was a classic, Close Encounters was a classic, Jaws was a classic. This unfortunately was not!"
"rogerdob","1","84","153","10 June 2011"," Nothing's really explained!
","The movie is quite interesting...for about 30 minutes. Then things fall apart. It slows way down. Strange events happen over and over (and over again!) However, I was still interested in finding out what was really going on and wanted to know the cause of the events. However, the ending is quite contrived and everything that happens to save the day happens quite conveniently. But the real bummer is that nothing's really explained. Just like in Abram's TV series LOST, he doesn't bother to give answers to a whole bunch of questions. However, the worst part of this movie is the last two minutes...it's unbelievably schmaltzy and not worthy for anything but a movie that's intended for six-year-olds."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","16","24","20 January 2012"," Good times
","Growing up, I was in the generation of a lot of great kid's films like The Goonies, The Sandlot, Monster Squad and Stand by Me. But sadly my generation seemed to be the last one where we had great kid films that not only insulted it's demographic, but also had the great adventure that we needed. Watching those movies were just a great time and they've remained classics ever since I think because we haven't had a movie for a couple of decades. Steven Spielberg was the man who brought a lot of these classics alive, who better to collaborate with J.J. Abrams who knows great action and obviously has a love of the movies I just mentioned. They bring us Super 8, the trailers remained so mysterious and made you want to see the movie, because all it was, was a car crashing into a train and you had to guess what just jumped out of it. Sadly I had to wait until the rental, however what a great movie that I feel people are being just a little bit rough on.<br/><br/>Joe, a 13-year-old boy living in a small town in Ohio, has lost his mother in a factory accident. His friend Charles Kaznyk convinces schoolmate Alice to be the protagonist's wife in his low-budget zombie movie on Super 8 film. Alice steals her father's car and takes Joe, Charles, Preston, Martin, and Cary to an old train depot where the group plans to film a scene. During the shoot, Charles sees a train coming towards the depot and sets up the cameras, hoping that the passing train will add authenticity to the scene. As they are filming Joe watches a pick-up truck drive onto the tracks and place itself in the path of an oncoming train, causing a massive explosion. Something breaks open one of the train car's doors and escapes. They discover that their teacher caused the ""accident"" and that there is something invading their town. Together they try to find out what it is and help each other when the times get more rough.<br/><br/>The weird thing is I really did enjoy this movie, not just because of the nostalgic feeling but I honestly felt this was a good movie. I loved the chemistry between the kids, they all clicked so well and their friendships seemed very real. I loved the special effects, they didn't seem over the top with the CGI. The only complaint I would have with the film is the ending, where the kid is talking to the alien and saying how he could relate to him that bad things happen, which I though was very cheesy, but that's the Spielberg effect. I don't know why there are any negative reviews on the film, I know that you can't win them all but I loved that this traveled back in time for the adults and a great new way to introduce an excellent genre to the younger generation. Who knows if we will have any more classics down the line, but this was a fun trip down nostalgic lane. Super 8 has laughs, action, suspense and reminds you why you loved being a kid before technology hit so hard.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Fields201","4","55","98","12 June 2011"," J. J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg Collaborated For This?
","I wanted to give this film an 8. As the film went on, I was giving it a 7, then a five, and finally I settled with a 4. It's sad because this is one of those movies that I anticipated for a year now and I can't believe this was the result.<br/><br/>If this is what to expect in the celluloid graveyard of summer movies, then we're in trouble. The concept had potential, and it's enough for me to give them my ten dollars. The first act also sets up potential, but unfortunately the actual story tears this film down. The actual story was also a kept secret by the filmmakers. It's not because it's going to shock you, it's because they were embarrassed of the end result.<br/><br/>It's about a bunch of kids with a Super 8 camera trying to make a movie for a film festival (which is forgotten about in the third act), when suddenly a train derails and explosions happen all around them. The explosion is caused by their science teacher named Old Man Woodward. But then the military gets involved, and the kids take off with this rubix cube.<br/><br/>Yeah, there's a bunch of rubix cubes that the military confiscates and the main kid has it in his room. It, like the Super 8 camera itself, never feels like the focus of the film as it is busy establishing that the town is in fear and the kid's deputy dad is trying to fix things, and the relationship with the main kid and this girl Alice. Apparently, their dads don't want them to see each other and it becomes a child love story. <br/><br/>As the film drones on, it becomes worse and worse. Be prepared to hear the kids constantly yelling, ""What's going on?"" and ""What's happening?"" over and over. In the third act, the film derails like the train in the beginning as if the writer's experience writer's block but they just kept writing stuff just to get the script done. Everything starts to feel scripted and formulaic. There's also a moment between kid and alien that felt so out of place, and utterly ridiculous that it gets even worse right to the closing credits.<br/><br/>As of this writing, I regretfully hail Super 8 as the worst movie of the summer. It saddens me because I was so eager to see this, and so sure that it was going to be great, that I hate to end the summer movie season by listing this as the worst. It's still early, and a crop full of movies to go. Super 8, unfortunately, is far from being super."

","This movie was full of holes. A good movie will let you suspend your disbelief for 2 hours, but this one right from the train wreck had me shaking my head. It was too spectacular. Don't get me wrong I like a good train wreck, but my logic couldn't wrap it's arms around it. Train wrecks don't happen like that, there are laws of physics you know, and even if they did who could survive a head on crash like that? This alien was so advanced he was able to create havoc with our weapons, electronics, everything we threw at it, and yet were to believe we kept it in captivity for decades. P.S. Haven't we had just about enough of ugly bug/reptilian like aliens. Obviously with their ability to travel inter-galactic space they are way more advanced than us so why do we always dumb them down and limit them to a few grunts or growls just before they claw our eyes out. Why was it abducting people and just hanging them upside down? What's with the dogs?? How did the water tower of junk turn into a spectacular shiny spaceship??? Are we to believe it was powered by all those missing car engines and microwave ovens that it was stealing???? It's not just the aliens that are being dumbed down, Hollywood is dumbing us down into accepting this crap. Gimme a break please"
"Rick_Swift","10","55","102","9 June 2011"," Simply an AMAZING STORY!
","Swift shot: If you see this one in theaters, count yourself enlightened, if you wait to rent or own Blu Ray, consider yourself miserable. Because, trust me, if you wait til you are home to see this for the first time, unless you are exceptionally wealthy and have a veritable theater sized screen at home – - – you are going to be kicking yourself forever! Occasionally, every few decades or so, a film comes along that just fires on all cylinders and resonates with something inside you that hasn't been active since you were a kid. Super 8 manages to do just that, stir up imaginations I once thought completely dormant – where the critical, cynical adult in me keeps the child bolted up in a dungeon called ""the impossible"". I want to thank EVERYONE who made this film a reality, and I wonder if Paramount knows just how fortunate they are to have some of the best film-makers to ever hold that title on their label? Set in 1979 in a steel town in Ohio, Super 8 essentially is a story about a group of friends, over the summer, dealing with a tragedy that one of them endures at the onset of the film. It has the feel of a Stand By Me script, though devoid of any narration or device that tells the story in the present. This film, again, is just an Amazing Story with a supernatural, monster-thriller, or sci-fi element tossed in to keep the characters constantly malleable and interesting.<br/><br/>With great tragedy comes the need for great distraction, and Writer/Director J. J. Abrams gets this, and displays this, quite efficiently. Rather than let their friend, Joe (Joel Courtney) dwell on his personal loss, his gang of misfits, led by Charles (Riley Griffiths) – who thinks he is the next Hitchcock or Romero – comes up with a perfect distraction . . . a zombie film. At first some of the others think it a bit tacky to involve a kid who just lost someone close to be shooting a zombie flick, but they figure it might help him take his mind off of the loss as well. Not to mention, the girl who everyone is afraid to talk to, Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) has agreed to be in the film as zombie hunting detective, Martin's (Gabriel Basso) wife.<br/><br/>It all starts off innocently enough, Alice steals her dad's car, without a license (rebels that they are) to drive them to the shoot, EXTERIOR: late at night, a train station, now closed. They run through lines, Charles delights in directing his friends, and he tries to get the most out of what he's working with. His friends are a great team, considering they are in middle-school, and they manage a level of professionalism that exceeds their years. Then, something happens, a crash, about an EIGHT on the butt-pucker scale (patent pending), which really sets the sci-fi or supernatural elements into locomotion.<br/><br/>What happens next is all too easy to spoil, suffice it to say, something is not quite right in the steel town of Lilian, Ohio circa 1979. The Air Force, helmed by Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich) is somehow involved, Joe's dad, Jackson, the deputy sheriff, played by the exceptionally talented TV-actor (Kyle Chandler) is suddenly put in charge and the misfits find themselves caught in the middle of everything but are still hell-bent on finishing their film to submit to the Cleveland Film Festival . . . ah great aspirations must start somewhere, but Cleveland? Comedy and tragedy is spliced into the story masterfully in short little bursts with character dialog, incredible action sequences and excellent acting. And, someone check me if I am wrong, but did they cryo freeze the blond-haired brat from the 70′s version of The Bad News Bears and place braces on him to hide his identity? Because, that kid Cary (Ryan Lee) in Super 8 is his clone! Super 8 is a high-tech drama with a childish heart that reminds you what it was like to build models, pine for the prettiest girl in school, and to never stop fighting for those you love. It is a film about loss, grief, struggling to cope and acceptance, all with a ""twist"" just to make things more interesting . . . or rather, AMAZING!"

","Found it hard to believe this movie got high reviews. I love Scify, but except for a couple funny lines I was bored stiff. Took my wife with me and her comment was that this was the most stupid movie she has seen. <br/><br/>I saw X-men and thought that was great, but don't waste your money on this one. <br/><br/>Sure the special effects were great, but these days you come to expect about the same in most movies of this type. The movie may be liked more by the younger crowd, but the mature audience will see a boring movie with a simple, silly plot. I went to see Super 8 because of the reviews, but will be a little more cautious in the future."

I gave up on this movie right about there. We had yet another instance of humans outrunning flying debris and coming out unscathed. And where did the displacement of all the rock and dirt end up when the alien built that huge cavern? The acting was alright, but the plot holes were big enough to hide a hundred aliens. It fails the science part of science fiction. I hope Cowboys and Aliens is better than this. This movie left me flat. The best part was the kid's movie that ran during the credits."

","This film has wonderful production values and excellent acting. However, it is totally derivative and predictable. I expected much more from Abrams and Spielberg. I can only guess that all of the reviews giving this 9s and 10s were written by 14-year-olds. There is absolutely no suspense. Rather the film goes for shocks - often. Val Lewton first discovered this technique in Cat People and it has been known ever after as a ""bus"". To be effective a bus has to be completely unexpected. Super 8's buses can be seen coming down the street for several blocks. The plot is completely unbelievable. The monster digs a pit and miles of tunnels in one day. I believed this could be done by a flying saucer when Invaders from Mars scared the wits out of me in 1953. But a single monster? And one that could attract tons of metal and magically turn it into a space ship? (Did anyone notice that while the kid's locket was being attracted to the water tower a background character had a necklace that wasn't?) Yet the monster couldn't escape from a box car? And don't get me started on the train wreck. Exciting - sure. But totally breaking the laws of physics. It is impossible for a truck to derail a locomotive on a straightaway. The truck would simply be pushed down the track for however long it took for the engineer to stop the train. And even if the loco derailed the rest of the train wouldn't act like a speeding bullet. Let's just sum it up by saying the great films are able to make you suspend your disbelief even over the most incredible events. Super 8 fails, making it only a so-so film."

I just couldn't stand watching these kids make home movies for the first hour of the movie. I kind of felt like taking a nap.

"Lyra-gp","10","38","70","5 August 2011"," Super 8, the 'format of my childhood'
","I cannot even remember for how long I have been waiting for this movie before watching it this morning. It was kinda a dream come true, I could hardly believe that I was finally experiencing the film whose trailers had made me shiver more than just once. I was so keen that I could not wait: I went to the cinema for the first show at midday. The perfect mix (A pinch of Elle Fanning, some good chilling thrill, a mysterious creature and our darling J. J. Abrams) for a 20-year-old guy like me. Just to give you an idea of what impact this movie had to me I can tell you readers that, although several hours have passed since the show, I am still thinking of the plot, the characters and the music. Super 8 will unlikely make no impressions on you: You love it or you hate it. It's not just a matter of having sci-fi thrillers among the favorite movie genres because the film is first of all a cinematic experiment: A J J Abrams attempt to introduce the spectacular way to see the life of the 80s Steven Spielberg and a friend-love-family-destruction plot into the new Millennium generation. <br/><br/>First things first it cannot be said that the movie is not well-directed: Abrams has a great experience, even when he 'copies' from his cine-mate Spielberg (There are some delicious brainwaves: The way in which he indirectly informs us about the incident in the factory, the way in which he avoids to show the creature when it attacks - You'll understand what I am talking about when you'll watch the movie). So, even just for that I'd rate the movie 8 stars. <br/><br/>Secondly, the cast. And when I say 'the cast' I am mostly referring to Elle Fanning: She's stunningly beautiful and she has a face expressiveness I have seldom recognized in a 13- year-old girl. Concerning the other members of the cast I really cannot blame anyone and very surprisingly I really enjoyed the performances of the younger ones. Very well chosen 'faces' make this movie a must-see (And here I MUST praise those who choose the cast: In contrast with a large number of cinematic productions where people choose the actors according to their 'hotness' or 'being cool', NONE of the faces seen in Super 8 seem to be 'dull' and 'banal').<br/><br/>Thirdly, the plot. OK, it's not Agatha Christie, it's not Shamalayan (at least at the time of The Sixth Sense) but it's good and gripping. Maybe a little bit predictable, but I would have blamed the writers if they had chosen to make the movie end in a different way. The plot is quite simple; however, it's all I was expecting from a movie like this: I really have no reason to be disappointed because I felt strongly satisfied at the end of the movie. It's moving, it's thrilling, there are even a lot of jumping-off-the-seat moments and, last but not least, SPECTACULAR. <br/><br/>Fourthly, the Music. Even though we can identify a main theme that is repeated in different ways and tones during the movie, Michael Giacchino did a very very very good job. It's not an anonymous theme, it's a theme that I still keep humming in my mind and that, in my opinion, is far better than many other themes from movies far more popular than Super 8. <br/><br/>Last considerations. Super 8 is a movie I've been waiting for for a very long time. Quite happily I may say, today, that it did not disappoint me, not in a single way. J J Abrams, the cast, the Music Composer did a very good job. It's not perfect for sure but it has everything it needs to be considered a 'cult' and I will probably let it in my 'cinematic'-heart."

This Spielberg production is a fun movie concerning a feisty bunch of underprivileged kids whose Super 8 filmmaking project is about to be destroyed by weird events . During the summer of 1979, in a small Ohio town a group of friends (film debut of Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths) while making a super 8 Zombie movie (since the kids were making a zombie movie, there are several references to director George A. Romero , as the poster for one of his movies in Joe's bedroom) witness a catastrophic train crash and soon suspect that it was not an accident. Shortly after, unusual disappearances and inexplicable events begin to take place in town, and the local Deputy (Kyle Chandler, Jeremy Renner declined the lead role ) tries to uncover the truth - something more frightening than any of them could have thought - and investigate subsequent unexplained events in their small town. They spend one last adventure-filled Saturday Afternoon together when one of them is kidnapped (Elle Fanning , sister of Dakota Fanning who during the town hall meeting, for a brief second you can spot among the assistants) . This happens after they find a film about their teacher , that could be the solution to all their problems . <br/><br/>This is an amusing mess made in Spielberg style, the goal was to pay homage to the science-fiction movies of the '70s and 80s . The story results to be an emotive homage to Spielberg -as the famous bicycle from Steven Spielberg's movie E.T. can be seen as a part of metal junk that is being attached to the water tower in one of the final scenes- and to cinema of the 80s , taking parts here and there from various film as ¨E.T.¨ , ¨Close encounters of third kind¨ and specially ¨The Goonies¨ , though directed by Richard Donner was written by Spielberg . Imaginative and rousing musical score by Michael Giacchino in John Williams style . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Larry Fong . Top-notch FX , Bruce Greenwood provided the motion-capture performance of the alien , as J.J. Abrams insisted that the train station scenes were actually shot at night outside, instead of in a studio , though the train is completely computer-generated , in fact , the train crash was purposely made much more sensational than a train crash would actually be. Lavishly produced by Steven Spielberg was reportedly on set many times throughout the course of filming , Director J.J. Abrams and Spielberg have both gone on record stating that the filming of this production was some of the most fun they have ever had on set. The motion picture will appeal to Steven Spielberg and J.J. Abrams buffs . Rating : Better tan average , well worth watching ."

","Super 8 is J.J. Abrams' ultimate tribute to the films that defined executive producer Steven Spielberg's career around the same time in which the movie is set, back in 1979. It contains elements of Jaws, The Goonies, E.T and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, while also working in later favourites like Jurassic Park. But you know this already, mostly because everyone in the media discussing this film seems to be falling over themselves to remind you of how good Spielberg is. While I don't dispute this, Super 8 is Abrams' child, so without further ado, let's see what he can bring to the table.<br/><br/>When young Joel and his friends meet at a railway station one night to film a scene for their amateur zombie movie, they're shocked to see a car drive onto the train tracks, causing the spectacular derailment of an oncoming train we later learn was transporting top secret exhibits from Area 51. A creature not of this world manages to escape from its holding carriage, and over the next few weeks the residents of Lillian can't understand why their dogs have all fled the county, and why so many electrical appliances have gone missing.<br/><br/>The film is shot in a unique fashion, using a semi-sepia tone that, at times, is reminiscent of Gordon Willis' cinematography in the Godfather trilogy. Abrams includes the deliberate use of lens flare (the shining lines you sometimes get when pointing a camera at a bright light), which serves a self-reflexive purpose but can get a little irritating. The setting has been recreated beautifully, with everything from the clothes to the cars to the music contributing to the cultural landscape that was late '70s rural America.<br/><br/>Given the subject matter, this film certainly could have been a lot worse. What it ends up being is a slightly above-average monster movie that, for the most part, seems to ignore the fact that a monster is on the loose. How does that even make sense? Well, a big part of it is the interplay between the talented cast of completely unknown child actors, who play off a good script and show maturity in their ability to portray interpersonal hardship that one wouldn't normally associate with this genre.<br/><br/>The film deals with themes such as family, jealousy and friendship, and it is truly a breath of fresh air to see a mainstream movie apply some well-structured character development in a genre that has recently been plagued with nothing but cardboard cut-outs of protagonists (see: Cloverfield, Skyline and Battle LA). Let me put it this way: if you get rid of the monster, and put a touch more thought into each character's persona, Super 8 could easily pass off as an Oscar-baiting, coming-of-age drama about a boy learning to let loved ones back into his life following the traumatic death of his mother. <br/><br/>It is ironic, then, that the movie slips into mundane and predictable territory as soon as the monster becomes the focal point in the Final Act. All these complex and engaging relationships we've seen build between the kids take a back seat in the final half-hour, in place of a climax that lacks originality and, quite frankly, tries to be too emotional for its own good, to the point of becoming sappy. Without giving too much away, Abrams tries to humanise the creature by comparing its plight to that of Joel, and the comparison is hammered home with such ferocity (using both imagery and dialogue) as if to imply we didn't get it the first three times. <br/><br/>Finally, I could have gone without the delayed reveal of the monster. I find that film technique rather dated and didn't really build up as much suspense as expected. That, and the fact that when the monster is shown in its entirety, it isn't exactly the biggest payoff in movie history. As with every movie that surpasses the halfway point of my ratings system, I will recommend it, just not with the same gusto that I hoped I'd have.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"

","J. J. Abrams directs ""Super 8"", a love-letter to all things Steven Spielberg. Packed to the brim with allusions to Spielberg's films and personal life, the film revolves around a kid called Joe whose attempts to film a low budget movie are thwarted when a military train derails and releases a marauding alien into his sleepy, Ohio town.<br/><br/>The film plays like a Spielberg show-reel. Its plot, iconography and setting recall ""Close Encounters"" and ""ET"", several of its action sequences recall ""War of the Worlds"" and Spielberg's ""Jurassic Park"" movies, its quiet suburbias and rural landscapes recall everything from ""Poltergeist"" to ""Encounters"" and its gang of little rascals allude to both Spielberg's youth as a kid-director and the junior adventurers of ""Goonies"" and ""ET"". Then there's the film's giant train-crash set piece, a nod to Spielberg's love for the train wreck in 1952's ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", a set piece which he'd himself recreate as a kid in his very first amateur movie.<br/><br/>While Abrams also mimics Spielberg's cinematography, camera work and orchestrals, what links his film strongest to Spielberg's filmography is its central plot. Here, Joe's mother's death (and his distance from his father) echoes the real-life divorce of Spielberg's parents, a psychic scar which casts ripples on virtually all of Spielberg's pictures, with their absent fathers, separation anxieties and aching longings for daddies to ""phone home"" and mommies to ""be good"". ""Phoning home"" is also what Abram's alien hopes to do, the creature's plight echoing young Joe's, both alien monster and Ohio boy yearning to bury past scars, ""let go"" and ""grow up"". The film's only moment which works occurs during its climax, in which little Joe lets go of a locket which contains a photograph of his mom. The metaphor is heavy-handed – he LITERALLY LETS HER GO – but the sweep of the scene works very well.<br/><br/>What doesn't work is the rest of the film. Abrams can't frame a scene, move a camera, has no gift for action sequences, his script is obvious, his alien looks silly, his CGI is terrible, his kids swear too much, his plot is derivative, he overloads on Spielbergian camera work, his script is unsurprising and the film as a whole feels like a billion dollar fanboy movie. What's worse, the whole film is about moving forward and letting go of the past, and yet is supremely backward-looking, like a nostalgic necrophiliac preoccupied with unearthing and licking Spielberg's corpses.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the film is set in 1979, literally between Spielberg's ""Encounters"" and ""ET"". Those two films were themselves infused with a nostalgia for 1950s scifi B movies (""Invaders From Mars"", ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"", ""It Came From Outter Space"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""Them"", ""The Thing"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" ""Earth vs the Flying Saucers""), with their alien invasions, military jeeps, suburban/rural paranoia and little kid heroes. Spielberg's films were themselves packed with moments cribbed from these classics (""Jaws"" literally uses the same score and scenes from ""Creature from the Black Lagoon""), but because only he and Lucas were repackaging these films in his era, they felt fresh. Today almost all Blockbusters borrow from the Spielberg model (ie are B movies or exploitation films with mega A movie budgets), so what's the point making a ""Super 8""? <br/><br/>6/10 – Worth one viewing. See ""Bowfinger"" and ""Signs""."

","This was- and I don't take this claim lightly- one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After it was finally over, I rode home from the theatre in utter disbelief, feeling as though I needed a shower to cleanse the reeking resonance from myself. The one positive thing I have to say about the film is that the effects- at times (and mostly early on so that you don't walk out after twenty minutes)- were impressive. The plot is unoriginal and corny; a failing attempt at injecting the overdone ""aliens terrorize a small town"" movie with a bit of drama and depth. After an hour I was still waiting for a glimmer of improvement, only to be wildly disappointed. I am still awestruck that Steven Spielberg attached his name to such a tragedy as ""Super 8."" The only scary part of the whole experience is that this film somehow earned a stamp of approval from anybody, and the most heart-wrenching moment was when I remembered that I had paid to undergo such a painful viewing. Obviously I cannot say enough about the poor quality of ""Super 8."" I'd immediately refuse another showing even if I was bribed."

Adventure, action, suspense, humor, and relatable characters who experience things the way humans do. Sure, there were a couple moments at the end where I thought, ""Really?"", but Abrams and the gang were savvy enough to put almost every objection my overly-rational grown-up mind had throughout the picture and put skeptical words into the mouth of a nearby character, thereby stealing my ammunition.<br/><br/>I don't think you need to love movies in order to enjoy this ride, but if you love movies or, especially, if you've ever made one of your own, I don't see how you could dislike it.<br/><br/>Plus all the sci-fi-ish stuff was badass."
"Cinnyaste","3","23","42","10 June 2011"," Stale Popcorn With Rancid Butter
","Think Spielberg Lite: a dollop of his heart, half the storytelling ability, ladle on the special effects.<br/><br/>Super 8 is a nearly forgotten film format that succumbed to portable video in the late Seventies. Much the same way ""Super 8"" will be quickly forgotten by the time eyes acclimate to sunshine outside the theater.<br/><br/>'Popcorn' films were invented by Mr. Spielberg who mentored this project that's a thinly disguised sycophantic homage. Mr. Abrams (born 1965) is no Spielberg. (Speilberg is no longer Spielberg.) There are a few obvious nods to Mr. S.: among many others, a character named Brody, flying bike and a shot cobbed directly from ""CE3K."" In ""Super 8"" Mr. Abrams also casts himself as the heir apparent to the Speilbergian crown. It's the same deadly mistake M. Night Shyamalan made in stating, ""I'm the new Hitchcock,"" just before releasing ""The Happening.""<br/><br/>Summer blockbusters eschew artistic merit for the promise of thrill ride entertainment. But Mr. Abrams falls far short by offering cardboard cutout characters – the square jawed, brave Sheriff-Dad; the mean-as-hell USAF Colonel - playacting basic emotions in a logic-defying story. In a reversal of Spielberg's 'Absent Dad', the opening shots introduce the 'Absent Mom' who's been crushed to death by a steel beam in the local mill. It's 1979. You know, when America still made steel.<br/><br/>A group of budding filmmakers hope to score big at the Cleveland Film Festival by producing a Zombie opus. Their filmic effort is interrupted by a massive train wreck loosing an alien transported cross-country via rail. (Huh?) The alien crashed on Earth a few decades ago, and suffered torture at the hand of the aforementioned mean-as-hell Colonel. (Why is it advanced lifeforms have difficulties piloting their craft? Don't they have to pass a test?) It seems all the none-too-cute alien really wants is to go home. Gee, that has a familiar ring.<br/><br/>The Kid-Director sees an opportunity to use the wreckage and sudden influx of military as backdrop and 'production value' for ""The Case,"" the Zombie film within 'Super 8."" Meanwhile, a little romance brews between the leading lady and our 13 year old hero.<br/><br/>Of course the leading lady is abducted as lunch for the alien, and the brave hero sets off to rescue her. The contrivances pile so high and so rapidly the brain numbs. Anyone over six years old intuits where things are headed light years before they occur. (Why are humans such a delicacy on alien menus? All the dogs are smarter and split the County before they become snacks.)<br/><br/>The one saving grace is Elle Fanning who is not only too good for ""The Case,"" but too stellar for ""Super 8."" Her eyes belie a depth even her sister, Dakota, hasn't plumbed – and that's saying a lot. However, there's cheapness in using a plot device featuring children as wise stand-ins for adult thoughts and emotions. Kids are kids. They ain't wise.<br/><br/>There are a few laughs, but most of the wise ass lines fall flat and, at the showing I attended, were met with stony silence not only by this reviewer but my fellow travelers as well.<br/><br/>On the technical side the dialog mix was set very low. This is always a clue the filmmaker is practicing sleight of hand to direct your attention to the visuals, not the story.<br/><br/>""Super 8"" as a 'Popcorn' film is only modestly entertaining, and in fairness the first half holds promise, but then plods to a feeble, sappy conclusion. It's mostly zip-bam-boom, and more surrender-your-brain-at-the-concession-stand than most. In its sloppy, ill and under-written script lies the germ of a great story with a lot of heart. Unfortunately, Mr. Abrams left that part in his word processor and instead infused the film with narcissistic recollections of his pubescent years as a LA film business brat. And set it all to his favorite songs from the late Seventies.<br/><br/>Make certain to stay through the credits when the amateurish ""The Case"" is unspooled in its entirety. It's funnier and more entertaining than the preceding two hours. Better still, stay home and NetFlix a double feature of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""ET."""
"anythinghorrorscott","2","21","38","20 June 2011"," SUPER 8 is Super Lame
","What a roller coaster ride!! I'm not talking about SUPER 8 itself, but am referring to the marketing blitz and mysterious buzz this film's had over the past year. Since May of 2010, this film's had a buzz even before the casting was finalized. There were rumors that SUPER 8 was either the prequel or sequel to CLOVERFIELD and then that it was a stand-alone ""giant creature runs amok"" film. Either way I was really looking forward to seeing SUPER 8 for the better part of a year. Then all of a sudden Steven Spielberg got involved. Hhmmm. Sure he terrified us with JAWS and somewhat scared us with POLTERGEIST, but since then I really can't say Spielberg has done anything all that interesting in the genre. And then I saw the trailer; the trailer where all you see are children and floating cars. I suddenly found myself not all that excited anymore. My gut was telling me this was gonna be a pathetic kid's flick; an E.T. for the new generation. My gut was right.<br/><br/>I'm angry people; seriously angry. I went to the midnight screening of SUPER 8 and realized that 90% of the cast aren't even allowed to stay up that late. Let me summarize what this film is and then explain why I did indeed hate it. That's right; I hated this movie. SUPER 8 is nothing more (and I mean nothing more) than THE GOONIES meets E.T. meets every single coming-of-age kids' drama ever made. Now let me be clear: I love THE GOONIES. It's a great film because I knew I was getting a fun kid's movie. SUPER 8 was marketed as a ""giant creature destroying stuff"" movie. There's more sentimentality and schmaltzy emotion in SUPER 8 than in most romantic comedies. I had to double check to make sure Rob Reiner didn't direct this one. Let's get to the story.<br/><br/>The film begins with a funeral. Little Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) lost his mom in a factory accident. A steel girder turned her into a pile of goo. Joe's dad, Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) is the small town's deputy and is a good candidate for the Worst Father of the Year award. Now keep in mind that all the kids in this film are in middle school yet act and think like adults. It's a total Spielbergian world here. Joe's helping his tubby friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) make a zombie film. One night at midnight (that's right; midnight ... are there no good parents in this entire town??) Joe, Charles, Preston (Zach Mills), Martin (Gabriel Basso), and Alice (Elle Fanning) all gather outside of town at the train station to film a scene. There's a horrendous train wreck which some thing survives, and it goes on a semi-killing spree in the town. First the electricity is knocked out, then people and pets go missing. <br/><br/>The creature takes a back seat to the drama going on with the kids and Abrams doesn't miss any of the common coming-of-age/GOONIES/E.T. trappings. Does the main kid, Joe, go through some kind of trauma? Check. Does Joe have an estranged relationship with his father that gets reconciled with as much cheese as possible? Check. Does Joe have a sweet, innocent love interest? Check. Does his love interest, Alice, have an estranged relationship with her dad? Check. Is there a mystery that only the kids can solve because the parents are all ineffectual? Check. Do we have a funny, fat kid? Check. Is there an evil military dude. Check. Is there a semi-scary looking, misunderstood creature who's really just scared and is more ""human"" than the ""monstrous"" military guys tracking it down? Check. Yup; its all here, and when you add it all up there's nothing scary or horrifying in this entire film.<br/><br/>The best thing going on here is the train wreck in the beginning. Abrams knows how to film a great wreck (i.e., the plane crash in the pilot of LOST) and the train wreck here is spectacular. But after that everything takes a back seat to the kid's, their problems, and their drama. I was also confused with the tone/setting of the film. It obviously takes place in the 1980's, but it feels as though it's set in the 1960's. The tone was all wrong. <br/><br/>SUPER 8 is pure, 100% sappy schmaltz marketed as a genre film. Everything about this film is targeted at a young crowd and it blatantly and liberally rips off THE GOONIES and E.T. We even get floating bikes and a touching ending. Technically this movie is extremely well done. The acting is strong from the young cast and it's filmed beautifully. It's just the content that I hated. The story offers absolutely nothing new and what's worse, the movies SUPER 8 rips off are way more enjoyable. SUPER 8 will definitely find an audience but if you're looking for an edgy monster flick, SUPER 8 is definitely not for you. You never feel any of the kids, or even main adults, are ever in danger, and the only scares Abrams musters are from having a loud accent of music as something jumps out of a shadow.<br/><br/>SUPER 8 is a huge disappointment and a rare miss by JJ Abrams ... a HUGE miss. Even though the credits assure is that SUPER 8 was written and directed by JJ Abrams, there's no doubt this is a Steven Spielberg film. If you're looking for a sugary kid's flick a la THE GOONIES, then go watch THE GOONIES. If you're looking for a disgustingly sentimental film like E.T, then go watch E.T. If you're looking for a giant creature film like CLOVERFIELD, then go watch CLOVERFIELD. But if you wanna be completely disappointed and feel let down after 12 months of hype and buzz, then SUPER 8 is what you're looking for. I hated this film."

","If there's one movie you shouldn't miss this year, it's Super 8. There's more heart and soul in it's two hour running time than most mainstream movies could ever hope to conjure. It's the kind of film that reminds you of why you go to the movies.<br/><br/>Reviewing a film like Super 8 isn't easy, there's simply too much material to cover and there is the delicate problem of giving too much away. Director JJ Abrams has gone to great lengths to keep the plot of his movie a secret, so much so that the film's resulting low profile may hurt it's box office take. He's the master of what he calls the ""Mystery Box"", he doesn't want to tell you what's in it, but he sure as hell wants you to enjoy opening it.<br/><br/>The film is set in a small Ohio town in 1979, complete with bad fashion, hairstyles, and fantastic cars. It centres on Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), son of Deputy Sheriff Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler), and the tragic events of that winter and how it changed his life. The film opens with one of the most chilling shots that will stay with you for a long time after the film, it's the kind of story telling you wish you could feel every time you went to the cinema.<br/><br/>Four months later and Joe is helping his friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) finish a super 8 movie for an upcoming film competition, much to the displeasure of his disconnected father Jackson. Charles has managed to convince Alice (Elle Fanning), an older girl whom Joe likes to play a part in his movie. All chuffed and excited they sneak out at night with their firiends Carey (Ryan Lee), Preston (Zach MIllso), and Martin (Gabriel Basso) to film a scene.<br/><br/>While filming they witness a shocking crash, their high school science teacher driving his pickup truck onto the train tracks and smashing directly into an oncoming train. The heavily injured teacher, gun in hand, tells them to go and tell no one or they and their parents will die. It's a bit dramatic, but the swarming men in military uniforms convince the children to make a run for it and vow never to tell anyone that they were there.<br/><br/>What follows is like a cross between The Goonies and E.T., and it doesn't fail to deliver. It's on the one hand a coming age story and on the other it's about dealing with grief. It's funny, scary, cheesy, and delightful all at the same time. The young and unknown cast are fantastic, they look comfortable and completely natural, with special mention to Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning (sister of Dakota Fanning). Those two are mesmerizing sharing much of the more touching moments of the film, especially Fanning who has a very commanding presence for her age.<br/><br/>It's not without it's problems true, Abrams must suffer from ADHD because he seems to love to blow things up even when it doesn't really make sense to. He's also a bit clumsy with some of the dialogue, but it's excusable because the rest of the film exudes a charisma I wish other Directors could master. I also think he's yet to master the elusive art of timing, particularly during the film's climax. He lacks a sense of pace when the plot demands it, and he under plays some action while overplaying others.<br/><br/>There has also been some debate over the ending, but I think it's perfect, I think it's easy to forget what this film is really about, which might be the fault of the film itself. But you only need to listen to Abrams tell you that ""Jaws isn't about a shark"" or ""E.T. isn't about an Alien"" (here) to see that he wants to tell a story that's very human and with a lot of heart.<br/><br/>Super 8 is an Abrams ""Mystery Box"" complete with a satisfying unveiling of the goodies inside. It's the best movie so far of 2011, and it's a real treat. You do not want to miss it!"

","I called this ""Calling Walter Kronkite"" because you see him at the beginning of the film, and as the film pro or regresses one wonders why someone just doesn't call 60 minutes or some other outfit to investigate the strange goings on in this town. I mean when all your dogs go missing, dozens of automobile engines are stolen overnight, etc., etc. doesn't that sound as though a major news organization might be interested in those mysterious events? Apparently not. Does this town not have a newspaper, or a television station, or any other communication with the outside world? After all, this is 1979 not 1949. Guess not.<br/><br/>However, putting that aside, I marked spoiler but the next statements are not (I don't think) spoilers because they occur near the beginning of the movie. But, just in case. So, here goes: A huge train towing I don't know how many cars (but lots) comes barreling full speed along a railroad track when a pickup truck turns onto the rails and heads full tilt toward the rushing train. The engine, of course, hits the truck at full speed, the train goes off the track, and railroad cars fly as though someone threw a handful of toothpicks across a room. Wow! Yeah. Do you know what would happen to a train with the force of a dozen or more speeding rail cars behind it if it hit a puny pickup truck? Nothing, that's what. Do you know what would happen to the pickup truck and it's occupant? They would be disintegrated into millions of tiny little pieces, that's what. But not this truck, no-sir-ee, it's still in one piece, a little mangled, but in one piece. And the guy driving it? No need to worry, he's alive, oh, banged up and a little bloody, but not too bad off at all. This should be insulting to any true lover of film or sci-fi because it tells you that the director thinks you're a mindless boob who will praise him no matter how outlandish the story line he delivers to you is. The end of this movie (which I will not reveal) is even stupider than this, reminding one too much of the Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skulls climatic fiasco. <br/><br/>As to other aspects of this film, it should have been rated R. It is filled with cursing from the beginning to the end, with the chubby kid having basically a one word vocabulary that rhymes with ""hit,"" which he says over and over and over and. . . . Once he says the ""P"" word, the one that used to describe a cat, in front of the 14 or 15 year old heroine and she says, ""Oh, that's OK."" Really? Chubs just called his male friend a term to indicate that his his friend was weak, a pansy, and cowardly, which, since that word is used to refer to the female anatomy and females in general, also means you little girl, and that's ""OK?"" Then there's the other hero of the film, the doper, the guy who offers to supply drugs to the kids, but, really, man, uh, you know, it's OK, he's cool. He's a good guy. He's a hero. <br/><br/>So, the messages to the targeted audience of youth this is aimed at are clear: 1. It's OK to curse. Be sure to do it hard, loud and obnoxiously; 2. Girls are trash and should not be offended by boys who talk dirty around them. They should recognize their inferior place in society and just accept themselves for the pathetic losers they are; and 3. Dopers aren't so bad.

","I haven't made any reviews on here for a while, but I felt the urge to do so for this particular film. Guys, this movie is not worth it. It's a bunch of ideas (taken from other movies, such as ""Cloverfield"", ""Goonies"" to name a few) put together and not in the best of ways. The scenario is flat, nothing surprising, no real emotions and a bit predictable. It feels like both JJ and Spielberg are toying with us, recycling older movies and just feeding it to us, the audience. Don't spend your cash on it, spend it on something a bit more useful. It might be worth renting it once it comes out on DVD but even then, I'm not sure..."

","Abrams has proved to be a talented cameraman. I don't mean this in a condescending manner, at least not entirely. But that's all there is with him, shape and contour. He's yet to situate himself within a worldview - so he borrows from where it is convenient to fit into. Here it's Spielberg - his world of wondrous discovery, magical escapade into comfortable menace, but where everything is wistfully made right again.<br/><br/>So you probably know by now how this is a pastiche built from other stuff; Close Encounters, The Host, The Goonies. The point-of-view is from the children (who are, perhaps, the only characters worth watching), the monster stalking the perimeters. The military is the faceless inhuman machine of cruel intentions. <br/><br/>What Abrams does is perfectly in tune with post-modernist ideas. But whereas the Coens appropriate raw essentials and even whole chunks of preconceived world but build from them their own notion of a universe, Abrams is merely an itinerant garbage collector.<br/><br/>It's all so derivative, so uniformly processed, it makes me wonder why anyone would take time out of their lives to make it - assuming one has creative aspirations about the art. Is Close Encounters really that old? So, like the myth of Prometheus; some artists risk to steal the fire that will renew our lives, a dangerous fire, others merely spend their time bound in the confines of earlier discovery."

","I'm really frustrated hearing how much people loved this movie, even people who are supposed to know movies. I heard a local critic say it was the best movie of the summer to date which left me baffled. I got absolutely nothing from it. It was like every other monster/alien movie had sex and this was the retarded baby that was born as a result. It starts out intriguing but then jumps the shark probably 30 minutes in. From there it just keeps getting worse and worse and is capped off with one of, if not the worst movie endings I have ever seen. Abrams was on The Dailey Show and basically admitted that they threw this piece of crap together from beginning (story development) to end in less than a year which explains a lot."

","From the day I first saw the trailer for Super 8, I longed to see this film. Having grown up on Spielberg, from Duel to Jaws to Close Encounters to Schindlers List, his genius is without equal. As a fan of JJ Abrams, especially Lost and Cloverfield, I went to the theater tonight expecting to walk out in slack jawed awe.<br/><br/>I walked out slack jawed, but only feeling disappointment. This film is essentially E.T. without the charm. A weak story line with more holes than a Swiss cheese factory, some truly insipid dialog, and character structure extracted straight from a night school screen writing class. <br/><br/>There are bright spots. The kids were superb actors, every one. The sets were gorgeous. The CGI impressive. Some hearty chuckles, especially the Sheriff's warning that Sony Walkmans were the start of a ""slippery slope."" I even enjoyed seeing an AMC Pacer get rear-ended by a Buick.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I felt like I was watching a highlight reel of Spielberg's trademarks: Richard Dreyfuss' noisy family scene from Close Encounters is replicated in shameless detail. People being pulled away screaming by an unseen beast, low camera angles with yawning skies, and 12 year olds far smarter than the adults. <br/><br/>It may be worth 3 bucks for a rental. It's not worth 20 at the theater."

","I was lucky enough to get to see Super 8 today at an advanced screening. I'd been excited for J. J. Abram's latest for months, but the result even exceeded my expectations. The secrecy of what happens to our group of middle schoolers is part of the film's appeal, so I won't spoil it. However, I will say that the first 4/5 of this film are an incredibly entertaining homage to the monster movies of the past. There's even mention of the Soviets invading! Real movie magic is created, kicked off by a breath-taking train crash sequence. Most of the middle school kids' performances are passable, but Elle Fanning stands out. She looks far older than she actually is, and acts as such. Her performance outshines even the adults around her. Unexpected humor is also present in the conversations that our heroes have. The wondrous, childlike aura of the film (and its ending) are expected from Spielberg, and it plays out a bit like ET + War of the Worlds + Cloverfield. This is a minor drawback, as the film focuses on the kids for the majority of its running time before suddenly switching gears at the end. Also, several plot lines, including the mother of our protagonist, run a little flat before they can fully develop. These problems being addressed, the ending doesn't quite live up to the extraordinarily high standards the rest of the film sets. It's not terrible, though! There is nothing else negative I can say about Super 8. It's hilarious, touching, scary, imaginative, and fun. And SO WELL EXECUTED. J. J. clearly knows how to make a movie, even if his writing isn't necessarily perfect. Without the few plot problems, Super 8 would be an Oscar contender. Unfortunately, I think that the Academy will look at Super 8 as nothing but above average summer fare. I will be seeing it again, however. And maybe again."

That's it.<br/><br/>The only thing that is correctly done is the alien: strangely enough there is not too much dramatic effect to render it.

"DonFishies","9","26","51","5 June 2011"," A wildly nostalgic and truly spectacular must-see event
","As the marketing and hype started to build for Super 8, I decided to try my best to not watch any real trailers or promos for the film. It was a difficult task, but somehow I managed to pull off allowing the film to be a mystery leading into its release. When I got the opportunity to see the film in advance fell into my lap, I did not second guess the hype – I ran to the theatre as fast as I could. <br/><br/>Taking place in the summer of 1979, Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) is part of an atypical group of friends making a film to enter into a local film festival. While shooting on a train platform late one night, the group witnesses a horrific train crash. They survive the mysterious crash, and do not think much of it. But then strange things begin happening in the town, and the US military suddenly shows up to clean up the damage, not to mention some bizarre things are being recovered from the crash.<br/><br/>I already feel like I have said too much regarding about Super 8, but my enthusiasm for this ridiculously well done film is too hard to contain. Abrams, alongside producer and obvious inspiration Steven Spielberg, has crafted something both special and truly extraordinary. What is on the outside a very keenly and nostalgically made film about the loss of innocence and the wonder of personal discovery, is also a period picture examining a time when the slightest enigmatic occurrence could lead to an accusation of Soviet invasion. Many will instantly equate the film to the early work of Spielberg himself (not only because of the various homages), but this is a film that was never meant to draw such easy comparisons.<br/><br/>With Super 8, Abrams has matured into a great filmmaker who is very quickly on their way to becoming a master of the craft. He tenderly embraces the format of a monster movie and the hard lessons behind growing up (not unlike Joe Cornish's significantly grittier Attack the Block), and never lets either get too far ahead of itself. While it can be thrilling and fused with electric intensity, it can also be very tender and moving. We know the focus is on these adorable, wide-eyed kids, but Abrams invests enough time into the adult characters like Kyle Chandler's Deputy Jackson Lamb and Louis Dainard, played by the obscenely underrated Ron Eldard as well. By doing this, he allows the audience to follow in the wonder of the children's vague cluelessness of the hell that is going on around them, and the adults trying to unravel the mystery. He also lets the script speak for itself, directing the increasing action brilliantly and allowing the actors to truly become the characters they are playing. I just hope he quickly realizes his stylish use of lens flare is beginning to border a little too close to overbearing.<br/><br/>Acting wise, the film fires on all cylinders. Chandler and Eldard are excellent in their fatherly roles, as is Noah Emmerich's absolutely despicable Nelec. But the show is completely stolen far and away by the children. This is really their movie, and they shine in each of their scenes. Casting relative unknowns in the majority of these roles, not least Courtney in the lead, helps give an enhanced sense of authenticity and fascination. The looks of fear, confusion, sadness and fun are real in the most flattering way possible. There is not one instance where any of these kids look like they are acting against a green-screen, or acting on a set. They act like seasoned veterans, and will surprise you consistently from the opening frame right until the end of the credits. Special mention also goes to Elle Fanning, who is rapidly proving to be a formidable talent who might be even stronger than her famous sister Dakota.<br/><br/>While I will not give away too many specific details, I can say the special effects should already be considered an early front runner for the best of the year. The train crash sequence involves some of the most incredibly and intensely depicted images of destruction I have ever seen. You will be on the edge of your seat unable to look away from just how amazingly realistic it all looks. With Super 8, the visual effects are taken to the extreme, and look absolutely astounding every time they are employed. Without ruining anything else, I can safely say you will be both terrified and awestruck by just how much effort was put into making these effects look so realistic.<br/><br/>If I hold anything against the film, it is the finale. The film is brilliantly paced and the tone is never taken for granted, but it just comes off a bit odd when compared to the rest of the film. It is not as disappointing as some may have you believe, but it was a bit too soft and cuddly for my liking – a little bit too close to what Spielberg would have done. We know the film is a nostalgic homage to those films that so many of us remember watching on weekends as kids, but the ending just does not jive as well as it could have. It feels like Abrams just did not want to commit to anything darker, and just went with the safest route he could think of. <br/><br/>If you are still reading this review and can see Super 8 now, than you have made a big mistake. With only his third film, Abrams has made a truly spectacular must-see film that demands to be seen as quickly as possible. Allowing some of the surprises to be spoiled is simply not an option. This is the best film of the summer thus far, and will be remembered well into the end of the year. <br/><br/>9/10.<br/><br/>(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."

","It was either this or Green Lantern which honestly is getting pummeled by the critics for being the worst superhero movie for a while (it's being compared to Cat Woman *shudders*). Having watched only the first trailer of Super 8, I entered the theater expecting something along the lines of Cloverfield (loved that movie). What I got was something along the lines of E.T., which in my books, is a good thing. Super 8 - to my utter surprise wasn't some super awesome monster as I initially expected but a motion picture film format.<br/><br/>In a fictional town of Lillian in Ohio, Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) lost his mother to an accident at the factory. His father, Deputy Sheriff Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) had never had the need to be a father until now. Unable to cope with the loss, a resilient Joe finds solace in an amateur zombie film he and his gang of misfit friends are making. His friends are Charles (Riley Griffiths), the best friend 'production values, production values' director; Cary (Ryan Lee), the bug eyed zombie explosives expert; Martin (Gabriel Basso), the pipsqueak zombie detective and Preston (Zach Mills), the geeky, smart cameraman. Charles manages the rope in 'oh my god you spoke to her' Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) to play the detectives soon to be zombie wife.<br/><br/>What unfolds next is what Po the panda would call 'AWESOME!' The kids are thrown in the midst of a train crash caused by their professor Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman) that releases thousands of metal objects that are the size of Rubik's cube, along with something else. Soon the Air Force under the command of Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich), is all over the wreckage and the town that is marred by mysterious events - from missing electronics and people, to runaway dogs. So while the adults are busy with the chaos, the kids carry on making their film while solving the mystery in their spare time.<br/><br/>The casting hits the nail on the head. Joel Courtney as the movie's protagonist does an impressive job in his very first film, showcasing the emotional depth the character demanded. Riley Griffiths was just right as a stressed out director whose constant gripes about completing his film were entertaining. He, like Joel's character had a crush on Elle Fanning who is fantastic; nothing more to it. Ryan Lee is a complete scene stealer with his funny one liner, Gabriel Basso's constant whining and Zach Mills as the totally non-obnoxious know-it-all is nostalgia stirringly good. These kids together carry the film from the first funeral scene to the climax. This is as film about them, everything else is secondary.<br/><br/>Kyle Chandler as the edgy father/deputy does justice to his character with controlled sentiments. Ron Eldard as Louis Dainard was believable as the remorseful drunk father while Glynn Turman and Noah Emmerich had one dimensional straightforward roles.<br/><br/>Character development was a bit of a mixed bag with a good amount of back story for the three main characters while everyone else was left in the dark. This doesn't bother you as much though, because it isn't of high importance in the complete picture. CGI was good and doesn't overshadow the actual actors. The soundtrack composed by Michael Giacchino echoes the emotions shown on the screen but fails to leave a mark. The story written by J.J. Abrams has plenty of potholes but with the compelling way it is presented with humor, drama and mystery; you tend to turn a blind eye to it.<br/><br/>This is out and out a Steven Spielberg film from the moment the Amblin logo shows up on the screen. As pointed out by numerous people, this film does feel like homage to sci-fi films made by him in the 1970's and 80's that were power packed with emotions and drama. J.J. Abrams at the helm makes you relive that childhood with wise wittiness and nerve wrecking scares with eerie excellence. He is turning into one skillful story teller.<br/><br/>The best film I've seen this summer that will go into my DVD collection. Oh and btw, wait for the credits to roll by to see one of the best parts of the movie; the completed zombie film."
"gigadragon12","8","21","41","18 June 2011"," Celebration of E.T. and Close Encounters comes with mixture of humor and horror that works brilliantly.
","Review Score: 8.5 – Go see it.<br/><br/>Super 8 is the story of a young group of kids who are trying to make a zombie movie in the summer of 1979. They're filming when they witness a terrible train wreck that causes their small town to become the hot spot of an Air Force Military Investigation. It quickly becomes clear that the military is attempting to keep something secret from everyone else and when people and mechanical items from around town begin disappearing things get even more hectic.<br/><br/>First off, if you couldn't tell by the trailers, Super 8 is a celebration of old school films Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and E.T. (1980) and mixes it with J.J. Abrams' two big secret dangerous monster staying off camera until further and further into the movie, a la Cloverfield (2008) and Lost (2004). This ultimately makes for a unique blend of sad child hood misfortune and scary dodgy monster movie tactics, which is a great mixture and works very well.<br/><br/>While I have a few quips with the movie, there is nothing particularly negative to say. The movie has brilliant development and revolves around a central theme of loss. The pacing seems appropriate and nothing seems terribly out of place. It does seem to have a love of needless explosions, though this seems more like a tactic to draw in the less enthusiastic action blockbuster crowd to see a movie that is ultimately more mystery and drama than action and explosions.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my one major quip, the train wreck scene and some of the plot developments around it (a stolen car that would at least be a bit dirty after a thousand explosions go off around it) seem to be ignored for the sake of letting the children get away with it. A few other plot points never seem to pan out, and really just seems like the director wasn't entirely sure they could control the plot lines (like say the children being arrested by the Air Force). Also the ending is unfortunately thin and easy to see coming.<br/><br/>But, as I said, any quips I have are minor. Another great thing is that its filled with quite a bit of humor, particularly the character and relationship of all the children making the film together blends together perfect and none are left without real character development by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Great movie, catch it when you can."

In this regard it may be a good idea to take a catatonic budding 5 year old film maker to the film to show that even brain dead boilermakers can make films and make loads of money, the key points being pay off the popular critics and the zombie critics on IMDb will follow. I have nothing nice to say liked the yellow with the black go fast stripe on it, but how did it survive the train wreck with out getting even a little dirty, craps is a game of dice this movie on misses the s. If you did not see the film please disregard this review and go for a walk."

","When JJ Abrams makes films, I either like them or don't like them. There doesn't seem to be a happy medium. A bit like with his recent attempt at a Star Trek movie, which I didn't like.<br/><br/>Now when you add Spielberg as well, I seem to have a similar reaction to his movies as well. Either he makes a masterpiece (I.E. Indiana Jones, ET, The Goonies, Hook) or he makes a movie that leaves you feeling that the hours spent watching that film could have been spent doing something more productive.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie hits the latter of the two. Now if we didn't have previous movies to go by, this would probably be a decent movie. But like what has been mentioned in previous comments, we've seen these kind of movie plots and characters many times before and in some cases done a lot better as well.<br/><br/>This is all down to personal opinion at the end of the day so if you haven't seen this movie, then please go and watch it and make up your own mind.<br/><br/>As I stated in my title, this movie had a lot of potential to be the new Goonies & ET movie of this century. Unfortunately it took all the elements of those movies, gave you the impression (in trailers) that it was going to be like Cloverfield, only to slap you in the face and give you something that doesn't even do either Director's names any justice at all.<br/><br/>Both Abrams and Spielberg can make outstanding movies. The ones they have made will be a part of many peoples lives for many years to come. Even with the new generation of kids, who I'm which will be sure to see the classics like ET, Goonies, Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>Like one reviewer said, if you want to see any movie that brings back that magic, then go watch them again. Nothing will ever beat the originals in my opinion.<br/><br/>At the moment in the movie industry, all we seem to get is Reboots, Prequals, Sequels to a movie that hasn't been done in over 10 years (IE Rocky, Die Hard etc), Origin movies and comic books to movies. Countless times we see this kind of thing being done and only about 1-2 out of 10 seem to bring anything new and original.<br/><br/>I will admit I have seen a lot worse out there and I did manage to get through the entire movie without turning away. However the 1/10 is the rating against Spielberg/Abrams best work in comparison...."

","SPOILER ALERT ALL OVER This is a movie I wanted to see. I am regretful. Premise sound good: A bunch of kids, doing a home made movie witness a train wreck which eventually will unfold a mystery. Movie starts well but quickly wears his charm out. Abrams use - and abuse of - all the frights and startles written in the ""scary movie"" book while he tries - in vain - to create some suspense in his own screenplay. Because screenplay is where the big problem lies... There is no background story to explain the main characters interaction, much less their parents. In top of that the creature's story is also severely under developed and we have to settle to some takes showing it trapped in some kid of laboratory taken out of a 50's B movie. We will not know how the thing crashed its ship, how these inept military guys were able to keep it trapped, how Dr. Woodward was able to know the exact route of the train - and don't tell me is telepathic connection. Also how is possible that this derailment takes about two minutes in screen - do these guys know anything about basic physics ? - but most of all: HOW IS POSSIBLE DR WOODWARD SURVIVES A FULL FRONTAL CRASH AGAINST A TRAIN WITH HALF OF HIS TRUCK'S CAB AND JUST MINOR INJURIES ? <br/><br/>I also will not say anything about the military showing in the scene just two minutes after the crash happened - great transportation - or about the late appearance of the creature, or the guns firing it selves or about the creature killing everybody but the main character (oh !...telepathy). But please somebody explain why this ""mystery"" movie is considered a Spielberg homage or why has 7.5 at IMDb... The only mystery for me is how I was fooled to watch this stupid piece of crap."

","Something strange is happening in a small town after a train derails . What was supposed to be a nostalgic look at the lives of a few middle schoolers in 1979 turns out to be the biggest movie non event of the year. Something is not right in this movie that fails for three reasons. First, it is entirely too much like the old ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Outer Limits"" TV shows. Secondly, the predictability factor manifests itself from the beginning. You know exactly what is going to happen before it even does. You just sit there and viola! It happens. Third is the ""Lets use every cliché from every sci-fi movie ever made"" factor.Self explanatory. The no name cast doesn't have one character you even care about. They look too clean, too polished,and too plastic just like animatronics at a Disney World attraction.And yes, they all have what I like to call the ""Spielberg Look""- you know, that dazed, glazed facial expression that was so prominent in ""ET"". If this turkey bears a resemblance to ""Close Encounters"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""ET"", ""Cloverfield"", and ""The Goonies"", thats the idea. There isn't an original idea anywhere in this mess. Its as if director Abrams was told to make a homage to early Spielberg films by Spielberg himself, and thats exactly what he did. Film does have its moments, but they are few and very far between. Film tries to be nostalgic, but 70s nostalgia? A great decade! Disco, Jimmy Carter, the looming Iran hostage crisis, inflation, oil crisses, unemployment, polyester, etc, etc. Kinda of sounds like today, doesn't it? I can go on and on but, dear reader, I think you get the point. This film has the cheesiest ending since ""Indiana Jones and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"",and the schmaltz in the last two minutes or so seems to have been applied with a trowel.As is, just alright for eight year old kids or undemanding viewers. However, adults who are looking for something with some brains and intelligence should go to another multiplex. However, you gotta admit that Spielberg is pretty smart. He just bought himself a 300 foot long yacht that cost over 200 million dollars.Mediocrity is its own reward,but to call this film mediocre is to praise it to high heaven. This film represents everything that is wrong with today's filmmaking and movies. Save your 11 bucks and the trip to the multiplex. It will be available on DVD before the summers over.Mark my words, you'll see. PS- ""Super 8"" refers to a type of 8mm film that was used for making home movies in the pre digital film age."

","To say this was a disappointment is an understatement, the story was boring and so was the camera work.

I can say that the acting of the young cast was very good and considering how bad the script it's the only plus part of the whole film.<br/><br/>I think we will see the same thing happen to J.J.

","A friend won two tickets to an advanced screening of this movie last night - so this review is done from the perspective of having watched it for free. :) <br/><br/>There are a lot of great things about this movie: The special effects are excellent without being gratuitous. In other words, the special effects enhance the story as opposed to BEING the story. The child actors do a great job of having their own personalities and really portraying the fun that kids have at that age. It does a good job of not making the adults out to be idiots (as so many movies do with child actors) but at the same time the adults have their own weaknesses. I felt connected to all the characters internal struggles. There is a good amount of tension throughout the first half of the movie, including several scenes that make you ""jump"". There are also several scenes that made me laugh so despite the tension, it never felt heavy.<br/><br/>The bad: The ending was disappointingly predictable. There were a couple moments of, ""There is no way a middle school kid would do that.""<br/><br/>In the end, I was glad to watch the movie but I don't think I'll be seeing it again. If you're looking for a good popcorn movie with a decent story, this is it. If you're hoping to see a movie that will leave you thinking about it for days, I would look elsewhere."

","I went to the advance screening of this movie last night. I have to say I was very impressed. Normally all these movies are all the same and have been done so many times. The story line wasn't original (cloverfield) However the way the movie was made was amazing. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie you will experience all emotions. I think each part was played very very and every character has some impact on the movie. <br/><br/>Joel courtney played the main character Joe lamb. You feel attached to this character throughout the movie and experience all his emotions with him. <br/><br/>Abrams tried to build suspense by keeping the audience from knowing what is actually going on. It sort of works, however its not too hard to guess. I would recommend going to see this movie and experience it in the cinema. The last 15 mins where a bit cheesy and weren't as good as the first hour and 45mins. If the ending was better without the cheese, I would of given this movie 10 out of 10."

"aaronjbong","9","11","21","28 June 2011"," ""Super 8"" is Super Great
","Note: I put the warning of this review as having spoilers, as I'm not sure if I've had written a spoiler below; just in case I wrote one that I considered as not one. <br/><br/>From first glance, ""Super 8"" resembles an enigma. Later on, the trailers seem to give us information of a very fatal train crash that sets fire lurking everywhere. Besides the derailing of the train, it also shows a mysterious monster punching through the train walls, which leads us to the conclusion that the monster is probably lurking within a small town, and secretly causing chaos around the small town. <br/><br/>The story inferred above is indeed correct. But that's not all. There's a whole lot other things that are related to the plot besides the fact that a monster is lurking within the fictional small town of Lillian. The only other thing I'm going to tell you is that a group of children were filming a Super 8 film (that's where the movie got its title) during the event of the train crash. And as a bonus, I'm going to tell you another thing: the events in ""Super 8"" will remind you of many of Steven Spielberg's films.<br/><br/>When watching this film, expect a lot of sudden monstrous attacks throughout the film. It will happen a lot of times and some will happen in the most unlikely scenes. So beware and keep your eyes open, the monster is everywhere. <br/><br/>The acting was convincing and satisfying for audiences to enjoy the film. The special effects were amazing and the script was nothing awkward. It was just - wow!<br/><br/>However, what amuses me is how they can use little children as brave heroes. Harry Potter is a young hero yes, but this, against aliens! And another thing: the main character, Joe is depicted in earning C- (or C+, I forgot), but amazingly, he can lead a group of other kids his age (apparently his friends) and devise a plan for saving his other friends. How amazing isn't it!<br/><br/>Despite the amusing things, the main culprit, the downside of this movie is no other than the ending. The ending was bland and felt too rushed. After an amazing approx. 100-minute run, the final minutes of the film was disappointing. I figured out the ending could have been much, much better. <br/><br/>But overall, I do recommend this movie to all movie adventurers, people who hunger for sudden scares, as well as Steven Spielberg's films. For movie adventurers, this film will take you on an adventure that will keep you hooked from beginning to ending. For moviegoers who loved to be scared suddenly, this movie will give you monstrous attacks that will get you shocked, even if you're almost immune to being shocked (sorry for putting too many ""shocks""). For lovers of Steven Spielberg, this movie will remind you of your Spielberg favorites (""E.T."", ""War of the Worlds"", etc.). <br/><br/>One statement about ""Super 8"": ""Super 8"" is super great!<br/><br/>Prince AJB's Rating: 9/10 (Very Good)<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review on ""Super 8"". I do hope you find this review useful."
"schmev117","7","15","31","12 June 2011"," A fantastically entertaining, old school movie
","I'm just going to say this upfront, Super 8 is now one of my favorite movies. It is one of the most thrilling , emotional, well-acted and just all around entertaining movies I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. It brings back that old school movie feel of wonder and innocence that made movies like E.T. , Stand By Me, and the Goonies , the classics that they are now and I think Super 8 is right in the same league. But Super 8 has another side to it as well, it's a monster movie. This aspect is obviously modeled after other Spielberg classics like Jurassic Park and Jaws and uses some of the same techniques to great effect.<br/><br/>As I said above, the acting is amazing. All the kids are absolutely fantastic they really act like real teenagers- the way they talk, the way they act and all their different quirks are all hilarious. It's so fun watching them all together. The adults are all great too particularly Kyle Chandler who plays the main character, Joe's, father. He perfectly displays his difficulty in the situation he is in and his lack of communication with his son.<br/><br/>Super 8 is actually a very emotional movie. Joe and his father have been through some tragic events and they are still trying to cope with their loss. There is some real depth in the emotional scenes and this makes you care more for the character and it makes the movie much more intense when the action starts heating up. That brings me to the next great aspect of the movie, the action.<br/><br/>There are some very intense scenes in Super 8. The movie has one of the most awesome scenes of destruction (the train crash) I have seen in a movie, and its in the first thirty minutes. After this is when the unseen monster starts causing havoc. What's great is that you hardly ever see the monster. It's just like Jaws, the less you see, the scarier things are. This makes it so that once you see the monster it is very satisfying.<br/><br/>There are flaws in the movie such as the drastic change in tones between the lighthearted events with the kids to the pretty dark and violent scenes with the monster, and the movie ends a little bit too soon, but this is all negligible because the movie is so entertaining, moving, and heartfelt.<br/><br/>http://evsmoviezone.wordpress.com/2011/06/12/review-super-8/"

Sure some of the effects are well made, but that doesn't make up for a lousy plot, with a endless row of lose ends and meaningless setups that doesn't get a follow-up. <br/><br/>I am not against movies that refer to or appreciate other movie makers or genres, but if this is the case here, the director has been caught up in he's own moment. Simply don't spend time on this movie unless you are a raging Steven Spielberg fan that doesn't mind that things doesn't make sense, as long as the movie creates that Hollywood moment that in this case, unfortunately doesn't come."

"Leofwine_draca","4","6","10","8 August 2016"," Plenty of potential here, until it turns into a cookie cutter CGI adventure
","SUPER 8 is a rather odd film. It's set in 1979 but feels very much like a modern action adventure film, and being a Hollywood blockbuster it's chock-full of CGI effects. Despite the copious use of slang from the era it's a film that feels like a masquerade, where characters play dress up but never really convince that they're from the era. This film was conceived by J. J. Abrams as a tribute to the Steven Spielberg movies he loved as a kid. In essence, this means that the film has a late '70s/1980s vibe going on, liberally borrowing from the likes of E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, THE GOONIES, and plenty more besides. It doesn't have an original bone in its body. Now, I'm a fan of those 1980s-era children's films too, so I was interested to see this, but I'm afraid to say it all falls apart.<br/><br/>There are good elements here and plenty of potential stemming from the characters. The characterisation is solid and the child actors acquit themselves well with the material. The stuff which has them shooting home zombie movies and the like is well portrayed. Unfortunately, once the over-riding science fiction plot line kicks in, all of the scene-building and characterisation is dropped in favour of making this a routine action-adventure vehicle with copious random action scenes and effects and not much else. The characters spend the rest of the movie reacting to CGI while preposterous effects scenes take place around them (the ridiculous train crash is one of the worst moments). There's an alien involved, which looks like your generic alien and nothing more, and an over-obvious climax supposed to evoke wonder but which instead falls flat due to familiarity. SUPER 8 ends up a soulless bore, when it could have been something special."

","There are movies that make you angry because you want them to be good, you want to like them - but that don't give you a chance. This is one of them. All in all, watching the movie was as inspiring as watching paint being dried with a flame-thrower. <br/><br/>By all means decent actors struggling with dialogue and character arcs that had all the sophistication of sliced bread are mere accessories to a film that announces a love of movies and storytelling but delivers a mish-mash of conflicts and story lines while blasting and bombing it's way out of every corner it finds itself in.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the flick is competent enough in all departments except one - and the one that matters most: story. It is a collection of loose ends and coincidences told through a series of placard-like scenes with dialogue to busy divulging information to allow any space for emotions. It doesn't involve and it does not go anywhere.<br/><br/>Seriously - I am disgruntled to have spent two hours of my life watching this. I want my time back. Sticking with the trailer only would have done nicely."

Super 8 starts very promising, introduces the characters and their relationship very well, and then starts going down a hill from the moment the famous train scene takes place; and this is what frustrates you even more than all those several clichés that Mr.Abrams cooks for you throughout the whole length of the movie. With such a descending trend, you could rightfully expect to see a lame predictable ending where the bad guys would die and the killer monsters would probably become the victims of society and get the freedom they are deserved! oh my oh! I don't remember any other movie like that before!<br/><br/>However, I should admit that one absolutely positive point of the movie is Elle Fanning's acting which blew my mind, and made me reconsider my initially very low rate for this movie. She plays the role of the Alice so hilariously that I completely forgot she was 13 (younger when she was casted for the film apparently) I'm so sure that during the next decade there'll be at least one real young superstar left in Hollywood whose films are worth watching just because of her act; same for her older sister, hopefully. Other casts are just OK. the boys manage to present their characters believable and funny enough that you could ignore all the scenario problems. Kyle Chandler which has always been my favorite actor, plays the role of Joe's father, and as I said earlier, like others, has managed to present this character very well. A recently widowed husband who has a bit of problems handling his wife's death. But unfortunately, as the movies goes forward/downward, Chandler's efforts to keep the strong act becomes pale and useless. The visual effects are not bad, but not outstanding either. In fact, at some point, you feel that you're being fed with just too much of it. There were moments that I absolutely had no idea why there were massive explosions, and heavy destruction. The only reason could be that they wanted to heat up their lame story through the use of stupid noisy distractions until the director would come up with his next spontaneous idea! could it be anything else? I doubt so! <br/><br/>Some say that the ending was so moving that it made them cry. Well, I'd say I could cry there with them too, but not because of my emotional state, but because of such a lame way the movie wound up, and that you still can find people out there giving 10 out of 10 for it. Not to be judgmental, but how do they spend their time watching movies at all?!"

","All I can do is add to what's already been said: anyone looking for a monster movie should look elsewhere. This Cloverfield isn't, a film that I enjoyed. This is a homage to Spielberg, in particular to his films of the 80s. If you are not a fan of this cinema, you better stay away. This combines films that I watched back in the day (The Goonies, E.T., etc.) but have not seen since given that I don't care at all about them, finding them sticky, formulaic and stereotyped. I never particularly enjoyed films about life seen through the eyes of a kid, which is what a lot of Spielberg's cinema in the 80s was: I'd rather watch his films when he finally decided to address the adult audiences, notwithstanding its many problems. This is not grand or fun cinema as Abrams obviously thinks it is. Once you fail to get hooked you start noticing the startling mistakes and gaps, including the absurd train collision, the monster which you wait all film to see, the inevitable love story, the melodramatic crap about the father and his girlfriend's father, and the annoying kids. At some time I just ff over scenes between the kid and the girl and scenes between the kids so I missed a big chunk of the second half of this tremendously long, insufferable film. After reading what I missed, I definitively did myself a favor."

","Think ET, Stand By Me (or Goonies) and Cloverfield in a bad mash-up. Kids' bikes galore, evil army men, misunderstood monster, saccharin dialog. I didn't expect this from Spielberg and Abrams. I think they phoned it in and let the PR Dept do all the heavy lifting. I knew I was in trouble when the train wreck went on and on and on after hitting a pickup truck. The only good parts were when the girl was rehearsing her part for the kid's movie; she was excellent. Oh, and I liked the attempt at not using all Hollywood brats, although the kid with braces looked like he had the bumper off a '65 Caddy in his mouth. It's a shame that Hollywood can't produce truly good movies anymore...regardless of budget. Skip this dreck."

","The story drug on and on. I felt like leaving because I was so bored. There was little to no action is in most of the film. Movie makes factual error stating that Brookville is in a different county. It's an over-glorified remake of Hangar 18. It's a real disappointment for a Spielberg movie. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was more exciting than Super 8. The special effects were also lacking. Aside from the train crash, there aren't a whole lot of special effects in this movie. I'm not sure what the critics saw in this movie to dub it a classic. There's nothing special about it. It doesn't stand out like ET or even Gremlins. In fact for a sci-fi movie it's very cliché."
"mmitsos-1","2","8","15","16 June 2011"," Disappointed! Less than mediocre - a waste of time.
","A terrible waste of Kyle Chandler's & Ron Eldard's talents; both playing fathers. The movie is one cliché after another. When we finally see the alien (too late), it's a disappointment. And the film doesn't explain why it kills some humans, & keeps others suspended (upside down, literally) for what purpose? (Other than sparing the life of 1 character - to add some suspense. Or to copy the film ""Alien"" - a vastly superior film, in another league.) I know it can feed off the feelings of humans (fear), as it also felt the empathy of one of the scientists (who tried to stop the train). The 'monster' is not compelling in any way & it's behaviors are minimally explained. I neither hated it, nor felt sympathy for it - except, ""Let it leave."" It's size & scale seemed to change throughout the movie as well.<br/><br/>Hate to say it, but the casting of the child actors was awful except for Elle Fanning (& she's no Dakota. Talented, but lacks the on-screen charisma of her sister). She did look like she could be Eldard's child. The other children are neither attractive nor even remotely charismatic, therefore very boring to watch. I'm sorry, as I realize it's subjective, but Joel Courtney as Joe Lamb (playing Kyle Chandler's character's kid) did absolutely nothing for me. (And why cast the blond kid w/ the extreme overbite? He was actually distracting. Next time, wait 'til the braces come off.) Except perhaps the heavy kid; the filmmaker/director kid was cute (as a budding Orson Welles). Everything in this movie was boring. The story was just TOO bland, & the ending was quite anti-climatic. Really, the stuff flying up & piling on the water tower? And for an interminable length of time? That's a good ending???<br/><br/>I grew up watching the '70s summer blockbusters & this falls way short of them in every department. And I wasn't a huge fan of those, but they were at least entertaining, with a compelling plot & some memorable characters, well portrayed by good actors who were also interesting to watch. (There were also other truly great movies made in the '70s that I saw & grew up with that I won't list now. It truly was a golden age of film-making for both Hollywood & foreign films.) The best part of this drivel was the Super-8 movie (the kids' movie) shown at the end alongside the credits. It at least had charm. I really regretted seeing this, as it left me with that bad a taste, & I wasted my time & money. The standard of 'entertainment' has really dropped."
"spencerthetracy","6","8","15","10 June 2011"," And a lot of stuff was happening all at once.
","The brightest part of this movie are the kids and their performances. Very likable and relatable. And it was fairly obvious that we were looking into an aspect of the past of producer Steven Spielberg. I didn't know the plot before I showed up at the theater this morning. I didn't mind that the action took awhile to get going. We were looking at some earnest kids trying to finish their movie while dealing with a little angst and a terrific loss for the lead. After the action gets going with the monster you could really see the hand and attributes of a Spielberg production. They were all thrown in here. Not all of it made sense. For instance, the monster seemed to be alone in his fury and wrath against humans but there were attacks all over town simultaneously and continuously. Pretty busy for a single monster. And it made the action pretty unreliable. One gets used to rolling ones eyes once in a while. Toward the end I couldn't keep my eyes still. <br/><br/>I give the movie 6 out of 10 stars because of the charming leads but only 6 due to its need for severe belief suspension."

Fearing punishment from their parents they flee the scene. Shortly after the accident things in town start getting weird.

It's OK if you have nothing else to do."
"ironhorse_iv","7","3","4","9 February 2013"," Wait a minute, is this movie directed by JJ Abrams or Steven Spielberg?
","Everything about this movie looks and feels like a Steven Spielberg movie rather than a JJ. Abrams. Unlike others movies that Spielberg produces, this one honestly feels like he directed it with most of the movie seem to be influences by a lot of Spielberg earlier works with scenes similar to Jurassic Park, Goonies, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, Jaws, E.T and War of the Worlds to name a few. It's called money and camera shot familiarity. Film directors patent movie grain, angles, and camera recording quality. So you instantly recognize Steven Spielberg DNA on film. Not only that, the movie has the same story clichés as Spielberg earlier works. Noticing these terms, Keeping the Family Together; The Search for the Lost Child; Science vs. Authority; Kids on Their Own. You find it in every early Spielberg film and in here. I wanted to see JJ Abrams spin into it, like 'Lost', but this film was so Spielbergism. Looking past that, the story starts off in 1979. Deputy Jack Lamb (Kyle Chandler) and his son Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) are just getting over the death of a love one. Joel Courtney reminds me of a very young Sean Astin from Goonies. Joe's friends decides to produce and make a low-budget zombie movie using a Super 8 camera to enter into an international film competition. Joe's friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) also enlists the help of 14-year-old Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) who is the daughter of the man that Joe's father has a beef with. So in a way, there is a bit of a Romeo and Juliet's house work here as Jack Lamb believes Alice's father had something to do with his wife's death. Elle Fanning who looks way older than her older sister Dakota was pretty good, playing the disturb daughter. Charles decides to film a scene at the local train depot using a passing train to add authenticity to his film. While shooting, Joe witnesses a pickup truck drive onto the tracks and ram the train head-on, causing a massive train derailment as the friends barely escape the resulting chaos and explosions. A alien is sent free and the government comes to find it led by Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich), arrive to secure the area and the town. I'm kinda a huge fan of Noel Emmerich after seeing him in Thurman Show, but Colonel Nelec wasn't that impressing. Plus those Air Force uniform were ugly, it's remind me more of the Green Berets than the air force. Nelec discovers an empty box of Super 8 MM film, and assumes the event was captured on camera. Soon, people around town start to disappear, and Alice is one of the them. It's a race against time for the kids, as they try to save Alice from the alien. Most people thought of the movie as prequel of Cloverfield. JJ Abrams said no, but the alien did look like the one in that film. Let me state this out, if you honestly thinking this is going to be 'alien/monster' movie then you will be disappointed. You don't see the monster until near the end of the movie. This was very well written. It's not about the alien, but deals more with coping of a lose of somebody, the tense moments of father/child, and childhood innocents. It's mostly about Joe Lamb dealing with the death of his mother, while falling in love with the daughter of the man who cause his mother's death. I like the movie, all the kid's actors were great in it. The kid that's play Cary in the film, looks and reminds me of that kid from the Bad News Bears. It's really good how they tie in all this, with the sci-fiction. Some scenes were really slow, and the pacing should have really pick up. The ending to the movie was flat in my opinion. Other than that, it was good. Check out, during the credits, the completed Super 8 zombie film, titled The Case, by Charles and his friends is shown. The Case is just awfully funny on how badly it's made. Abrams' original plan was to film all of the sequences for the film-within-a-film, ""The Case"", using Super-8 cameras. However, this approach proved unsuccessful, as visual effects house ILM found it impossible to integrate CGI into the footage due to the format's graininess. For sequences involving CGI, cinematographer used Super 16 instead. In a way, the title should have been known as Super 8 & 16. Just don't think it's a alien movie, but more a coming to age movie"
"commanderrobby","5","3","4","2 November 2012"," An enjoyable, mediocre movie
","This is a difficult movie to grade because I really enjoyed watching it. But the last 5 or 10 minutes of the story just didn't really seem like it was that well thought out. It was like they got to that point and then said ""OK, let's hurry this thing up and get done with it.""<br/><br/>First off, the whole bit about the teacher being involved with the alien's capture and hearing him talk about how that the alien was just wanting to go home develops pathos for the alien, how could it do anything else? So when it gets to the point where the kid starts talking to it, of course you know that he isn't going to get hurt. So it fails at delivering a fearful suspense, which is what appears to be expected. But seriously, you can't expect someone to feel for a character and also be terrified of it at the same time. To draw a comparison, it's like the bunny in Monty Python's Holy Grail. You either think ""Oh, look at the cute little bunny!"" or you think ""OMG! It's going to kill us all!"" But you can't think both of those things at the same time. It just isn't possible.<br/><br/>Secondly, it fails to explain very much about what's actually going on. Why was the alien roaming around stealing random stuff? Why did the water tower suddenly turn into some kind of giant magnet? If that's all the alien needed in order to get home, why didn't it happen sooner? How did the kids get out of the tunnel when they were lost and at a dead end just two seconds ago? etc etc<br/><br/>I read a review comparing it to ET. I think that it's true that there are some similarities, but ET is definitely better. ET was imaginative and heart warming. This was a pretty mediocre sci-fi adventure. One other huge difference is that ET couldn't have done anything without Elliott and there's a real bond that is formed that you care about. Here, however, Joe and the alien have no connection at all. There are basically two stories going on simultaneously: Joe is trying to win Alice and help his friends make a zombie movie. The alien is trying to escape the military and return home. The alien doesn't really affect Joe's story and Joe doesn't really help the alien's. You could literally take one or the other out and you would still be left with a half decent story. But you definitely could not take ET or Elliott out and have any kind of story left. They are too interconnected, while Joe and the alien are completely disconnected.<br/><br/>So that's why I rate this a 5, not that I dislike the movie, but I just don't like the movie. It's just dead center mediocre."
"MLDinTN","5","3","4","21 May 2012"," Other reviews have said it all.....
","this is basically Goonies meets ET. The film centers around several young teens whom are making a zombie movie and witness a train wreck and accidentally capture some amazing video footage. The military comes in to clean up the train wreck and soon overtakes the town. Also weird things start to happen in the town, like all the dogs run away and microwaves and car engines go missing.<br/><br/>The kids know the man whom caused the wreck because he was one of their teachers (BTW how did the teacher survive that, it wouldn't be possible). They find these old videos he had stashed that tell the whole story and what they are up against. So, it's up to them to save one of their own.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't get is when the kids are running through the neighborhood, what are all those tanks shooting at. Too much was going on in those scenes.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: OK, but not really good enough to recommend."

","Being a fan of Steven Spielberg's 70's films like Jaws and Close Encounters makes me a pretty hard to please fan of the blockbuster. So when JJ Abrams comes along with his clever marketing schemes and pitches a new film that looks and sounds like one of Stevens early ones, my defences are cautiously lowered. Unwise of me. I found Super 8 to be forced and tiresome. Those of us who rode the crazy wave of the first blockbusters in the late 70's and early 80's know exactly how they felt and don't need some jumped up Spielberg wannabe regurgitating them up. That's exactly what JJ tries, but somehow it comes off as being the same, but not as good. Just like McG did with Terminator Salavation. Film makers inspired by other great film makers trying their hardest to replicate the work. It's kind of the ultimate tribute, but it's also just a little bit boring for those of us wanting to feel like were being taken on an adventure, not being reminded constantly of better films."

I still have no clue at times it was kids stuff and at times there was blood and horror. I found the story slow and at times pointless especially the whole sub plot about the hero's mom - seriously what was the point in this it added nothing to the movie at all. If you want a monster horror watch Cloverfield if you want kids adventure with mild peril then the Goonies ... no idea which audience this was pitched at.

","This had to have been my first midnight showing in 2 years. For one, nobody in Maine keeps anything open past 10PM even on the weekends (they fear wolves, I think), but mostly there just isn't a crowd. We drove 40 miles to the incredible Magic Lantern Theater and shared an intimate screening with 4 other folks, including 2 theater employees. Everyone else completely missed out – there was energy in the room from the tiny crowd that matched the feeling when I first saw the trailer. ""Here it is,"" I thought, ""finally a movie that is done like a classic sci-fi thriller. If anybody can do this, J. J. Abrams and his attention to detail will pull it off.""<br/><br/>Super 8 opens strong with an event that sets up our hero, Joe Lamb's, chain of events. There are a lot of things that the trailers have been misleading on and intentional about keeping quiet, so I won't spoil those moments. The first shot is one of those – defining moment with a lot of ambiguity that clears as the movie progresses. After we introduce the stellar cast of kids, it doesn't take long for the massive train wreck (literally, not in the story sense like most films) that sets the weird rolling.<br/><br/>I started sweating a little bit during that scene – not because it was so tense, but so over the top that Michael Bay would have blushed. I swear that train crashed for 10 minutes. Train cars and debris flew everywhere mostly because the Air Force conveniently peppered their precious cargo train with gasoline tanker cars. Despite that, Abrams quickly redeemed himself with a riveting adventure story told through the simple eyes of children.<br/><br/>Casting couldn't have been more perfect. Joel Courtney, with his single impressive IMDb credit, plays a perfect hero just trying to have a childhood and save the girl. His energy and intensity was easily matched by the impressive Elle Fanning. In a sea of raunchy films and slapped-together productions, it was a huge breath of fresh air to simply enjoy good acting and a well-structured story. Was it the most innovated film? Not by a long shot, but what it attempted, it did very very well.<br/><br/>A grand-scale adventure capped off with realistic-looking action and a great cast of appropriately aged kids (*cough*I Am Number Four*cough*) made for an incredibly enjoyable film. Stop showing the monster, and take a queue from the old-school movies, Hollywood."

","Super 8 appears to be J.J. Abrams' way of paying his respects to Steven Spielberg. I was steadily reminded of E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind throughout this film. The community kids are the first to discover the strange things happening around town, are almost always the only witnesses to important events, and repeatedly run into the adults who just don't understand.<br/><br/>An article in this week's New York Times magazine describes how a young J.J. Abrams got a job repairing and editing Steven Spielberg's old Super 8 films. That is a great memory to start your new screenplay with. Five pre-teen kids in an out of the way, small Ohio town are making a zombie movie on a Super 8. The boss kid is the director and persistently updating screenwriter. There is also the nervous lead actor, the kid obsessed with explosives who plays the zombie, and our film's main character, the make-up artist who is also adept at model trains and airplanes. While sneaking out at night to work on their movie with a newly recruited girl in their mix, the kids witness a train derailment and so begins the mystery.<br/><br/>I will reveal nothing about the train, what was on it, and what happens after that. Would you have wanted the answer to everything about E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind before seeing them? No way. Just know that this is not a movie just for the kids. There are genuinely suspenseful moments, a lot of pre-teen cursing, drug use, some quality horror gore, and an overall tight story. It is very refreshing to see a summer movie which is not a franchise continuing sequel or about a new superhero. These kids are real and there small town adventure mystery is well worth it."
"a_chinn","8","4","6","8 April 2018"," Before ""Stranger Things,"" J.J. Abrams did his own 80s/Spielberg love letter
","Before ""Stranger Things"" was ever a thing, J.J. Abrams did his own love letter to early Steven Spielberg, a nostalgic and spot-on homage to films such as ""E.T.,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" or ""Poltergeist."" Sure Tobe Hooper directed the last one, but Spielberg produced and left his mark all over it and the horror elements of that film are embraced in ""Super 8"". Spielberg also produced ""Super 8"" and it contains many early Spieberg-ian hallmarks; childhood innocence, broken families, government conspiracies, the sense of wonder and faith, parent-child relationships, etc. Set in the summer of 1979, a group of middle school boys and one girl are filming their super 8 zombie movie when they unexpectedly film a train crash transporting a secret cargo. To reveal more would spoil the plot, but the plot isn't what make ""Super 8"" memorable. Just like the best Spielberg films, it's the characters and their relationships that have endeared those film to us and made them classics. ""Poltergeist"" is a perfect example of this. The plot is a fairly straightforward haunted house story that is basically a riff on ""The Twilight Zone"" episode ""Little Girl Lost,"" but the believability of the characters and the realistic portrait of a typical suburban family connect the audience so much more to the plot (and the scares) than would a similar haunted house story with lesser defined of characters. Even strong haunted house films like ""The Entity"" or ""House by the Cemetery"" are nowhere as immediately identifiable to audiences as the family depicted in ""Poltergeist,"" which has the impact of making the scares all the more scary. ""Super 8"" manages to capture that same type of middle America feel, but does so steeped in nostalgia, in very much the same way the Duffer Brothers have done with ""Stranger Things."" Now despite the well drawn characters and the warm nostalgia the film generates, the story about the mysterious cargo on the train and the kids investigation is nowhere as interesting or compelling as Spielberg's best films. ""Super 8"" is probably on the same level as ""Explorers"" when it comes to story, which isn't bad, but the plot is just not up to ET or Close Encounters levels of greatness. Back to the film's strengths, it boasts a strong cast of unknown child actors, with the exception of Elle Fanning who I think at the time was more famous because of her sister, Dakota. The always reliable Kyle Chandler is also a standout as a deputy sheriff looking into the train crash against his superior's wishes and who's also the father of the main boy of the group, both who are grieving the recent loss of the boy's mother. Also of note is a fine score by composer Michael Giacchino, which manages to be nicely evocative of the John Williams/Jerry Goldsmith type of scores that frequently accompanied Spielberg films of this era. Overall, J.J. Abrams does a terrific job of capturing the innocence and wonder of early Steven Spielberg, which is a real treat for anyone who grew up watching these film."

And this film is loaded with this and much more: Small town apparently isolated from the rest of the world; no telephone, radio or road communication with any outside help for the sole functioning police officer; Ford F150 pickup that runs head-on into and totally destroys a military cargo train, yet remains intact enough for the driver to survive; A 1-story tall creature that runs around at night destroying everything while the townspeople sleep a slumber so deep that no one even has a clue or a glimpse (no, there's no cloaking going on. I could have bought into that); Kills & eats everyone but the protagonists, digs massive and extensive tunnels and hides all the dirt.... where? Awe come on people, let's be honest: The main movie has a bigger budget than the short flick at the end, but not much better otherwise. At least the latter has some elements of comedy."
"intern-88","5","4","6","20 June 2012"," Clichéd encounters of the Spielberg kind
","The old cliché that every story has already been told seems as pertinent as ever in Hollywood. A quick glance at the forthcoming releases reveals a bevy of rehashes, from Sherlock Holmes 2 to the upcoming Footloose remake. But Super 8 is different. It doesn't simply try to rehash; no, it attempts to reinvent the Spielberg formula for a new generation. Yet despite incorporating all the elements which made Spielberg's early movies so great, Super 8's endless references to these classics of family cinema only underlines its inability to measure up.<br/><br/>Written and directed by JJ Abrams, Super 8 tells the story of 13-year- old Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) who, while helping his best friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) make a zombie flick on Super 8 millimeter film, witnesses a train crash which both releases a mysterious monster from one of the carriages and launches Joe into a classically Spielbergian adventure. Over its 112 minutes Joe strives to woo the girl of his dreams (Elle Fanning), discover the secret of the train's cargo and, when he has the time, help finish Charles's movie.<br/><br/>In the past few years the name Steven Spielberg seems only ever to appear after the words 'Executive Producer', as if nowadays he's little more than a rubber stamp. However, in a film paying such obvious homage to Spielberg, his presence on the production staff is more than token. Spielberg's involvement serves as a validation of Super 8's blatant plagiarism. Because plagiarism is what it is. Everything, from the smalltown US setting to the BMXs Joe and his friends race around on, harks back to Spielberg's action-adventure opuses Close Encounters of the Third Kind and ET the Extra-Terrestrial.<br/><br/>Spielberg's stamp of approval also gives Abrams the space to employ this mode of film-within-a-film storytelling, denoted by the title, in a way that is unabashedly self-aware. There is absolutely nothing here which we haven't seen before, and Abrams knows it. Even Joe's tousled, mousey- brown mop makes him a dead ringer for Elliott, ET's 10-year-old protagonist. Yet it is these knowing nods to Abram's influences which allow the viewer to see past Super 8's lack of originality and enjoy it for what it is: a vehicle to relive those bygone moments of movie magic.<br/><br/>The boys' persistence in making their film, despite the deaths and disappearances all around them, draws a smile even after the most fearsome set pieces. Only 24 hours after they narrowly escaped death at the train station, Charles and his crew rush, monster make-up in hand, back to the crash sight, hoping that the backdrop will give the film the 'production values' Charles is seeking.<br/><br/>Moments like this indicate that this is a film not to be taken too seriously. Yet tongue-in-cheek nostalgia is not enough to sustain the entire movie, as becomes painfully clear halfway through. Then, with more and more townsfolk having disappeared, the zombie film is postponed and, with it, the loving homage ceases. From there on in, the plot descends into one all-too-familiar setpiece after another. And the moment Super 8 begins to take its own story seriously, it becomes the very thing it was trying to escape: being merely derivative.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that while the setpieces are big and visually stunning, the pastiche which opens the film creates a barrier between the viewer and the action. The sense that it is all one big in-joke, full of film- buff allusions and references, makes it hard to really care about the fate of Joe and his friends. So although Super 8 is well acted and has decent dialogue, you find it hard to believe in either young Joel Courtney or Elle Fanning when, at the back of your mind, you know that they are not so much characters as ironic nods to a filmmaking past.<br/><br/>The regurgitative approach to filmmaking Hollywood that has employed for the past few decades has left a creative vacuum. Whereas the likes of Close Encounters and ET made mainstream film an artistic medium, they seemed to prepare the way for a long chain of bad remakes. These attempts at giving the audience more of what they want has only left us pining for those old movies all the more. Super 8 may be a trip down memory lane, but it still struggles with this vicious cycle: it delights because of what it reminds us of, but fails to tell its own story."

"Coneydogg","Null","18","41","6 June 2011"," Hype Over Substance... Dull and Predictable
","My major problem with Super 8 is not with the unremarkable cast or with the cheesy attempts at tension. It's not that it's ""slow"" or poorly paced for a summer film. If I had to sum it up with a word, I'd say coldness, maybe carelessness. How about dreary? How can anyone enjoy bad dialogue and poor pacing if they don't care for the characters? The execution was palatable but you simply didn't care about anyone or anything that was going on. This is slasher film quality without the slashing. It's just a poor story and a poor effort by all involved.<br/><br/>Without a doubt this film going to be the quintessential ""hype over substance"" film we all reference for years to come. The mystique, marketing and mystery leading up to release was bigger than what we actually see on screen. This overrated film has done nothing but hide behind big names to draw a big opening weekend at the box office. It wanted to be another ""Signs"" type drama but all it delivers is disappointment.<br/><br/>Forget ""Signs"" this movie was like combining M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening"" and Spielberg's ""War of The Worlds."" Not exactly a winning combination despite the hype. I'll give the creator's of this film a pass because they usually deliver but the sooner we all forget about this mess and J.J. moves on to the Star Trek sequel the better."

","Many people will no doubt label Super 8 as a 'great summer film' and 'lots of fun'. I, on the other hand, will label it as 'crap'. It is just another brainless Hollywood production created off a sub-par script that is marketed behind some big names in Abrams and Spielberg.<br/><br/>I knew it was heading in a bad direction after watching the way-over-the-top train crash scene. Ugh. If you are someone who doesn't care about movies at least making an attempt at realism, this won't bother you. If you are one whom likes an attempt at realism this whole movie will bother you.<br/><br/>Their are MANY themes and sub-plots to this movie, but none of these parallel movie lines are developed enough for the viewer to actually care. The acting is good which makes at least some of the relationships work well, but not enough to overcome the 'lameness' of it all.<br/><br/>There is an attempt at some suspense and mystery by not revealing 'the mystery' for a while...and this attempt falls flat on its face. No pay-off whatsoever. None.<br/><br/>And then of course there is the ending of the movie. The entire time I was watching the last scene I wanted to continually punch myself in the face for actually paying to see this crap. The symbolic scene and gesture at the end was so incredibly lame that I have to completely revoke my JJ Abrams fan card. Which is a shame.<br/><br/>I would have much rather watched the movie the kids were making in Super 8, then Super 8 itself. That pretty much sums it up."

","To put it bluntly, you expect more from a movie when it's being advertised as a major product of JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg. <br/><br/>There were some good one liners in the movie, and I enjoyed the kids, but overall the whole thing was lackluster and I'm still trying to figure out what the climax was supposed to be. Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning along with the other kids in the film were cast well, but their story line alone could have been developed into its own entity (minus the alien). <br/><br/>Visually it was pretty good to watch. The train crash was great and I liked the tones used in the film but, beyond that, the most enjoyable part was the sequence played during the credits. If you stay for the whole thing, make sure you tough it out and catch that part."
"kgprophet","5","11","23","12 June 2011"," An unbalanced mix of Scary/Silly & Deep/Shallow
","There are some great moments near the beginning of this dense script where you feel that Spielberg Magic. Like Drew Barrymore in ""E.T."", Elle Fanning stands out as a young talent. When there is subtly in the storytelling of the coming-of-age dimension of this film, you feel grounded in a solid drama. Natural based humour around goofy teenagers works to start with. But then a way too convoluted conspiracy develops with no chance of making sense. Here is where the large wish list of ideas that Spielberg and Abrams dreamed up begin to dismantle the momentum that we the audience had invested in for the first 45 minutes or so. Gone now is the magic as a poorly written B-movie monster horror flick invades the town.<br/><br/>""Strange"" things begin to happen all over town with such over-the-top silliness and randomness that the storytellers make their fatal flaw. You throw so many ""mysterious"" incidents at the audience with such succession that we no longer can keep track of what the clues are supposed to mean and begin to no longer care. Thankfully the mostly solid acting is able to drag you through the nonsensical military invasion going on in the town. We have the troubled father of Fanning's character Alice. At one point he has a deep emotional impact upon the backstory, but then is clumsily written into being involved with defeating the bad guys.<br/><br/>There is a Jekyll/Hyde dichotomy to this movie. At one point you feel it could be a better take on an M. Night Shyamalan film take can convincingly bring terror into the domestic environment (like ""Sixth Sense""). Other times, it feels like a too silly to be taken seriously ""Goonies"" type of adventure. Which brings us to the monster that is supposed to be the big scary killer lurking behind the scenes. (Not a spoiler here) It turns out the monster is too fake to be believable. There is ""Jurassic Park"" inspired monster attack that makes up the final act that just does not have the same impact. Abrams' ""Cloverfield"" was much better at creating a chilling dark creature that could make you jump. In that film there is a smaller insect-like alien that lurks in a subway that is genuinely terrifying. Nothing in ""Super 8"" comes close to that level of chills. Which leaves only the thrills, and the train wreck that is a centerpiece of the film does a good job of it. The extended train disaster launches large train cars into the air at frightening speeds with monster sound effects as they crash and explode with summer popcorn movie splendor (especially in Imax).<br/><br/>This movie gets a mild thumbs up for all the positive intentions of Abrams' script. He is a disciple of Spielberg, and it is good to see that other filmmakers can recreate the old school magic, as he does here literally by creating 1970's homages to Spielberg movies. This includes overlapping dialogue of hyper teenagers, sweeping crane shots of bicycles through middle class neighbourhoods, a John Williams style score, Vilmos Zsigmond style lensing, and attention to little details in the kids environment. All of this works well, and I applaud Abrams for displaying his knowledge of the Spielbergisms. Unfortunately that also includes the gimmicks that Spielberg adores so much. In the third act, all the characters become chess pieces as they race around to witness and discover some very implausible stuff that helps reveal the big conspiracy. By then however, there are large military trucks taking over the town, and eventually the lamest looking battle scenes that all but remove any subtlety that began so quietly at the beginning. Despite this, we are hauled through a great deal of relationship melodrama that feels like remnants of one of Abrams TV dramas. The second act gets especially bogged down in emotional situations that at that point do little but destroy the momentum of the impending danger of the sometimes forgotten monster on the loose.<br/><br/>I give it a slightly favourable 6 out of 10 since there was nothing bad enough in the clunky storytelling that turned it into a Tony Scott-like embarrassment."
"Buddy-51","Null","7","13","18 July 2011"," tries to recapture an era but just feels derivative
","J.J. Abrams' ""Super 8"" hearkens back to the days of early Steven Spielberg (who co-produced the film) - a time when summer blockbusters could appeal as much to the heart as to the eye, when a group of intrepid suburban kids could unravel mysteries and take on evil forces, when the military-industrial complex was clearly up to no good, and when tear-stained characters could look in wide-eyed, tight-shot amazement at wonders unraveling above them in the heavens.<br/><br/>Set, appropriately, in 1979 - in a time before digital cameras and CGI technology, when children had to express their creativity and imagination with what was then the technological equivalent of chewing gum and baling wire - ""Super 8"" centers on a group of nerdish preteens who are attempting to make their own amateur zombie-splatter film for an upcoming contest. While filming one night, the kids are witness to a horrifying freight train crash, the repercussions of which go far beyond just the mass of mangled, twisted metal strewn across the area. For it seems the Air Force has taken a more than casual interest in the event, and soon strange and inexplicable occurrences begin happening in town.<br/><br/>The focal point of the story is Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), a young boy whose mother has just been killed in a tragic factory accident, and whose grieving father (Kyle Chandler from TV's incomparable ""Friday Night Lights"") serves as the town's deputy. Joe also has a crush on the pretty and alluring Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning), who has been brought into the boys' film project at the last moment.<br/><br/>The similarities between ""Super 8"" and any number of Spielberg - or at least Spielbergian - films (most notably, of course, ""E.T."") are both so numerous and so obvious that they really don't bear repeating here. Yet, while I admire much of what Abrams is trying to do in this movie, so much of it falls flat that I really can't recommend it in the final analysis. What's actually missing is that special Spielberg touch, that almost Quixotic visionary conviction that could turn even a simple work like ""E.T."" into a timeless classic. One never questions Spielberg's belief in his material, but I'm not sure one can quite make the same claim about Abrams, at least not in this particular instance. Abrams' story lacks the streamlined clarity of an ""E.T."" and, by extension, the emotional resonance that comes along with it. ""Super 8"" seems to be going off in so many different directions at once that it winds up going nowhere. And, frankly, the sci-fi aspects of the story feel awfully stale at this late stage in the game. <br/><br/>In addition to ""E.T.,"" there are bits and pieces of ""The Goonies,"" ""Stand By Me,"" ""Gremlins,"" and ""War of the Worlds"" in the film as well. And that, in the final analysis, is what's most wrong with ""Super 8."" It's made up of so many borrowed parts that, in the end, it's left with nothing it can truly call its own."
"howard.schumann","2","7","13","15 July 2011"," It is so derivative that Spielberg fans should sue for grand theft
","The best thing that can be said about J.J. Abrams Super 8 is that it reminds us of the memorable science fiction films of the 80s that touched our lives. There is nothing in Super 8, however, that even touches those seminal movies. In the immortal words of Yogi Berra, it is ""déjà vu all over again"" but without the same touching and tender story, wit and charm, feeling of magic, beautiful score, or memorable performances. It is obvious right from start that enhanced CGI effects, loud explosions, frightening monsters, fake emotions, and dysfunctional families do not take the place of heart and soul, but, of course, we know that in today's Hollywood schlock factory, heart and soul do not bring in the big bucks.<br/><br/>Set in suburbia (where else?) in 1979 (Lillian, Ohio to be exact), young teen Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) lives with his father (Kyle Chandler), a deputy police officer. Both are trying to overcome the effects of the death of Joe's mother in a recent accident. During the lazy summer, Joe and his friends Charles (Riley Griffiths) Martin (Gabriel Basso), Cary (Ryan Lee), and Preston (Zach Mills) are attempting shoot a short zombie film with Charles' Super 8 camera. The biggest reason Joe agrees to do it, however, is because of his attraction to 14-year-old Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) who is playing the wife of the film's hero. Though Courtney and Fanning do a more than creditable job, the other teens are mostly one-dimensional stock characters without any authentic interactions. They are terrific at screaming and yelling, however, and saying ""Oh! My God"" with a shocked look plastered on their faces.<br/><br/>The film begins to get its focus when a freight train passing through the area where they are filming is derailed by a pick-up truck driving on the same track. The ensuing train crash is the best since ""The Fugitive"" but it is so overblown that it looks like the train was hit by a nuclear missile, rather than a pick-up truck. This is only the start of the mayhem. People and animals disappear including the Lamb's pet dog Lucy, appliances and machine parts are stolen, and a variety of other mysteries abound. Of course, the townsfolk demand answers from the police, but the military that arrives to cordon off the area reveal nothing. Of course, if we trust the military to solve anything, we are on shaky ground to begin with.<br/><br/>Speculation is ripe, however, and one of the brightest members of the community is convinced that the Russkies are behind everything. Abrams cleverly withholds what the fuss is all about until three-quarters of the film is over. By that time, most viewers have either had a coronary from the unbearable suspense, their children are running up and down the aisles, unhinged by terror, and the rest of the audience have either gone deaf from the explosions, fallen asleep, or left the theater.<br/><br/>Abrams can't make up his mind if he wants the culprit to be cute and cuddly (though with a very big face) or a demolition expert because his feelings were hurt. The ultimate explanation is so ridiculous that if I gave it away, it would cause hysterical laughter. In any case, we know that the kids will turn out to be super brave, super lucky, or the rest of the bunch, super stupid. If you are gutsy enough to make it to the ending, you will think you are in a time warp watching an early Spielberg film. It is so derivative that Spielberg fans should sue for grand theft. Oh, wait - Spielberg is listed as the producer. He ought to sue himself for crimes against humanity."
"tlopesio","3","9","18","21 June 2011"," Most Unoriginal Movie EVER!
","Wow, what a waste of time. People have been saying that this movie is JJ Abrams ""first"" movie, meaning that his other two films (MI3 and Star Trek) were franchises so he was emboldened to already established characters and tone. Well, Super 8 makes his other two movies seem like the most original things he's ever done.<br/><br/>This film is nothing more than a mash-up of the most popular Spielberg/Amblin films including ET, Close Encounters, Goonies, and Poltergeist. It's as if JJ called Steven and said ""Hey, do you mind if I make one movie that summarizes all your other films?"" Spielbergs response: ""Well, since I now put my name on Michael Bay movies, why the hell not?"" I could get past all the unoriginal storytelling, direction, cinematography, writing, plot, etc. if the movie actually did a good job of eliciting emotion, scares, and wonderment but Super 8 falls way short. Abrams tries in every way to emulate Spielberg (right down to the way overused CGI lens flares) but actually ends up showing how inferior he is as a story teller. Spielberg's gift to the world was his innate ability to make the fantastical believable (A kid really befriended ET, Jaws really jumped on to the Orca, aliens really landed at Devil's Tower). However, in Super 8, nothing feels real or believable including plot points, logistics, and character.<br/><br/>Some examples: how can a small pickup truck derail a high speed freight train? How can the driver of that truck still remain alive? Why would 8MM raw footage of an alien be edited together with a well recorded voice over? Why, when the train first approaches, does the kid yell ""production value"" but he never repositions the actors to show the train in the background? Why are the aliens cubes in trucks near the water tower when the Air Force knows the alien needs them for his space ship? When they have the big town meeting, where is the press and national news? When the kids are running through town, why is the Air Force blowing up everything in sight? And when the Air Force speeds to the train wreck they see a car drive away, but instead of chasing the car they just decide to check the tire tracks and match them (which never pans out).<br/><br/>I was excited for this movie more than any other this summer. I was hoping for JJ to have an original, exciting spin on movies I loved as a kid. But unfortunately, it was nothing more than a haphazard cut and paste job that should be an embarrassment to all involved."

"LloydBayer","7","9","18","19 June 2011"," They don't make 'em like this anymore...
","Simultaneously premiering in the UAE on 16 Jun, I had a choice to make""Green Lantern"" or ""Super 8"". If you are reading this, then my choice was quite obvious. Although the marketing hype for ""Green Lantern"" was good, I settled for this movie simply due to the J. J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg collaboration. While both have been known to possess a flair for Sci-fi adventures, my curiosity was out of bounds when anticipating what this partnership could produce.<br/><br/>Set during the summer break of 1979, teenagers Joe, Charles, Cary, Preston, Martin and Alice go about producing a low budget zombie movie using Charles' hand held Super 8 motion camera. Just before wrapping up, they witness a horrific train crash, caused by derailment by head-on collision with a pick-up truck. Having barely survived the crash, the children's biology teacher, instructs them never to recount what they just saw; for their own safety and the safety of their parents. Soon enough, the crash site is cordoned off by the US Air Force, plunging the small town into mystery and peril with unexplained disappearances of household metals and even some town folk.<br/><br/>Written, produced and directed by J. J. Abrams with Spielberg signing on as co-producer, this film is more than just a tribute to sci-fi mysteries of the 1980s. True, there will always be negative criticism, as the film's plot will be compared to ""E.T The Extraterrestrial"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Cloverfield"". But with ""Super 8"" produced by Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, there is absolutely no question of plagiarism on Abrams part. How can there be one, when the studio executive is none other than Spielberg himself? Unwarranted negative criticism aside, this film is well made, from casting and acting to special effects and production values. Although Abrams has interjected humour at the right moments, his general feel of the plot centres on the tragedy of loosing a loved one. For good measure, he also throws in moral messages associated with the sense of belonging and acceptance. Again, this juncture will be compared to Spielberg's ET trying to fit in amongst humans. As the narrative revolves around the lives of teenage children, casting is near perfect with captivating portrayals from Joe Lamb and Elle Fanning as Joe and Alice. This could well be Elle's claim to fame, rather than living of her sister's (Dakota) repute as a child star. Some unexpected yet amusing moments are well rendered by Riley Griffiths, Ryan Lee and Zach Mills. With limited screen time, but worthy of screen presence, Kyle Chandler as Joe's grieving father and the town sheriff, and Ron Eldard as Alice's alcoholic father standout among the adult cast.<br/><br/>As a child of the 1980s, I can relate to this film with boyish nostalgia. Thankfully, I didn't have to deal with aliens or monsters in the flesh. However, Abrams does an excellent job in capturing the mindset of a teenager. From that perspective, there is adventure, fantasy, puppy love, heart break and even terror. Filming is clearly digital and takes you back to an era when low lit scenes were peppered with heavy grain, also called 'noise' by photographers. Back then, cinematographers had to use special films for low lit scenes. The unavoidable disadvantage was the noise level. Here, this works to Abrams' advantage and is obviously intentional in creating the look and feel of a bygone era in film making. Another aspect Abrams gets right was resisting the temptation to bring this out in 3D. While there are moments during the film that could have the audience bobbing and weaving, the intended atmosphere would have been lost to a plastic gimmick. Where Abrams excels as the film's director, is in placing special effects in the background. He gives a lot of focus to character development while heightening the mystery of 'something dangerous lurking in the background'. As such, we never get a full glimpse of what terrorizes the small town of Lillian (Ohio). When we do get to see it, the film is in the final act. This here is my only gripe, especially when there is evidently so much work put into drawing in the audience. Maybe it is just me, but if the film spans 112 minutes, where is the harm in adding another 15 minutes to avoid the risk of an abrupt ending? Although ""King Kong"" (2005) has a tragic ending, the final act is simply spectacular. Having said that, if you are the type of person to go for first impressions, rather than last impressions, then ""Super 8"" is an otherwise great piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>With a PG-13 rating (PG-15 in the UAE), this is a film for the entire family. So load up the SUV and get to the nearest cinema. Leave the dog at home."
"jimmy2","7","9","18","8 June 2011"," A film with an identity crisis
","I saw this film at a screening tonight, and I must say it's the most disjointed film I've seen so far this year.<br/><br/>First off, I have no complaints about the actors. In fact, the actors kind of reminded me of what Goonies could possibly look like in the 21st century. Okay, the actors are fine. So far, so good.<br/><br/>The movie goes off the rails midway through it; precisely when the alien storyline comes to the fore. While this particular storyline isn't that bad initially, it wears out its welcome in a hurry, especially when it all comes together. I don't think I'm spoiling much by saying that there isn't much to it.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, I think that Abrams' love of Spielberg's previous films has prevented him from actually making this his own film. It could also be because Spielberg produced the film, meaning it would require his stamp of approval in order for the movie to be released. A shame really, because if Abrams did it his way, he would have made a better movie than 'Cloverfield'.<br/><br/>Don't expect to have the same wonderment that you get from Spielberg films, however. You can tell those moments were merely tacked-on to fit the 'Spielberg' mould. Anyone who's seen the early 80's Spielberg movies knows what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>So, with all that being said, what are we left with? The closest analogy would be a chocolate bar with layered and soft caramel on the outside, but a rough, hard to chew toffee middle. As good as the caramel is, the toffee sure makes it hard to swallow.<br/><br/>Wait for it on Netflix or your local video store. You'll thank me later."
"cadillac20","8","12","26","9 June 2011"," A Touching, Exciting Summer Blockbuster
","If there is any wonder about what Abrams is capable of in terms of being a filmmaker, Super 8 should sufficiently debunk this. While he is certainly a great producer, this is Abrams first original picture. But never fear, he succeeds again with a fine picture that will warm your heart and excite you.<br/><br/>In case you are wondering what this whole thing is about, I will try to keep the plot as a minimum so as to save much of the surprise. Joe Lamb is helping his best buddy make a zombie film in the 1970's when they witness a horrendous train wreck. What follows are several days of unexplained activity that alters all their lives in exciting and frightening ways. <br/><br/>Super 8 has been said to be reminiscent of all those old Amblin Spielberg films of the 80's, and it's not far off. There is a good mix of several films in here, including Stand By Me, ET, Close Encounters, and other classic films. Some will blow this off as nothing special, merely a nostalgic trip trying to replicate Spielberg. But in Abrams hands, this is a well crafted and very well directed film. The child actors here are some of the best most emotionally provocative that I have seen in a long, long time. Elle Fanning, in particular, is fantastic. All the children are, and it's something that has rarely been seen since Spielberg, who is arguably the best child director in the industry. <br/><br/>But beyond the actors, the cinematography is also of note. Firstly, the train wreck is handled extremely well. It's both frightening and exciting and truly underscores the damage and effect that it will have on the town. And when the creature from within the train begins to wreak havoc, it's extremely effective. Though this is not a horror movie, horror film principles are applied in getting the most out of the tension of these scenes. Some reviews have called the sci-fi elements weak, but I would argue against that. There are issues, which I will get into later, but the scenes dealing with this creature before it's big reveal are nice and scary. These scenes are countered with even better drama. As stated, these child actors are fantastic, and that really makes the scenes in which the budding love story or family drama shines through. <br/><br/>Of course, the film has it's issues, the reason it's an 8 and not higher. First of all, I took issue with some of the separation between the monster plot line and the plots involving the kids and their drama. It's almost like two films are being played out here, and while that may have been how the film initially started (as ideas for two different films coming together), it's kind of disheartening to see that they never truly figured out how to make the two interweave naturally. My second issue involves some story elements that seem like they could have been developed more, namely the father-son relationship between Joe and his father. His dad spends much of the time trying to figure out what's going on. We know there are issues there between Joe and his father, and one scene between the two showing this doesn't really encompass the true nature and effect of these problems. It would have also been nice to see more interaction between the two, but I won't spoil anything about why I think this. <br/><br/>These are minor issues though for a film that is well crafted and truly enjoyable. Yes, the film is quite nostalgic. However, there are a great deal of touches Abrams puts in himself that make this his own film. For those who grew up on all those old Amblin films, this will warm your heart, and for those who didn't grow up on those, you'll have a chance to know what it felt like to see a film like ET for the first time. Simply put, call this film this generations ET or Stand By Me."

","I'm sorry to have to contradict the first review but I did not get as much out of this movie as they did and in fact I would not recommend it all. It was a loud hash of a movie which was all over the place. It has elements of all the movies he mentions i suppose and I could not help noticing all the gestures to earlier films but it was very long, not pacey at all and the trailer is probably the best part of it. Maybe its trying too hard to pay homage, develop character and suspense,and tell a story which holds together. It didn't work for me. I saw X-men 1st class a few days ago and enjoyed it far more and in fact could watch it and Thor again no problem. Its all about opinions as they say I suppose so the only way to find out is to go and see it yourself."

And the CGI? The train crash was cutting edge for the mid-90s, but in a 2011 post Avatar cinema world, it looked awful. This has set me back with JJ about ten years.. trying to be Spielberg doesn't work, even with his help."
"school_account","1","6","11","27 November 2011"," An awful kids film full of awful kids !
","I am of an age now, when watching a movie stuffed with teenagers is sickeningly awful. Where are the great sci-fi films that should be in production ? I mean come on, this is a collaboration between JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg for crying out loud. If they can't make a good sci-fi movie , who can ?<br/><br/>It would have been better to see the dynamic of an older group of friends in the town than kids. Because it's kids it introduces serious problems with the story. They are all nearly killed very traumatically at the very beginning (final destination style) and yet all agree to go home and tell no one in fear of getting into trouble. I'm annoyed with the film from this very premise as none of them seem bothered by this event. Then whilst all these horrible things are happening and people are going missing (including one of their dads), they carry on making their film each day as if it was business as usual, what kind of a crazy town is this where kids recover from serious trauma so easily. Then there's the romantic development between the main character and his love interest, he's about 12 and she's old enough to drive (though doesn't have her license yet), its a very unlikely and awkward romance. And the two of them are overly emotional and poignant when it doesn't make sense to be or that you would expect kids of this age to be, it seems out of place. True heroism in the face of adversity, fine with pirate ships and cute bicycle basket aliens, not so believable when its a monster akin to Cloverfield, they would be petrified, they are too young to take such roles in the story. The main kid and his dad, poor effort to build audience empathy for their relationship. I felt more empathy for the Dad of the vomiting child in The Sixth Sense, (and he only had a couple of scenes in his film to manage that), than i did for the father in this film even after the whole movie. And why the 80's, I didn't even know it was the 80's in the film to begin with, I don't know who did set design and costume, but even when the kid in the petrol shop is listening to Blondie, i genuinely though he just trying to be pastiche. It was only when the sheriff makes the ubiquitous comment 'you kids these days and your modern Walkmans, what ever next', that i realised that it was set in the 80's. It doesn't need to be realistic, its a film, but it does need to be convincing and make sense and if people are to gain any connection with the characters, they have to at least act in some way proportionately to the events that have happened. Its obvious, predictable (long quiet pause...monster jumps out...long quiet pause....monster jumps out....long quiet pause....you guessed it, monster jumps out), melodramatic and offers nothing new, in fact a little insulting to an adult audience. And if I have to watch another film where characters should be running for their lives and instead take time out and practically stop the film to fit in a romantic or sentimental moment I'm gonna start throwing things at the screen. Monsters don't wait for people to finish their lines, Monsters eat people who stop for a chat. Super 8? super c**p indeed."

Yes, the beginning of the movie is a lot of fun, you wonder what the thing is, what's going on, etc., etc. But about 3/4 of the way through it's revealed that it is... again... a stupid alien. Don't get me wrong, I like alien movies. But come on! If you're going to make yet another alien movie in your long line of alien movies at least come up with something original. Tell me if you've heard this one: alien crash lands on earth, alien is held against his will by the evil military people, alien longs to go home, and in the end he does. Only, in this movie he does it with no fanfare, no climax, just him climbing in some ship and taking off. Guys, it's bad. It's a bad movie. And the fact that people have given this thing 7 stars is really, really sad. I guess I shouldn't be surprised in a society that gets wet from watching American Idol for the 1000th time. Oh yeah, one other thing, in this movie the alien is really p***ed off - wow, that's really unique.

","I watched this expecting an interesting story in the mold of 'Explorers' (1985), which was what it seemed to an extent. My oh my, 'Super 8' was one of the biggest let-downs ever in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>This movie is genuine garbage from the very start until the very ending. So, what is wrong with this movie? Everything! It is too long and slow (let me yawn of boredom). There is virtually no plot. It seriously lacks any character development. The kids can't seem to captivate in any way and they are kids with very bad taste for filming movies about zombies (ugh!).<br/><br/>The movie is supposed to take place in 1979, yet it doesn't deliver the slightest bit of the atmosphere and feeling of that era. In other words, a laughable attempt of being something it clearly isn't.<br/><br/>Things out-of-line, things that make no sense at all, occur. A giant, disgusting alien-like monster viciously attacks and devours people. And we are supposed to sympathize with it? One of the kids even has a conversation with it and it calms down (come on!). Military men often show up (what the hell are they doing here??). There is too much noise and too many explosions.<br/><br/>The one saving grace is the scene when the massive derailment of the train occurs. That scene is absolutely impressive and amazing. I've never seen such a long, intense, fantastic and noisy derailment in a movie. But that's hardly a redeeming feature, given the movie's all-round awfulness."

I'm getting tired of it...a movie that had some interesting ideas and concepts, but was done for by obsessingly trying to pay homage to Spielberg's early popcorn juggernauts ""ET"" and ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"". <br/><br/>The cast was unremarkable, and I'm trying to be gentle, that goes for both the kids and the adults. No matter how much they tried to mimic the late 70's-early 80's, the kids especially, could not wipe away the Twitter and Facebook stains from their faces and their characters...the wooden, empty and shallow essence, which this upcoming generation has so successfully adopted as its mantra. That wooden, lethargic zombie-like mentality and way of existing comes through every frame, to the movie's detriment. And these were just the child actors, don't get me started on the adults.<br/><br/>There is NOTHING remarkable about this movie, not the special effects, not the production values, not the soundtrack, not the cinematography etc.<br/><br/>This is a perfect specimen of mediocrity...if you haven't yet noticed mediocrity is the quality which best describes the times we live in these days!"

"TheManCalledX","6","6","11","10 June 2011"," Super 8 is a Super Gr8 recipe that's missing a few delicious components
","J.J. Abrams and the legendary Steven Spielberg join forces in this coming-of-age, science fiction film, Super 8. In the small town of Lilian, Ohio, a group of teenagers are making a zombie movie with their Super 8 mm camera, but fall witness to a catastrophic train crash. What follows are a series of mysterious events that include people missing, local dogs being discovered in neighboring counties, and the appearance of the military. <br/><br/>I showed up to the movie's midnight premiere with very high expectations. A year ago, seeing the teaser trailer that implied that a mysterious alien creature would run amok just left me anticipating for June 10th to come. I was a huge fan of Cloverfield for its originality and non- stop action (as well as the monster himself), so I expected J.J. to create a masterpiece of its own. <br/><br/>The way I can describe this movie is that it's like a recipe for a chocolate cake. The cake surely tastes delicious, but looking in the recipe book, you expected a little more. For example, many have complained about the ending, and this I can agree on. It's so rushed and abrupt right when you're in the middle of the awe and action that it's almost a bit of a turnoff. There were also points where the movie seemed so unrealistic (i.e. the Biology teacher surviving the train crash with half of his truck left unharmed), but they're things to be overlooked. <br/><br/>What Abrams does perform though is an excellent set-up of the plot and production design. Yes, the plot does get messy by becoming various different types of movies, but it does it in a way that just manages to work out in the end. The design of the film was also well done, whether it be the beautiful train collision scene, the 80s feel, or the creature itself.<br/><br/>The film itself pays a solid homage to classic Spielberg, giving off a ""Close Encounters With The Third Kind""/""E.T.""-esque vibe. However, this doesn't quite live up to either of those films. It turns out the reasons behind the alien's attacks is *SPOILERS* the usual ""creature kept in captivity and tortured, and now hates all of mankind"" cliché. It doesn't ruin the film, but it leaves a small tarnish on it. <br/><br/>What separates this from most other summer flicks though is that it has a heart. The relationship between this young group of friends is flawless, and brings me back to when I was just a kid. Like most have said, it's like ""The Goonies"" or ""The Sandlot"" all over again. Acting-wise, the young and unknown (minus one face) cast is absolutely top-notch. Elle Fanning has proved herself to grow up into a strong and emotional actress, possibly better than her older sibling Dakota. Joel Courtney does an especially phenomenal job as Joe Lamb, who just can't let go of the recent death of his mother, and proves himself an especially powerful character in a scene where him and his Dad have a tear-jerking argument. Kyle Chandler does a great job as Joe's overburdened father, who not only has to juggle with the death of his wife, but the mysteries and troubles occurring in this town. Ron Eldard as Elle's character's father is truly an underrated and troubled character. Overall, outstanding cast.<br/><br/>Overall, Super 8 is truly a unique summer flick in its own, but it just misses at certain points that make you feel like you expected some more from it."
"toytrainbob","4","8","16","12 June 2011"," Disappointing Film that Fades Into Melodramatic Mush
","Warning: There are a lot of spoilers in this review, but it was necessary to make the point. <br/><br/>I am somewhat amazed that the reviews are so positive for this film. It was at best mediocre. It starts off in rather spectacular fashion with a train wreck that would make Final Destination proud, but it seriously stretched believability. Forget the obvious questions of the speed of the train and the lack of security. There were flying freight cars, explosions everywhere, demolished train station, complete and utter destruction. Yet not one of the kids was injured, let alone killed and even the driver of the truck that causes the accident survives!!! Of course, the car the kids drove to the station, parked right next to the wreck, didn't' have a scratch on it. My head starting to spin a little. This starts a film that had gaping holes in the storyline or just things that made little sense. The Air Force should sue the film makers for making them look so evil and incompetent. There are questions in the plot galore. My favorite is why, when they finally closed the town down, would the military bring back the trucks holding the secret contents wanted by the alien to rebuild his ship. Ugh, that material would have been safely tucked away in a high security location, but then there would have been no melodramatic ending. I could mention the military's use of tanks, the fire, and other silliness, but I will leave that to the viewer. <br/><br/>Even the premise of the kids making a super 8 movie was never really central to anything in the film more than a late in the movie glimpse of the alien being escaping the train wreck. Maybe this was the director's slight of hand making us think the Air Force would track down the film makers, since the movie made it clear the commanding colonel knew the super 8 film existed. More confusing than diverting. I had difficulty figuring out what year the film represented; my guess is mid 1970's. But that would make the communist angle seem out of date and it was inconceivable that the town folk failed to link the heavy handed Air Force actions with the events happening to them. And of course where is the news media? This was industrial Ohio, not a rural backwater somewhere unknown. It became a poorly done Twilight Zone episode.<br/><br/>There are parts of the film I liked. The subplots for the most part worked and the acting is passable. The kids are entertaining and the super 8 film making was wonderful fun. The adolescent love story and the jealousy it created was well done. Their exploits had a charm that unfortunately was lost later in the film. <br/><br/>This movie is worth seeing, just leave your brain behind. I read one review that saw this as a successful merger of ET and the Goonies. Unfortunately, I see it as an unsuccessful merger of ET and Final Destination."

","Super 8 is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. What was the point? The seventies are over and Spielberg was in his 20's unknowingly making classics. Trying to go back and copy successes of those bygone days.....why? To cash in once again? Well, here's the deal: Those of us who are old enough to remember the 70's were 35 years younger and just as naive as Spielberg. But, it's 2011 and we have witnessed the evolution of the sci-fi genre (and I must say it's one of my favorites and has come a long way, particularly with the MARVEL classics and the sophistication with which they have been transformed to the screen). Poor me, having gotten sucked into buy a ticket. The movie made no sense (I could list about 25 scenes which were gratuitous, senseless, and poorly executed). I think anyone with an IQ below 78 might enjoy it. Elle, get a real job, because your sister has it all over you and her choices are far above yours, and please get your teeth fixed.

"Craig_McPherson","5","9","19","12 June 2011"," So ET and Cloverfield walk into a bar and.........
","Anyone familiar with Director J.J. Abrams' re-visioning of Star Trek should, by now, be annoyingly familiar with his cloying love of lens flare. He's even admitted in interviews to going overboard with the gimmick. So it's all the more surprising that in Super 8 – his collaboration with Steven Spielberg who served as Producer – that the icon who gave us Jaws and Close Encounters didn't crack the whip and reign in flare boy.<br/><br/>How much does Abrams love lens flare? Well, If you want to get totally plastered before the first reel spins out, invite friends over for a Star Trek drinking game where everybody takes a shot whenever there's lens flare. Super 8 isn't much different except that unlike Star Trek, you might survive an alcohol overdose until the final act, but all that's saying is that Abrams has learnt to pace himself, from a drinking game perspective.<br/><br/>Seriously, there are entire sequences that break the ""fourth wall"" by having so much damn lens flare that I found myself wondering why the scenes weren't re-shot. After all, Spielberg was cracking the whip here.<br/><br/>As for the story, without giving away copious spoilers, suffice to say it's what anybody would achieve if they took both men's most iconic films, ET in the case of Spielberg, and Cloverfield for Abrams, and had a team of re-writers blend the two together.<br/><br/>You can read the plot synopsis online, but since you're here, the story involves a small group of kids who, in the late '70s, are devoted to making a zombie film using the then cheap and popular Super 8 film stock. While filming a key scene, they witness the derailment of an Air Force train carrying mysterious cargo. The result of the spectacular crash is that a critter of uncertain intelligence and power is released into the countryside, with the US Army rolling in to contain the townsfolk and generally act as the baddies. Viewers familiar with Spielberg and Abrams' sci-fi and monster flicks can fill in the blanks.<br/><br/>In spite of the hype and the pedigrees behind it, Super 8 isn't a bad movie, but it isn't a stand out either. It's basically like drinking a cocktail composed of the essence of Abrams and Spielberg. It goes down easy but leaves a lingering taste of ""meh"" in your mouth afterwards. When it comes to cocktails, however, my only lament is that I didn't bring a flask of booze. It would have made the popcorn go down easier every time there was lens flare."

The crash continues for about ten minutes. Is that stupid enough? No. Guess what? The driver of the small pick up truck survives ... with some injuries. The driver is later murdered by the Air Force, giving no meaningful or logical explanation for the murder.<br/><br/>It's Sci-Fi as seen from the eyes of early teenagers. The dumb things we saw in some of the Spielberg films from years ago, such as a boy hammering away at his breakfast dishes at his breakfast, with a large plastic bat, while his parents ignore him, all intact in this film. <br/><br/>I cannot believe this is a JJ Abrams movie.

What I did like about the film was the screen presence of Joel Courtney, and I thought his acting carried the picture. He is certainly destined to be a big star. I was just not impressed with the storyline that much, and I thought there was a lack of creativity with the alien. Aliens in recent movies have shown no originality. This one is no exception. The one dimensional character i.e. the fat kid was totally annoying, unlike most fat kids in movies, they are usually funny. This one felt like fingernails on a blackboard every time he was on screen. Elle Fanning was OK, but even her performance was lackluster. I just would not recommend this film for adults, maybe for middle schoolers and freshmen in high school. All in all I was extremely disappointed with the film.

","Writer/director J.J. Abrams pays homage to late-seventies, early-to-mid eighties Steven Spielberg science-fiction films, with the living legend himself as producer.<br/><br/>Set in 1979, when people had Walk-Mans instead of iPods, and listened to the kind of music today's parents sing karaoke to on weekends, the story begins with a group of youngsters making a cheesy zombie flick with a Super 8 camera. This is the best part, bringing back memories of the endearingly curious kiddos in Spielberg outings E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL and THE GOONIES... this film-within-a-film is a fun and involving baseline.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this titular device doesn't last long. For as the kids are shooting at the platform of a train station, a train derails causing a big budget wreck liken to the plane crash on Abram's television series LOST. The group scatters for their lives and never quite recover. And either does the story at hand, replacing character development with a horror-driven suspense: Following the disaster, something's causing strange and violent things to happen in the small town.<br/><br/>Thus Joel Courtney, as the young, vulnerable main protagonist, his dream girl Elle Fanning (cast as the ingénue of the zombie film), and Joel's father (Kyle Chandler), a local cop, investigate separately: becoming the only three characters we really get to know.<br/><br/>While Cop-Dad deals with the nefarious military, Joel and Elle (their friends subjected to filler roles) are trying to figure out the source of these happenings: imagine ""Elliot"" from E.T. morphing into Richard Dreyfuss from CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.<br/><br/>And while those Spielberg classics, which this film borrows from in not only plot-structure and characters but camera and lighting, took their time to reach a conclusion, this one too quickly turns an initially creative coming-of-age suspense yarn into a high-octane monster movie rushing to an inevitable, and somewhat predictable, conclusion. And while Riley Griffiths' character (think THE GOONIES ""Chunk"" with bossy bravado), who directs the zombie film, has his moments, he never becomes the capable scene-stealer as obviously intended.<br/><br/>Although his completed short (shown during the end credits) is entertaining, serving as a reminder that J.J. Abrams, while making the town itself and the situation at hand seem real, didn't center enough on those kids and the Super 8 camera."

","When I go to a movie I take a notebook. I usually jot down a few items about the movies as I watch. I can look back at my notes and see the movies that really engaged by the amount of notes I take during a movie. For this film, I have only one note in my book: ""loved it! "" I was completely engaged throughout the picture. Every aspect of this movie was masterfully done. The acting, the storytelling, set design -- everything was done really well. The pace of the story was fine and the balancing act between all of the human emotions is awesome. Some people have said that it's a cross between The Goonies and Cloverfield. I would say ""yes and no"". I will explain more later. Right now let me go into other aspects of the movie. I am going to give this movie a full-on green light. I count this as a win for J.J. Abrams To read more of my review go here http://fatsamuraireviews.blogspot.com/2011/06/super-8.html"
"PhillipMichaelH","10","8","17","16 June 2011"," A unique and refreshing film.
","I saw this movie in New York on opening day and I loved every second of this film. I was already a huge fan of Steven Spielberg and J.J. Abrams so I knew that this would be a unique experience and it turned out to be everything that I hoped it would be. I won't go into detail in this review and let everyone else make up their own mind about the film.<br/><br/>I thought that this was a very refreshing movie that does a good job at combining different genres without being too obvious. Even though the movie does have elements of Science Fiction, action and fantasy. It also is a very heartfelt coming of age story and I believe it's one of the essential elements of the film. Without these characters, I wouldn't have believed in the film as much as I did. J.J. Abrams does a nice job and making the characters and what they go through the most important part of the story and it works. The movie also has elements of comedy, their are plenty of moments that will have you laughing or smiling. I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't seen the film but stay in your seats when the credits roll at the end of the film, you won't regret it.<br/><br/>I love E.T., Close Encounters and The Goonies and this movie brought me back to those films and how much I loved them as a child and still do. Go see this movie, it may be the most fun and delightful time you will have at the movies this year."
"baronvonyiffington","4","8","17","11 June 2011"," Disappointing, plain, predictable story
","I expected a lot more from an Abrams film. Maybe that was my problem.<br/><br/>Anyone who has seen Abrams' other movies or TV shows knows what to expect. Twist endings every episode, surprise character revelations and cliff hangers. Super 8 delivered absolutely none of that, instead replacing it with a very normal, predictable ending that most people will figure out after a short time into the film.<br/><br/>The movie tries to pull off what Cloverfield did: an obscured, unidentified alien that nobody sees and lives to tell about. However, it falls flat on it's face for two reasons; this time, the alien has an agenda instead of just being on a rampage, and the military proves to be a much bigger threat than the monster does.<br/><br/>Another gripe is that - and this surprised me, because, again, an Abrams movie - were plot holes you could drive trucks through (or, in this case, trains). For the sake of not having this tagged as containing spoilers, I won't go into detail, but I'll just say they are obvious if you think about it after the movie.<br/><br/>However, the children were (mostly) interesting characters that I liked. Other than the ""lead"" character, all of them had quirky little problems that made them fun to listen to and watch. In addition, all the children are amazing actors and I look forward to seeing them in better movies sometime down the line.<br/><br/>I understand that this movie is less about the monster, more about the characters but that doesn't save it because the actual development behind the characters is boring and as predictable as the monster plot.<br/><br/>Overall, I was disappointed. The plot lacked any real substance that mattered and beneath all the hype and speculation was a plain alien movie that everyone has seen before. Definitely not Abram's proudest moment, and anyone expecting to enter Super 8 and find the usual things that Abrams brings to a movie will be extremely unsatisfied."

","Another primary layering. This time the idea is to start with a horror subgenre and grow inside it. This is virtually set in the fifties (though literally in 1979). It has the military conspiracy, the small town at risk, the alien monster, the lone cop who of course is both the single dad of the child hero and doesn't believe him. We have the world saved by kids. This isn't strictly necessary and is an addition since ""ET."" (Speilberg is a producer.ET is also set in 1979.)<br/><br/>All of this is usually dragged up so that we can make fun of it in some way, because it is so obvious and cheesy it just cannot work. But it is taken very seriously here and we are intended to take it seriously. Two tricks are applied. One is obvious: more kick in the kickass effects. The train wreck is orchestrated with flying debris photographed after the fashion of Kurosawa warriors. (Kurosawa again!) The monster is okay. The spaceship more than okay.<br/><br/>But the much more interesting device is what I call folding. This is trick to put us in the narrative. It works like this: we have a relationship with the kids in the movie. They in turn are making a movie that has characters with which they have a relationship. The inner movie is a subgenre horror film, a subgenre more overused that the fifties creature feature one. You can say that it is artificial and goofy to the kids as the 50s tropes are to us. <br/><br/>This layer of us outside the film and the kids inside, gets 'folded' with the layer of the kids outside their film and the characters inside. (This literally happens with overlapping footage.) The subconscious effect, based on the behavior of mirror neurons, is that we place ourselves in the world of the kids. Abrams then paces the film not for us as passive observers, but us as active participants. Oh, there are some assumptions of external place: we have the macguffin of the white cube. But mostly this is framed as if we were the kids, and we eagerly adopt their attractive personas. (Following current studio wisdom, both have ""father issues"" that are resolved by the end of the movie.)<br/><br/>Abrams, like Soderbergh, is a narrative experimentalist. Many of the insights on near POV framing we have here were worked out in ""Cloverfield."" Lets hope he works like this for decades.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"patrickwigington","10","6","12","12 June 2011"," As Good As You Hoped It Would Be
","J. J. Abrams (creator of Lost) makes his greatest film yet with this homage to his hero, Steven Spielberg. The fact that Spielberg co- produced this movie with Abrams helps to make it seem like a class 80's Spielberg movie. And who doesn't like that?<br/><br/>In the middle of a small Midwestern town in 1979, a group of middle schoolers are trying to make a short film with a Super 8 mm camera. One night they all sneak out of their homes and head to the train station. They film the scene as a train is passing for ""production value"", but suddenly a pickup truck smashes headlong into the train. After a fantastically over-the-top train wreck, Joe witnesses something escape from the train.<br/><br/>Although the movie does involve monsters and science-fiction, the focus remains on the kids. Joel Courtney plays the main character, Joe, who is reeling from his mother's death, and strikes up a relationship with Alice, played by Elle Fanning, who steals the show. But all of the kids are phenomenal, each one hitting the nail on the head with preteen awkwardness; and Kyle Chandler is great as Joe's dad, the sheriff who has to deal with losing his wife, and the strange happenings in town.<br/><br/>The script, written by Abrams, is exciting and skillfully paced. There always seems to be several subplots going on at once, yet there is never a moment of confusion about what is going on. Packing in action, emotion, and commentaries about childhood, Abrams' script never stops short of pure entertainment.<br/><br/>As for directing, Abrams makes a fantastic popcorn movie, the kind of which hasn't been made since—well, Spielberg's last film. Abrams gives a wonderful feeling to his movie, always putting the audience in the midst of it all as if they were a part of the town. Some may argue that Super 8 is much more than a popcorn movie, and perhaps it is. The point is it doesn't really matter, because either way, this movie rocks.<br/><br/>A Spielberg homage like this is very interesting and entertaining to watch. This reviewer certainly hopes Abrams has a long and fruitful film career, especially if he continues to make movies of this caliber. A wildly exciting and beautifully photographed film, this summer blockbuster should not be missed.<br/><br/>http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com"
"pressboard","5","6","12","11 June 2011"," Stand By Me...just not so close
","I never thought I would ever give J.J. Abrams or Steven Spielberg a mediocre review so the proceeding comes as a surprise. Super 8 is like take-out Chinese food - an hour later you feel a little empty. Here's a synopsis. Alien crashes, is tortured and abused, escapes (where the movie begins) and proceeds to throw a massive bloody tantrum (with very little blood). There is also a love story or at least two good-looking young actors who put on the longing faces that should elicit a response from the audience. My wife and I are in our fifties so we are not the target audience for this movie. The girl next to us, however, was young teens/early twenties and is definitely the core demographic. She spent the entire movie texting. I hesitate to criticize the actors who seemed to be doing a good job, technically. Were J.J. and Steven trying to do a much smaller version of Cloverfield? Were they doing Stand By Me with less laughter? E.T. goes postal? I'm just not sure. If you mixed all of the above in a cuisinart and dumbed it down to a teen audience I suppose Super 8 would be the result. I think if they had concentrated on any of the above the end product would have at least been entertaining. Sigh..wait for the DVD. On the upside I read a ton of positive reviews on this site - whatta I know?"
"innocuous","4","4","7","28 November 2011"," 7.3 stars (as of this date)? Really?
","""Super-8"" isn't an awful movie, and I will freely admit that the child actors do a much better job than most, but how could this be rated as high as it is? To me (and to use an old aphorism), there's no there there. This film doesn't really have anything to say, other than that the producer and director liked to make films when they were younger. This would have been a MUCH better film if it had omitted the SF/alien angle completely.<br/><br/>As it stands, it is an uneasy melding of ""E.T."", ""Cloverfield"", ""Stand By Me"", and ""The Goonies."" Furthermore, it contributes nothing that we haven't already seen many times before. I know it's up to the producer to decide what the money gets spent on and which films get made, but this was a terrible miss by anybody's standards.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to mention the CGI and FX, which are uniformly dull. This worked for Abrams in another film when the action took place in space, but the same thing doesn't work for Small-town, USA. The train crash, for example, is excruciatingly long and unrealistic, and the viewer begins to wince after the first five seconds or so because it is just so embarrassing. (As usual, I blame gamers for this, as they seem willing to accept the most mediocre CGI as long as it looks about what their games look like.) It's not thrilling and certainly not realistic.<br/><br/>But I drone on. This is an adequate movie, but it's not a good one."
"secondtake","6","4","7","21 June 2011"," Mostly fun, mostly absurd, partly great theatrics, suburban dystopia redefined
","Super 8 (2011)<br/><br/>Oh dear, I guess Stephen Spielberg knows what might make money, and he produced this movie without taking a huge risk. And writer/director J.J. Abrams buys into the extravaganza of the Spielberg kind of sci-fi story, with suburban America on the fringe of something big and otherworldly. It could have worked even with the endlessly overworked clichés, with better writing and better direction. Yes, that would be you, Mr. Abrams.<br/><br/>It helps to know going in that this is a teen movie, and teen viewers will get a lot more out of it because the main crew of actors are all high schoolers, and convincing ones. In fact, the strength of the whole thing depends on these kids, who are a great ensemble, smart and immature in turns and in unexpected gaffes and laughs. It's almost fun enough watching them to get through the rest. <br/><br/>But there is the rest, which is combination E.T. (quite literally, an alien wanting to go home) and the ""Andromeda Strain"" (where the military rushes in to face an extraterrestrial force, revisited recently in ""The Crazies"" in 2010). The highlight for me was the last part, where a nostalgically sweet small town suburbia goes into a colorful apocalypse. Never mind the improbability of the plot, the super spaceship, the monster with unreasonable (and not quite explained) powers, or even the history of such a thing going undetected until now, surviving surely on something besides nuts and berries.<br/><br/>In a very fun twist, there is at first a movie within a movie, where our high schoolers are making their own short and entertaining movie. That's where the title comes in (the time seems to be roughly 1975, before video). The train crash at the beginning is so excessive (it goes on forever, with enough burning and screeching for several movies) you know that something is amiss. And not just in the scene (this is no ordinary train) but in the direction (there is a woeful lack of balance). Pauses happen when there isn't time, and things are frenetic when a little pacing might have added more suspense and less kinetic frenzy.<br/><br/>This might all make it sound like a disaster of a movie rather than a disaster movie, but it's somewhere between. If you fit the demographic, it might work. If you don't mind sitting through some ludicrous moments for the much better ones, it does work (this would be me, Mr. Abrams). And if you like seriously inventive sci-fi disaster flicks, this won't quite cut it."

","I gave the movie 2 stars to give credit to the OK acting of the characters. Move past that and you get nothing but hype and fluff. You would think that any movie with the name Steven Spielberg attached to it would at the very least return your invested time and money without the profit of having a mind-blowing good time. This one will make you feel like you've been scammed.<br/><br/>The trailer looked promising even without it showing a shadow of the creature. That draws you in. But like a cat, your curiosity will kill you. The film is shallow and tries really hard to pump your heart with the hopes of making you jump off your ergonomic cinema chairs. It drags on about the character's side story which by mid-film will make you think ""so what?"" Nothing of any importance could be attached to the main plot of the movie to the history of the people involved whatsoever.<br/><br/>The momentum of the story flies and dips so often that it ruins the thrill if there is any. After the train wreck I thought ""ok here we go..."" but then it mellows down almost to a coma up to the last 20 minutes or so where things finally starts to build up only to a very disappointing and rather stupid conclusion. <br/><br/>If you feel like you ""need"" to watch this just because it has Spielberg's name tagged on it, you're better off brushing this aside for a more meaningful experience, like say, impulse buying a gum at 711."

","Cloverfield Clone with a higher budget and a far less, strangely complicated story line with no ending at all, which is not a spoiler. Spielberg makes the most predictable films and with market cynicism targets this movie to young kids, mostly male. I found this movie to be such an empty clone that one wonders if JJ Abram is not really just a one film guy. I am at the point where when a film has Spielberg's name on it, I know the film will be glossy, fancy and utterly empty. The children in this show is where the story centers, but boy does this film lead to so many unanswered questions. Some important scenes seem to be missing, as there are many unexplained developments here. While mildly entertaining in a shallow way, I cannot understand at all the good reviews this disjointed film has earned to date."

The average person would not really care for this movie, that's my opinion. Definitely don't make the mistake of spending more than $3-$5... it's just not worth it. Hope I've been helpful to someone.

It is during this ""simpler"" time, 1979, when Charles (Riley Griffiths) - a want-to-be director, enlists the aid of his junior high friends to make a ""Super 8"" movie. His dream is to enter his movie in an upcoming contest and of course win fame and fortune. It is during the filming of an all important scene when Joe (Joel Courtney) notices a white pick-up truck enter the path of a speeding freight train. As the kids run for cover, the camera is left running and films the entire crash. The train disaster unleashes a secret that has been kept from the American public since 1958. The arrival of the military and their very hush hush demeanor has the town deputy looking for answers.<br/><br/>The group of young filmmakers continue on and when the original role of super 8 film is returned from the lab (remember when you had to wait for film to be developed?), Joe and Charles get a look at why the military has occupied the peaceful burg of Lillian, Ohio.<br/><br/>Government conspiracy, man's inhumanity to anything different than ourselves, rivalry between friends, young love and most of all being able to let go of your past to grow and move into the future are all explored during the 112 minute run time.<br/><br/>This film is definitely worth a trip to the theater to see on the big screen. The special effects would loose some of their impact - even on those 55"" and 60"" full HD TV's.<br/><br/>The ""secret"" is kept hidden enough to keep the audience guessing and ads to some ""shock"" moments that may make you jump.<br/><br/>Overall and enjoyable film - rated PG-13 the film could be disturbing to some younger viewers - I recommend you go see this one."
"DICK STEEL","10","11","27","8 June 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Super 8
","The first indication that this is a throwback and homage to science fiction of the 70s and 80s, is the Amblin logo that came up at the start. After all, Steven Spielberg had given the world Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and ET, two major alien films that had strong characterization and a compelling storyline filled with plenty of human drama, compared to these days when the attention is all focused on who can come up with the baddest looking aliens that can wreck havoc on Earth. Even Spielberg himself had a go with the modern update to War of the Worlds that failed to capture the charm of his earlier sci-fi films.<br/><br/>So he took on the producing role, partnering with J.J. Abrams who took on writing and directing responsibilities for Super 8, in what I would deem very ET like, except for the fact that the alien encounter is anything but friendly to a certain extent, more like District 9 style where us humans basically like to, as far as the movies go, enslave anything that falls down from the sky, sending in the military might to overpower, and like Paul said it, exploiting all alien technology and capability before sending them for a lobotomy and autopsy. In case you're wondering, no this is not a Cloverfield prequel or sequel, since the net was abuzz with such speculation given its teasing trailer, and Abrams' own credits as producer of Matt Reeves' film.<br/><br/>The story has to be kept under wraps, so what I'll do is to fawn over what worked. There will be quarters who may find it a tad too convenient in the way it ended, but I thought that simplicity is beauty - too often these days we're looking for that surprise ending or smart alecky gimmick, that something so effectively bringing the curtains down on a thrill ride get frowned upon, which is a pity because in essence the film reminds us of the days gone where such tricks need not be resorted to, so long as one had a solid story to tell, which is what Super 8 has in abundance in weaving closed loops in its narrative threads, with mystery, action, drama and romance all rolled into one superb summer blockbuster package.<br/><br/>Then there's the casting of relative unknowns, and children at that, who did such a superb job they put their older, seasoned counterparts in the industry to shame. We don't see too many films these days where the protagonists are a group of children embarking on that huge adventure, or in this instance, indulging in their passion for, filmmaking! There's portly Charles (Riley Griffiths) the director and writer, his best chum Joe (Joel Courtney) the makeup artist who both have the same crush over their leading lady Alice (Elle Fanning) to form one romantic angle, and not forgetting lead actor Martin (Gabriel Basso), cameraman Preston (Zach Mills) and pyrotechnics and effects specialist Cary (Ryan Lee), all sharing incredible chemistry together as a team working toward a common goal in making a short film in their small town, only to stumble upon an aged old military secret that threatens their way of life.<br/><br/>Adequately peppered with comedy balanced with that sense of mystery and tension throughout, J.J. Abrams leaves you consistently wanting more, feeding off nuggets of minute information bits that he reveals a little at a time. I thoroughly appreciated how everything need not be spelt out in verbose, allowing emotions to come through more genuinely as you feel for the characters involved, though leaving the pieces of the puzzle simple enough for anyone to put them all together. Then there's the tease of not showing you the threat, leaving things for the most parts to your imagination, before the inevitable show hand.<br/><br/>Action sequences are what you'd come to expect from a summer film, with the tent pole being the spectacular train crash sequence that began with the little filmmakers wanting a little added production value to their film, which in itself - the train rolling by; anyone who had experienced something similar would attest to that relatively nerve wrecking moment - giving way to a larger scale disaster that made it literally rain metal. Other action moments weren't as big scaled as this one was, though no less crafted with subtlety that demonstrated some degree of confidence not to overindulge in the need for special effects shots, again adding to the mystique that the children and their town had to face.<br/><br/>But credit will have to go to the trio of Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths and Elle Fanning, who all did such a great job to anchor their roles. Dakota will probably be looking over her shoulders given her sister's performance in this film, while I'm pretty sure offers will start knocking on the doors of Joel and Riley as the next potential child actors that we will see more of in time to come, who together with the rest of the young cast had the weight of this film carried on their shoulders, if the film were to succeed it will have to depend on the believability of their banter, antics and chemistry, which as mentioned, were really excellent.<br/><br/>Oh and don't head out the door once the end credits start to roll, especially if you're curious to know how the group's short film actually turned out to be. Easily one of the best, and potentially the favourite scene of many. At least I know it is for me! Highly recommended, and it waltzes its way into contention to be amongst the best this year had to offer."

","I was nineteen years old in 1979 so I can relate to the time this film took place and JJ Abrams does an excellent job in keeping with the times. Although he did have a Sony Walkman in one scene which I felt might have been stretching it a bit. Not that the Walkman didn't exist, it did. Actually Sony introduced the Walkman on July 1, 1979 and technically, the main portion of the film occurs on or around June of 1979. OK, I know, I'm a dork who looks for authenticity in film making when they go to a specific year. However, it wasn't that big of a deal.<br/><br/>This is a terrific film and I know you may have seen the ET meets Transformers, or Alien meets Goonies, or other such comparisons. I will say it has Spielberg written all over it, which is a good thing because Spielberg is Spielberg. J J Abrams wrote and directed this film. If he keeps making films like this the film industry will be a better place.<br/><br/>So if you like E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Sandlot, Goonies and Alien; you will love this film!

"alexart-1","8","5","10","11 June 2011"," Eight Reasons to See Super 8 (and Two Reasons Why Not)
","Instead of presenting this as a normal review, I'll put it in the form of bullets. I just think it's more reader-friendly for this. It also helps to avoid plot details, and that's probably better if you want to go in with a blank slate.<br/><br/>1. If you like Steven Spielberg, you'll like this movie. J.J. Abrams has clearly created the movie as a homage to the classics that Spielberg has made. Echoes of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Jurassic Park are felt throughout the entire film. Super 8 directly borrows Jaws' style in that the viewer only gets brief glimpses at the monster for the first two thirds; it isn't until the last third that the viewer sees it in its entirety.<br/><br/>2. The acting. Elle Fanning is the highlight of a great cast of child actors. Fanning has proved herself once with Somewhere, but she ups the ante with Super 8. There's one great scene where she has to act as though she's acting in a movie filmed by the other children. She, along with the rest of them, nails it.<br/><br/>3. J.J. Abrams' script. The writing is one of the best things about Super 8. It's rich, fast, and, again, Spielbergian. Abrams' screenplay is delightful because it plays on the viewer's own childhood memories. It's basically one long nostalgia trip.<br/><br/>4. J.J. Abrams' direction. He basically becomes Steven Spielberg to make this movie, as seen in his use of constant Steadicam shots and visual restraint when it comes to the shots of the monster in the early parts of the movie.<br/><br/>5. The cinematography and color palette. Also reminiscent of 1970s blockbuster film is the visual look of the movie. The drowned-out colors are similar to that of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.<br/><br/>6. The train sequence. The best scene in the movie is one involving a train crash. It's basically what you've already seen from the first trailer, but this time, it's from a different point-of-view. Watch this in a big theater. You're going to want to hear how great the sound editing is in this scene.<br/><br/>7. The monster. I'm not going to say anything other than that I very much enjoyed the way the monster looked.<br/><br/>8. The tone. Like The Goonies, Super 8 is a summer movie that's made to make you feel like a kid again. It's wonderful, at times whimsical and at other times frightening. It's exactly what one should want from a summer movie, but...<br/><br/>Reasons why not to see Super 8: 1. J.J. Abrams got too bogged down in becoming Steven Spielberg. The film is sometimes obnoxious in how much it wants to be Jaws. This ends up getting in the way of the film's great story, and keeps it from becoming a classic.<br/><br/>2. It's not perfect. Super 8 has pacing issues a lot of the time and will often involve characters and subplots that completely unnecessary. There are certain elements of the movie that could have absolutely been taken away without any repercussions.<br/><br/>Overall, Super 8 is worth seeing. Take the family out and have fun. See it in a big theater with a good sound system. It's a fun but unfortunately forgettable ride."
"Karmakrazy","10","5","10","10 June 2011"," A true masterpiece
","If there's one movie you shouldn't miss this year, it's Super 8. There's more heart and soul in it's two hour running time than most mainstream movies could ever hope to conjure. It's the kind of film that reminds you of why you go to the movies.<br/><br/>In the current era of CGI laden, soul-dead adventure flicks, Super 8 distinguishes itself by having heart. There is an authenticity to those kids in the film, a familiarity in their conversations. It reminded me of when I was a kid. The friendship between the kids in the film really resonates, and the emotional elements of the film totally deliver. One of the most poignant scenes in the film has nothing to do with whats in the train car, or the air force, and anything like that....rather, its a scene that takes place in Joe's bedroom as he sits on the floor talking to Alice. <br/><br/>Super 8 is an Abrams ""Mystery Box"" complete with a satisfying unveiling of the goodies inside. With only his third film, Abrams has made a truly spectacular must-see film that demands to be seen as quickly as possible. Allowing some of the surprises to be spoiled is simply not an option. It's the best movie so far of 2011, and it's a real treat. You do not want to miss it!"
"chrisskaja","1","9","22","13 June 2011"," For younger viewers, and Lens flares again....................
","Best described as the Goonies meets E.T. on steroids. Heavy on the younger audience (13 to 15 yr. olds) very light on adult entertainment. JJ Adams persists in using lens flares.......... most of us think they are an obnoxious distraction, but Mr. Adams continues ruining scenes with his obsession/love making use of lens flares. There are only a few people in the world who thinks it's really cool- JJ Adams and the person who showed him the first one. The kids acting is well done. The little bit of adult interaction was average. Takes two thirds of the movie to finally get to the alien, which was done just o.k...... Only pay admission if you have a minibus full of kids, otherwise it will make a good red box rental."

My first thought was , ""this movie is a melodramatic copy of the E.T. from 1982"" ..WTF?"" Who is he trying to cheat? Pure commercial piece of lack of ideas! Laim,very laim..First you sit in cinema and and wait something to happen. The story is about some alien monster that you only see once in the whole movie for about 5 seconds. Spielberg tryied to create, already seen for million times , a kids love story with alien contribution. What is the age of his viewers that he want to impress? I think 10-18 yo...Is this his maximum?i'm 32..Am I getting to old for his movies? I hope Transformers would be better, but if this dissatisfaction happens again, i'll ask Spielberg to return my hard earned money that i gave to him in Cinema!;)"

","This film was a lot of fun. I don't know if it matters if you see it on the IMAX screen but I did and I loved it. The train wreck scene on IMAX was incredible. To me this movie is a B+. It may not be the next E.T. but it certainly has a lot of entertainment value to it. If I had any complaints it would be with the ending but even that doesn't ruin this movie also I don't think this is a movie for very young children. There is some dirty language and a few scenes that are a bit too dark for the very young but the film is rated PG13. This is not the best movie ever but it's pretty damn good. It's worth the price of the ticket. Very well acted by the young cast of virtual unknowns. It has lots of jumps and surprises at certain points and is lighthearted at other time. I can't speak for everyone but I saw it opening weekend and the theater that I was at was packed and no one walked out during the film. The most common review that I have read and agree with about Super 8 is that this isa great summer movie. Get the popcorn and grab a seat."
"jerry07","4","6","13","11 June 2011"," Disappointing at best ...
","Although the acting was good in general and the characters entertaining, this movie comes with no surprises: at first, the atmosphere of an unknown threat to a little town of Ohio tend to grab you. But by the time the plot is understood (very early in the movie), there is a feel of a bad remake of ET mixed with the Goonies mixed with any other movie with a bad alien in a rampage. It is also full of scenes defeating any logic and laws of physics and some of the outcomes make no sense. The (rotted) cherry on top: add to the mix a few classic themes such as ""the two family do not talk to each other but let's get together for our children"" or ""the child saves us all and empathize with the Alien"" (with a scene to cry for). Nauseating. If there was not so many cliché, it could have been a good movie."

"lonshapiro","8","3","5","13 December 2015"," Underrated - best kid buddy film since Stand By Me
","First, E.T. is a 10, and the standard for all kid driven films Second is Stand By Me, which should be a 9 in the genre. Super 8 gets an 8.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie fell short of the gold due to a weak feel-good ending and mixing in a strange horror/suspense sub plot. Just making the movie about the kids filming their zombie movie and the usual coming of age/early romance themes, would have made this a huge winner.<br/><br/>A lot of people put down the movie for gaps in the plot or improbable scenarios and I get that.<br/><br/>With access to unbelievable amounts of content and a social media culture, all of us have been split into the dual role of fan and critic. The big question is always if a movie can captivate us at the beginning and draw us into its world. If it does, we'll suspend our disbelief and accept all kinds of inconsistencies and mistakes. If it doesn't we're angry that we spent our money on a bad film, and rip the film to pieces for its duration.<br/><br/>Super 8 was one of those rare movies where I was completely drawn into the world of those middle school kids. The shy 14 year old that used to be me identified with Joe. Alice's opening scene blew me and the other kids away. And then suddenly, BOOM, we get hit with a scene so unexpected, so dangerous and so suspenseful, I almost shouted out loud as if I were a first person observer. That hardly ever happens to me - I can't remember reacting the same way to any movie I've seen this year, which includes all the blockbuster films. So I was hooked into the movie, and just shrugged off or ignored all the stuff other reviewers complain about.<br/><br/>it's that simple, if you get transported by a movie and it keeps you in that trance it's a great movie. If it stumbles and you lose that focus, your critic side is going to find all kinds of things to complain about.<br/><br/>One last thing, expectations are killers. Super 8 got such mixed reviews, I never saw it in the theater. Seeing it on TV was a low risk gamble, and I was so pleasantly surprised that may have contributed to the high rating."
"maddog-50","1","3","5","25 August 2013"," Cloverfield meets E.T. meets The Goonies, for Hillbillies from the master of allusion
","I'm a true hater of Jar Jar Abrams way of film making and i tell you why:<br/><br/>Everything Abrams writes is a patchwork of allusions clued together by some light weighted side plots, mainly of inter human structure, to distract the audience from the illogicality and sloppiness of the 'main' plot which typically fits on a coaster. Thereby Abrams pits on the superficiality of curiosity and laziness of the audience, which is a zeitgeist phenomena of modern multimedia times.<br/><br/>Here, there's an alien guy, who was captured by the military years ago, after he crashed his ship somewhere, and then mistreated in cruel experiments by unscrupulous army scientists, he just want's to go 'home', but he can't for some reasons. During a railway crash, he/it could escape and is now chased by the army. Finally because some kind words of a kid, the frustrated and very angry alien guy gains his faith back and decides to fly away in his space ship which only consists of little magnetic cubes and which rebuilds out of them in minutes. <br/><br/>WTF? You might ask yourself right now, well that's the main plot on the coaster.<br/><br/>Your Questions are probably: Why did the railway crash? A.: one of the army scientists who was involved in the cruel experiments has become a partisan supporter of the alien and tries to cause the railway crash with his pickup truck. The train rammed the truck with full speed, the train goes to pieces, the truck with his driver survives the crash somehow. Q.: Why, How? A.: Because it's in the script, the guy is there to tell the audience later what happened to the alien before. Q.: Why is the army transporting that huge super dangerous alien in a container wagon without any high security equipment or delta force guards? A.: It's in the script, otherwise the alien guy couldn't escape.<br/><br/>The alien guy escapes to a near small town, where our Goonie-kids live. There he hides under a cemetery where he builds himself a huge cave labyrinth in 4 months, without ever catching the attention of the village people, for instance by noise or the huge amount of soil he had to clear away. Q.: ??, A.: keep watching, idiot!<br/><br/>To escape from Earth the alien guy needs his ship, or, equivalent, the cubes, which form the ship. Lucky wise, all the cubes he needs were also transported with the train, and lucky wise, were spread all over the place, and, lucky wise or so, he could collect them somehow before the army or anybody else could find them after the crash. Well, ONE cube was found by one of the Goonies. The alien guy, though, puts all his cubes in the water tower of the village meanwhile. Q.: ???, why cubes?, why the water tower? A.: A good place where everybody could see the final scene of the movie and why not cubes, maybe Abrams likes Rubik's cubes *cough*! Q.: But didn't he want to hide himself? Carrying tons of cubes to the best visible place in town, as a spider like huge 5000kg alien might be 'a bit' risky hiding-wise, even at night, above all, the army is chasing you non stop! A.: Yep! Maybe it's so crazy that nobody is expecting it, you know, and that's the alien guy tactics? I dunno!!<br/><br/>One of the Goonies discovers the covert of the alien guy, climbs down in the caves and tells the alien guy to check himself finally to take his ship and go.<br/><br/>Q.: WTF? Why did HE find the covert, why did he climb down?, His ship, what...? A.: 1. He's a Goonie, 2. His girlfriend Pauline was kidnapped by Donkey Kong before, so he tries to rescue her. 3. Even without an universal translator but some telepathy, the motivational words of the kid solved the whole movie. And well, yeah there'r some drama 'serious' plot things going on, the father of the girl is an addicted choleric, the boys mother had died, so these kids are kind of 'aliens' in their world too, other fat boys sister is a slut, bla, bla, all together a 'typical' social scenario of the average Spielberg Americans, we all can identify with (?). BTW, lens flare fanatics will be also very happy again.<br/><br/>Q.: What do Abrams and Spielberg have in common? A.: Spielberg nuked the fridge, Abrams wrecked the train! The both jumped the shark long time ago!"

","First of all, I was impressed by the acting of the kids in this movie. Simply amazing. However, everything else left me less-than-impressed.<br/><br/>The plot was one-dimensional and predictable. The directing was predictable...in the sense that by the use of sound and camera angles you knew what was coming because it has been done so many times before.<br/><br/>The premise of the film was suitable for children, and it would have been a great kids' movie if it weren't for the unnecessary mature language and themes.<br/><br/>But the intense scenes and action aren't enough to hold an adult's attention, so there is a very narrow demographic that would enjoy this film."

"aznfratboy1","8","3","5","15 June 2011"," Not too shabby
","I've given this an 8/10, mainly because I'm easy on the ratings. I saw some trailers of the movie and I thought to myself, it doesn't look too bad. Whilst with a friend, she suggested that we watch it, as there was nothing else to watch at the time. Personally, I find this movie to be a sign of the times, the body of the movie is actually pretty decent, but the start and end are sort of iffy. It takes too long to get to the real nitty gritty part. Yes, the kids are funny, the way the bag and diss each other is cool, and a not too bad depiction of what kids were like before Facebook (ie. they actually talked to each other, rather than facebook messaging the person THEY ARE SITTING NEXT TO), yes I hate those people too, but let's return to the topic at hand. The movie does take a little too long to build the storyline. I think there is too much calling for movies to be character driven in the modern era. I say no! If you want characters you can relate to THAT'S WHAT A TV SHOW IS FOR. A movie is meant to last 90-150 minutes, give or take. The characters support the plot. The ending sort of came out of nowhere. I thought that the movie was just about to take it up a notch and then it finished abruptly. Is is weird that movies are now very much ""oh, so I'm going to push this button, and that will make everything else that you've seen in the past 90 minutes or so basically null and void"". <br/><br/>Now that I've gotten the negatives out of the way, lets move onto the positives. As you can probably conclude, the part of the movie I liked was the main storyline aspect of the film. The kids are decent actors. Joel Courtney, the lead plays the role of the child superhero well, Kyle Chandler brought a little of the Eric Taylor to the film, further supporting that he probably is the best ""average dad"" actor out there right now. The visual effects were great without being overdone like Transformers. But I like specificity, so I'll keep it at that.<br/><br/>Overall, I give it an 8 for a general movie, but for a movie with the backing of Abrams and Spielberg, the guys behind ET and Lost, I give it a 7. Take of that what you will, but I reckon for others, it's a 7 and a 5.5 respectively."

","The concept was interesting but the surrounding story is borderline inept. There's something missing from the heart of Super 8 for which no amount of quality cinematography, editing, and acting can substitute. I'm not saying the acting was good. What I'm saying is that Super 8 is an insanely uninteresting and almost unlikable film. Devoid of any thriller resonance, the movie treats intrigue the way porn movies treat sex, as a subject to be exploited. The script matches mass childish mystery with awful dialogue and lame performances, using a thin plot as an excuse to try and keep the audience. Unless your IQ matches your show size, there was really nothing of intrigue. I can't tell you how disappointing I am in this movie.<br/><br/>I wanted to be scared but just wasn't. I wanted to like this movie and buy in to the ride but I just didn't. Huge let down."
"bopdog","2","16","47","11 June 2011"," I was loving it before it opened, then my fond wishes dashed- crap movie!
","I was really expecting something much better than this. I read respected reviewers all ooo-ahhh-ing about the Spielberg touch and the old-school Hollywood 80s magic making a comeback here. I must say I saw none of that.<br/><br/>What I saw was dim, clumsy, and amateurish. The characters were unappealing. Of the ""corps de kids,"" so to speak, I wouldn't have minded terribly if ALL of them got hit by a bus and disappeared, they were so unpleasant and whiny. The only exception I can remember is the kid called ""Joe."" While the others are played by youthful actors who are without doubt fine young people, the characters they portrayed, the behaviors the adults in charge of production demanded that they engage in, were unattractive.<br/><br/>I was SO on this film's side! I was cheering it on, willing to make all kinds of allowances in order to support its artistic flair. Truth is, this film seemed to be about on the primitive level of an early 1960s kids' TV show. I needn't have worried about the flair- there was none.<br/><br/>The deliberate attempt to bring on a Spielberg vibe was ham-fisted, clumsy, and embarrassingly obvious at all times. There were passages in the movie where various Spielberg shticks were imitated, especially places where there was frenetic camera action and lots of Voice Over. For example in one puzzling 20-minute stretch the kid actors in this movie were sounding EXACTLY like the pint-sized crew from The Goonies, even the two ""fat kid"" characters from the two movies were in sync.<br/><br/>I don't ask sci-fi or fantasy to make sense outside of its own world. But there is a degree of internal logic, or artistic coherence, that is a minimum requirement for a human being to even follow the story and make sense of it. This movie lacked such a minimum.<br/><br/>I am not angry at all- I am more disappointed and puzzled by this movie's poor quality than anything else. Seriously- it is BAD."

Of course this has to do with my age, but these kinda things brought me right back to my own childhood and that's probably also the reason why this movie hit me on personal note I guess.<br/><br/>All in all nostalgia for the ones who lived and seen the period before the digital age. 8/10<br/><br/>Don't forget to watch the credits too!"

In an attempt to get older viewers engaged, nostalgic bits are thrown in - Walkman, CBs,dope, 15 cent pizza (that was early 1960s, not 1979). The special effects, the ""monster"", the central characters - old news. The scenes of bicycles, the military - cold, faceless - E.T all over again.

Then of course there is the ""visitor"" that the movie is centered around. No spoilers here, trust me that part is good too.<br/><br/>This is a movie to make time for.

"sme_no_densetsu","8","5","11","11 July 2011"," Abrams evokes some of that old Spielberg magic
","On the poster for ""Super 8"" you'll see producer Steven Spielberg's name featured just as prominently as director J.J. Abrams'. That's the first indication that this movie seeks to recapture some of the magic behind past Spielberg offerings like ""E.T."" & ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". While the movie falls a bit short of those classics it does indeed provide a pretty rewarding cinematic experience.<br/><br/>The story is set in a small Ohio town in the summer of 1979, where a group of friends making a super 8 movie become witnesses to a catastrophic train wreck. They suspect that the crash was not an accident and soon the actions of Air Force personnel seem to confirm those suspicions. As strange events begin to occur the local deputy attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery and so do those who witnessed the initial crash.<br/><br/>The movie includes little in the way of recognizable names & faces but that's no distraction. Newcomer Joel Courtney does just fine in his first film and young Elle Fanning gives an effective performance as well. Meanwhile, Kyle Chandler is stalwart as the father/deputy and I could even tolerate Ron Eldard, who's high on my list of least favourite actors.<br/><br/>Abrams does double duty as director and writer and he does pretty well on both counts. His script definitely isn't perfect, though. The last act has been rightly criticized and some have also taken issue with his fairly obvious nods to Spielberg (but not me). Imperfections aside, I think that Abrams captures the spirit of vintage Spielberg better than anyone else (including Spielberg) has done for years. The period feel is also well done, benefiting from detailed production design and a nifty, period-specific soundtrack.<br/><br/>All that being said, I don't blame some people for being disappointed, given that the ending isn't up to the same standard as the rest of the movie. However, the film's strengths make it worthwhile as a blockbuster that harks back to movies with more substance than today's offerings concerning battling robots and the like."

"GWilliamLocke","10","5","11","10 June 2011"," Super 8 is Great!
","I'm of the belief that most people haven't yet digested just how much things have changed over the last five years. We're living in a different world than we were in 2006, one that certainly seems alien to the movie settings of classic-era Steven Spielberg films. A modern world that, aside from the look of the creature/catalyst in the film itself, is alien to the world we see in J.J. Abrams' 1970s-set film, Super 8.<br/><br/>Set your clock back to 1979, a simpler time, back when people moved slower, talked nicer and  well  cared more. Now consider these things: The Goonies; Close Encounters of the Third Kind; Signs; Cloverfield; the geeks from ""Freaks the Geeks""; and maybe, just maybe, a splash of Mars Attacks! and Spielberg's War of the Worlds and ET. Throw all that junk in a blender, stick it in a small town (still, remember, in 1979) and you have an idea of the style and appeal of this Abrams' new movie. <br/><br/>The story, as it should be, is a simple one. Basically, something really bad happens to a small town full of good people. Something impossible to understand, even for the Air Force dudes who have been working on a solution for decades. Something impossible that only the silent minds of children can translate and solve. We meet our crew of inevitable heroes - five sassy boys and one enigmatic and broken girl - as they savor their summer break working on a zombie movie they plan to enter into a film festival. They go here, they go there, they screw around, not unlike the crew of goons from Goonies or even Stand by Me. The lead boy, Joe (played by future star Joel Courtney), is the soulful son of a fearless and recently widowed deputy (played brilliantly by ""Friday Night Lights"" star Kyle Chandler); his best friend (the hilarious Riley Griffiths) is a brilliant old soul with big dreams and high emotions; and Joe's crush (the suddenly amazing Elle Fanning) is the stunning daughter of Joe's father's mortal enemy, a town drunk named Louis Dainard (Ron Elard). Solid set-up, right? Formulaic you say? You bet.<br/><br/>And sure, Super 8 is, from afar, quite formulaic. A period piece monster/alien flick set in a small town and led by a cast of incredibly lovable ""tweens"" - almost sounds like something a scriptwriting class would put down on paper, right? Who cares. Abrams handles each frame, each scene, each gigantic explosion and slight facial expression, with so much love, so much skill and so much studied consideration that you can't help but get sucked into his Spielberg- produced version of movie magic. As the story progresses we know that everything will eventually - after plenty of running scared, wild flames, sweet tears and epic destruction - be alright. There will be a hug and maybe a kiss. There will be heroes and connections. There will be sub plots that make us care and bad guys who only the crowd can understand in full. Super 8 is, without any doubt, a big, brawny blockbuster film that intends to touch all the bases - your head, your heart, your funny bone and, most importantly to folks like myself, the part of your soul that values strongly crafted screen art.<br/><br/>Without giving away too much, I'll just say this: Super 8 is the first movie I ever outwardly cheered for during the end credits. Not because it's necessarily a huge artistic achievement like, say, Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life; but because it managed to take me to another world. A world where Michael Bay isn't allowed, Spielberg is your lovable guiding light, we don't solve our problems with computers and  ya know  anything is possible. Movie magic. And sure, same as was the case with M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, there are plot holes of reason here and there that some NASA goofs will someday dissect. But how much has that really ever mattered at the movies? And do we, the people of 2011, have any business saying what could or should be in an alternate reality such as the one in the 70s small town of Super 8? We, the lovers of fiction, do not.<br/><br/>My recommendation: leave the boringly logical part of your brain at home, forget about reality television, get to the theater and escape to Steven Spielberg and J.J Abram's 1979. Super 8 is a tasty, incredibly well-made Hollywood film that demands another lap before it has even crossed home. Somehow the so- far best commercially released film of 2011is a blockbuster about aliens, ""tweens"" and explosions. Who'd have thunk it?<br/><br/>Read more of my film- and music-related writing at ZeCatalist.com!"

","OK, so the story is derivative, but who cares?! I call it an homage to Spielberg, and who better to create it than JJ Abrams?

What's great - the acting, especially by the kids, the score, the action (even the CGI, which usually grows old quickly), the humor, the human drama, and pretty much everything else! <br/><br/>I won't add many spoilers, but I have to say this is the most fun I've had at the movies (and subsequently, at home on Blu-Ray) in a very long time. Don't be turned off by the previous reviews - it's worth a rental - you might just find yourself jumping, laughing, and enjoying yourself!"

","Some friends in a little town. A bunch of kids faced to a completely unimaginable situation. A small city isolated by a strange happening. The military taking over. The sweet smell of distant childhood as remembered by sensitive ones. A movie within a movie (or maybe ""a dream within a dream"", Poe dixit). Tell you something? Yeah, there are a few specialist on these matters. John Carpenter in ""Village of the Damned"", ""The Fog"", ""Christine"", Stephen King (""It"", ""The Stand"", ""The Body"", ""Duma Key"" and a million et ceteras) and Steven Spielberg (""Jaws"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""E.T.""). And so on. All of them share a very personal view about the reality: the world is a strange, hostile place to live in, and the only way is the group, call it friendship, loyalty or love, but the group anyway.<br/><br/>This movie is about just that: a bunch of friends, young kids in a journey of knowledge, a ritual of manhood, an unbelievable event that force them to grow up, to mature, to start giving value to thinks they never thought about before.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams (without any shame or guilt, because this film is just about this) develops a powerful tale of love and friendship among an apocalyptic chaos, unleashed in a small village by an unprecedented event. But the story isn't about the event, but our society and the way we raise our children.<br/><br/>If you look carefully (or even casually at all), you'll quickly see that, smartly enough, Abrams switches parts from the very beginning: all the kids behavior like grownups, with decision and intelligent thinking, and all the adults do the very opposite: they are selfish, childish, totally unfocused on those things that really matters.<br/><br/>And when the chaos menaces lives and the happiness of everyone, the one and only solution rises from beyond the hard feelings and confusion, and then the climax claims its terrain.<br/><br/>Mr. Abrams gives his tribute to, yes, ""E.T."", yes, ""Stand by me"" and even ""Close Encounters"" as many editors correctly pointed out in other reviews, and, more noticeably, to John Carpenter (look for the underground sequence and tell me if you didn't expect to find Dr. Blair down there, if you know what I mean) and George Romero, all of them films, books and artists who share the same vision about life, collaboration and love. And, homage after homage in visuals, SFX and score, builds a movie of pure entertainment, a story of passion and emotion, and a big moral about the dangers of power and moral descent.<br/><br/>The movie is a very enjoyable experience for all audiences, and a very spectacular one indeed, despite some over-the-top CGIs (the train, mainly).<br/><br/>Embedded in this great script and direction, you will find some real gems: those two miracles of non-methodic (in the sense of not committing with Stanislavski-Grotowski Actor's Studio acting method), negative performances (the excellent and ever-focused child actors Elle Fanning and Joel Courtney), an amazing beauty (Amanda Michalka) and the promising future star (yes, we can foresee that) Riley Griffiths as the kid who directs the movie within the movie (which results you'll can appreciate along the end credits).<br/><br/>Watch, also, for the miraculous Fanninng's performance in the train station, immediately previous to the train's entering.<br/><br/>Worth seeing: You bet your life."

","This film had all the chances in the world. Namely Abrams and Spielberg. The film is shot wonderfully and instantly takes the audience back to the eighties when films were great and Spielberg was king. Abrams has undoubtedly recreated a charm here that is missing from most modern films, although admittedly less successfully than the films it is a homage to (E.T and Goonies). I so wanted it to be great, perhaps to the point where I expected too much from it. However it does contain stellar performances from a few of the cast. Overall the film is definitely worth a watch and who knows in twenty/ thirty years time it may retain some childhood nostalgia for someone but don't make the mistake of going into this film expecting greatness."
"Rectangular_businessman","5","2","3","6 January 2012"," Super Average
","I honestly don't see what it's the big deal about this movie. While ""Super 8"" isn't a bad film, and has some entertaining moments, most of the film feels flat and uninspired, being an endless succession of references to several movies from the 80's, such as ""The Goonies"", ""E.T"" and ""Stand by Me"", combined with the ""visually dynamic"" (Read: The camera shakes a lot during the whole movie, even without any special reason) style from J.J. Abrams. <br/><br/>While I don't hate any of his movies (Such as ""Mission: Impossible III"", or the 2009 version of ""Star Trek"") I don't find them particularly interesting either. ""Super 8"" isn't the exception, being an average movie at best, with bland characters, lots of clichés, and a (somewhat) entertaining history, but that is easily forgettable. The resolution of all the conflict was incredibly disappointing, from my point of view. <br/><br/>Anyway, ""Super 8"" isn't a bad movie, but personally I don't think that it is anything special either."
"lasttimeisaw","7","2","3","5 December 2011"," Super 8
","This film is J.J. Abrams' amalgam love letter to producer Spielberg's E.T.: THE EXTRA- TERRESTRIAL (1982) and CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE THIRD KIND (1977), and in the meantime, to a great extent to pander to the new youngsters of the technology-era (the juvenile filming crew is awesome!). <br/><br/>In order to maintain an orthodox balance between a summer blockbuster family film and an Alien-like horror-fest, the film consummates a relatively shrewd paradigm (a PG-13 rating is well-suited): you will never witness the ugly facade of the monster until the acme moment and it is certainly not scary; no blood will be splattered (the only exception is literally fake blood); no children and animals will be dispatched on the scene, in spite of a seemingly hyper-perilous train-wreckage, while grownups are trashily disposable (under one condition is that as long as there are no actual slaughter shots); the mass-killing is all behind the scene and the sudden seizure tactic has been exerted a dozen of times, which is considered as irksome thanks to a wonderful young cast for their endeavor to make the scene credible. <br/><br/>Plot-wise, the film obviously suffers from some plausible expositions, the latter part of the film comparatively passes by hastily, The ""communication with the creature"" and the pinnacle ""magnetic muster"" scenes are too much similar and not original, what's more all is done on the spur of the moment, which bugs me whether J.J's inspiration well has running out of fuel? I'm still anticipating his new Star Trek project next year!<br/><br/>But overall, I do enjoy the film quite a lot, first the CGI effects are marvelous even watching on a television screen, and the young cast, I'm name-checking the lead boy Joel Courtney (the boy's eyes can talk!) and another Fanning girl, Elle Fanning (a stunning monodrama presentation in the film and she is only 13 at that time), by far they are the best children performances I have seen for years among mainstream Hollywood films (along with Hit-girl in KICK-ASS 2010)."

","Entertaining if derivative Steven Spielberg homage (ironically produced by Spielberg himself), this is smarter than most modern summer action movies by a long shot, with some amazing special effects, some fun shocks, and good performances from a brace of young actors. <br/><br/>What it doesn't have is a lot of originality, being sort of a mash up of E.T. and Close Encounters with a few bits of The Goonies and old monster movies thrown in. <br/><br/>It does remind us of how good those stories were, and that there's no reason you can't make a teenage friendly action adventure with smarts.

"witster18","6","2","3","23 November 2011"," The first 25-30 minutes is fantastic... then... well... not so much... it's going to sound like I hated this - but I didn't.
","THIS IS CHOCK FULL OF SPOILERS EVEN THOUGH THE DIRECTOR TURNED THIS INTO ONE OF THOSE MOVIES WHERE THERE'S NOT MUCH TO SPOIL.<br/><br/>Man... I really, really wanted to love this movie. I went in with high expectations. I literally went to the rental box at 9AM Tuesday to ensure myself a copy for Tuesday night's ""Mexican/Movie"" night at the house. The burrito's were awesome - the movie was alright.<br/><br/>Not only did this one have to meet my high expectations, but it also has to be compared to masterpieces like E.T. and Close Encounters of Third Kind(don't blame me for that - Abrams and Spielberg knew that would be the case). If you're gonna make a movie like that for a 38 year-old guy like me - you better do it right.<br/><br/>The set-up is fantastic. I was as giddy as a schoolboy who'd just confirmed his first girlfriend throughout the first 30minutes or so of this film. The story planted all the ingredients for a great epic.<br/><br/>The band of kids are aspiring film-makers. The idea to use that was completely squandered in the second half of the movie - as were many other possible subplots.<br/><br/>I was expecting the government to hunt the kids(and for them to run from them/not just pop into a classroom and snatch them) - didn't happen. I was expecting more out of their developed film(not just hand it to dad at the end of the film and say watch this) - didn't happen. I was also expecting the story to focus more on its' lead character to drive the story - and that didn't happen either. Instead the film dives into to some really meaningless alien crap(""I touched him and he just wants to go home), and turns a great set-up into an alien show fresh with hanging human bodies for food, and our lead talking himself out of being eaten. This film started to take all the wrong turns right at the point where it showed the doctor had survived the crash.<br/><br/>Basically, there were hundreds of opportunities to take advantage of subplots that had already been touched upon, and then the film didn't do it. Instead, the last hour of the film is nothing more than a big jumbled editing mess.<br/><br/>I'm a little ticked off because all the elements they needed to make this a fantastic(and I mean REALLY fantastic)movie were RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF THEM.<br/><br/>I'm no film-maker, but I could take the ideas that these film-makers had put into the first 30 minutes of this film and made this film into a masterpiece. You could have too. The set-up is freakin' brilliant.<br/><br/>There were three chances to put the government on the kids heels. And, I know they picked them up... later... for no good reason... That subplot really needed either a chase scene, or some follow-up on the general's part to find out why the empty film box was at the train station. And, every moment that the kids were filming close to the action - I was waiting for that Raider's of the lost Ark moment when the government looked in the distance on the hill and wondered - is that Indy digging the Well of the Souls over there? NO, these kids just film government operations freely. When the general looks out the window and does see the kids filming outside the house - what happens? - NOTHING! <br/><br/>next. Is that the best we can do on the ending? the little radioactive rubic's cube flies to the water tower, attracts everything metal within a mile radius, turns into a ship, and flies the alien away? <br/><br/>What happen to the Astin approach in Goonies where the one brave kid leads the others into the eye of the storm? The set-up was there. Instead of him running from the government, leaking his video, or leading his band of misfits against the man - we get ""go save the kids""...I thought it was about the kids, and then Abrams turns them into complete weaklings by deciding to go save them all of the sudden. I wanted these kids to save themselves. I wanted them to keep diving into the situation. Personally, I don't think we needed to see the alien at all(at least past the glimmer of it on tape). This film needed to be about the government moving in, and the kids not moving out, trying to figure out what was going on. It needed to be about the kids saving the girl from the government and not the alien.<br/><br/>Funny. I'm still giving the film 6 stars. I just wasn't expecting to wake up today and score this the same as the rom-com ""How Do You Know"" from Sunday.<br/><br/>Obviously, the production values are top-notch. The kids as actors are passable(one early scene with Elle Fanning is particularly effective), and again, the first 30 minutes is amazing. I just hated to see this thing spiral out of control for the last hour. The first 30 DID remind me of Goonies, E.T., and Close Encounters, and it was up to that standard, but the last half reminded me of the remake of ""War of the Worlds"" in a very bad way.<br/><br/>Can you tell I'm disappointed? It's not so much with the overall quality of the film - as it is with the squandered opportunities in the storyline."

I liked the story, and the way it played out with ease. My favorite character would have to be Cary, with his insane obsession and knowledge of explosives.

","The Movie Itself was written, produced and directed by J.J. Abrams, best known as co-creator of the TV shows ""Fringe"", ""LOST"" and ""Alias"", as well as for producing the film ""Cloverfield"" in 2008 and directing the reboot of ""Star Trek"" in 2009. The film was also produced by the legendary filmmaker Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>The story here is set in the year 1979 in a Ohio town. The main character is a boy in his early teens by the name of ""Joe"" (played by Joel Courtney) who lives with his father ""Jackson"" (played by Kyle Chandler). Joe's father is a member of the local police department, specifically a deputy. We see in the opening of the film a tragedy when Joe's mother is killed in a steel plant accident. A funeral is shown and we are introduced briefly to the supporting cast (Joe's friends). After that scene is over we fast-forward to 2 months later. Joe's best friend is another kid in his early teens by name of ""Charles"" (played by Riley Griffiths). Charles is an aspiring filmmaker and he uses 8mm cameras to shoot his homemade films with his friends like Joe. Joining Joe and Charles in the group of early teen kids working on the film are ""Cary"" (played by Ryan Lee), ""Martin"" (played by Gabriel Basso), ""Preston"" (played by Zach Mills) and eventually ""Alice"" (played by Elle Fanning).<br/><br/>The kids are working on shooting a zombie film and already have a bit of footage shot of a zombie death. Charles is just convinced it needs more of a story and such as well as production value. Lucky, or maybe not, for the kids they manage to find some major, major production value in the form of a train that passes by the train station where they are filming. At first that is all they think they have, a passing train to add production value, but it soon turns into one massive mess when the train is derailed by a truck. This sets up the plot to our film. Kids making a Super 8 film and they manage to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. They stumble onto a major conspiracy covered up by the military. The train was an Air Force train transporting materials from ""Area 51″, so you can only imagine what is inside the train's cargo.<br/><br/>""Super 8"" proves to be extremely enjoyable, action-packed and proves to have a very strong story with characters you sincerely do care about; especially the lead Joe and his best friend Charles. It's very cool to see J.J. Abrams team up with the legendary Steven Spielberg. In fact, having said that, I went into this with high expectations and I feel they were met. This is a new breed of ""monster movie"" / Sci-Fi. I'd compare this film to ""Cloverfield"" meets ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" perhaps — appropriately enough."
"enigmaticmaniac","6","2","3","9 November 2011"," Great - Good - Average - Poor wrt progress of movie
","It was a highly anticipated movie so watched it with much expectations. Movie started off quite well and I really got interested. Reminding me of Goonies it gathered my attention. As the movie progresses things go pretty well. An environment is created that something is gonna happen. But when it happens its not much of a surprise, the movie falls down then to the category of average. In short it's good for most of the former part but the latter has spoiled it. The problem is with script which do not cooperate with the theme well at the end. Its one of the same old formula used several time in movies like Goonies, ET, Close Encounters etc. The acts are pretty fine by everyone. CG work is nice. There are few good sudden scenes to stir you which serves well. Now I feel that surely when you see it you will find that you were not actually expecting the movie to turn out so bad reaching the end with stupid script. Anyways, this will serve as a nice flick overall and entertaining as well but don't keep high expectations or you may regret."

","Apparently, if you put Steven Spielberg's name on the movie poster, no matter how clichéd is the movie - it will have success. It's just a mix of Goonies (the kids having an adventure) , Cloverfield (the alien destroys the town) and ET (the story of the alien and boy). I can even say it's a little bit of District 9 (where aliens are being held on Earth against their will). The script is filled with implausible elements like the unguarded train that carries an alien, the car who causes the train to derail and make such a big explosion. Anyways, it's best seen when you are bored, and don't have nothing to do. By the way, just rent the DVD, don't buy it."

","Not every day world is given sci-fi film and not every time its that good. Unfortunately like 99% of films that comes from Hollywood its deeply flawed however in comparison to certain robo trilogy this is a masterpiece (brainless teenagers that concentrated mainly in one country probably wont agree :P ). This film is a mix of 2 sci-fi classics that were given to us by mr Spielberg. I'm talking about E.T and Close Encounters of the third kind. Like in et we have brave, pure hearted teenagers who against all odds in their stupidity are also only smart and righteous people in town. Like in Close encounters we have evil military that just wont share info with good people of US and mystery which is obvious from the beginning but for things to unveil completely we have to first bite off our nails for an hour. This is actually good think because don't know how about you but I'm just sick of the trailers that reveal key-points of the story not to mention films with no mystery. Here informations are given to the audience piece by piece and that is what makes it so damn interesting (for most parts).<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>Just like I mentioned earlier film is flawed. Mainly by so common idiotism. First off all in 1979 US pick-ups were the safest vehicles on earth they could take head on collision with the train and after be in better condition then locomotive. Like that dude couldn't steal some big track and leave it on the tracks and while running he could be struck by a splinter from those big explosions. Necessity for drama won over common sense. That left really bad impression and its full of such moments. After those moments I always wonder either a film maker is that stupid or the audience for which its intended for. Like in most of JJ's films there is cinematography that reveal nothing more then a hand or claw of the monster (Cloverfield all over again but there it was justified with sudo-documental style of the film). This is kind of entertaining at the beginning but after each scene it keeps getting more and more irritating. I don't necessarily consider it as a flaw more like going a little bit over the top.<br/><br/>SPOILERS - THE END <br/><br/>When it comes to acting... Lets just say its not bad. Joel is quite credible in his role. However his complete lack of fear is in my opinion a little bit disappointing. Unfortunately this is how JJ probably imagined that character. I mus mention Elle Fanning's role, she was outstanding in comparison to the rest of cast and I hope she can give even better performances in the future. <br/><br/>CGI is very good especially derail of a train (in a clash with fearsome pickup. Monsters snout is also very lovely.<br/><br/>In conclusion I must recommend it to all of you who liked any of Spielbergs sci-fi films. And its a must see for those who grew up on his work. 7/10"
"The-Sarkologist","8","2","3","23 September 2011"," ET with teeth
","I be blunt and say that I like this movie despite there being a lot of your standard Hollywood cookie cutter scenes and concepts, and a rather soppy ending. If I were to sum this film up in one line and that would be ET with teeth. The film is set in small town America focusing around some young misfit teenagers who have stumbled across some mysterious happenings. The two main characters, Joe and Alice are both from non-standard families (Joe's father is the local cop and his mother recently died in a factory accident, while Alice's father is the local crook, and doesn't seem to have a mother). However Joe and his friends are making a horror film for a film competition, but the filming is interrupted by a train crash.<br/><br/>The film is set in the 80's, which is another reason why I call it ET with teeth, but the main reason is that it is because it is about an alien who simply wants to get home, but the US Airforce simply will not let it. The alien does have a number of allies who are trying to assist it, but it is simply angered at being treated like a zoo exhibit, and it's opinion of humanity is not very high.<br/><br/>However, the film focuses around the teens, and we only know what the teens know. Thus, they witness a train crash (and in turn try to incorporate it into their film) and then strange things begin to happen, which includes the US airforce turning up. It is interesting how the army is always portrayed (okay, not always, but often) as a secret organisation that has its own agenda, and this agenda is not always for the benefit of the population at large.<br/><br/>Hollywood's relationship with the army is spotted at best. There are a number of films (such at Top Gun) which is promotes the armed forces (and as such the armed forces bend over backwards to assist them) while others (such as Super 8) is not all that flattering. It seems that there is a love/hate relationship. In a way people want the army to protect their 'liberty' but this desire is sometimes in conflict with the wealthy elite using the army to protect their own ends. The United States has been reasonably lucky in its history in that it has actually have very few foreign attacks on it's soil. Since the revolution, there has been the war of 1812 (when the British invaded and burnt the White House down), the Civil War, Pearl Harbour, and 9/11. Most of the deployment however have been foreign interventions for various reasons.<br/><br/>However, I get beyond the scope of this review. As I said, this film ends rather soppily, but I guess that is what one can expect from such films. We spend most of the film wanting to know what happens, and while we are not guessing, we are hoping for something that we never expect, however, in most cases that simply does not happen. I guess, as the bible does say, 'there is nothing new under the sun'."

","Really captured the feeling of those early Spielberg family films - the constantly moving camera, soundtrack, setting, bunch of kids and subject matter were all spot on. Moreover, the story was told in a confident, self-assured way, which felt comfortable and nostalgic, yet still fresh - and not at all 'wannabe', which could have been a danger. Even the CGI was good.<br/><br/>There were one or two problems: the teenage daughter was way too hyper and unbelievable - in fact that whole family was too big and a tad underdeveloped - and some of the 'friendship' aspects of the storyline could have played out a little more (one of them in particular).<br/><br/>But those are relatively minor gripes, and the general feeling of the piece won me over.

","For baby boomers of the 60s, Super 8 is a nostalgic period piece that harks back to the early films of Spielberg. It's Close Encounters meets ET meets The Goonies but with an emotional heartbeat that lifts it above the usual summer blockbuster fare. The film begins with a bereavement which is an indication of its true intentions - a film about pain, loss, broken families and friendship - but wrapped around a fast paced story of an alien cover up that is both thrilling and humorous throughout. The spectacular early train crash, for example, must be seen and (especially) heard in IMAX format to be fully appreciated. The alien is well designed and pleasingly strange and unfamiliar. The three main child leads of Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths and Elle Fanning deliver pitch perfect performances and in the case of Fanning has shown that she is even more talented than her precocious older sister, Dakota Fanning. An early scene in which Fanning is 'acting' in the Super 8 film will leave you awestruck in wonderment. Overall, Super 8 is not just the film of the summer, it's the film of the year so far. Only a young Spielberg at the height of his powers could have matched it."

Even more, it is a 1980s Spielberg production, with the radiant light, sweeping orchestral score and plucky but fairly realistic children that distinguished many of his 80s films.<br/><br/>Pure popcorn entertainment, Super 8 efficiently delivers excitement, adventure and a smidgen of romance amidst aliens and untrustworthy military men. Emotions are touched lightly, but never deeply enough to halt the smooth flow of the movie.<br/><br/>The result is pleasantly familiar. It is a movie that I would have liked if I were still a teenager, but that I still totally connect with today (unlike a lot of movies about kids that are too flashy and modern to connect with an old fogey like me).<br/><br/>Is it a great movie? No. I wouldn't even say it was particularly memorable, and it certainly has all sorts of plot holes and inconsistencies. And yet, while I was watching it I was completely enjoying myself."

","""The Goonies"" (1985) meets both ""Close Encounters .."" (1977) and ""E.T."" (1982) in this retro movie set in the summer of 1979, a simpler time for kids when there were no personal computers or Internet but a fun way for five young Americans to pass the time in a quiet mid-western town was to shoot their own Super 8 movie. The three aforementioned films were all created in some way by Steven Spielberg (now 63) who is here executive producer and his ardent fan is the 45 year old J.J. Abrams who is both the writer and director, most men having cut their film-making teeth on the eponymous piece of technical equipment.<br/><br/>The narrative is soon enlivened by a spectacular train crash and nothing which follows quite compares to this terrific scene but it's all very entertaining if (deliberately) derivative. I don't think it is spoiling things too much to reveal that an alien is involved. Of course, in the world of Spielberg, aliens are basically benevolent; however, this is 2011 so we can't have a cute E.T. but his more aggressive features are explained by abusive treatment from the US military (not unknown around the world). As in ""Alien"", we gradually we more of the creature as the story unfolds but we never really understand the role of those white cube things.<br/><br/>A recurrent theme of Spielberg movies is the absent parent and here two of the leading child characters have missing mothers. In fact, this is a very male film with the female of the species being mysterious either by not being around or, in the case of the one girl in the group of movie makers Alice (Elle Fanning), by being able to drive, to act, and to empathise. It's no wonder that the pre-pubescent rivals for her affection - 'director' Charles (Riley Griffiths) and 'hero' Joe (Joel Courtney) - have their film in a twist over her.<br/><br/>This movie within a movie ends neatly when, during the credits, we seen the finished Super 8 movie with clever connections with the real/reel movie."
"bob the moo","Null","2","3","28 August 2011"," Gets the spirit of those throwback family sci-fi films just right, but takes the weaker aspects with it
","I'm not adding anything to the discussion by noting that Super 8 is deliberately and professionally a throwback to those family-friendly sci-fi films of the 80's. Explorers comes to mind, as does Flight of the Navigator and The Goonies. However, for as many people observing this, not enough of them appear to be happy to accept some of the weaknesses that Super 8 also carries forward into 2011. The story here is that a group of high-school students are making an amateur short film on a friend's super 8 camera when a massive crash occurs and they flee just as, for some reason, the military move in to take control. Shortly it transpires that ""something"" may have been in the train and is now loose in this small town community.<br/><br/>The set-up is classic and by choosing to set the film in this time period it works even better because it is able to be mostly free of modern cynicism or reference points and manages to capture a sort of image of childhood and small-town life that may never have existed but certainly a lot of people of my age will have already been sold on since we grew up on the films this one is referencing. In this regard I can understand why the main love for Super 8 appears to be from a certain age-group, not to suggest others do not enjoy it, but certainly the nostalgic sense of familiarity with the tone and approach did add a bit for me on my viewing. The gentle comic bantering between the characters is great stuff and it frames the film and provides enjoyment and colour around the sci-fi action.<br/><br/>This action is not quite as good but again it hearkens back to days where seeing the creature is less important than seeing what it does. It worked for me and I was more than happy to see the destruction played out in a teasing way as it was. Those expecting Cloverfield 2 though, will be disappointed as it is not that type of film. Although it is a throwback, it is impressive how well Abrams captures the spirit and content of these films of that period. I'm not a massive fan of his because at times he seems all about the hype of the moment rather than the lasting substance, but here he does a solid job. The downside of this is that he also captures the sentimentality and rather pat endings of these films. I accepted this as being a genre thing but the ending still is a little weak as a result. I also thought he overdid the lens-flare effect, it is a nice touch done sparingly but here it seems to be in almost every scene and it got on my nerves.<br/><br/>Overall though Super 8 is a great little throwback film that will play best with those of us of an age to no longer fancy another noisy and hollow effects films this summer but rather something that benefits from a nostalgic warmth. It does really well at catching this spirit and content and for that it deserves credit even if the downside is that it captures the weaknesses as well. Fun and engaging if you let yourself get in an 80's frame of reference."

","I really like Steven Spielbergs work, but when I saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull I really was a little bit disappointed. This whole alien-mother-ship-soaring-up-in-the-air at the end of the movie nearly threw me off the seat at the cinema. Well as it always does, some time passed and I saw the Super 8 trailer on IMDb and I just thought wow, this looks interesting. But then I saw that Spielberg was producing it and I could just think of another alien movie, that will disappoint me. Again. So it took me some weeks and a very convincing friend to get me into the cinema to see a movie with aliens in it. But what I can say, this reluctant attitude to this film, just made it absolutely work for me. From my point of view, Super 8 was one of the most convincing alien movies I've seen in a long time. It really caught me to my seat, nearly forgetting to breathe while I was covered in suspense.<br/><br/>I also doubted that this movie could be carried by some children, who were not even teenagers. But I have to say, they could have carried a much heavier load than this movie. I was fascinated by their acting from the first minute on. Everybody played their part and in my opinion they all did an amazing job. The passionate little film-maker who wants to do what it takes to get his movie done. The charming little lady who stuns everybody with her acting skills. The make-up artist in the middle of everything, although he is just a figure outside the frame. The funny guy who makes you laugh also when you think there is nothing to laugh about. And the Sheriff who is willing to take his life at risk, to safe his family and his town. For me, everything just fit together like a wonderful puzzle. It made me laugh, it scared me, it just caught me. Yes everything. Also this alien thing, that I was so sceptical about. But I'm not gonna reveal more than I've already said. Just watch this movie. You will not regret it. But if you do, I'm sorry. I didn't want to ruin your expectations. Mine were nearly none existent, but this movie really proved me wrong. Thank you mister Abrams and of course mister Spielberg too."
"a_chan","Null","2","3","22 August 2011"," Not just the film of the summer but the film of the year!
","For baby boomers of the 60s, Super 8 is a nostalgic period piece that harks back to the early films of Spielberg. It's Close Encounters meets ET meets The Goonies but with an emotional heartbeat that lifts it above usual summer blockbuster fare. The film begins with a bereavement which is an indication of its true intentions - a film about pain, loss, broken families and friendship - but wrapped around a fast paced story of an alien cover up that is both thrilling and humorous throughout. The spectacular early train crash, for example, must be seen and (especially) heard in IMAX format to be fully appreciated. The alien is well designed and pleasingly strange and unfamiliar. The three main child leads of Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths and Elle Fanning deliver pitch perfect performances and in the case of Fanning has shown that she is even more talented than her precocious older sister, Dakota Fanning. An early scene in which Fanning is 'acting' in the Super 8 film will leave you awestruck in wonderment. Overall, Super 8 is not just the film of the summer, it's the film of the year so far. Only a young Spielberg at the height of his powers could have matched it."

It's not as bad as some reviewers are implying - I have seen far worse! - but it is a bit clunky in places. <br/><br/>As with a lot of recent films the last act is rushed through trying to tie everything up as quickly as possible and therefore unravelling some of the good work laid down earlier. <br/><br/>It's an OK film. It does have a nostalgic feel, the kids are great in it and there are legitimate comparisons to The Goonies and ET but I didn't come out grinning or feeling ""wow, great movie!"".

","Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) is just a normal pre teen living in 1979. He and his friends have an affinity for Super 8 film making. However, everything starts to fall apart when an alien creature escapes from government captivity only to cause mass destruction during their filming. Joe, accompanied by a young cast, decide to continue making their film by using the disaster footage to their artistic advantage. Deep into the story, the alien abducts Joe's semi-love interest, Alice (played by Elle Fanning). This leaves Joe with a desire to come to her rescue. To me, this premise alone would have made for a great film but; the story progresses even further from there.<br/><br/>Joe recently lost his mother in an accident at the steel plant. Alice's father was supposed to be working that shift causing him to feel guilt and responsibility for the death of Mrs. Lamb. Tensions arise during the course of the story as Joe's father, Jackson (played by Friday Night Light's Kyle Chandler), urges his son to not have any communication with Alice or her father. The story has now made an outstanding turn: what seems to be a simple science fiction film ends up becoming an amazing story of redemption and forgiveness.<br/><br/>After viewing the IMAX version of this film, I was left breathless. This movie brings back everything that has been missing from movies in recent years. The moviegoer is truly given a sense of adventure that stands out in an amazing way. I believe that Abrams really brought back classic film making on this movie. I really don't think I have experienced a movie that is able to offer such a wide appeal and yet teaches a bold positive message. Also, the special effects blow just about blow away any other science fiction movie from recent years!

"Quebec_Dragon","8","2","3","24 July 2011"," Future modern classic for nostalgic Spielberg fans and newer viewers alike
","It's not for nothing I use apparently contradictory terms in the title. Super 8 is a throwback to those old Steven Spielberg's movies from the 70s/80s made with modern technology. It's not made by Spielberg (only produced) but it could have been made by him. The movie doesn't look old although it takes place in 1979. There's a palpable sense of nostalgia going on and we follow the tribulations of a group of film-making boys (and girl) as a spectacular and peculiar train crash changes their lives. It would be easy to reveal too much but I'll refrain myself. I hope myself that you know as little as possible before watching this.<br/><br/>I'll just say that there are fantastical elements including the main one that is rather scary but ambiguous. In fact, I loved how Super 8 harked back to the old school of thought that showing less is more. This could be frustrating, but it wasn't for me because the movie was directed so expertly. In fact, I think that style of directing built up the suspense. You often see the effects but not the cause. The sound effects (especially during the train crash) were amazing and would deserve some kind of award. The special effects were seamless and my disbelief was never suspended because they looked fake or computer-generated. The boys acted quite naturally but the blonde girl was a definite stand-out. In one of the best moments, she play-acts an awkwardly written scene for the boy's amateur film and she's so good, she not only moves the boys but the viewers. The adult actors are mostly stoic but they do their job.<br/><br/>The father-son relationship could have been a bit better as it didn't grab me very much. I loved how the story was told without sacrificing characterization. You're never lost and it just flows well. Kudos to the director J.J. Abrahms for doing such a stupendous job at recapturing the magic of the early Spielberg films. It does make us nostalgic in more ways than one, not only for that time period but for that kind of great film. I do also think that younger viewers will enjoy it, but it is rather scary in parts so it would be best for kids 10 and older. Lest I forget, besides the suspenseful moments, there's quite a bit of humour that makes us care about the characters or gives us a little breather. That Super 8 movie at the end is hilarious.<br/><br/>Rating: 8 out 10 (Very good)"
"PWNYCNY","8","2","3","23 June 2011"," The movie has its drawbacks but is watchable.
","The movie has a rocky start but then the story picks up steam. The problem with the movie are the child roles. Not only are they contrived caricatures of pre-adolescents, they are annoying caricatures, especially the one with the hardware in his mouth. Their presence almost destroys the movie. In fact, much of the story is contrived and a rehash of sci-fi formulas that were popular thirty years ago. Nevertheless, the movie does succeed in conveying a sense of suspense as, despite the movie's drawbacks, one wonders how the story will end. The acting is stilted, the dialog is at times ridiculous, the style of the movie pure 1970s, without it intending to be a parity, and the presence of the pre-adolescent caricatures embarrassing. Yet the movie survives to tell a story that is worthy of attention. This movie could have been better but then again it could have been a lot worse, so if it's not a classic at least it's not a joke. However, this movie deserves a rating of 8 out of 10 primarily because of closing credits into which are inserted two popular upbeat songs from the 1970s and an actual 8 mm film clip. It's just too bad that more of the movie was not so innovative."

","I'd hate to say this but this was the first JJ Abrams movie I watched. I don't feel so very lucky now.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was very mediocre and never stopped feeling like it could've just been bigger than how it already was. And when I bring up exaggerating, I mean by how mediocre movies in general really make me upset.<br/><br/>It's the same movie you've seen before, like ET which seems to be the most common comparison. I'd like to include Flight of the Navigator too, even if this movie isn't similar at all in terms of plot, but the same basic ideas are there: kid(s), alien(s), spaceship(s), government, etc. I see what they were trying to do, which is make a modern kid-alien movie, but it just doesn't work. We already have these movies and I don't know anybody who still breathes who needs another movie like this--it's unnecessary.<br/><br/>Unnecessary is a good word to use for a lot of things in this movie too, like a few of the characters that annoy me. People say the characters are the best part but their mediocrity in terms of how they were written bug me. Like, the female lead I can't help but feel like she has NO other reason to be there other than some *thing* for the main character to chase and I am so fed up with those kind of stories. I just can't be emotionally invested into it. I get it, I get why the kid wants to be with her and wants to be her friend and how their families have troubles but that's exactly why I don't care: it's all shoe-horned in. I feel like they just made up reasons just for the sake of making up reasons for these characters to connect. It's forced and really awkward.<br/><br/>I hate how this movie has an overload of clichés in it that really break the immersion of it. Like, I've SEEN the male child and father argue before because of over protection, I've SEEN young romance, I've SEEN aliens (which is just a tentacled monster, whoop-hee) interact with kids, I've SEEN the fat kid no one cares about get angry because his friend has the girl (by the way, what DOES that amount to? The whole subplot is entirely pointless and goes nowhere, not to mention I don't feel bad for the chubby kid at all). I've seen it all already and it's gotten very tiresome.<br/><br/>The ending especially annoyed me. There are a bunch of captured people hanging in the alien's lair. Why? Why did he keep them there? Why did he kill anybody? Because he's scared? Okay, that's fine, but why didn't they ever help the other people that were hung? Here's why it's so jarring when I see the main character save the girl, because I just wish it were something I could be emotionally invested in like if instead of some GIRL it'd be his brother who'd probably be hurt too by the loss of his mother, causing mixed feelings with the main character, now that'd be interesting. But no, he saves the chick, who cares, and then the alien gets inside his ship and the absolute worst moment of the movie is when the main kid's locket of his mother (never seen that before, wow!) is slipping through his fingers and about to be connected to the alien ship. And get this, this is the last thing that flies into the ship before it takes off, THAT ticked me off.<br/><br/>I get it, the ending is symbolizing he's letting go of his mother, but in such a cliché way that I can't feel any connection to it whatsoever, and this is coming from a guy who lost his mother as well. But it BEGS the question, did the alien spaceship really need that last trinket to finish itself? Really? Or no, is it just special coincidence? Either way, it's BS to me. They could've handled that so much better.<br/><br/>And then when the credits roll, it just raises MORE questions. What about the government officials still going after the alien after it escapes? What? Did they just let everybody back in town and tell the main characters to GO HOME? Wouldn't they question them and wouldn't there be a possibility of their lives spiraling downward now that they had such huge involvement with the alien? Probably not, because they'd probably come up with a cliché for that too if asked up front about it.<br/><br/>You may think I HATE this movie, but I don't. I only HATE how frustratingly mediocre it is and especially how I can't feel literally a single solitary connection to any of the connections themselves they're trying to give out to the viewer. A modern kid-alien movie, it is not. A movie trying to be a kid-alien movie that's modern, it is. It's sad because afterwords I saw Star Trek by JJ and while it didn't touch me emotionally (especially since I don't like Star Trek, at all), I thought it was a good movie. This makes me worry still about how Star Wars 7 is going to turn out. Do I worry that Star Wars 7 is going to be bad? Not at all, I'm worried that it's going to be a MEDIOCRE Star Wars movie.<br/><br/>If anything, it's a harmless movie, I guess. It's good for kids, but being an adult that LOVES movies like Flight of the Navigator (sorry to bring that up again), that's saying a lot. If you're nit-picky like me, you'll probably not like this movie at all. But if you're young, then maybe you'll get some enjoyment out of it, which I still don't think is a great thing because then you'll get older and realize how not great it really is.<br/><br/>I never heard of Super 8 until this year (2014) and I can see why."

The place on screen looks nothing like that, of course, since they shot it about 2 hours from there.<br/><br/>There was plenty of personal interaction and it seems genuine, believable.

And these are characters I did care about. That is to say, white people. Heh, I'm joking, of course. No, I mean they're kids with personalities and creativity and relatable problems and aspirations. Yes, the film isn't very original. It wears its influences (GOONIES, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, E.T., and so forth) proudly on its sleeve and there's probably nothing here you haven't seen before. I mean, good lord, if I never see another ""shadowy military conspiracy"" plot again it'll be too soon. And for fuck's sake, Abrams, lay off the lens flares. It's incredibly distracting once you start noticing it. But the movie is very entertaining, with pacing that rarely feels too sluggish or too fast, engaging action scenes, a pretty good sense of humor, and some skillfully prepared character moments. The cast of kids is quite likable... even the little pyro who irritated me at first eventually won me over.

Yes it is about a group of kids and you can see Spielberg's camera touch but that is where the similarity ends. It's a great show but a lot different. Watch this with only the expectation of seeing some kids trying to deal with some serious life issues and coming upon an unexpected event in the midst of it.

","I will be honest. First time I saw this, I absolutely LOVED the movie up until the conclusion. It was an awesome movie, complete with jump-out-of-your seats moment and suspense, coupled with a good dose of nostalgia and comic relief. I have nothing to complain about this part of the movie. It is flawless. The first part is good enough to earn a rating of 8 from me, which seems appropriate enough... I will not talk about it, lest I ruin the amazingness for someone. <br/><br/>And now comes the ending...<br/><br/>Now, I appreciate an action movie ending on a softer note...it can be very refreshing and original, unlike the heart-stopping action packed conclusion one finds (though, I am not opposed to them...I just like a little calm now and then.) I was pleased when it became apparent that there would be no mass shoot out between the alien and soldiers. Such a ending was appropriate for this film. Yet...there came the unexpected...which I should had expected coming from the duo of Abrams and Spielberg...<br/><br/>We were suppose to feel sorry for the alien.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, I can't bring myself to do so. Even after buying this movie and viewing it again, I cannot. As the kids come to the realization that it is ""sad"" and ""only wants to go home,"" all I can picture in my brain is the shot where it's chowing down on that person's leg, or the multiple scenes it ate innocent civilians. Whoa...did I miss something? Did being sad and homesick make up for the crime of killing God knows how many people? <br/><br/>Is it likely that kids, in real life, would come to this conclusion? I believe not. This is not the cutsie E.T. with his glowing finger. This is a giant alien with a taste for human flesh. I would accept a simple ending with the alien escaping, perhaps looking dramatically down at the world as it take off into the sky, vowing revenge or some other nonsense as the kids look on with relief, glad to have escaped the man-eating alien. <br/><br/>The messages Abrams intended are clear. Not everyone is as they seem, everyone deserves to be treated good, and so on. Yet these messages just don't click when the subject of these themes eats half the town. <br/><br/>Overall, this ending is a perfect reminder of why I made that promise to hate all of J.J. Abrams work since he destroyed my favorite TV show as a child (a certain TV show about trekking about the stars...) Super 8 had an amazing beginning, and my expectations were raised tremendously, yet they fell with the concluding scenes.<br/><br/>Oh...on a side note rant...why the heck would the teacher release the alien so near to his town???? He obviously new the alien was dangerous and hated people, as revealed by his tapes...did he really not think that the alien would destroy his home town and eat everyone? Perhaps even his own students? Personally, if I were in this situation, I might perhaps, oh, I don't know...crash my car into the train in a more isolated location. It's not like roads only cross train tracks at train stations. But, who knows! Perhaps he was sick of his town and wanted this to happen. Heck he probably gave the alien a list of names for him to take out...but, in all seriousness, this strange plot twist really confuses me...<br/><br/>*a minute after writing this review, I changed my rating to a 7, which is much more accurate depiction of my view of the movie as a whole"

Other than that mis-step, this was pretty good.<br/><br/>However, if you are a Kyle Chandler fan, and I am, this is not his movie. The movie belongs to Elle Fanning as Alice and to Joel Courtney as Joe Lamb and the other kids who all performed well. Chandler is Jackson Lamb the town's deputy and he was excellent. He was at wits end trying to figure out what was happening in the town with people, dogs, power lines, car engines and microwaves disappearing; and he could get no answers from the military who had taken over the town. <br/><br/>Elle Fanning is becoming a major force in movies. Look out Dakota.<br/><br/>The CGI, cinematography and dialogues were all good. That train derailment was spectacular. <br/><br/>Near the end of the movie there was a bit of a continuity problem. The kids are in the underground cave and trying to get out, and the next scene has them on the main street of the town watching a space ship being built by the alien. Oh, you didn't know an alien was involved? Now you do. Not a big mystery here and you will have figured that out early on anyway. And, the promos seemed to give that away.<br/><br/>Stay while the credits run and you will see the Super 8 movie the kids made. It lasts a couple minutes and is rough but funny. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb and some S-words"

","Ir's hard to rate this movie, because it's not like most films I watch. I really enjoyed the stupid conversations and fighting of the group of kids, but I did get annoyed with them from time to time. There was a great deal of adventure and lust to find out what exactly is going on and what was on the train. The panic and naive nature of many ""uninformed"" characters definitely provided suspense. The sound design was spot on though - and it was rightfully given a ""Dolby True HD 7.1"" channel audio track to entertain its listeners with. I am more of a ""DTS-HD Master Audio"" fan, but Dolby was fine.<br/><br/>The quality of acting and nature of the kids makes me believe that this movie was marketed towards perhaps a younger age group. It's not that I don't have an imagination, it was the acting and the cheap CGI that the monster was made of. This was not directed by Steven Spielberg, and I could tell. It was just produced. He did have some of his own blood on it, and was still entertaining, but it was some ""Holy Crap!"" Jurassic Park film. I felt the CG monster was so detached from the characters and rest of the world that it was just not believable. Unfortunately, this affected my watching experience.<br/><br/>I do think this movie was way over rated when being advertised. For me, it did not live up to it's hype. When I found out what the monster wanted, it was rather let down. Though it was over rated, I still enjoyed watching it. I don't think it's a movie to go on my shelf, but definitely an entertaining Friday night flick."

","Super 8 is a fantastic combination of two wonderful creative minds, that of J J Abrams and Steven Spielberg, and although the ending is slightly questionable, overall this movie is enjoyable.<br/><br/>The narrative is set in a small town in Ohio. It's 1979 and Joe Lamb is trying to cope with the recent death of his mother. Led by his best friend Charles, Joe and the rest of his friends immerse themselves into creating a horror film. On the night of their first big film shoot, they witness a train crash and pretty soon, the small town in which they live becomes taken over by a military presence, and what is actually happening in the town remains a mystery.<br/><br/>Super 8 contains all the elements needed to be successful; it is emotional, funny, and thrilling. Lets not forget also the presence of the unknown 'monster,' which is lurking nearby. The characters are believable and portray a certain innocence. One other important factor is that they have chemistry, which is not all too familiar from that in The Goonies. As a member of the audience you can fully engage with the characters, and not to mention the budding romance between Joe and Alice. There are also some amazing sequences; my favourite being that of the train collision. I thought it was truly breathtaking the way it was put together and the CGI is done to perfection.<br/><br/>This film kept me very entertained, mainly due to its solid direction, accomplished performances and exceptional screenplay. Unfortunately, they just didn't seem to be able pull all of the plots elements together, which led to flat ending. Questions are left unanswered and the movie has a sudden ending, after building up to a heightened finale.<br/><br/>Super 8 can definitely be seen as a tribute to the classic films directed or produced by Steven Spielberg, in which normal life was contrasted with some unprecedented phenomenon, which usually is explored through the eyes of kids. There may not be anything original about Super 8, but this movie brings you back to the good old classic times. If you enjoyed ET, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The Goonies, or in fact Cloverfield then you should definitely give it a watch."

","If you dive deeper into the reviews for this film, you'll find an extraneous amount of people who like to bash this film for the comparisons to E.T.. While I do agree, that there are some minimal comparisons, it is not the same movie, by any means. If you drop the idea that this was produced by Spielberg, you can take into account; the throwbacks to classic Sci-fi/Horror films of the 50's. It's like a B-movie with a larger budget, if that makes sense. The atmosphere is dramatic and brooding, and the lingering tension is just riveting. With that said, the creature is nothing special to look forward to(typical Abrams), and the recurring archetypes are sort of gimmicky, but it still holds up brilliantly, nonetheless. Is it campy? Sure. But it's a fantastic specimen of a tribute that immerses you within the imaginative, yet classically submissive setting of the classic Science Fiction theater. So, the complaining about E.T. should stop sometime soon, because this film is great."

","J.J. Abrams directs this loving mash-up of 80s sci-fi adventure films, notably the Amblin stable films, with a slightly darker, modern touch as shown by Spielberg himself in his War of the Worlds. All the reviews so far have given Spielberg as the touchstone, but to me the underrated Joe Dante springs to mind rather more. Unlike Spielberg, Abrams uses his top notch, if overly bombastic, effects sequences to shock and awe in their predictable visceral impact, rather than create that sense of original wonder. <br/><br/>Despite Abrams crow-barring an unearned, sentimental moment between kid and the ugly, violent ET, the heart of this film is not the relationship with the alien, here teasingly glimpsed as a Cloverfield type monster, or even the perfunctory broken family subplots but between the kids themselves. A squabbling, Goonies-style dynamic is the films ace, further enhanced and complicated by the inclusion of Fanning's strong female character, a rarity in this sub-genre, provoking puppy love, jealousy and naive heroism to the usual boy's own adventures. The filmmaking project also brings some comic highlights, as Charles opportunistically shoots the threatening military personnel and the train wreckage for added ""production value!"". The film within a film (shot by the actual teen cast) plays over the credits and is a great outro. <br/><br/>The fun that Abrams has channelling Spielberg does come across, but to me this just further proves just how great the master is and how enthusiasm, technique and a big budget will never beat a warm, genuine heart and perfect storytelling. This is both a director and a film trying hard to please resulting in a visual spectacle which entertains but soon fades, whilst the films it is in love with still feel beautifully effortless all these years later."

","It has been almost a year since this movie came out, hard to believe isn't it, I can still remember the hype, everyone going crazy about how much they were looking forward to the film. Yet after it finally came out, it seems that so many people were disappointed with the film. Sure it has good reviews, but look up the film on IMDb, look at the featured review, I guarantee it will most likely be someone saying it sucked, or was only OK. Well unlike so many other people, I absolutely loved this movie.<br/><br/>From what I get, a lot of people were disappointed was because it was too similar to other movies like E.T. and the Goonies. Um, yeah, that was the point. The movie was supposed to be like an 80's Spielberg movie.<br/><br/>The film was directed by J.J. Abrams, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite filmmakers. I enjoyed Mission Impossible 3, he produced Cloverfield, one of my favorite movies, and while Star Trek put me to sleep, it looked like he did a good job from what I saw of it. Super 8 looks fantastic, homaging classic Spielberg while also having Abram's own style. The child actors were all fantastic, they didn't seem like actors, they seemed like real kids, and created some funny and memorable characters, my favorite being Charlie.<br/><br/>The effects are top notch, some might complain that there is too much CGI, but come on guys, this was 2011, be happy there are any practical effects. The train derailment was so overblown that it was awesome. And the production value was fantastic, I was born in the 90's, so I can't speak from experience, but I always believed that they were in 1979.<br/><br/>It's hilarious, especially the kid who has an unhealthy obsession with explosives. The diologue is great, the kids swear, like, you know, KIDS. My brother is 12 and he swears more than I do. But the film is also really scary at times. I jumped quite a bit. Which brings me to the sound. I have never thought more about Sound Mixing more than in this movie (Why wasn't this movie nominated for any Oscars?) I had only one big problem with this movie, and that was the ending. The last seven minutes aren't really bad, but it seems the writer didn't know how to end it. I won't spoil anything, but some things just don't make sense.<br/><br/>Super 8 was a great movie, it seems quite a lot of people were disappointed with it, but personally with the exception of the last seven minutes or so, I was completely satisfied.<br/><br/>9/10 Very Mint!!!"
"slimkat87","8","1","1","7 August 2011"," Good but not what I expected...!
","Since seeing the trailer for this months ago, I have been waiting with pure excitement to go and see it! I'm a huge fan of all of Speilbergs films and when I heard he had a say in this film, I couldn't wait! Unfortunately this did fall a little short!<br/><br/>I have to admit, after seeing trailers, I went in to this film thinking it would be 'E.T / Close Encounters' type film; Set in a the late 70's early 80's, child cast, suburban location, alien etc etc. It was close but not what I expected it to be.<br/><br/>The child cast do well to carry the film. The rest of the cast are almost left out and have no depth. I know the aim of the film is to be about the children but I would like to have heard more from Officer Lamb, the only adult that really has any screen time! <br/><br/>Overall the film is good. The alien was completely unexpected. As I mentioned before, I thought the alien would be typical 'little green man'...how wrong could I have been. At first I thought it was a giant spider, until we saw it in all it's glory. The special effects were brilliant especially the train crash and I have to admit, I did jump quite a lot during the film as things had a habit if loudly crashing, banging etc etc!!<br/><br/>I didn't feel this film was magical and didn't have the innocence of other alien films we have come to love and, although I enjoyed it, I won't be rushing to buy it on DVD.<br/><br/>Final words I would say, check it out but go in with an open mind. Don't make my mistake and think it will be an 'E.T' for a new generation."
"paul_haakonsen","5","1","1","6 August 2011"," Just another CGI treat without a solid story.
","The trailers for this movie initially made me watch it, and I had high expectations to the movie, given the facts that it was Abrams and Spielberg who made the movie. And now that I have seen the movie I am left with a bit of a hollow sensation.<br/><br/>Sure the movie was awesome in special effects and CGIs, nothing spared here, and it was an interesting thrill ride to watch. However, the story in itself was a tad too much of something that you have seen before. Think ""The Goonies"", ""E.T."" and ""Battle Los Angeles"", then you pretty much have the end result that is ""Super 8"". I am sure this movie can be watched by people of all ages, but I am left with a nagging sensation that it was perhaps intended for a younger audience.<br/><br/>The story is about some kind of alien creature stranded on Earth, being experimented on by the American army, and all he wants to do is just to go home. Gee, haven't we seen this before? Say, in ""Paul"" to mention but a single movie. And of course someone wants to help the creature to go home. And a handful of young movie making teenagers are caught in the midst of the chaotic events, as is the peaceful town of Lilian. This is basically the story.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about the movie was that a lot of it was shot during night or in really dark conditions, hiding most of the alien creature in most shots. I don't want to watch a movie like that, I prefer to see the details, not just given dark silhouettes and having to guess my way to the rest. So for me, this overall dark setting of the movie was dragging the enjoyment down quite a lot.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie was good, both from the adult actors and actresses, as well as the young ones.<br/><br/>I am sad to say that this movie is just yet another movie that lives high on CGI effects, dazzling and thralling us with its effects, such as movies like ""Skyline"" and ""Monsters"". It was lacking depth and a more solid foundation for its storyline. Everything here was just a remake of things seen before in other movies already.<br/><br/>However, I am sure that ""Super 8"" will captivate and spellbind a large group of young viewers, in the same way that ""E.T."" did back in the day when I was a young kid. I was just hoping for a bit more..."

The suspense of the movie is extreme at some points and the sound effects make it even intense.<br/><br/>Performance by the entire cast is OK and the script/dialogue/story is pretty genuine and the movie looks like very REAL and you are compelled to believe it.<br/><br/>Cinematography is another very positive point of the movie and the scenes really take you 30 years back.Original Score is nice too.<br/><br/>IMO the movie will enjoy excellent critic/public/award response this year. and business will be good as well.<br/><br/>9/10."
"moviewizguy","8","5","12","11 June 2011"," Next Summer, It Arrives.
","Unlike many recent movie trailers where the marketers think it's a fantastic idea to spoil 97.6% of a film in its trailer, SUPER 8's marketing has been really old school. The trailers have been really mysterious, relying on intrigue to get the movie goers' butts in the theater seats, which help both the cases of the film and the movie goers because SUPER 8 is one of those films where you want to see it with knowing as little information about the film as possible. The mystery is what makes viewing SUPER 8 fun and exciting. And I have to say, SUPER 8 is one of the most joyous experiences I've ever had in a theater! THIS is how you make a great summer film.<br/><br/>Saying that, what distinguishes SUPER 8 from most summer blockbusters (or contemporary films altogether) is this: The film tells a story in which we care for the characters in it. Sure, you can have explosions exploding every minute and add as many car chases as you want, but it's nothing if the audience doesn't care for the characters trying to survive or succeed their goal by the end of the film. I mean, that's what distinguishes good films from bad films, isn't it? The film is also masterfully told by director JJ Abrams revealing bits and pieces of the mystery at a time until the third act in which all is solved. And to top it off, the film also has pitch perfect pacing. Oh, and let's not forget about Michael Giacchino's excellent score. He really doesn't disappoint us here.<br/><br/>While watching SUPER 8, one gets the feeling of many early Steven Spielberg 1980s classics. This is no coincidence seeing that JJ Abrams wanted to make a film as a homage of all the films he loved seeing when he was a kid, which may include ET, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, and STAND BY ME. And no, SUPER 8 doesn't reek of overly affection of the films that homage evolves to blatant copying. They're noticeable but subtle enough that they aren't a distraction. Abram's affection for these films also bring a sense of nostalgia (""the good ol' days"") and innocence, which is enhanced by having kids be the focus of the film. There's something genuine and heartfelt about SUPER 8 that many other films don't have, and it's Abram's love for filmmaking that makes SUPER 8 feel really human.<br/><br/>It's obvious when I say that the young actors did a terrific job in here. Every single one of them were wisely chosen, including the film's protagonist, played by Joel Courtney. Even though this is his first film, you wouldn't think that when you see SUPER 8. He's perfectly casted, providing emotional depth to his character, and he's capable of carrying the film on his shoulders. There's also Elle Fanning, the sister of the more well known Dakota Fanning, and she acts well alongside Courtney. Ryan Lee is a scene stealer, providing some of the film's biggest laughs. And yes, there are a lot of laughs in the film. Riley Griffiths is also up to the task, with SUPER 8 also being his first film. The last two kids in the group, Gabriel Basso and Zach Mills, aren't as prominent, but they're just as good as the rest of the gang. Kyle Chandler, one of the very few adult actors that has some screen time, is pretty good as well.<br/><br/>Overall, SUPER 8 provides an ORIGINAL(!!) emotional story, great performances by the young actors, an exciting sense of adventure, and exhilarating action scenes, resulting in one of the best feelings I've had in a movie theater and one of the best films I've ever seen. Director JJ Abrams has done it again, giving people another reason why he's one of the best new directors to look out for. EVERYONE should go out and watch SUPER 8 if you like great films. Also, stay during the end credits for a great surprise. 9.5/10"

","If you haven't seen it yet, don't be fooled by the trailers or TV spots. It's not about the 'thing'. That's why 'Super 8' let me down in the well established subplot. The mystery that had the most hype around it was let down by an ending that was rushed and didn't match the superb, first three quarters. Then again, though this subplot of the story was the most focused on, that didn't matter, cause there were so many other things to love about this throwback to old Spielberg.<br/><br/>The characters were well developed throughout the entire film. Joel Courtney, who plays the protagonist Joe, had never acted before. And look at the performance he put up! The real star however is Elle Fanning, who plays Alice. She does tremendously within the diversity of the film. The other children and Kyle Chandler, who plays Joe's father Jackson, were all fantastic too. The contribution of these actors who are not so high profile was a highlight of this movie.<br/><br/>Aside from the monster and blowing up of crap, what I adored was adventure, something that every kid wanted back when there wasn't Call of Duty. The story of the protagonists provokes great memories that we all had. Also, there is a human element that is delivered through Joe and Jackson's point of view. Which I wouldn't want to spoil.<br/><br/>Finally, don't let the ending get you down. Super 8 does in fact lives up to its anticipated monster mayhem. The attacks were extremely frightening, especially the intense bus scene. We cannot forget the stunning, unforgettable train crash that is by far the greatest action sequence this year.<br/><br/>Overall, this film started off like a masterpiece, but you should have particular expectations in order to enjoy it for all it has.<br/><br/>Be prepared for a scary, funny, touching, action-packed movie that will make you feel young all over again. Super 8 proves to be the best film this summer."

","From J.J. Abrams, the man who brought us the labyrinth TV show ""Lost"" and the superbly revamped Star Trek, comes the sort of adventure that Spielberg would've made in his early days. It's not surprising then that the legendary filmmaker was a producer on Super 8 as well as someone who Abrams admits was a massive influence not only on this film, but his whole career. Following a group of teenaged mates in small town America in '79 who are trying to make a DIY zombie flick but become embroiled in a military operation gone astray, Super 8 is scary, humorous, affecting, adrenaline-pumping and poignant, whilst boasting an absolute bucket-load of heart. Abrams' meticulously selected youthful cast are pitch-perfect too, all of them balancing naivety and strength with measured care.

Terrific small-town '70s setting and wonderfully driven dialogue that meshes surprisingly well with the large amount of action. However, aside from the annoyance of dragging on way too long, the most fatal flaw of this thriller is the lack of foreshadowing. When a story builds its suspense on twist after twist like it's a game of Jenga, rather than strategizing a complex conflict to bring everything full circle, really does a film injustice.

"Lifexinxrewind","10","4","9","13 June 2011"," Best movie of 2011 so far!
","""Super 8"" is the movie they used to make back in ""the good old days."" Back when special effects were creatively used to serve the story and characters, not just there to cover the screen and show off the latest tech. Back when kids in films would act like real people without being over-simplified and dumbed-down. Back when films were made seemingly to grab at your imagination, not just make a quick buck. In an era of the endless sequel/retread/reboot/prequel/cash-in, Super 8 arrives like a breeze on a warm day. It is the greatest homage to classic 70's and 80's sci fi adventure that has been attempted. It is for all of us that grew up on films like E.T, Close Encounters, The Goonies, and Stand By Me. It is for anyone that saw a Steven Spielberg film and was moved by the sense of wonder he brought to them, the way I was the first time I saw movies like Jurassic Park, Jaws, or Back to the Future. It is for all of us that appreciate the art of film making. And in glorious two dimensions to boot.<br/><br/>I've gotten this far without mentioning who is behind all of this. Super 8 was written and directed by JJ Abrams (director of 2009's Star Trek and Mission:Impossible 3, producer of Cloverfield, and creator of shows such as Lost and Fringe), and it should come as no surprise to find that Steven Spielberg himself was the producer. Abrams has clearly always had a love for Spielberg's work, and the passion with which he creates this tribute is clear from the start. He inserts references to almost all of Steven's trademarks, taking elements from those famous films and expertly crafting the film to play as familiar but never ripped-off or copied. It's more the sense of adventure and mystery that he owes to the original films than the actual story. Sure, some cynics may disagree, but I never felt like I was watching a movie I had seen before. Similar feelings and themes were invoked, but I was never less than enthralled with what would happen next.<br/><br/>Super 8 bases much of it's humor and young group of friends dynamic off of what we loved in The Goonies and Stand by Me. I was surprised and impressed with just how funny the dialog and banter is. There was numerous one-liners that had my group of friends cracking up and repeating them afterward. Even in the midst of intense action, Abrams manages to sneak in some great humor without it feeling forced or contrived. Abrams recognizes that without these well-rounded and endearing characters, all the special effects in the world are meaningless. Sure, they look great (alright, I admit the opening train sequence is pretty ridiculous), but what makes everything work is we really do care about these characters and we are eager to see how they overcome their obstacles.<br/><br/>It's no accident that the plot starts off with the kids trying to shoot their own movie. Abrams bases the story in the late 70's, and we are immediately treated to a wondrous sequence that gives us a taste of their lives while setting up an effective atmosphere. And for those that are wondering, Super 8 gets its name from the young wanna-be film makers in the actual story, trying to shoot their movie on Super 8 film, like so many did in those days. It isn't long before the big mystery begins, and the way it unravels will be no shock to Abrams' veterans. He wisely believes in the idea of less-is-more, and waits to tie everything together. Of couse, I'd be lying if I said there was some huge twist that will blow your mind. That's not the point or goal. In that regard, it comes off well because the motivations for everyone (no, I'm not going to spoil everything this movie is about, you can go elsewhere if you insist on that) are so believable. There wasn't any point where I got frustrated at a lack of understanding. Not everything needs to be explained thoroughly, what matters is that we know what's going on and essentially why. When a film has multiple layers and stories, it can be a burden for some to keep up with it. This was a problem for some when viewing LOST, and although Super 8 is hardly as complex, the same rules apply.<br/><br/>In the end, Super 8 is a great time at the movies, in every way a great time at the movies should be. It entertains first and formost, but features undeniable humor, a fun mystery, fresh performances, and a feeling that I have not felt since I grew up with all those films Abrams' carefully emulates. The nostalgia factor may have been a big part, but I don't care. As one review so astutely put it, ""It's a great thing to see a motion picture spectacle that does not require a temporary lobotomy for gratification."" An easy front-runner for best movie of 2011, Super 8 is an enjoyable adventure for all but the biggest cynics. 9/10"
"papciakm","6","4","9","11 June 2011"," A film with great potential falls well short
","I have just gotten home from a trip to the theatre. Me and a few friends decided on Super 8. What appealed to me most about this film is that it was very mysterious, and I myself had only seen 1 trailer on it. I prefer to go into a movie knowing nothing about it, so I have no expectations.<br/><br/>For about 100 minutes, I thought the film was fantastic. The old-school style of filming really hooked me in. The children in this movie, I must say, were fantastic actors for their age and the genre. Charles, the director of the children's zombie movie, seemed to satirize a bossy director who always wanted things differently. The quiet boy Joe, with a crush, and their relationship was great, as well as the rest of the young actors relationships (until the end, I'll get to that).<br/><br/>I also enjoyed that there was a parallel storyline going on, so the viewer could see the story from an adults and child's point of view. It kept me guessing throughout the film. The suspense, the build up, was mostly perfect, keeping my friends and I on the edge of our seats. That was a spoiler-less summation of the first 100 minutes.<br/><br/>I only wanted to write this review based on what happened after this 100 minutes.<br/><br/>Now, after this 100 minute mark, the movie was concluding. Quickly. VERY quickly. To me, and many other people, it seemed as though JJ Abrams had to sum up the movie as quickly as he could, which was where the 'actual' train wreck began.<br/><br/>So after this 100 minute mark, young Joe is having a conversation with another character. After this short conversation, the 2nd character leaves, and Joe and 2 of his friends do as well, into town. They go completely unnoticed by anyone else, which I thought was very odd. As they, along with everyone around them, watch the scene take place, the movie attempts to sum itself up. To avoid spoilers, I will have to leave it at that.<br/><br/>Basically the movie was going in a direction with a lot of build up, as most movies do, and then the build up died. The climax was forgotten, and the entire movie fell apart. Had the filmmakers decided to lengthen the film and try to gradually end it, I would not be so upset. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Also, the ending had nothing to do with the rest of the film, and instead the solution came from almost out of the blue.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the film 'Super 8' had the potential to be fantastic. It was humorous, suspenseful, and mysterious. But when it came down to the final minutes, the filmmakers didn't deliver. All of the conflicts in the film were summed up so quickly, the build up seemed pointless entirely. You impressed me, Mr. Abrams, and yet my impression quickly faded away with your terrible ending I give this film a 6 out of 10. Had the final 12 minutes been different, I believe it could have been worthy of a spot in the top 250.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading everyone."
"debali","10","4","9","11 June 2011"," Great Movie
","This will definitely become one of the surprise hit of summer, 20011. I haven't had so much fun watching a film since first seeing Close Encounters. Although, the movie's title can be quiet misleading, the film itself is a masterpiece. Totally fun, exciting, adventurous, and thrilling. The special effects are mind-blowing, the kid's characters were believable, and the script was written to kept even the most calm natured, on the edge of their seats. The movie is actually a story within a story, but it never loses its sense of reality blended in a very science fictional plot. It's early seventies setting has a sort of magical effect on the senses, a walk down memory lane with some of the hit songs played in the background. Do not cheat yourself. This is a must film for the whole family to see."
"sofiw_26","10","4","9","10 June 2011"," A perfect movie
","I loved this movie. It reminded me quite a lot of Spielberg's early work especially of E.T. I thought JJ's work as a director and writer was terrific. In my opinion the movie was quite balanced which makes it appealing to people from all ages. I thought the subjects of friendship, family and love were handled perfectly. In this movie of science fiction, aliens and some incredible special effects, I found the perfect representation of that moment in life when your life changes in the case of this movie the first crush you ever have, the moment when you stop being a kid. I think that JJ and Spielberg know how to work together, I really do hope they do something else in the future. With what Hollywood has become this past years, it is hard to find a truly good movie, the kind that stays with you and reminds you why you loved films in the first place, this is one of those movies. I often watch older movies such as Indiana Jones or Back to the Future and I ask myself, why don't they do them this good anymore? Today seeing Super 8 I found a movie that is just that, an original movie as good as those from past years, I am positive it will become a classic."
"nateflex11","10","4","9","10 June 2011"," Super 8 is this year's Inception
","Super 8 was an excellent movie. It's not your typical alien movie where some monster runs around blowing crap up, this one actually has a story. I think that J. J. Abrams is getting better and better. His Star Trek reboot was an instant classic and he did a FANTASTIC job with this film. Steven Spielberg was outstanding as usual. This movie doesn't have star power, but part of what made this film work was the chemistry between the cast members (particulary between Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning). The cast members in this film are incredibly talented. So if you add J. J. Abrams plus Steven Spielberg, plus a good plot, script, special effects and cast, what do you get?.......A Truly OUTSTANDING FILM. Did I mention that this film is mysterious, action packed, dramatic, sometimes scary, and funny? All of these components add up to make this worthwhile and very entertaining. This movie is this year's Inception, and that means its AMAZING."
"alain-leccia","10","3","6","31 August 2012"," Super 8, a masterpiece.
","Super 8 is really amazing! It's one of the greatest movie ever and seriously, just the teaser show you the intelligence of J.J. Abrams and how this story will be. When I watched the teaser for the first time, I didn't really understand that it was about Super 8, the film format. But when I saw the beginning of the movie, I understood this story. Maybe because I was 14 like the characters and I was making super 8 movies, I really loved this story but I think it's something more popular. The movie is about a destroyed family. The son was really loving his mom but this one died so he's now with the parent he didn't prefer and who doesn't understand his son. That's about that actually, and seriously, I'm sure that this movie is the most important for J.J. Abrams because that's his life (without the monster i hope). And all the persons who worked with him on that movie had this life too. To me, it's a masterpiece and you can say that this movie isn't interesting, that the end is weird or anything you want, I will love this story forever because it's true and real. If you didn't watch this movie, watch it now because you'll see that it will be a great journey and that after this, the entertainment won't mean the same thing for you. Thank you J.J. Abrams for that story you gave us."

","Super 8 is written and directed by J. J. Abrams. It stars Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, Kyle Chandler, Ron Eldard and Riley Griffiths. Music is scored by Michael Giacchino and cinematography by Larry Fong. The film tells the story of a group of young teenagers in Lillian, Ohio, 1979, who are filming their own Super 8 zombie movie when a train derails and crashes, releasing an unknown being into their midst. As the town is threatened and mysteries start to mount up, the youngsters must come to terms with not only that, but also growing up mentally and physically.<br/><br/>It's feels nigh on impossible to come across a review for Super 8 that doesn't contain the name Spielberg. With the film overtly Spiebergian in themes and production, and the bearded maestro of the film geek masses on producer duties here, his name hangs over Abrams' movie like a watchful father figure. If that bothers Abrams, or indeed if it detracts from the quality of his movie? Then that's up for debate by those not enamoured with Spielberg's movies of the late 70s and early 80s. But to my mind it's a blessing, a triumph of sorts to be mentioned in the same breath as the beard and those wonderful movies of his. Part homage, part nostalgia harking, Super 8 is still one great, sweet and affecting J.J. Abrams movie.<br/><br/>Abrams himself is on record as saying that Super 8 is born out of two movie ideas he had, this while also being drawn from his own recollections in childhood, and the two movie idea shows. It's very much a two part picture in structure, part Stand by Me coming of ager, part Goonie like monster hunt. Nothing wrong with that, mind. However, with that comes some form of irritation to those who venture in expecting a big ole alien attack movie. Oh for sure he exists, and he is big and mean, although he has just cause, but the creature is not the centre piece of the movie. It's the human characters that form the basis of Super 8, be it the kids adjusting to their changing emotions and hormones, or the single parent fathers coming to terms with absence of love and grief, Super 8 is brimming with human heart. Yet never is it schmaltzy.<br/><br/>PRODUCTION VALUE!<br/><br/>Aided by Fong's warm metallic hued photography and Giacchino's beautiful heart tugging score (both energised in Blu-ray), Super 8 always carries a magical mysticism to it. The warm glow of nostalgia cloaks the proceedings, never cloying, always smile inducing, offering comfort as the narrative deals out observations about the need to let go while playing out as a deft, if unsubtle, meditation on grief and growing pains. The cast do wonders for their director, Fanning and Courtney are exemplary, so much raw emotion and energy, it's unfussy and believable acting. Griffith's, too, is wonderful as the booming voiced wannabe director, a tender nod of the head to the many young amateur directors out there; of which Abrams was once one himself. While Eldard and Chandler as the two fathers are most affecting, the pangs of juggling single parenting with loss are deeply portrayed.<br/><br/>Of the director himself? He crafts it with care and precision, a knowing of the pulse beat of the thematics to drive it forward. His attention to period details are admirable, from the dialogue sparks involving Walkman's and Soviet paranoia, to the items located within the bedrooms and houses of our young protagonists, he is a man who knows his late 70s and early 80s onions. Spielberg was far from finished as a film maker of note at the time of Super 8's release, but it did feel then that the torch was deftly being passed sideways. After the excellence of Star Trek he followed up with this most delightful of movies, where Abrams showed in his work a love of cinema that's wholly infectious. 9/10"
"axekicker78","Null","3","6","2 August 2011"," Horrifying! (For all the wrong reasons.)
","By now, we all know the plot; while making a super-8 zombie movie, a group of kids (""Stand By Me"") inadvertently film a train wreck that releases some mysterious cargo (""Cloverfield""). As the kids get caught up in the mystery, the army (and its villainous leader) run around trying to contain both the kids and the cargo in what amounts to a clusterf*ck of exposition and deus ex machina. (That's Latin for, ""Nigga, please.""). How big are the plot holes? Put it this way: a 60-foot, spider-like alien could crawl through them without so much as an ""excuse me.""  <br/><br/>Like the story's protagonists, I love being terrified by way of a willing suspension of disbelief. Instead, I found myself horrified by the film's utter suspension of common sense. I can't understand why Spielberg, the mastermind behind ""Close Encounters"" and ""Jaws,"" EP'd this movie. Actually, I can -- when I think of Spielberg, the producer. He truly ""gets"" the ever-descending standards of today's movie-going public. For better or worse the man has always understood his audience. In Spielberg's day, we were better, smarter. Today, well... we have the Tea Party. Actually, we have its progeny, spending their parents' unemployment checks on movies when they should be reading their bibles and burning crosses on the White House lawn. <br/><br/>Is it any wonder my respect for Spielberg as a filmmaker increases tenfold when comparing his abilities to Abrams'? Spielberg could have farted a better film. And 30 years ago, he would have -- as a TV episode of The Night Gallery. Remember that show? Neither do I. But Abrams' ascendancy in the world of television explains a lot about his shortcomings as someone looking to be the next Spielberg. Maybe on some other planet.<br/><br/>The idea, itself, is great. But Super-8 gets derailed the moment the train careens off the tracks, releasing its cargo of cheap scares and incredulity, causing M. Night Shamalamananyan to wonder what the hell happened to his FedEx package! Even ""E.T. - The Extraterrestrial"" appeals to both adults and kids, dishing out thrills for the latter without insulting the intelligence of the former. Not so with Super-8. <br/><br/>The characters have nothing to do with the larger story. While the performances are solid - and Elle Fanning's foreshadows future Oscars - the kids play no role pivotal to the outcome of the tale. Nor do the events really change them beyond what's expected. It's as if there are two movies playing out simultaneously. And the one with the expensive monster is crap. An afterthought. Only the secondary and tertiary characters undergo any real change. But their stories are so fleeting, who cares if the love interest's Dad starts out as a bastard and ends up as a swell guy? We can't even remember his name. Ironically, the best part of the movie was watching the kids' completed zombie flick during the credit roll, which turned out to be scarier and more plausible than Abrams' big-budget train wreck. (I get the feeling Spielberg directed it). As for the larger movie, I'm not gonna run through all the plot holes, which are sufficient for an entirely separate article. <br/><br/>But how is it that such a large and unstoppable creature could have been contained for over 20 years -- or even 20 seconds (in a box car no less) -- only to escape when the box car gets knocked sideways alongside a small town in the middle of nowhere? Why does the military wait a week or two (allowing all the necessary characters enough time to get wise to the extraterrestrial cargo) before finally evacuating the town -- when they already know there's a giant alien on the loose in search of used appliances? Hello?? Earth calling common sense?? And just what is it about microwave ovens and old refrigerators that make for such great alien space ship launching pads? Hell, had I known back then that my old Zenith harbored highly-advanced technology, I would have sold it to a Chinese kid. <br/><br/>Even the era is totally arbitrary to the story, satisfying only the filmmakers' sentimental yearning for the old days when they were kids with super-8 movie cameras. I get it, but so what? This isn't relevant to me; in the late 70s, I was learning to masturbate while wearing KISS make-up. Super-8 (the format) has nothing to do with me, or the story. The movie could have been called Hi-8. Or MiniDV for all it matters. I suppose it's convenient for the story take place before most of the audience was born, so there's fewer people calling bullshit on the references. I mean, come on -- no respectable nerd would buy a Hunchback model over a Karloff Bride of Frankenstein; the stores couldn't give the Lon Chaney Quasimodo ones away. <br/><br/>Altogether, the era, the lapses in logic, the predictability -- all of it suited Abrams' needs rather than those of the story. And isn't that the whole problem with movies these days? Nobody wants to do the work. Not the filmmakers. Not the audience. Not the focus group moderators. We want it easy. We want CGI. F*ck stop-motion, it's too much work! Save your provocation for the art house, we'd rather not think, thank you very much.  We want all the services without paying any of the taxes. In this context, Super-8 makes total sense, along with most of the ""blockbusters"" these days.<br/><br/>But why I spent over $60 to see this in the theaters when I should have known better? That remains a mystery for which I have no sufficient answer. I guess, like everyone else, I'm only human, and not that smart either. Although, looking back, I certainly understand the alien's motivation for wanting to get off this planet. When confronted by the likes of those in Middle America... well, let's just say the horror was all his."
"gupta-salami","2","3","6","6 July 2011"," Steven Spielberg has become a Cliché of himself!
","Did you see ET? If you did, well, wait for the opportunity to rent this movie, or download it online for less. Why? Well, if you are hoping to watch an original movie, this isn't it. It is a rehash of the ET story line, only with a bigger budget.<br/><br/>I expected better from Spielberg but he is rich and fat now, and he can simply rehash a story line and make money rather than write something original. Good for him.<br/><br/>Super 8 is a nice action movie, a great way to waste time, to be mildly entertained. If you are happy to blow money to see junk in a theater, go for it. Not me. I expect more for the money & this is just a ""category: rental"", to me.<br/><br/>Spoiler Warning!<br/><br/>Characters in this movie are BORING! Two can act. The rest... <br/><br/>The story is no different than ET. A big, bad ass alien wants to go home but the bad humans are keeping him here against his will. The bad guys are from the Air Force this time around. One rogue former scientist wants the alien to go home. He was touched by him (well, picked up and shaken, then tossed) and now he ""understands"" the alien. <br/><br/>YAWN.<br/><br/>The kids, a sad parody of the Spielberg childhood, are.... yes... .moviemakers! Just like the big boy now. So, under the premise of sneaking out in the middle of the night to ""film"", they catch a train wreck and are warned to stay away or death will come to all of them and their families. You have to get this warning or there is zero suspense, as this scene is suppose to make the movie ""scary"" as the ""plot"" develops. It is suppose to make you think the Air Force is bad! And, it is suppose to make you wonder what is so special about this train, that it had to be stopped.<br/><br/>YAWN.<br/><br/>After a spectacular crash, the big bad alien breaks out of the railway car and starts to destroy the town, one microwave and car engine at a time. What does he do with this stuff? Who knows. It all disappears from the town and the town folk are ""angry""! Where are the micro waves and what happened to all the engines and radiators from the used cars in the lot? The Town folk think it's the RUSSIANS! FAIL!<br/><br/>YAWN.<br/><br/>I forgot to mention, to try and tug at your heart, the hero loses his mom in an industrial accident and falls in love with the daughter of the guy who should have died in the plant but he was drunk, stayed home and she took his shift and got crushed by an ""I"" beam that fell on her. Pass the Kleenex box, please. FAIL.<br/><br/>YAWN.<br/><br/>Are you bored yet!? I am and I am not even finished the review yet.<br/><br/>The Air Force guys are really, really bad guys. They round up the towns people, throw the deputy in the slammer to keep him from interfering with their recapture efforts etc etc. But, the kids manage to ESCAPE the round up, find the scientists old films, unravel the truth, and get caught again, by the Air Force guys! Not only do the kids escape this high security compound, a drug addict, film store sales guy drives them out of the compound. No one notices. I guess the Air Force must have gone to the Luke Skywalker Ranch for training on stuff like: shooting and security, just like the Empire Storm Troopers. They did shoot just as bad in the shooting scenes when they couldn't hit the broad side of an alien but tore up the town pretty good, sound familiar?<br/><br/>YAWN.<br/><br/>On the way back, the Alien has his moment with the bus, kills the Air Force guys transporting the kids, but... yes.... the kids ESCAPE. Very unexpected.<br/><br/>YAWN.<br/><br/>The hero finds the underground tunnel the alien is in, finds the girl he is in love with that got taken by the Alien earlier, so he could eat her later when he gets hungry, but the hero rescues her.<br/><br/>YAWN.<br/><br/>And... The alien ESCAPES, goes home, Fade to Black, roll credit. DON'T LEAVE YOUR SEAT EARLY!!!!!<br/><br/>You get to see the finished film the kids made. It is better than the movie!<br/><br/>YAWN.<br/><br/>Badda bing. $60 lighter in the wallet. FAIL!<br/><br/>The train wreck scene was like something out of the Spielberg War of the Worlds. It simply never ended. All because the MASSIVE train hits a small pickup! The scientist IN the pickup is NOT DEAD! NO SIR! He warns the kids to RUN! The pickup isn't even obliterated, and it was a head on collision.<br/><br/>Triple YAWN.<br/><br/>Read the gushy reviews from all the mindless people who just love everything they see and fail to turn a critical eye to anything. The movie industry loves them! They allow all the rich producers and executives to enjoy wonderful, plush lifestyles with mansions, Oscars and Bentleys. <br/><br/>Trust me, you will watch this movie and feel like it was a waste of time after it is over. And, that is because it is. Rent it later if you have to. Spielberg will still make money from you on the rental, and he will like that too.<br/><br/>If this was a romance novel, it would be a Harlequin Romance. A formula novel they crank out by the dozens every week, the names change, the locations change, the covers change, but the story is the same. <br/><br/>Overall, FAILS on many levels.<br/><br/>Welcome to Super 8, the ET rehash."

","As a slyly self-referential autobiographical peek at J.J. Abrams's movie-obsessed teenage years, it's not so bad. Trouble is, it's also trying to be a sci-fi thriller, and it's just not going to thrill when it's so damn predictable. Think the shy kid and the popular blonde girl are going to be sweeties by the end? Well, so they are. Think the military dude who's a dead ringer for Kiefer Sutherland in ""A Few Good Men"" is going to turn out to be the heavy? Whaddaya know. Bad scary monster who just wants to go home going to go home? Yeah, and not a moment too soon.<br/><br/>There was some good stuff here. The kids were great, the aforementioned youthful-movie-obsession stuff was actually kind of cool, the protracted train-crash sequence was as good as protracted train crashes in movies get. But if you want to see the same basic story done with a bit of actual originality, rent ""Iron Giant."""

The effects were amazing, the story included a layer of depth that was truly intriguing, the acting was PHENOMENAL, the music was perfect, and, most of all, I didn't feel like I was constantly being preached a lesson on morality as these movies typically do. Yes, it's there, but it's not right in your face weighing you down constantly.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Excellent CGI Extremely Convincing Acting Flawless music Decent though somewhat cliché story Well worth the $10"
"bababear","4","3","6","20 June 2011"," I liked the ending....but not too much more
","What I learned from this movie: 1. If you're the wife/mother major male characters you're doomed to an early, messy death, but it will happen off-screen the day before the story starts. 2. The state of Ohio will hire someone with a dishonorable discharge from the Air Force for a teaching job in a nice little town. 3. A man can drive his truck down the railroad track and deliberately have a head-on collision with a train and survive, and be conscious and able to talk afterward. 4. I'm concerned about the safety of my town as a train carrying a monster will be coming through. Therefore, I'll go downtown to the train station and derail the train right there instead of letting it be derailed somewhere nobody cares about (New Jersey?). 5. Children and important characters cannot die. Death is only for peripheral or unsympathetic characters who do not see the error of their ways. 6. A town can, after a cataclysmic explosion, be isolated from the outside world. In return, the outside world will take no notice of this as none of these people have friends or relatives outside of this one tiny town in Ohio. 7. A character played by Noah Emmerich (a very good actor who deserves better) will appear, at first, to be kind and helpful. That will not last forever. 8. The American military is evil. Uh, no, they're all very stupid. Oh, they're really nice people after all. 9. Monsters from space are only nasty on the surface. Once you get to know them they're really nice (as long as they don't eat you). Well, yes, they do eat people, but only older character actors or women who wind up in caves with curlers in their hair. 10. A spaceship can be built around a water tower if magnetism attracts the contents of what seems to be a junkyard to it. It cannot achieve critical mass and accomplish its transformation, though, without one piece of mass-produced costume jewelry. Pixie dust seems to be optional. 11. Cars will fly toward said magnet like paper airplanes. Tanks are immune to this. 12. Theater stereo systems (and this is from someone drove two hours to see THE DOORS in a theater with really great sound when it was playing locally in mono) are really distracting when vehicles drive across the screen. Stereo should be reserved for explosions of various kinds and music, and (like jalapenos) using sparingly."

This picture is also filled with spectacular jump moments to keep you on your toes throughout the movie. This wondrous movie itself is filled with mystery so as the movie progresses you must put what you've already seen together with what you have just seen at certain points to understand the movie.

","Super 8 had a lot of potential. The story of the kids and first love was well constructed, however it was overshadowed by the schmaltzy story plot point and steroid-induced explosions. J.J. Abrams is a decent filmmaker, but has a long way before he reaches the precipice of greatness like Zemeckis, and early Spielberg. Abrams is afraid of the quiet beautiful moments and is on top of you with another huge explosion. It was a period piece, right. There was no need to blow everything up so he can compete with the comic book extravaganzas and Transformers of the summer. He should have been confident to tell the story and not focus on gimmicks.<br/><br/>Also, the alien is a total contradiction. The alien is scared and wants to go home, but eats and kills certain people and leaves others alone. I guess the alien was bi-polar too."

It is basically a movie for teens-kids, but the real problem is that it seems to have been done by...well, kids.<br/><br/>Regarding the actors, I gotta say the young ones did a fairly good job. Ironically, I thought that the worst acting in the movie came from the older actors. The reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I thought the kids did a fairly good job acting and also because some amazing visuals in one or two scenes.<br/><br/>But what most bothered me is the misguided advertising.

Yet there is a great script, and an original plot that is not that common to the expected Summer Blockbuster.<br/><br/>I know the director is keen to point out that it is not a Spielberg homage, but you can not avoid drawing comparisons. However, if you were a painter, would the odd influence or comparison to Da Vinci be all that bad? The influence as I see it, is on great casting, fabulous details in the development of the supporting cast, and a plot that honestly leaves the audience guessing until the final reel.

","It's getting harder and harder to make movies like Super 8. Without the marketing muscle of a comic book superhero or a million dollar mug to slap on the poster, director J.J. Abrams gave the Hollywood bean counters dangerously little to count on. Even after Star Trek proved Abrams could direct the hell out of a summer blockbuster, the budget allocated for his pet follow-up is as diminutive as its young cast.<br/><br/>There is one megaton name Abrams drops on the Super 8 one-sheet: Steven Spielberg. But then, even his involvement means little when stinkers like Transformers and Eagle Eye regularly reappropriate his reputation for their own nefarious purposes. Fortunately, Abrams' connection to Spielberg is more personal.<br/><br/>Super 8 is a tribute to the early accomplishments of the famous filmmaker, and to his ilk who fell under the Amblin Entertainment banner in the 1980s. Abrams draws thirstily from their well, and precedes his film with that iconic E.T. over-the-moon title card. His contribution isn't quite the missing masterpiece many might have hoped, but it is a fun sci-fi throwback with modern flourishes and plenty of heart. Imagine that.<br/><br/>Like Richard Donner's Goonies, the pint-sized protagonists of Super 8 are kids. Not the angsty teenage set that Twilight has cornered, but kids. Cute, flawed, and endearing, the cast and casting director deserves a lot of credit. Two of the youngest stars make their debut here, including Joel Courtney as Joe, a boy dealing with the untimely death of his mother, and Riley Griffiths as Charles —Joe's (token big boned) friend with directorial aspirations.<br/><br/>Hence the title, a love of filmmaking permeates Super 8 — not just in Abrams' confident, informed direction, but among his characters as well. Set in the summer of '79, our heroes sneak out by night to shoot scenes for Charles' schlocky zombie detective short, The Case. Anyone who's messed around with a camcorder as a kid or endured an amateur film festival will immediately recognize the beats. Armed with approximations of professional equipment that would put my friends and I and our Mickey Mouse operation to shame, these characters are seriously creative. But then, being written by J.J. Abrams doesn't hurt.<br/><br/>It's no real spoiler that Super 8 is an alien flick, and Charles' little project takes a dramatic turn when he records something he was never meant to see. A loosed extraterrestrial menace stirs up trouble in the close-knit community, but with the subsequent government invasion, the first act's micro-focus begins to blur. Spielberg's own E.T. benefited from an exclusively adolescent perspective. By comparison, Super 8 wanders.<br/><br/>Though we're never parted from Joe long, the unfolding alien drama rarely meshes with the human story. Creature characterization should be married to his coming-of-age, but instead, exposition usually amounts to an isolated attack on a tertiary character. The scenes play well with suspense and camera trickery, but in hindsight, the plot is pretty much paused for action.<br/><br/>Super 8 is still a summer movie to aspire to. Like Inception, it defiantly forgoes franchising in favor of an as-yet untapped creative reserve. Of course, Abrams draws from the same wellspring that Spielberg, Donner, and Dante drank from, but even when he borrows, he reminds us why so many films made for triple the price aren't half as enjoyable — heart. Call Abrams overambitious, but his is a story of love, reconciliation, and friendship. How exactly do you quantify that?"
"Turfseer","4","4","10","12 June 2011"," Spielberg clone wins no points for bashing US military and scientific communities
","It sure doesn't hurt to have your film produced by Steven Spielberg and apparently J.J. Abrams, creator of the highly commercially successful 'Super 8', understood that the way to Mr. Spielberg's heart (as well as his purse strings) was to create an homage to the 'master', a Spielberg clone if you will, that both legendary director and scores of uncritical teenagers could appreciate.<br/><br/>'Super 8' certainly begins with a clever concept. A group of teenagers are shooting their own amateur detective zombie movie which they hope to enter in a statewide competition. You can see how this would appeal to Mr. Spielberg—he got his start making amateur movies as a teenager. At the end of 'Super 8' during the closing credits, we actually get to see the amateur film ('The Case'), the intrepid teenagers end up creating. It's one of the most clever and enjoyable moments in 'Super 8', and it's too bad the rest of the film is unable to reflect the true joy and unheralded abandon of young teenagers trying to find their way in the adult world.<br/><br/>The protagonist here is Joe Lamb (very nicely played by newcomer Joel Courtney) who is your basic Spielberg stand-in. Note that the young Lamb is the make up and special effects guy who best friend Charles depends on to spruce up the amateur Super 8 film they're shooting at a nearby train station. The tension really builds when a real train derails and crashes in spectacular fashion and the kids barely escape with their lives. <br/><br/>After that, there just seem to be too many contrivances to ignore as Abrams introduces us to another tired alien 'E.T.' narrative, about a misunderstood Anthropod, pursued by a sadistic US military who won't let him return home. It's a little difficult to believe that Dr. Woodward, the kids' biology teacher, is able to survive the horrible train derailment; in addition, one can only wince that the film's primary victim is another saintly black man who must sacrifice his life for the good of all humanity (please see 'Terminator II' and '2012' for further examples).<br/><br/>Much more egregious is the idea that there is a psychopathic Air Force Colonel (Nelec) who has an entire group of soldiers who follow orders (like any good Nazi), ensuring that a kindly alien is tortured needlessly for years and his main protector, is murdered after surviving a horrendous train wreck. After the kids discover Woodward's treasure trove of journals and film, we realize that it's not only the military (represented by Nelec) who is indicted here, but the scientific community who went along with the cover-up. Thus it seems rather obvious that Abrams is content to take cheap shots at both the military and scientific community since in these days of heady conspiracy theories, it just seems like the easy thing to do.<br/><br/>While I had to suspend my disbelief that the military was unable to uncover Woodward's treasure trove before Joe and his gang get to it, I was more bothered by the fact that neither the local or national media picked up on this story considering that there were a lot of unusual goings-on in this little Ohio town. First off there probably would have been a lot more questions from the media regarding the massive train wreck which probably would have drawn even more reporters to the sleepy town. Then after the power went on and off, and the sheriff disappeared, there was a town meeting (which certainly would have been covered by at least some local media), leading to some additional uncomfortable questions, which in real life, probably would have led to further scrutiny (perhaps leading to coverage by the national news.) In other words, this is something that could not have been covered up so easily as Abrams would like us to believe.<br/><br/>Abrams has more difficulty turning his alien into something lovable and cuddly. After all, he's locked himself into a corner when Nelec is depicted as having tortured the hapless creature relentlessly for years. Abrams is content to have the creature communicate telepathically—once anyone bothers to do a 'mind meld', the alien 'understands' that humans mean no harm, and it conveniently backs off acting aggressively. This is shown in the past with Dr. Woodward but also in the present with Joe, who tells the creature 'it's okay' to go home! The problem remains is that the creature has kidnapped a whole bunch of townspeople including Joe's love interest, Alice, who remains suspended upside down, in the creature's subterranean lair. One wonders how long the all those people have been hanging upside down. What happens if they have to go to the bathroom? And why does the creature grab the sheriff a second time? Has he killed him or simply hung him up on the 'rack' for another bout of suspended animation? It's obvious that Abrams doesn't want to kill the townspeople off since that will put his cuddly alien in a bad light!<br/><br/>For those who haven't noticed, 'Super 8' does have a 'B' story. No it's not the prepubescent romance between Alice and Joe but rather the conflict between their warring fathers, Jackson and Louis. It seems that alcoholic Louis missed a day at work and as a result, Joe's Mom was killed in an industrial accident. Unfortunately, Abrams misses an opportunity to develop Louis's character and he comes across as too petulant for most of the film. Jackson is good trying to wear many hats in attempting to help harried townspeople during the 'creature crisis' but later, the big 'rescue' of the kids flops, after Joe and his chums escape from the besieged bus, by themselves.<br/><br/>For those who enjoy Spielberg, 'Super 8' may be the ticket to relive the memories of some of Spielberg's sci-fi classics. But for those who want something that's not so derivative, you'll probably come away being a bit disappointed."
"Br007","5","4","10","11 June 2011"," Adequate 8
","If anything, Super 8 reveals the giant gap between the talents of Steven Spielberg and JJ Abrams. Abrams, emulating the master here, establishes an interesting premise and gives us the requisite teary eyed children and out of touch parents but then completely meanders off course in the film's last third.<br/><br/>The kids all turn in fairly impressive performances but the adults have little to do and, where the first part of the film has wonder and humor, the last part turns into some sort of Transformers sequel and runs the jokes into the ground.<br/><br/>This is Abrams' problem. He cannot stay on a narrative. He did a terrific job reviving Star Trek, but that franchise, of course, has a well worn structure that kept him on course. However, as we saw clearly with Lost, Alias and again here, left to his own devices, his writing tends to lose focus. His plots drag on and by the end we're tapping our toes waiting for a satisfying conclusion that we know will never come.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER AHEAD Super 8 is not a bad film. But it's certainly not super. And, irony of ironies, the home movie the kids make, shown during the end credits, is somewhat more satisfying than Super 8, itself."

"westley34","2","3","7","17 April 2017"," Tried too hard to be sensational...failed
","This movie could have been really good but there are major, major problems. The train wreck was way over done. For one thing, at one point early on in the train crash the train was wrecking behind where the kids were running but they were reacting to something in front of them, which I guess was the train wrecking, but then how could it wreck on both sides of them? Then there is the fact that the guy that drove the pick up into the train caused the train to crash in such a dramatic way. It would take a train running into another train head on to create anything even remotely similar to what we saw (even then the way the trains were flying was probably 20 times more spectacular by far than any real train wreck in history). Then how does the man in the pick up not only survive running his pick up into what must have been an extremely fast moving train for it to have crashed the way it did, his vehicle also was shown to explode into a large ball of fire on impact. And so not only does he live, he is well enough to talk and move his arms around? Incredibly unrealistic. I also have major problems the intense contrasting in volume in this movie. You have to turn the TV up loud to hear what they are saying then something designed to startle the audience happens and the volume suddenly becomes a thousand times louder. Its annoying as heck. I won't blindly like what should be a good movie with so much nonsense thrown into it."
"isawilk-70851","10","3","7","18 March 2017"," Deeper than you think
","I know everyone says this but literally the only reason I made an account was to write a review for this movie because there are many reviews on here that haven't thought about how this movie could actually be a lot deeper than the surface ideologies show........ Perhaps Abrams did this on purpose?<br/><br/>One word - WOW. It has taken me 3 times watching this movie without falling asleep (because at first I too thought this film was a bit of a flop) to finally understand the true depth this movie holds.<br/><br/>I absolutely love JJ Abrams' movies because I always walk away completely and utterly mind boggled. The surface ideologies normally suggest endings with overcoming fear, love, reuniting with loved ones etc., but the passive ideologies suggest something much farther beyond the surface other than just the story about how a boy lets his mother go (when perhaps he really didn't need to?) and reunites with his father. <br/><br/>I know IMDb suggests not to include links in reviews but I literally cannot plead with you enough to read this analysis. ----> https://super8secret.wordpress.com<br/><br/>It could not have summed up the same theory I have any better and I am so glad someone else feels the same way I do. I love how JJ Abrams doesn't want to give anything away in the movie and I think he is far more clever than people give him credit for. <br/><br/>After the end of the movie I sat for a while and thought about how Joe was an extremely mature character and realized that he was much smarter than it seems. This was when I discovered something more was going on. There are many criticizing comments on IMDb about this movie and it is great that the analysis I have linked was able to see outside the square and realize there is a deeper story than the one that is shown. This is one of the reasons why I admire JJ Abrams as a director so much. Well done Abrams - 10/10."

"bkoganbing","8","3","7","21 June 2011"," Another Alien Just wants to go home
","I'm not sure why Super 8 could not have been set during the present rather than in 1979 which is so identified because at the beginning there is mention of the famous 3 Mile Island nuclear disaster over the radio of the protagonist family. I do believe it may be set there because this is the era that producer Steven Spielberg knew first hand as a young man and the one he personally identifies with.<br/><br/>The movie is a combination of both E.T. and Stand By Me. But instead of cute and lovable E.T. just trying to get home, instead we've got a really nasty alien monster with an attitude wanting same. However this alien has a real good reason for his bad attitude. He was captured by our government and tortured by an elite unit.<br/><br/>Some kids who are trying to make a film for some contest happen to capture a train wreck on camera where our monster has escaped. Right after that, strange events start happening in the town and the army comes in. The military is not real forthcoming with answers about what's happening. A little bit of national security and a whole lot of guilt.<br/><br/>But the kids led by Joel Courtney Miller and Elle Fanning do start figuring this whole thing out until the alien captures Fanning along with other assorted townfolk who've gone missing. Then young Miller gets a boys adventure of a lifetime when he goes to rescue Fanning and has to make contact with the alien to do so. That's when Super 8 becomes vintage Spielberg.<br/><br/>One other performance I should single out is that of Glynn Turman who is the doctor who was involved with the alien and took his point of view and is against what our government was doing. Turman reminded me a bit of Danny Glover, but he gave a restrained and intelligent performance in a difficult role. He has to and does convince the audience that their sympathy must lay with the being from outer space.<br/><br/>Super 8 should be seen in an Imax theater as I did. The special effects are great. But the kids are a really winning bunch of real and not movie star kids. They and Glynn Turman make Super 8 one of the better films of this year so far."
"shawn00","9","3","7","17 June 2011"," JJ Abrams Does It Again
","While I think Abrams is an excellent writer and producer, I believe his real gift is directing. Following up a masterful job on Star Trek, Abrams does it again with a whole different setting and story in Super 8.<br/><br/>I've seen some reviews of this movie that call it boring or slow. Well, if all you want is explosions and noise, Abrams isn't that kind of storyteller. This film lets you know its going to be about emotions, relationships and characters from the very opening and it doesn't stop there.<br/><br/>I'm also frustrated by some reviews about poor acting. I couldn't disagree more. I thought all of the acting was fantastic. Even some of the characters like the Kaznyks who barely had any lines nailed the emotion right every time. When it comes to the kids, I think they were all wonderfully acted but none better than Elle Fanning. Wow can that kid act. Her scene at the train station in their movie was a good first glimpse of her talent, but the scene where she confessed about her dad and Joe's mom's death was amazing. That's a lot of emotion for a teenager to show.<br/><br/>All in all, I felt this was an incredibly well done movie. If you want a Godzilla deal or a Michael Bay explosion-riddled mess, this isn't your movie. But if you like films that focus on characters and a well told story, go see Super 8. This is the kind of masterpiece Hollywood needs more of."
"goldwriting","10","3","7","17 June 2011"," Super 8: The Super Combo Delivers Best of the Year
","One is a legend in the movie industry, the other is the current hot ticket with a winning streak not seen in a long, long time. Sometimes when teams like this are paired up, the expectations can be unbearable and completely fantastical, but J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg are not ones to break under the pressure of expectations. The stage was set perfectly for them and they delivered brilliantly with an homage to each other's previous works and the simple storytelling styles of film classics gone by.<br/><br/>Super 8 surrounds a group of movie loving misfits who find their town the unwilling center of a government takeover after a terrible and deadly train accident. While filming their own Super 8 movie for a local festival, they bear witness to the escape of something unexplainable, setting up a quest the kids must all rise to complete or watch their friends, families and entire town get erased from the map.<br/><br/>Jeff Goldsmith, the Q&A master behind the popular podcast The Q&A with Jeff Goldsmith sent out this tweet after screening this new summer throwback:<br/><br/>""I just saw Super 8. Wanna know the guarded ""secret"" behind it? Abrams uses plenty of screen time to develop characters you'll care about. (@yogoldsmith)""<br/><br/>As usual, Jeff nailed it on the head. Above and beyond all the other things that done right in the making of this film, it is the writing and careful execution of creating characters that are human, real and inherently lovable. Super 8 brings back the youthful purity of classics like E.T., The Goonies and Stand by Me, something the movie industry has been woefully lacking in the last few years. The story gently reels you in until you almost look at their story as your own, a memory being perfectly played out they way you wish it happened to you.<br/><br/>Then comes the picture perfect casting, where I was compelled instantly by the innocence of Joel Courtney (as Joe Lamb), who is the first young actor since Patrick Fugit in Almost Famous to truly capture that wide- eyed stare into the possible purity of the future. Another factor connecting the audience to Courtney was our shared need to care for and protect the young damsel in distress, Elle Fanning (playing Alice Dainard). Fanning is the epitome of the first girl we all fell in love with in elementary school and she holds the audience in the palm of her hand throughout every scene. Not to be outdone, Riley Griffiths (playing Charles, the young film director), taps into the other side of the coin, the best friend who always wanted to be the hero, but never quite made it to center stage.<br/><br/>Behind the camera, Abrams and Spielberg may have just cemented themselves as the ultimate dynamic duo. Spielberg is still a legend in Hollywood and has incredibly well tuned story senses, but some of his recent efforts (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, War of the Worlds) have been slightly off from his previous greatness. Abrams, on the other hand, is still a relative newcomer to the big screen (only directing Mission Impossible III and Star Trek), but has proved himself a near master of the current form, grown on the sensibilities of a changing and ever adapting crowd. Abrams took this story and crafted it into a beautiful homage to the man sitting right next to him. Super 8 is a throwback to Spielberg's younger days, giving a whole new generation of movie watchers a glimpse into what others grew up with in the late 70's and early 80's. The balance of character development, action sequences and well-paced comedy beats really gives this film a perfect blend for nearly every audience member.<br/><br/>The End of the Page recommendation: Super 8 is a perfectly crafted summer blockbuster. It just doesn't get better, at least not this year."
"jbc1297","9","3","7","15 June 2011"," Great Sounds Bro
","First off writing a review is very hard for me because my mind is constantly changing topics so bare with me.<br/><br/>I just saw ""Super 8"" today with my dad not really knowing what was in store for me, and I was pleasantly surprised. Two things that really stuck out for me was the acting of the kids and the sound. First the kids they really did a great job, i found my self liking each of them and even hoping that a certain character wouldn't get grabbed in a certain chase scene. Now for the sound, it was really incredible. Some people will say that all it was was a bunch of BRUUUURS and BLAAAAAS but it was so much more. In a particular scene were a car crashes into a train the audio was truly Oscar worthy. The crash alone was mind blowing but the sounds of metal bending and smashing into the ground were stunning. The story it self was also good too. I expected it to be like the kids must save the town because the adults are to self absorbed to fix the problem but that wasn't it at all. The kids didn't even seem to try and fix the problem they were just living threw it and that seemed more realistic to me. So basically this is easily the best movie in theaters right now and you should definitely check it out.<br/><br/>now that that fuss is over some of you may wonder why the movie is called Super 8 and the answer is that the film that little camera they use to shoot there movie uses is super 8mm film which replaced 8mm film in the 1960's so there ya go bro hope i learned you some then today."
"jimvalko","8","3","7","15 June 2011"," Fun, Funny, full of holes
","If one is looking for reasons not to like Super 8 there's plenty available. Most notably, at different times of the movie you really have to be willing to suspend disbelief to keep your head in it. For example, a car runs head on with a train. The crash causes the best train wreak that anyone has ever created on film. The train is derailed and its cars fly in every direction banging and bouncing and...it's quite dramatic. But then the guy in the car that hit the train is not only still in one piece in his car, he's alive and able to talk. Sorry, but in real life that guy would have eaten the steering wheel and the engine. There's also plenty of other parts that are tough to swallow. But the truth is the movie is so enjoyable that I, for one, was completely willing and wanting to suspend disbelief. The kids that starred in it were perfectly cast and did a superb job. It is a perfect Summer kick off movie, reminiscent of ET, Back to the Future, and The Goonies.Popcorn eating fun at its best."
"Reel_starz","9","3","7","14 June 2011"," Take note, aspiring directors: this is passion
","I admit it: I am a huge fan of J.J. Abrams. Lost is my favorite TV show, I'm currently hooked on Fringe, and the 2009 reboot is pretty much my only knowledge of Star Trek. I adore the perfect blend of action and emotion and unabashed optimism he brings to his work, a style reminiscent of the great Steven Spielberg - he who popularized escapist summer blockbusters with such classics as Jaws and E.T. So when I heard that his new movie, Super 8, was not only a mysterious science-fiction thriller but also a tribute to Spielberg's early films, my expectations skyrocketed.<br/><br/>Boy did Abrams deliver. Considering the vast amount of hype surrounding the movie since the enigmatic teaser debuted in theaters, anything less than THE feel-good summer movie of 2011 would have suggested failure. Yet somehow, not only was Super 8 everything I wanted it to be, it was more. Suspenseful, humorous and poignant, occasionally all at once, this is the kind of film that's impossible to describe to someone who hasn't experienced it, not because of any shocking plot twist but because its pleasures are rooted so deeply in the pure, irresistible emotions it inspires: delight, sadness, longing, fear, awe. It's like wandering through an exquisite dream – strange yet familiar, surreal yet authentic – and when the credits roll and you jolt back to reality, you feel as though you've left home. This is what the best movies do: sweep you off your feet and immerse you in a world you never want to leave.<br/><br/>Something about prior experience always seems to bring out the best in directors. The majority of the media coverage that greeted the release of Super 8 focused on its cryptic marketing campaign and J.J. Abrams's past making amateur 8mm films and admiring the work of producer Steven Spielberg, and for the latter, it's not hard to see why. Each shot of Super 8, from its quietly moving opening scene to the breathtaking resolution, is infused with such palpable enthusiasm and soulful sincerity that viewers feel as though they're witnessing the director reach some personal catharsis. Part of what makes Super 8 so special is Abrams's obvious personal connection to its story, as his ardor and sympathy breathe life into a plot that could easily have been hackneyed and forgettable. Nonetheless, the movie never becomes self-indulgent or maudlin and displays a striking lack of pretension. Along with the drama and nostalgia comes a healthy dose of humor that assures the audience Abrams isn't taking himself too seriously; one senses that in essence, he is still that same eager cinema-obsessed kid. Also, Super 8 is in no way a rip-off of E.T. or Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Although maintaining some tropes from those films (i.e. benevolent alien, wistful view of childhood,) Super 8 is a distinctly J.J. Abrams creation. In fact, references are something of an Abrams trademark, as they feature prominently in both Lost and Fringe, and the rapport between Joe and his father mirrors the multifaceted parent-child relationships common throughout his work. Most of all, Super 8 showcases Abrams's characteristic hopefulness, a refreshing break from post-9/11 cynicism.<br/><br/>Here, Abrams also continues a trend of pitch-perfect casting. None of the actors can be considered A-list, yet they provide such equally subtle, convincing performances that it is impossible to single out one person – the mark of a truly great ensemble. As Joe's father and the only adult with a significant amount of screen time, Kyle Chandler reveals why Friday Night Lights fans have championed him so fiercely: alternately self-assured and vulnerable, he has a remarkable ability to convey myriad emotions in a split second, often simultaneously. Even in his darker moments, he shows, through a flick of the eyes or inflection of the voice, that beneath the anger and grief, he is thoroughly, undeniably human. In less generous roles, Noah Emmerich (sinister yet never cartoonish) and Ron Eldard (heartbreaking) demonstrate similar tact. Still, it is the newcomers who form the movie's heart and soul. In his acting debut as shy protagonist Joe Lamb, 15 year old Joel Courtney is astounding, inhabiting his role with the poise of an actor twice his age. Amid an industry dominated by spoiled, too-clean child stars, he feels refreshingly down-to-earth, coming off as praiseworthy yet relatable, innocent yet flawed. Elle Fanning lends rebel Alice Dainard a nice balance of feminist resolve and quiet sensitivity, and Riley Griffiths has an endearing vivacity as Joe's best friend Charles, while Ryan Lee, Zach Mills and Gabriel Basso (Cary, Preston and Martin, respectively) provide ample support. Watching this group of up-and-coming actors, I can't help but feel a bit more hopeful for Hollywood's future.<br/><br/>And this brings me to what should resonate most with audiences: the movie's spot-on portrait of childhood. Neither patronizing nor quixotic, Abrams's ode to the wonders of youth is among the most faithful I've ever seen, and his empathy for his juvenile protagonists is evident from the way he treats them not as precocious saints (one of cinema's most infuriating clichés) but as complex, well-rounded people who are capable of love, bitterness, despair, excitement and everything in between. Even when dealing with serious themes such as death, their dialogue is never less than credible. Look at their crude banter in the café scene or their panicked reactions to the train crash or Joe and Alice's casual exchange of complaints about Charles's domineering behavior. Abrams deftly avoids the typical (pre)teen angst formula, giving his characters depth rarely seen among on screen children, who tend to obsess over superficial issues like popularity and dating (there is a minor love triangle, but it stays true to the awkward naiveté of real child romances). Plus, bonus points for making nerds cool! <br/><br/>Ultimately, Super 8 is like its director: smart, nostalgic and lighthearted, a comforting reminder of humanity's potential for goodness. This is why I fell in love with movies in the first place."

The direction and script were wonderful in that I walked out not hating the alien even after it killed multiple people and destroyed a town. That is excellent directing and an awesome script. Definitely made me believe that people can still make good sci-fi movies and that not all summer movies will be all hype and no meat. i.e. Transformers."
"hmlegendlife","9","3","7","11 June 2011"," Super 8 was Nothing Short of Great
","Going into Super 8, I was ready to see a movie that would remind me of why I've wanted to become a filmmaker for so long. A movie that would maybe remind me that Hollywood could still provide movies worth actually being put into production. When Super 8 faded to credits, I knew this movie was it.<br/><br/>Super 8 was a work of art. I cannot find a weak moment in Super 8. The kids were perfectly cast with Elle Fanning shining the most. She has a bright career ahead of her.<br/><br/>Abrams direction was perfect. No actor had a cheesy or bad-acting moment. Also, Abrams script was impressive with such a natural dialog.<br/><br/>Michael Giacchino's score was effective. I had my doubts with his ability to put an effective soundtrack together after his critically- acclaimed score for Up won the Academy Award (which I felt did not deserve it at all), but Giacchino put a score worthy to be called as good as John Williams himself.<br/><br/>The emotional impact was there, especially with a certain scene where the protagonist and his love interest watch a film reel of the protagonists deceased mother.<br/><br/>What I will brag most about Super 8, the crucial thing that made Super 8 a 9 out of 10 instead of a 7 or 8, was the ending. The last 5 minutes, or the closing scene, is one of the most beautiful, awe-inspiring, I have seen in years. I was stunned. I was speechless. Not since maybe Return of the King in 2003 have I seen an ending in theaters that has left me in such an awe.<br/><br/>Go see Super 8. The movie will not disappoint. Super 8 is maybe the first step back into having big-budget blockbusters again that were not too long ago that had depth, heart, and character such as Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, Titanic, and even Spider-Man 2."
"jbushy14","10","3","7","11 June 2011"," Super 8 mixes heart with Sci-fi
","I don't plan on using spoilers but any information about this movie is a spoiler.<br/><br/>I went into this movie with astounding expectations, and all were met. JJ Abrams mixes the suspense Spielberg created in Close Encounters with the heart in ET, however Super 8 has arguably more heart, and adds the action Abrams used in Star Trek. <br/><br/>The key to Super 8's success is the children. The kids are by far the best actors in the movie. They have great range, which they use in this movie, and are simply fantastic. The movie is so focused on the children because Abrams is showing how beautiful imagination is, not just at a young age but when we grow up. The sci-fi is good, the alien idea has been done again and again, but the focus does not revolve around the monster but instead focuses on the kids. The movie is not about the alien but instead the growth of the children. <br/><br/>The bottom line is, Super 8 is more about youth and imagination. Much like the kids are making a monster movie Abrams is making his own. The heart Abrams puts in the movie makes Super 8 more than just an action or sci-fi movie. In Super 8 Abrams did a better job than Spielberg. He took the heart and childlike wonder Spielberg had in ET and Close Encounters and merged it with a story and action only JJ Abrams could pull off. <br/><br/>Side Note: I saw this movie in IMAX and the sound was phenomenal. I recommend seeing this movie in theaters and if possible in IMAX."
"CSHaviland","9","3","7","11 June 2011"," Fun, Sweet, Funny, Scary, Nostalgic SF
","Coming out of Super 8, I felt as though it was the early 80's again, or sometime in my own childhood. That is not because it was set in the early 80's, however. It's because J.J. Abrams engineered a style of film that reminded me of a monster movie formula of the 60's combined with a science fiction formula of the 70's and early 80's. It definitely has a Spielbergian echo, with thematic homages to movies Spielberg directed like E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Jaws, and produced in his early years like Poltergeist, Gremlins, and The Goonies (when he was more creatively involved). Monster movie motifs were found all over the place, ranging from zombie flicks (the type of Super 8 movie the kids were making) to Them and Earth vs The Spider, as well as cult SF alien invasion movies like Invaders From Mars.<br/><br/>Abrams thankfully avoids the shaky-cam trend of modern movie making and takes more time setting up shots and angles that work in the moment, another Spielberg and Hitchcock style I wish more directors would adapt.<br/><br/>That is not to say that Super 8 isn't original. Every child carries genes of his or her parents, grandparents and ancestors, but is still unique. It is a great adventure movie featuring a group of kids doing things not unlike what I tried to do when I was young (but with a lot better resources than were available to me), and so it reached me personally not only in style but in content.<br/><br/>For younger audiences, who may not have even been born until the mid-80's (or later), and who haven't taken the time to watch movies from earlier years, should find it fresh, fun and interesting, and unlike your typical Michael Bay action film, easy to watch.<br/><br/>No matter how it performs in today's box office climate, I think Super 8 will prove to be a classic in later years."

","I went into this movie knowing it was PG-13 which nowadays means scary for a 13yo and little violence and if anyone does get killed it's off screen or blurred. There are one or 2 deaths that are violent enough to border on an r rating but everything else is kiddie. The special effects and shock moments that have you jump are not bad but they alone cant carry this movie. Some of the acting is pretty bad and it drags quite frequently. The kids act better than the adults and their range of emotion is why I didn't lower my rating even more. The ending is typical Spielberg schtick and a definite cop out as if they couldn't figure out how to end it and maybe threw ideas into a hat and picked one. I saw it in an IMAX theater which I'd recommend especially for the train crash scene or you'll miss the feel of it. Overall a 7/10 , the kids acting is a 10 the rest of the movie is a 4."

","Greetings again from the darkness. A nostalgic feeling generated by nostalgic filmmaking at the hands of JJ Abrams and classic Spielberg. Yes, I meant to use nostalgic twice ... the film has a familiar feel to it, but also entirely new twists and effects. That's what happens when the master (Spielberg) and the star pupil (Abrams) unite.<br/><br/>Part of the nostalgia is that this is kind of a throwback to the blockbuster era that Spielberg helped create. There are bits and pieces of Jurassic Park, E.T., The Goonies, *Batteries not Included, and Jaws. Spielberg has always had a nice feel for kids and emotions, and in this film the genius of Abrams' script and special effects make for a spectacular combination.<br/><br/>You know there is nothing more fun for these filmmakers than a story about smart, outcast kids obsessed with making a movie! Throw in the adolescent battle over the out-of-reach older girl, the somewhat demented kid who just loves explosions, the sensitive kid dealing with the death of his mother, the wise beyond her years girl who is a natural actress, and the chubby, driven boy with a camera ... mix it up with a couple of clueless parents and the evil, secretive Air Force, and you have quite the exciting small town Ohio drama with comedic elements and startling special effects.<br/><br/>Not going to say anything about the ""surprise"" that was hinted in the trailer, but what I will say is that the first hour of this movie was pure movie magic to me. Unfortunately, the second half was a slight let down, though not horrible at all. I just enjoyed the pure human elements on display before it became just another ...<br/><br/>The film really rides on the shoulders of Elle Fanning (probably the last time I will reference her as Dakota's little sis). Ms. Fanning has proved again that she may be the most talented of the acting sisters. She really has a feel for her scenes and clearly melts the heart of young Joe Lamb, played by newcomer Joel Courtney. Also excellent are Riley Griffiths as Charles the movie maker, and Ryan Lee as Cary the demolition ""expert"". Joe's dad is played by Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights), but again, this film really belongs to the kids.<br/><br/>The film is rated PG-13 for some pretty intense scenes and some language that many prefer not to hear coming from kids. It's too bad more films ""like"" this aren't made, but that's probably a factor of not many filmmakers being in the class of Spielberg and Abrams (Lost, Star Trek)."
"KnightsofNi11","8","4","11","11 June 2011"," A fine example of nostalgic filmmaking
","Time to return to a more glorious, beautiful, and empowering time of filmmaking. Super 8 is a nostalgic sci-fi film highly reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's 80's classics like E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and even Jaws. It's the story of a group of kids who live in a small town spending their days shooting movies with the super 8 camera. One night a train derails and very mysterious things being to happen around the town. Electrical appliances begin to disappear, dogs run away, the power around the town goes out constantly. Things get even stranger when the military arrives and it then becomes obvious that a serious situation has arisen. The film does an excellent job at reminding us what the Summer blockbuster used to be like and just how well film can captivate our imaginations and cultivate a sense of wonder in our hearts.<br/><br/>Super 8 tells the kind of story we can easily recognize, follow, and still fall in love with. The film starts out as a mystery before we get to learn any of what is truly going on. We get plenty of vague clues that keep our senses sharp and our interest alive. Then when things begin to get answered the wonder and imagination take over and bewilder our minds with immaculate visuals. It's always nice when an engaging story follows through from beginning to end making sure to deliver a satisfying beginning, middle, and end. There are moments along the way that tend to drag the film down a little bit and there are certain character relationships that don't seem to be going anywhere towards the middle of the film. Thankfully it all pays off by the end and what Super 8 gives us is all very satisfying.<br/><br/>The film's story reminds us of this simpler time of cinema, but so does the filmmaking. J.J. Abrams is an incredibly dedicated man and it is obvious that he wanted to make Super 8 in a very specific style that pleased himself and his audience of all ages. He keeps this nostalgia alive through beautiful cinematography that reflects the sweeping grandeur of the classic blockbusters we know and love today. Abrams doesn't rely on the shaky cam or an overdose of quick cuts and jumpy edits. He shoots the film with grace that excites and also mystifies. There are some awesome shots that capture a very pure vision that Abrams wanted to put forth in Super 8, making it a film with a lot of life and very high spirits.<br/><br/>Overall Super 8 is a great movie that is incredibly fun. The story, while faltering at times, is a joy to watch unfold and all of the technical work on the film is magnificent. The film has a great look and feel to it that just forces you to fall in love with it. You can't help but enjoy all the characters, especially with some fantastic child actors playing these excellent roles, and the film is incredibly exciting with almost non-stop action for the entire final act. Super 8 isn't a masterpiece or anything, but it certainly reminds us why we love going to the movies and it relives a great time for filmmaking. This could easily be one of the best releases this summer."

"StonedMagician","9","2","4","27 July 2019"," Great: 9.0
","Far and away the most hyped film of the year so far, J.J. Abrams' Super 8 has, I am happy to say, lived up to its all but insurmountable mountain of buzz that it has accrued, and done so with a grace and style rarely seen in summer blockbusters. The title comes from the old type of film found in portable video cameras, which are used by the main characters. These children, led by Elle Fanning as Alice and Joel Courtney as Joe, are filming a zombie movie for the Cleveland Super 8 Film Festival, and (as aspiring filmmakers, and as kids) want more ""production value"" in their film. Be careful what you wish for, right? As seen in the trailers, a pickup (somehow) derails the train they are shooting next to, and from the wreckage emerges...something I won't go into any more detail about (for fear of spoiling this movie for anyone who hasn't yet seen it. It is from here that Abrams truly shows his mastery of storytelling. The movie follows Joe as we see him in a variety of events and emotions: grief, terror, love, wonder. All of these things are what make Super 8 the best film of 2011 so far, and how they fit in so well with the suspense, and later on, effects-driven action. Yet, through all the explosions, killings, and mysteries surrounding the town of Lillian and its occurrences, Abrams manages to keep the film feeling distinctly human, and it is this fact that allows you to empathize with every major character, as each one is portrayed as their own human being, complete with inner light and inherent flaws that lie within us all. When this movie decides to bring the thing into the picture it does so in a very similar manner to the Abrams-produced Cloverfield, showing a bit at a time, and almost never giving you a good look at it. And when you do finally see it, it is always fleeting. Is this an attempt to heighten the mystery, or to keep people focused on the more worldly characters? I decided the answer was the former, but regardless, whichever you choose, you will leave satisfied. There seems to be a popular sentiment that Super 8 packs too many homages to older films into its 112 minute runtime. I caught some subtle but noticeable references to E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Night of the Living Dead, among a few others. However, unlike other reviewers, I do not feel like these little things detracted from the film. Nor do I feel like they added to it; Abrams is a protege of Spielberg, and thusly, would probably create some shots that are so similar to ones found in some of Spielberg's earlier classics. Like Spielberg, Abrams manages to deftly weave two vastly different types of storylines into one extremely clever hybrid, with the strengths of both, and weaknesses of neither. If you are a fan of sci-fi thrillers, or of dramas that focus on the ever-changing ""human element"", you owe it to yourself to experience this incredibly unique thrill ride for yourself. You should not be disappointed."

","""Super 8"" is a surprisingly engaging, heartfelt ode to vintage Steven Spielberg (think ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"") by writer / director J.J. Abrams. It focuses on a tight-knit group of young friends in the summer of 1979. Right now, led by their director, Charles (Riley Griffiths), they're busy making their own shot-on-Super-8 zombie epic. VERY early one morning, they're at the local train station filming scenes when they manage to record a catastrophic train crash. Not only there is much destruction, but a stealthy *something* escapes from the ruined train and vanishes into the night. Soon, the military shows up to try to contain the entity and keep a lid on the matter.<br/><br/>It's true that the final half hour can't measure up to the opening 80 minutes, for then the movie does descend into maudlin predictability. Yes, some people could complain that it turns into an outright ""cheese fest"". But this movie has real heart, and takes place in a rural location (in and around the town of Lillian, Ohio) that could have easily been a setting for a Spielberg film. The production has a respectable amount of razzle-dazzle and an abundance of digital effects, not to mention a fairly well conceived alien creature. It has a body count of sorts, so it won't be completely harmless for the youngest of viewers. It also takes a pretty dim view of the military, as has been the case for scores of genre pictures for approximately half a century. A first rate filmmaking team includes cinematographer Larry Fong and production designer Martin Whist; the music by Michael Giacchino perfectly sets the mood.<br/><br/>The cast couldn't be more likeable, even if some of the characters are formula types. In fact, it's the camaraderie among the kids that really makes this work as well as it does. Joel Courtney as Joe is our main character, a boy mourning the violent death of his mother, and at odds with his policeman father (Kyle Chandler). Ryan Lees' Cary is one of those expected ""quirky"" type of roles, a kid who likes to blow stuff up real good. Elle Fanning is appealing as the leading lady of the movie-within-the-movie, upon whom Joe crushes. Familiar faces in supporting parts and bits include Ron Eldard (as Fannings' troubled pop), Glynn Turman (as a science teacher who sets the story in motion), Noah Emmerich (as a hard-charging Air Force colonel), Bruce Greenwood, Dale Dickey, Richard T. Jones, and Dan Castellaneta.<br/><br/>Overall, it may be imperfect - with the expected sob-into-your-hankie character resolutions and out-of-this-world finale - but it did hit a nerve with this viewer, who expects that some Spielberg devotees will go right for it.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."
"roddekker","5","2","4","10 May 2015"," Super 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1-0-Blast Off!
","I don't much like films where it takes a phenomenally catastrophic event, like the one in Super 8, to get parents to finally realize the value of their kids. This sort of thing seems to be something of a recurring theme in a number of Steven Spielberg movies that I've seen.<br/><br/>I also don't like films that show an overwhelming military presence in its story. Again, another somewhat common element in a Spielberg movie.<br/><br/>In Super 8, with the military presence being that of the US military gathering in troops in its own country, I found it very odd how reluctant these members of the armed forces were at actually leveling with their own citizens about the reality of the present emergency situation. I think this is a very strange approach for the military to take, especially when you consider that a large portion of the taxes that Americans pay go to these guys' wages.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, I found Super 8 to be one of those borderline alien invasion movies. In other words, its story left a lot to be desired. But, as always, with any Spielberg film, one really can't complain too much about the outstanding visuals."
"nzl216","3","2","4","27 June 2013"," Clichéd, disappointing
","Clearly there's a market for this stuff, but I thought the kids making a movie captured pretty well how I felt about the whole thing... clichéd plot, contrived action sequences and some pretty clunky dialog. I agree there was some good work by Fanning, but that hardly saves it. Fortunately I was able to multitask while I watched, so it wasn't a complete loss.<br/><br/>The fact that Abrams wrote and directed is interesting... I'm a big Fringe fan, and you can certainly see shades of that here, but Super 8 totally lacks the great characters, dialog and humor and the ability to make you willingly suspend disbelief for the sake of the story."

This movie starts out fun with the kids making a super eight film about zombies ( the interesting and good part of the movie) and then it turns into the biggest train wreck since the awfully stupid train wreck in the movie that causes a giant misunderstood spider thing of all things to escape and go rampaging through a 7 eleven . Now this spider is supposed to be a sympathetic character because of the torture that the always evil (in Hollywood anyways ) military subject this monster to. There's is also the father son estranged and utterly stupid relationship where the dad completely ignores his child until the very last moment when this child neglecting Nimrod of a dad turns into Rambo and saves his son.

I remember a lady was talking to our SWAT guy and she said that ""my dog didn't go that much before. do you know the reason?"". I said enough! What kind of an unreasonable conversation is that?

","As many have noted already, this film is very much a Goonies reboot with elements of ET, Close Encounters, etc thrown in. Pretty much anything Spielberg is associated with these days is shameless saccharine crap and this film is no exception. I can only conclude that he has reached a point in his career where no one has the ca-hones to tell him that his doo doo stinks and that's why he excretes this kinda crap over and over. Also the JJ Abrahms 'grade school' writing style is prevalent throughout (if you've seen that crappy TV show Revolution that he wrote then you'll have a good idea just how much he cares about silly things like continuity, costuming, facts, physics, reality). You have to be willing to suspend disbelief...and logic, common sense and tact to enjoy most of it.<br/><br/>Its not all bad though, its not a terrible movie, its entertaining in its own way, the overall story is pretty good. And it makes for wholesome family fun for movie night if that's what you're after... its just that you get sick of watching the same bag of tricks and tropes recycled over and over again and sadly this one delves into the bag far too deeply and frequently."

OK SO, THIS MONSTER, STEALS MICROWAVES, AND FLYS AWAY WITH THEM, MICROWAVES. MICROWAVES. So this beast is locked up for 10 years in what looks like bars, like generic prison bars, yet it cant get out, but somehow, when the train crashes, it breaks out by its self even THOUGH it could've broken out of the train at any given time. CMON JJ ABRAMS, YOUR NOT JAMES CAMERON HERE, GET A GRIP So the kids were purely ripped from the goonies, with literal stereotypes used in the goonies.

OK so this monster managed to kill a total of like 2 people? the whole movie? and that train wreck killed nothing? So this highly advanced monster just wraps them up like a spider, because thats the best jj abrams can do for a monster, is to completely rip it as a spider, but no audience, its an alien, that uses microwaves to build a ship. Microwaves, to build, a highly advanced space craft, to fly off.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie falls short in almost every area, except the area of movie monsters who build ships out of microwaves with no explanation to the audience, other than OH MICROWAVES ARE METAL, METAL=SHIP.

","I have not seen anything from the series 'Lost' which made J.J. Abrams famous so I didn't come into this movie with high expectations and it's a good thing I didn't either. I just found so much of the action sequences flat, the characters weren't really all that engaging and the story pretty much non-existent. It had really good potential early on with the train crash and played the mystery up fairly well and then the payoff was just not there at all. So much of the action and the entire movie for that matter happens in darkness which makes it easy for F/X department but just made it confusing and tiring for me. The dialogue was hard to pick up, it seemed like the kids were mumbling a lot or something, and what lines you did hear was pure corn. I really have no idea why this was a period piece set in the late '70's either, there was really no reason for it and there was little there to indicate it was the '70's. There was a 'Super8' camera in use and they had to wait for the film to be developed but the 3 day wait wasn't much a of a plot device. Just a really poor movie with very little story, which basically hacked 'E.T' for inspiration. I was expecting something more from a Spielberg production. I get the feeling that Abrams was offered a shot at making a movie but he didn't really have much of an idea what to do for a movie. Very disappointing."

","Castaways, alien invasion, and paranormal phenomenon are nothing new, but when they are re-imagined by J.J. Abrams, they sure seem that way. Like king midis, everything Abrams touches is pure gold and Super 8 is no exception. On the surface, the film seems like something you've seen a million times before, but it's Abrams twist, turns, and imagination that make it very different. What I loved about this film, was that it's a blockbuster film, with two major names behind it, and there wasn't any big stars attached to it. In fact, most of the cast never had a major role in anything, like the lead, Joel Courtney. I don't know how they found this kid. He had zero professional experience and he was fantastic. This movie is a gem, and while it seems like it's been done, you've never seen it done J.J. Abrams way. Super 8 is an evolved version of many similar films behind it and is one that they will talking about for years."

","I loved this movie so much that I created an IMDb account just so I could write a review. This movie is full of great action and effects, mystery and intrigue, but what makes it so much better than many recent movies with similar themes is that it is full of heart, and characters that you really care about. The entire thing is laced with emotion that, at several points, you can really feel in your heart, and this is helped along by the beautiful soundtrack. <br/><br/>Elle Fanning's performance makes me think that she is set for an Oscar one day (she's less annoying than her sister, let's put it that way), and although child actors are often extremely annoying, this certainly wasn't the case in this movie. <br/><br/>What I found especially enjoyable about this movie was all of the allusions and references to some of Spielberg's greatest early work (Close Encounters, ET). Of course, he was the producer, but this is not a lazy copy. Although you can predict some of the main plot points, there is not a moment of this film that is boring, with each individual scene throwing up a surprise, stunning action, snappy dialogue, or emotion. <br/><br/>I think this is a movie that most people will like. It's a story of healing, friendship, and homesickness, but it also has some awesome explosions, and a pretty scary...well, you'll see..."

","From SPOILER - I am very glad I did not spend money to see this thing at the theater, although if I had not seen other Spielberg movies, I think I would have enjoyed this flick a whole lot more. The story takes place in a small town and the new sheriff has to protect his community from a large shark – wait – a monster from outer space. Also involved are these kids who get together, and in order to conquer their fears, they join together and wander down a set of railroad tracks to look at another kid's dead body – wait – they are filming some kind of movie every kid back then did with their super 8 movie camera. Well during the filming of their movie and some nasty disaster happens. And what a disaster this ends up being. There is a horrific derailment of an EVIL US Air Force (the military is just so bad you knowbad, bad, bad!) cargo train. Did I mention that one of these kids was a pretty blonde girl living with her abusive, alcoholic dad who is always shouting, 'Run! Forrest! Run!' – wait – she is one of the main characters. Anyways these kids find this old pirate ship with all this gold on it – wait – they film this train wreck and out of the top pops this outer space guy who just wants to phone home – wait – he is a monster from outer space. Well he is not really a monster he is just a misunderstood cannibalistic nice space guy who has been chowing down on members of the town as a result of his close encounters – after SPOILER. This kind of a fun flick targeting a young audience, I am too old to fall into that category. If you like to hate the military that even makes the movie that much easier to enjoy – I did twenty and kind of like - and respect the military, so this is not my category either. It almost seems like most movie plots are peddled like they are the screams produced by the skillful minds of writers when they actually turn out to be no more than the talentless echoes resonating from the empty cerebral caverns of the inept."
"FairlyAnonymous","10","2","4","30 November 2011"," Excellently directed and great movie, even though it has some hiccups
","Super 8 far exceeded my expectations. This movie is interesting because you either like half of the movie, or you like all of the movie. I know a lot of people who say only the first half was good and the second half wasn't, but for me: I love all of it.<br/><br/>I will agree that Super 8 does not have the most original plot, but that doesn't mean it isn't an original movie. Super 8 purposefully uses a plot that resembles a Steven Spielberg movie from the 70s-80s. Super 8 is like Close encounters of the third kind, meets Cloverfield, meets E.T., meets the Goonies. Some people will say that makes it a rip-off, but then you entirely missed the purpose of the movie. The movie is making homage to those classic movies from 70s-80s while still being its own movie. I will mention that the movie is MUCH better the first time than the second time, because the first time is very mysterious while the second time is not mysterious. This review is based off my first time seeing.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is really good. I was shocked at how well the kids in this movie acted, and how well they actually acted like kids. They seemed very life-like and realistic, and also the kid love relationship in this movie was actually good and didn't seem lame.<br/><br/>The effects are very good, and the movie has this constant blue lighting theme which is pretty cool to make it look like the camera is a little messed up. The lighting is very nice. The CGI is pretty good, and the train destruction scene was over the top amazing! Some people may say that the train wreck was unrealistic, but in reality it wasn't. Train wrecks do look like that, and seeing as how the train had explosives that also adds to it. The creature (I won't give away its appearance) was cool and fairly frightening. There were quite a few jump scares but they didn't seem lame or unneeded except for maybe one time.<br/><br/>All in all an excellent movie that really pays tribute to the old movies, while still being great in its own sense. I am surprised at the excellent acting which actually makes up for any small problems. Good movies are usually judged by their ending, and this movie had an amazing ending... oh and the credits were quite enjoyable as well ha ha. Go see this movie if you understand that it's plot isn't original, but that doesn't make it a bad movie.<br/><br/>First viewing: 10/10 Second viewing: 9/10"
"lee_eisenberg","8","2","4","27 November 2011"," 1979 is back
","The plot of J.J. Abrams's ""Super 8"" is quite clear, and it is equally clear that the movie takes a lot of cues from producer Steven Spielberg's movies ""Close Encounters with the Third Kind"" and ""E.T."". But there's more that I interpret. The movie is set in 1979, when my parents' generation was approximately the age that my generation is now. Both years had seen a previous decade of cynicism. This year's Arab Spring is analogous to the Iranian Revolution that year, and the news clip about Three Mile Island brings to mind Fukushima. And of course, both years saw the economy faring poorly.<br/><br/>Of course, that's probably all a coincidence. The movie itself brings up good points about government cover-ups, while also showing kids having the most fun possible. Without a doubt I would have loved to participate in the making of that zombie flick.<br/><br/>As yet I haven't seen any other of J.J. Abrams's work. I don't know whether or not I'll get around to it, but ""Super 8"" definitely gives him a good name. I highly recommend it. Production value indeed!"

Honestly, I regret even paying half-price rental for this candy-assed load of sticky-sweet bubblegum nonsense. 'Super 8' was total cornball pap from start to finish, and an ideal flick for the kids' slumber party. Rest assured that youngsters won't be getting too many bad dreams after this one.

"mozohu","10","2","4","25 October 2011"," Amazing acting and directing.
","Let's just not avoid it, the story is at most average for a Sci-Fi. It's ET and alien horror hybrid. They just don't fit together. The surprise is, you just don't care!<br/><br/>In my opinion the story is intentionally like this, because it is only the secondary line in this film, and it's just necessary to have one. The main plot is about a bunch of children, the friendship between them, and a beautiful love story. There is a lot of personal crisis, mainly the ones that would prevent their love, and the role of the main story about the alien is just serves the good environment for their character development.<br/><br/>The characters, their story, and the acting is just beautiful, and the directing makes it even better! And the beautiful acting gets another twist, because they make a movie inside the movie, where they have different roles, and they play that personality through their main one... this just cannot be written down, you have to see it to understand.<br/><br/>Sadly the main source of negative reviews is that this film is categorized as Sci-Fi, and they concentrate about the main story line, which is secondary here. As a Sci-Fi I couldn't give 10/10, but as a film, it deserves even more, like an Oscar! This film is just the complete opposite of Skyline: That being an average-good Sci-Fi in a bad movie, while this is an average-bad Sci-Fi in an excellent movie!"

","During the summer of 1979, a group of friends witness a train crash and investigate subsequent unexplained events in their small town.<br/><br/>J.J Abrams has successfully brought back our memories from movies like E.T or The Goonies. People who complain about how similar they are, the film is SUPPOSED to bring back those movies into the modern day; and they did a damn good job. The acting to start is very real and very good, even for the kids. The score is beautiful and conjures mystery, suspense, and action all together. The kids grow on you and they remind me exactly of the kids on the Goonies, which I'm sure that was the point. It makes me mad how people cannot enjoy a movie without having to compare it to something, or complain how cliché it is. I'm not saying Super 8 is perfect; it's far from perfect, but it's a great way to bring back memories. I do have to complain about the over-dramatized action. How can a car/train collision cause that much havoc? And near the end, how does fighting one alien cause so much explosions and what not? Despite the flaws, the clichés, and the over-dramatized action, the film delivers what it was supposed to deliver and I highly enjoyed it. To add, why is everyone complaining about the ending? It was nice, I loved it actually. When people find one thing wrong with a film, it's automatically a bad movie. But overall, Super 8 is a beautiful film that brings back our childhood memories. I overall loved it. 10/10."

","Ever since I saw the 30-second trailer during the Super Bowl, I've been itching to watch this movie. Well, let me just say that on September 6th, two days after my fifteenth birthday and the day before school started, that itch was worth it.<br/><br/>Super 8 circles around a group of young teenagers that are trying to make their own zombie movie, filmed with a Super 8 camera. While doing so, they witness a train wreck, thus fleeing for safety. What the children don't know until later in the movie is that the camera videotaped what came out of the train, which causes the mysterious events that happen in their small town.<br/><br/>When watching this movie, I'm almost reminded immediately of The Goonies mixed with War of the Worlds or Cloverfield - although I didn't watch Cloverfield. The young cast did a wonderful job playing their parts, it seemed like it was their movie and they were the stars of the shows. There were also some surprises from the young actors as well, such as Dakota Fanning's little sister Elle being in this movie( I felt my mouth dropped when I saw how much she grew - not too long ago she was a little girl)and discovering that this movie is rather the first movie to perform in for two of the young male actors, which they did an amazing job at it.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was indeed worth waiting for. It made me laugh, jump, and smile as the juvenile heroes save the day. It depicts a couple of good messages that actually can be related to real life today. For a belated birthday gift, it was one of the best ones that I've gotten, sharing it with my siblings, and let me just say, this movie is no time- waster like some movies nowadays, so check it out when you have the time. You won't be disappointed."

","I'm a critical person when it comes to movies. I expect when I see a comedy that I will laugh, drama I will get emotional, action I will be at the edge of my seat, and sci-fi I will think about the possible what-if's.<br/><br/>This movie is a sci-fi, wanna be drama. It walks a fine line between the two classifications.<br/><br/>The movie starts out simple enough, but soon becomes complicated with too many questions. I liked the special effects, the acting, the dialog, and the ""hiding the alien"" until very late in the movie. I especially love this part because it was like Alfred Hitchcock's movies where he would let the viewer's imagination do all the work.<br/><br/>But too many questions leave me wondering if the director/writer skipped over what should have been an awesome sci-fi movie to instead try and fill what the studios wanted ""a touchy feel good movie"".<br/><br/>The cliché ending wasn't needed and was more like ""here at the last minute I'll put this in so some executive will be satisfied"". Talk about sacrificing art for business.<br/><br/>Over all it was an OK movie. Nothing I would purchase on DVD or want to see again."
"fighter2","7","2","4","12 June 2011"," Super 8... Super Satisfies
","Hats of to Spielberg who truly has a talent for spotting a great story. The film is a bit of a period piece that follows a young boy still coping with an emotional loss who unwittingly embarks on an adventure of finding himself and discovering love all while unraveling the mystery of a tragic train accident that hits his small town. This film strongly resembles the mystery of E.T. and the camaraderie of goonies. Good plot, great story. Abrams is great at using the camera and angles to build suspense and to properly place you in the action. I do feel the film suffers from snip happy editing; too much footage left on the cutting room floor. Though the released version is already near the two hour limit, an additional 30 minutes of character and story building would have made this an undisputed instant classic. As I'm suggesting the film should have been a little longer, I certainly enjoyed it ;-). Recommended."

","Initially the storyline had me intrigued, a train crashes very dramatically if rather unrealistic, caused by a man who warns the children that they'll kill them if they caught them, or something or other. So it's basically another alien/ government cover up type film. People go missing, the airforce is covering things up. Unfortunately just as I was expecting it to get exciting, we learn that all the alien wants is to get home. ""Oh? That's it?"" I thought. So it's pretty standard JJ Abrams, builds up to an interesting story, only to make it predictable and derivative. I mean an alien that was captured by the governent done experiments on, and wants to go home? Come on he could of done better than that."

The Air Force is there because the train supposedly carried items for them, but the deputy doesn't think it all adds up.<br/><br/>About 2/3s of the movie is just captivating. The kids are all pretty good in their roles not only seeming like genuine kids, but also, when filming their super 8 zombie movie, they genuinely seem like kids trying to make a kid directed movie. I think about myself trying to act like that at that age and I don't think I'd be able to do it.<br/><br/>The story unfolds in a manner that keeps you interested, with layer after layer adding mystery. I don't know exactly when it started to unravel, but at some point it seemed to lose it's magic and just turn into another alien movie.

I do wonder what it could have been.<br/><br/>Oh, and a couple of subplots did seem superfluous, such as the mother's death (no spoiler as it happens right at the beginning) and the large family of one of the friends.

Abrams (Mission: Impossible III & Star Trek), the story is intriguing from the get-go and the nostalgic touches plus nods to earlier classics are carried out in a tasteful fashion. The first act is an absolute delight that sets things up on a spectacular note and paves a solid groundwork for the rest of the story but it all goes awry as the film nears its conclusion.<br/><br/>The suspenseful moments are executed with finesse and effortlessly sustain their nail-biting intensity. Even the dramatic moments between the kids exhibit certain tenderness & understanding. The underlying mystery of it all drives the narrative. And performances from the cast is sincere. The ending isn't entirely a disaster but after such an explosive start, more was expected.<br/><br/>Overall, Super 8 had the potential to finish as one of the most enjoyable, thrilling & entertaining examples of its kind, and it does walk that path for a good portion of its runtime before stepping off the tracks and derailing in the final moments.

","This film is an interesting mystery sci-fi that revolves around a small group of teenagers with a passion for cinema. They have a common project for a film, but end up witnessing a major rail disaster while filming. It is immediately clear that the accident is very unusual, and that the military's interest in what happened is far from normal. Set in the late Seventies, a remarkable decade for sci-fi thanks to the fascination of aliens and technology in general, it is a film of familiar contours where mystery is well used.<br/><br/>The film is skillfully directed by J.J.Abrams, and presents a good story, with young teens taking the lead. The film strives to portray teenagers, the way they relate and even the family environment and the relationships between families, which are important for a very small community like this small town. I don't think sentimentality is bad, I think that in the right measure it brings depth to the film.<br/><br/>Elle Fanning and Joel Courtney are the main actors in the film, which gives a lot of scope for young actors to show what they are worth, and these two young actors have definitely done a good job here. Riley Griffiths is good, but not so good. In the adult cast, Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard deserve an especially positive mention, the latter giving life to a character that is rather unfriendly to the audience.<br/><br/>Technically, the film invests a lot in the environment, in creating tension. It is not that kind of film loaded with thunderous effects, but one where what is suggested matters more than what we see. Honestly, I think it's more interesting than most big-budget sci-fi films, which are basically shot on the green screen. This does not mean that it was not used here or that there are no effects: the film has good special and visual effects, a competent CGI and good sound, but it knows how to use these resources without exaggeration.

Although brilliantly done, there are a number of flaws. The train crash sequence is absolutely brilliant, but it seems too incredible that no one got hurt during all this. Also, despite all the chaos and explosions, the camera is still found exactly where they left it. And with containers and debris raining all over, their car is still left intact - not a scratch! This is simply not believable. And then they simply drive off - the tires would surely be punctured by all that debris.<br/><br/>I found the ending also too much of an E.T-ish happy ending. The creature in 'Super 8' is a destructive killing machine, yet at the end the sentiment is ""ahh, he just wants to go home"". Uhm, not believable.

","I rented this based on some very promising reviews (and some spectacular ones too!), but without knowing really anything about it. Let's just say, it wasn't anything near what I expected.<br/><br/>Now, that's not saying it was terrible, because it wasn't. I just wasn't expecting a kid movie. But, thank god for the kids, because without them, this movie would have been a complete train wreck (no pun intended ;)).<br/><br/>The kids were the movie. They all were great, with some great subtle lines and moments that reminded me of being a kid. They were the lifeblood of this movie, and were about the only reason to watch it. Some of the scenes between Joe and Alice were pretty good, as you could tell they liked each other. And it didn't hurt that the setting was 1979 either. The music sure was good! LOL <br/><br/>As with all Spielberg movies, there is a moral to the story here. Despite everything that happens in this movie: a train wreck, a military cover-up, an escaped monster, etc...., there's a theme of being able to let go and move on. And it took the Alien to meet Joe to realize that he could build a 'model' and go home and leave the pain behind. And in return, Joe learned to move on from his mother's death, as he let his amulet go and become part of the Alien's spaceship. Of course, this also brought Joe and his father closer, as well as Alice and her father. It was all a little corny, typical of Spielberg, but there's at least something of value to take away from it.<br/><br/>This wasn't a terrible movie, but it's far from the blockbuster that many think it is."

","Everything's fine. Everything but the ground story. And what's not fine is exceptionally bad, as in, really, really bad.<br/><br/>What I've always disliked about Steven Spielberg, whenever he is associated with a movie, regardless of whether he's producing it, writing it, or directing it, is that he has slowly transitioned from a perfectionist to a materialist. Maybe his specs need a new fit, or maybe he is just too ignorant to recognize the basic wrongs with his pieces. Sometimes, it's what you are instinctively capable of. Then, your wreck is justified. But receiving an enormous load of goo from a renowned personality, probably the most successful Hollywood celebrity (money wise, fame wise, and award wise) especially when he is in no way bound to tag himself to that pile of absolute garbage, is heart-breaking. And lately, he's been doing this a lot. Cowboys & Aliens being his worst sci-fi and mystery amalgam.<br/><br/>Super 8 is much like Cowboys & Aliens, except the cowboys. Instead of them, there are kids and county police, and army (which seems to be messing around with civilians for no genuine reason.) A massive train crash, followed by a secretive revelation about the deadly involvement of its stakeholder—the army—by the cause and victim of the crash ignites fear, confusion, and horror among the movie-making little kids of Lillian county. The contents of the train were slightly hampered by Joe Lamb, but it turned out, that it was just a mystery-stunt that had no practical importance to the movie itself. That content, by the way, vibrates like a dildo, is fast as a rocket, and is cubical, and it's claimed to be some kind of an equipment to resist the deadlier content of the wreck—a tree. Hahaha. Well, it's a Groot-like monster, an alien, so to say, who's interested in eating less important characters, and preserves more important ones. And, he's a f**king mechanic.<br/><br/>Super 8 is extremely vague, a half-hearted attempt at sci-fi, and a misleading movie. It's like those online websites that are trying to fool you by making you think that the live webcams—the supplementary Chrome tabs opening when you switch to porn—are actually live. If you believe that, you are good to go for the movie. If not, watch it for the kids. Because the drama that's incorporated into the so called sci-fi is ""mint."" The kids, their stories, and love stories, their parents, and all sorts of house stuff going on, is catchy. In fact, these are the only things that keep you stuck to your seats until the movie ends. And hey, watch the credits; the short zombie-film they were making plays then. But it's kind of desperate and sad that ""drama"" is what you find interesting in a sci-fi/thriller/mystery movie. That's the height of non-sensical money-grubbing bullshit this industry is plunging itself into.<br/><br/>J. J. Abrams is perhaps my most disliked director/writer for sci-fi. His Star Trek series is a total mess. His scripts, without mistake, lag all along. It seems like he was never prepared for writing in the first place. He writes, takes coffee, writes some more, sleeps, forgets about it, picks the pencil again, writes some more, but by that time, he has already forgotten what he talked about earlier, but doesn't bother to knock back a few pages to get it in rhythm. And that's exactly what he has done with Super 8. The idea itself was not so bad. But he has yet to learn that when you pick a theme, and corresponding characters, you have to stick with them to create details and story. Abrams, you are not yet Nolan to pick up totems. What exactly were those cubes? And why in such quantity? Where exactly did you use them? And if you had to show U.S Army as the primary villain of the movie, you should have gone into its depth, not just pick the very mainstream factors about it and shove it on the screen. Everybody knows the political and administrative pick they have. But do it with a class. You had Avatar to follow. Believe me, the archives are flowing with movies on army and its haters.<br/><br/>While I was watching the movie, I was almost fatalistic about it. There were some things extraordinary about the movie. For example, the chemistry between the kids, their suitability to the roles (although a little bit too bold, even though apparently they were shown afraid and confused,) their house stories (Charles, his sister (LOL,) Joe, his mother's death, the necklace, the accident and consequent quarrel of Mr. Lamb and Mr. Dainard, was all that made sense in the movie. While I think the kids were a good select, especially Elle Fanning, there's a heavy chance that their characterization was too flake. They were made to stick to certain things. Firecracker maniac, control freak, detective Pus*y—they all had their thing. The lead cast, however, did it sufficiently well to bring longing to the situation.<br/><br/>J. J. Abrams isn't t after all a bad director. He is just a bad writer, I guess, but not entirely so. He did write the kids' parts too. Bottom-line: When it comes to being associated with sci-fi(s), the guy simply doesn't have it. The depth, the understanding, and the subtlety with which logic (despite the movie being superficial) is distinguished from everything else. He's exactly like the pre-pubescents he portrayed in the movie: he thinks he can, but he can't, but he likes to give himself the benefit of the doubt, and so do most of the audience. But I'm not most.<br/><br/>I think Super 8 is just another regular movie you watch and forget, with the exception of Elle Fanning, who is kinda hot. No judgments; she is my age, after all."

","The biggest thing ""Super 8"" has going for it is its cast of child actors. They work well together, they're relatable, and their scenes are where this movie lives and breathes. Good performances, all around. But this movie sells itself as a loving homage to vintage Spielberg, and that's where it's disappointing. Abrams brings his trademarks (always with the lens flares) but gets lost in the reverence. It feels like the key parts of ""Goonies"", ""Close Encounters"" and ""E.T."" but none of the wonder. No soul. This is an empty vessel - very very skillfully made, but without heart.<br/><br/>5/10"

","""Super 8"" is a science fiction film written and directed by J.J. Abrams between his two Star Trek turns. Soon we will see him direct the next Star Wars movie and in his effort here from 2011, he works mostly with a cast of child actors. For Joel Courtney, it is the very first performance in a film and for that he did a pretty decent job. Elle Fanning, however, is a true professional with a long filmography despite her young age and it shows. She plays her part very well too. Even if ""Super 8"" was missing at the big awards shows, it was one of the movies from 2011 with the most awards and nominations.<br/><br/>I personally preferred the first half of the film. The second half was not terrible by any means, but getting to know the main characters was just more interesting then the second half which was packed with violence and action. The train crash scene early on was pretty exciting too. Also I did not like the second half that much as everything about the creature did not entirely convince me, for example how only a couple words from the protagonist turned it from an evil eater of human flesh (with a hate against humanity that rose over many many years) back to completely normal again, so it would leave the planet Earth. Apart from that, the accident from the woman early on and everything that followed afterward including the bonding between the widower and the one allegedly responsible for it did not really do too much for me. It added something, but the core for me was pretty much the story between Fanning's and Courtney's characters. Riley Griffiths played his role well too and stays in the mind. The other kids were fairly forgettable I thought. The only actor playing adult characters I knew was Kyle Chandler in this film. I usually like him, but here he did not do that much really for me. I felt his character was just too stereotypical and generic and somehow adds no uniqueness and charm.<br/><br/>Abrams here reunites with some of his crew from previous projects, including the aforementioned Star Trek movie, but also his television work on ""Lost"". One of these would be the Academy Award winning score producer Michael Giacchino. And Steven Spielberg is on board as well. All in all, I would not say that this film is as superb as the title suggests, but it is a solid watch and I'd recommend it particularly to those who love science fiction films. Those will also appreciate some of the cult and humorous moments like the sheriff (twice) and the clerk being attacked early on."
"jimbo-53-186511","4","0","0","13 May 2014"," Super 8 ain't that great
","Super 8 focuses on the lives of a small group of friends whose main interest is in creating movies. One evening whilst filming their latest movie, they witness a train crash. Following the aftermath, they are warned not to inform anyone else that they know about the incident otherwise they will be killed as well as their parents. Shortly after, mysterious and unexplained events begin to occur in the town.<br/><br/>I didn't mind so much that Super 8 felt like it had various elements of films we've seen before. Yes there wasn't much originality, but that wasn't really what bothered me. My biggest bug bear with this film was the majority of the child actors - particularly the kid who was the film director and the 'dynamite' guy. These 2 kids were just annoying as hell. The rest of the kids were also annoying with the possible exception of Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) and Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) who were actually fairly likable. All the kids were either shouting at each other or talking over each other. At times, it felt like I was watching an over acting contest. I was pleased when brief moments arrived when the kids weren't on screen just so that my ears were given a break.<br/><br/>Writer & Director Abrams does manage to inject some emotion into the film which at least gave the film and its characters a little bit of depth. Alice and Joe start to develop feelings for each other but Joe's dad and Alice's Dad don't want their children to see each other. This is because Joe's dad blames Alice's dad for his wife's death - this is due to the fact that Joe's wife and Alice's dad both worked together and Joe's wife ends up being killed in an accident whilst covering a shift which Alice's father should have been covering. This animosity between the 2 men clearly causes problems for Alice and Joe and their blossoming relationship, but the 2 men do put their differences to one side when they both work together to find their children. This was a nice aspect to an otherwise poor film.<br/><br/>Aside from the annoying characters, Super 8 never really held my interest. It's about 2/3 of the way into the film before you release why everything that has proceeded is occurring, by which time I had completely lost interest. The film was light on scares, light on character development. The only real hook with this is the mystery of what is happening in the town, but I felt that the mystery was drawn out far too long to really sustain interest.<br/><br/>There's very little going for this film and if I'm honest the old good aspects of this film were the train crash and the vague attempt that was made at developing some characters. It's let down by a lot of annoying characters and a lack of scares and a somewhat lethargic pace."

","SUPER 8<br/><br/>I remember watching this when the movie was first released. I thought it was very average at the time... but now I have watched it again I thought it was better the second time around.<br/><br/>The movie is about a group of kids that are trying to make a movie. One night they are filming on a train station when they witness a huge train crash... what they don't realise is that the train was carrying some alien creature that has now escaped.<br/><br/>The story is quite good. What I like about it is it has a lot of different levels to it. There is not just the one story about the alien... there are other elements to this film. The relationships that the characters have towards one another are really good and add a lot to the film. The relationship of the children with their parents is a big part of it. These kids are going through other things in their lives other than the disaster going on around them.<br/><br/>The film was shot to make it look like an older film than it is. It tried to feel like an 80s film... but failed mostly. There are moments that felt like it could have been made in the 80s. We have the hair, the cars, the soundtrack... but for some reason it is still missing something. I just can't put my finger on what it is. Maybe the effects are too good. I think if the effects were more 80s then it might have had the right atmosphere.<br/><br/>The acting was good throughout from everyone. The movie stars Joel Courtney, Ryan Lee, Zach Mills, Riley Griffiths, Gabriel Basso, Ella Fanning, Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard. All deserve a lot of credit, but the best performance by far came from Ella Fanning. She has a lot of talent just like her older sister. I always thought that children were terrible actors and mostly annoying, but the Fanning sisters were both amazing when they were little. I just hope that they continue on and become big stars. They deserve it.<br/><br/>I was a little disappointed that we didn't see the alien sooner. I understand the suspense side of things and I agree with it in a lot of ways, but I did think that the alien could have been seen a bit more in the film. It also took the creature too long to even make it's first appearance in the film.<br/><br/>The movie was directed by J. J. Abrams. So as you can imagine, there was a bit of lens flare... no wait, a lot of lens flare. It was crazy! At some points I thought it was ridiculous. On the bright side though... Steven Spielberg was involved in this film also. These guys work well together.<br/><br/>I did like this film, but unfortunately I am not sure there was too much memorable in it. I can't guarantee that I will remember this film 1 year down the line. Only time will tell.<br/><br/>I will give this film 6 out of 10.<br/><br/>""Excuse me, can I have another order of fries?

","Goonies + Aliens = Super 8<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams is well known for his awesome work on television and cinema, but this time I was disappointed. I expected more, much more. The movie is about some 70s children who get into a mysterious adventure. It looks very, let me stress it out, VERY similar to Goonies. The plot is different of course, but Goonies and Super 8 are ""brothers"". In my opinion, J.J. Abrams thought about Goonies' popularity and then created a similar movie to be such as successful. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie is good, but a cliché, just don't expect much.

","On the whole, Super 8 is a fun, exciting experience for anyone from nerds to jocks, teens to adults (note the certificate) and film gurus to bored families. I thought the plot, while somewhat generic when compared to similar films, was sound, had its moments and was adequate in terms of the balance between action and drama. The CGI, too, was good to the point that it was convincing, and I thought the acting, especially by the younger members of the cast, stood out among films in this genre as being very good. Joel Courtney is impressive as the troubled Joe Lamb, Elle Fanning is excellent as the equally troubled Alice Dainard, and the rest of the child cast contribute to the humour and drama shared within the group of kids with their quirky personalities and funny one-liners. Generally a great family film (watch out for one use of the 'f' word) that will be enjoyed by all who watch it. So I give a relatively -super 8/10 for Super 8."

As early teenagers, they are bound by limitations set by the law, and their parents. These kids will have to be more creative and resourceful.

But, when the train crash happens in the film, I already felt like I'd seen this before.<br/><br/>But, that's not written how I mean it to sound. This is a great film on multiple levels. J.J Abrams is becoming predictable, but unlike Michael Bay's level of absurdity, Abrams makes his films work with the ridiculousness.<br/><br/>Overall this is just another alien invasion film and has a similar feeling to it as Cloverfield. But, instead of an adult subplot that nearly dominated that film, this film has a surprising ensemble cast of kids. It has a feel of The Goonies mixed with Cloverfield.<br/><br/>Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths proved that no experience doesn't mean that you can't be captivated by an unknown actor in this debut performance. My one gripe for them is Riley's overused ""mint"" line during the film.<br/><br/>However, perhaps the most amazing accomplishment is the acting performance of Elle Fanning. I'd seen her sister, Dakota, in many films before and thought she was decent, but I was blown away by Elle. Not just her acting, but her elegant beauty similar to Bonnie Wright and her innocence because of her age gives off this great next door girl vibe and makes the film much more spectacular.<br/><br/>Combined with the astonishing acting by everyone involved -- including Noah Emmerich -- the special effects and sound effects make this movie complete gold cinema in my eyes. It's just got the feel of a instant classic and due to the homages to '70s films, it feels like an old '70s Super 8 film.<br/><br/>I can't say anything bad about the film because quite honestly, I didn't see anything bad in the film. Steven Spielberg helped J.J Abrams craft a truly remarkable alien invasion movie that can't be forgotten in a couple years. Years -- perhaps decades -- to come, this movie will be a cult classic."

","people told me to stay away from this flick because I probably wouldn't like it. The reason was that Steven Spielberg was involved. To be honest, I don't have any problems with the man, his early work I liked a lot, for example Duel (1971) and Jaws (1975) but later on he became tame and made flicks in the style of Disney, polished and made for the whole family. J.J. Abrams was also involved. Men, did I like Alias (2001 - 2006). It was so great and he really did add suspense towards the series and his early flicks but slowly (around Cloverfield (2008)) he also moved further to major productions although Fringe is still excellent. <br/><br/>Both directors collide in Super 8 and it shows. After seeing it i thought, well, this is just E.T. for the next generation. The effects are sublime but nothing really happens. In fact due the youth involved it reminded me of E.T. and the army did ring a bell too, Close Encounters Of A Third Kind (1977), another Spielberg gem. You can easily spot that J.J. tried to do something with the monster, it do attacks but no blood or gore is added towards that monster. But the overall look of the monster (CGI) is laughable. You never see the monster until the last part and J.J. clearly tried to redo Cloverfield. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the references by the youth who are trying to make a Super 8 flick towards horror and books concerning make-up. But further it had nothing to deliver even as the kids did a fine job acting.

","For me, Super 8 is the film of 2011. Let me explain why. JJ Abram's movie is presented, more or less, as an affectionate homage to those 80's whimsical fantasies that Steven Spielberg either directed or produced. Take some E.T. add a little Goonies then stir in Close Encounters and maybe a tiny bit of Poltergeist and you get is a warm, heartfelt and engaging movie. The main character Joe {Joel Courtney} is nicely portrayed as the average kid, a little shy maybe and as the film opens he is coming to terms with the death of his mother and then re-establishing a relationship with his father, the local deputy. There's an early teen crush on a local girl and of course his small circle of friends who gather to make amateur horror films. It's as they are shooting their latest production, again an affectionate homage, this time George Romero, that they witness a terrible train crash and so a mystery begins. The production teams' exhaustive search for the right cast has paid real dividends especially with the kids as they are excellent which isn't normal for a Hollywood feature. They're relaxed, likable and not in any way pretentious or emotionless. Abram's control of tension and suspense is superb, when this is combined with well realised set pieces it makes for a journey that is well worth the ride. Yes its nostalgic, yes there are elements that we may have seen before but when you take into account summer movies over the last few years it's good to see one that doesn't have an over inflated ego. More importantly it's fun."

Nothing wrong with the basic story line, decent casting, but I really thought that the editing could have been paced a good bit slower to increase the basic tension of the build-up in the story.

","Watching this movie is like skiing down a mountain. The beginning is really nice, but the end is just flat and boring. This is a movie created with no climax, and two stories that just do not mix (kids making movie) (monster chase).<br/><br/>I expected the movie to be like a roller coaster ride, where there would be a lot of thrill, and then in the end an ultimate showdown and a winner. However, this did not happen due to many of the sub stories that were occurring. One about the air force, the next about the fathers, and finally the kids. By having this much to cover it makes it a difficult movie to end. I was disappointed when the movie did end leaving everything hanging. It did not seem realistic to me at all. An example is the army firing at something they cannot find. Or just how the kids thought it would be fine to keep shooting a movie even though they clearly witnessed a monster escaping from the wreck. Also there was very poor character development. Not enough time was put into introducing the REAL characters because most of them were so consumed in acting as another one. This resulted in no suspense for majority of the movie. No suspense means no roller coaster ride, and that means no fun to watch.<br/><br/>Overall I feel like the movie did not really end like it should have. It left too many things untold, and ultimately left the audience very confused. I feel like the transition from the kids making a movie to a monster chase is a terrible idea.

This film is kind of enjoyable and it remains true to its revival of old classics, however it suffers from several drawbacks.

Spielberg does a good job of putting together the characters and they are good characters, each with their own mystery and little story to unravel as the film progresses. It has some good comedic elements. (SPOILER) The story of the alien monster is interesting, and visits subjects such as racism, inhumane animal testings, how bad treatment can turn a good person into one filled with hate and revenge (END SPOILER). The special effects and the action scenes are also well done and interesting. So far so good.<br/><br/>However, as I said, the film does have one major drawback which damages the overall experience. The kids although interesting, get in the way of the plot. Previews of the film try to sell the monster as the main plot, but in reality it's the kids that are the main plot. It would be fine in other films, but in this case you have a rampant and mysterious monster abducting/killing people and gathering technology, but you never really find out why except at the end of the film. Whenever the film is about to get boring, the creators throw in the monster to keep the viewer watching, but then the monster vanishes suddenly and no one in town really seems to care except the kids, who go on about it for about 2 minutes before returning to their boring plot. This is the same strategy followed in Cloverfield, however in Cloverfield this works fine, because you are seeing the characters constantly under stress from the destruction ensuing around them. Here you just see some action, followed by overstretched drama that shouldn't exist in a film like this. It seems the monster and the army/scientist plot was just put there to attract more people to the film and wasn't really expanded that much. This made me feel cheated throughout the film.<br/><br/>(SPOILER) Another drawback is the plot holes starting to appear towards the end of the film. Mainly, the actions of the townspeople who are still oblivious to the existence of a monster in their city despite all the weird killings and thefts that occur throughout the film (and the major presence of the army requisitioning everything and everyone) and also the really underplayed monster never really gets to show its character in the film (like it was in ET, where the film was a success because it expanded a lot on ET's character and gentle heart). We do learn how it came to Earth and why it's angry, but not much about who it really is. (END SPOILER)<br/><br/>My third and final quarrel with the film is the overuse of sensitive blue light filters. In every scene throughout the movie, we see lights flashing directly in the camera from the most minute source of light. There was a time when this was considered really bad directing, and I don't understand what has changed now. Spielberg tried to give the feel of amateurism in the film to reflect how the kids were also doing an amateur horror film. However, this could have been achieved with less annoying ways or with just less lights. JJ Abrams' Fringe does the same thing with lights to show the change from universe to universe, but it only happens once or twice throughout an episode. Not every friggin 2 minutes. It gets quite tiring, and made me flinch away from the screen every time it happened. I felt like I was in an epileptic's nightmare (I kid you not it can get really annoying).<br/><br/>I guess if you can ignore the crappy light effects, this can be a quite enjoyable movie if you are just looking for a new movie that revisits classic themes such as childhood friendship and is something to relax to with buddies. It's not anything exciting, but can be enjoyable. However don't go in expecting to see the greatest film of all time, as I heard a lot of people saying to me. It certainly isn't and it saddens me that it could have been a lot better."

","Yes! It is one part 'Cloverfield' with a dollop of 'ET' and a dash of 'Goonies'. Now, if it was a bad movie then the vultures could gather and shred this corpse. It wasn't a bad movie. But, it is far from original in any respect and, unfortunately, it began to be a let-down, plot-wise, toward the end as you witnessed all of the formulaic elements come together and merge into an ending that tries so hard to compel a tear from the viewer's eye. There's no surprises. It's almost thought provoking -- just barely -- yet it tsunamis any morals away by the time the alien makes his(her?) final exit. I suppose if you like good sci-fi with entrenched morals you could always go watch an old Outer Limits. You won't find it here. Still, the acting is excellent, the special-effects are top-notch....in fact, the movie is very well made. But, we've been down this road before...and we'll likely be going down it again. It's inevitable. I don't mind. A little originality would be a nice surprise. I do think ""they're"" running out of ideas for alien configurations, though. There is a long build-up before you get to see it and then it's >groan<. More convoluted spins on ideas already beat to death. At the end of the day this movie is most likely for the mid to low adolescent crowd. It has at least that much wisdom."

","Super 8 cites a lot of movies, mainly every Spielberg movie from the late 70s and 80s, and the Goonies. But unlike in those movies, the kids in Super 8 seem strangely nonchalant about events around them that are supposed to be marvelous and exciting.<br/><br/>Remember the kids in E.T.? They were concerned about the alien every single second. The guy in Close Encounters? He got so obsessed that he formed plateaus from mashed potatoes. His normal daily life ceased to exist. All those characters got so involved with the events around them that their everyday lives didn't matter anymore.<br/><br/>But the kids in Super 8? They survived a train disaster which had things exploding and wagons flying for minutes, they got told that they would likely get killed for having seen something that they shouldn't, their town got occupied by military while people and dogs keep disappearing. Yet, none of that seems to impress them. They are too busy making an amateur horror movie, falling in love with another, and having trouble with dad. There is a scene where the kids watch a strange cube they found at the train wreck developing a life of its own and punching a hole in the house wall. In another scene, a kid sees disturbing things at a cemetery. Do they care? Not enough to even mention these events in the scenes following. And even the main idea of the plot, that the kids accidentally filmed something secret, goes nowhere. The film's content is revealed so late that it doesn't matter anymore.<br/><br/>How is the viewer supposed to grow a sense of awe and wonder about the miraculous events if even the characters are more concerned with their amateur movie or their troubles with dad or with any other randomly tossed-in subplot? Super 8 completely lacks the sense of awe and wonder of the movies it attempts to be a homage of. <br/><br/>It took Elliot the length of an entire movie to grow a relationship with ET. Super 8 goes the express way, thanks to instant empathy. Near the end, the alien just touches the boy, they totally understand another within a second, the boy tells the alien something along the lines of ""time heals all wounds"", the alien flies off, and everything is sweet and happy. So sweet that everyone has forgotten the alien's killing spree of some minutes ago as well as its habit of storing people and eating them alive (though the movie is vague about this). Bad things happen, and time heals all wounds, after all... The boy seems so eager to forget the ""bad things"" that he pretentiously lets the medallion of his dead mother go and become part of the spaceship. Basically, we're told that remembering your dead mum is a bad habit that you better get rid of so you can dedicate yourself to fun things.<br/><br/>I think the movie would have been ten times better if it skipped all those random, pretentious, fake emotional subplots about mums and dads and falling in love and concentrated more on its entertaining bits: the effects and the funny amateur horror movie subplot."

","I saw this movie in theaters and enjoyed it, but then I read some negative reviews and decided to watch the movie again to see if I missed something, boy did I miss something.<br/><br/>The dialouge pretty much every kid sounds like Eli Roth wrote the film which is strange seeing how JJ Abrams made good dialouge for the teenage crew of the enterprise in Star Trek. And Just Like in Star Trek..<br/><br/>The two dads relationship makes no sense, why does Joe's dad act like Alice's dad killed Joe's mom? it was an accident and Joe's dad does not realize that until four months after the fact and grows unnecessary hated for Alice's dad.<br/><br/>How did a fire cause the town to evacuate, why didn't the military just commandeer the town?<br/><br/>If Charles likes Alice and wanted to get to know her by putting her in the film why didn't he, you know get to know her? He should have and would have spent time with her showing her exactly what he wanted to see on the film instead of constantly making Joe give her makeup?<br/><br/>The military is molding tire tracks which goes no where and why didn't they try following the footprints the monster made when he escaped the train!<br/><br/>But the worst part is the ending, as many people have said. The movies that inspired this movie have a good message behind them, the message in this movie is that bad things happen. Not only is this message weak but it's not even a real message it's just a statement sort of like how this movie is just a statement by JJ Abrams saying ""I Like Spielberg Films"" <br/><br/>The movie does have potential which is why this movie isn't a 1 but there is just so much bad stuff in this movie as you might see"

","Super 8<br/><br/>Super 8... What kind of a movie would one expect, reading the title while never heard anything else about it. With the current superhero-movie exploitation that dominates our cinemas, it's very easy to make a link towards that genre. it's what I thought at first, something among the likes of ""Heroes"" meets ""The Fantastic 4"".<br/><br/>The only thing I heard about it before watching, was that it was directed by Steven Spielberg (you know, that epic director who just seems he can't make a bad film.) and the word ""Sci-fi"" was associated with it. Steven Spielberg and Sci-fi... Now - I was born in the late 80's and grew up with sci-fi films alike ""ET"", ""The Goonies"", ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"" and ""The Iron Giant"" (And ""Predator"" and ""Aliens"" of course, but let's just keep on track here). I remember, as a youngster, sitting in my living room wearing my pajamas's, putting in video-cassettes of those films in the VCR. I loved those movies. They had a certain friendly mood in them and delivered a great atmosphere. <br/><br/>""Super 8"" reminded me of those movies.<br/><br/>This is classic Sci-fi Spielberg, like it could have been made in the late '80s or mid '90s.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is very good, reminded me a bit of ""Invaders From Mars"". Very moody and fantasy-like. It's being used well in every scene too. Some scenes involve illogical behavior and dialog here and there. But you're too busy enjoying and being carried away with it. It has some scary parts every now and then, but nothing really to keep your kid away from the TV-screen (well, except your Amish or so - ow wait, they don't watch TV) I'd give it a 7/10 and would watch it again.<br/><br/>Don't judge a book by it's cover?

","I knew nothing about Super 8 going in aside from the trailer, that JJ Abrams made it and that Steven Spielberg was somehow involved. Since watching the film I have seen a JJ Abrams interview and read a review that totally gave a major plot development away.<br/><br/>I will try not to do that here, as I think I would be pretty p*ssed if someone gave away such information prior to me watching it Super 8 is set on the cusp of the 80s in a small town in the United States named Lillian. In the opening moments we can see that there has been an accident in a local steel mill, moments later we learn it was the mother of Joe, a local boy (I would say 'teen' but he is really still a 'boy').<br/><br/>With the summer break arriving and both Joe and his policeman father still coming to grips with the unexpected passing, Dad thinks Joe would be well served spending his free time at a youth camp.<br/><br/>Joe decides he'd rather commit his summer to helping his portly budding director chum as he finishes up his homemade zombie opus. Joe will be on makeup and special effects duties.<br/><br/>So unbeknownst to Dad, Joe and five other local kids head off in the late evening to complete some scenes, the unexpected inclusion of young Alice only sweetens the deal for Joe When the filming of the first big scene of the night is interrupted by a massive train crash that occurs within metres of the 'set', the course of the entire summer is instantly changed. And probably their lives whatever.<br/><br/>I might digress here by saying that the train crash is so spectacular and action packed that it seems determined to subvert the very laws of science and nature. For almost two minutes after the initial impact carriages and debris are still hurtling about the place, always perilously close to one kid or another.<br/><br/>But with no-one hurt (!) the shaken sextet gather up their stuff and head home hoping that the approaching vehicles saw them, and more importantly that their parents were aware that they were even out of the house.<br/><br/>The train wreck is understandably all over the news the next day in Lillian, but the kids swear that they will not tell a soul that they were there, nor that they saw one of their teachers at the scene and strongly suspect he had something to do with it.<br/><br/>I'll leave the exposition there, but can inform you that the how/why/what/where and who's? are all answered in the ensuing hour or so.<br/><br/>The secret to enjoying Super 8 to the fullest is understanding what it is aiming to be. In my opinion this is a film that aspires to be a 21st Century equivalent to The Goonies, a light, fun and most of all non-confrontational film for kids.<br/><br/>Super 8 is perhaps less focused, less creative than The Goonies, and features many big explosions and other noisy distractions near the end, but it has no real violence nor truly scary scenes, and no sex or profanity to speak of.<br/><br/>Like The Goonies it isn't really that hilarious or even action packed, but it moves along at a swift pace and never causes you to check your watch or even look away. Super 8 is hardly Die Hard, The Last Boy Scout, Bad Boys or even Aliens, but you could do a lot worse. (And I didn't name Bad Boys because I think it is good I don't.) Final Rating – 7 / 10. An action film with 'other' elements to keep the younger lads content, with a sort-of romantic subplot building to make sure the girls don't leave.<br/><br/>I'd much rather lil Billy n Bessie spent a couple hours watching Super 8 than the latest Saw knock-off or Saw itself for that matter."

","Written and directed by J.J. Abrams, accompanied by producer Steven Spielberg, ""Super 8"" is a sci-fi thriller about creatures from the unknown. But at it's heart, it's a movie about forgetting the terms of the past, and growing up. Set in the late 70s, the movie is about a group of kids who experience a deadly train crash while filming a movie on a Super 8 camera. Then, when something breaks out of the train, none of the children has any idea of what has just emerged. Then, the city experiences unexpected disappearances, a power outage, and missing dogs. For all we know, that thing could be an alien. ""Super 8"" is a classic tribute to Steven Spielberg's classic sci-fi flicks like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""E.T."". Every moment feels like watching a classic nostalgic sci-fi. This is a thrilling, suspenseful, and masterfully accomplished film, directed beautifully by J.J. Abrams. Every moment kept me on the edge of my seat, because I was entertained by the heartbreaking drama, suspenseful action, and all the amazing special effects, music, and sound. The performances by the young cast including Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, and Riley Griffiths were all just special, when they do things that any adult actor would do. From their feelings of freaking out, and their inappropriate swearing, they make this movie stand out for what it really is. The only problem with the film was it's cheesy ending. It was disappointing, that it felt like it was too quick to end the movie already, and it's really silly. The rest of ""Super 8"" is crystal clear perfect. This is a spectacular film, and it's one of the best of 2011. The young performances, the special effects, the classic storyline, and that Spielberg touch helps make a classic sci-fi. ""Super 8"", in my review, ""a thrilling tribute of Spielberg sci-fi""."
"DukeEman","6","0","0","23 December 2011"," It had all the elements, but...
","It began as an entertaining movie with lovable and heartwarming characters, but it got sillier as it attempted to search for an ending. There were plenty of ways for the storyline to thread through, but the wrong path was chosen and after all that wonderful and playful built up, it fell flat on its face.<br/><br/>The most enjoyable aspect of the movie was the kids making the super 8 zombie film (I did it back in the late seventies). While all the madness was occurring around them, they persisted in trying to complete this film, utilizing the chaos. It was fun to see the shenanigans the kids got up to make such a film and what goes on behind the scenes of movie making is just like the grown-up world of filmmaking. The teenage love interest on the set was also a pure delight.<br/><br/>The other interesting aspect of the film was the distrust of the military, who mislead & jeopardized a peaceful town for their own interest. The same as today, but with the media taking on the role.<br/><br/>Production values where of the highest order, enhancing the visual story telling. It's just a shame that not too much thought went into the last act of the screenplay. But overall it was fun and worth munching on popcorn while watching it."

Another reviewer mentioned that it had an E.T. feel to it and I would have to agree. It even gave me the same feel good feeling while I was watching it. I thought the acting was very good for most, especially Elle Fanning.. She was simply amazing.

","When I was kid growing up in the 80's, I loved American cinema. They offered a promise of how life could be to kid growing up in a grim and ordinary Yorkshire town. The kids in the films where all confident and sassy, with access to technology you could only dream of. They talked to each other on walkie talkies and made movies on their own hand held cameras. The walkie talkies i had lost range at the end the end of the drive, and no one i knew had there own super 8 camera. Later on I discovered that some people did, but they used them for things less salubrious. As I grew older, and the world became smaller. The America of my childhood became less foreign, more ordinary, and often, quite grotesque. But anyway, for an awkward child, living through what was, this side of the pond at least, and unimpressive decade. Films like The Explorers, The Goonies, Back to the future, The Navigator, E.T. and the like offered the kind of escapism that I was looking for. And I feel that this is what Abrams was looking for. When I watched Super 8 I was whisked back to 9 year old self. Suddenly America was awesome once more. The town, the cars, the BMX's all had sheen of some new and exciting. The kids, so ineffable cool and self assured. I wanted to there, I wanted to be those kids. I wanted to be sat in my room surrounded toys I never knew existed, with posters on the wall of cars and half naked ladies. The room much messier than my parents would have ever allowed, and talking to my friend on a walkie talkie about some major event that will change our lives forever. Dodging bullets and missiles in town that is being raised to the ground, to save a friend, and in our own meek way, save everyone else. Abrams, at heart, is a movie geek. What he gives here is a glimpse of his own childhood memories of film geekery, and a an unabashed nod to Spielberg. The film is littered with references to his films, from E.T. to Raiders of the Lost Ark. I had much fun spotting those as I did the story. He also knows how to give a story heart. The film isn't really about an alien, it's about a bunch of people overcoming their own failings and personal tragedies, to learn to forgive, forget and love... and even, you know, hug. from the previous reviews, I can see that this film is not everyone. Though I honestly believe that if you are over 30 or under 13 this film is as good as it gets. I loved it, and I am sure, when I take the kids with me to watch again this weekend, they will too."

I thoroughly enjoyed the likes of Lost, MI-3 and Star Trek, and I even forgave him for putting Cloverfield out there (Am I the only person who couldn't get past the terrible acting?) So when the teaser trailers sprouted up for Super 8, it jumped to the top of my 'Things To Do in 2011' list.<br/><br/>After viewing the film, I found it to be... OK. It isn't the worst film I've seen this year, but I was gravely disappointed.<br/><br/>In great Spielberg-fashion, Abrams' attention to detail in this film is spot on. From the model trains to the bedroom posters, the '70s feel is very authentic and charming. I found the pace of the film to be good, despite many reports that some found it to be slow and boring (ADD and Xbox Live will do that to you). The child actors held their own, which is a rare thing these days. Super 8 didn't rely on visual effects, which again is a rare thing in a summer blockbuster. In many respects, this film is a success.<br/><br/>For me though, Abrams was trying too hard to be like Spielberg. I know that's like me complaining to my wife that she looks too much like Natalie Portman. But I couldn't help but feel like Abrams had sold out a little. JJ can bring a great deal to the table in terms of making a fairly dull concept (Star Trek) into an exciting piece of entertainment (Star Trek). Unfortunately, it was almost as if he didn't have the confidence to create a film which he could call his own. So he put Close Encounters, ET, The Goonies etc in a blender and served up what came out. He didn't need to, and that's why I'm disappointed.<br/><br/>Still, the Star Trek sequel is at the top of my 'Things To Do in 2013' list, and Super 8 hasn't changed that."

","In 1982, Steven Spielberg produced a movie called ""E.T."" which went to become an instant classic. In it, an alien is stranded on Earth and a child is helping the frightened creature return home, defying authority and following his heart. This film has an eerily similar plot.<br/><br/>There are differences, though. This alien is huge, has no problem killing people and only in one scene seems to blend into a semblance of the E.T. we know and love. The effects are obviously better and the kids are brilliant in their play, especially Elle Fanning, who at 13 seems to be an already well established actress.<br/><br/>Bottom line: this is more of a thought provoking film, rather than a kiddie, heart melting, ""Awww"" thing.

There's a bit of ""hommage"" to director J.J. Abrams LOST series on TV and a bit more to the ALIEN series, but there are also some E.T. moments to dilute the scariness factor.

","IMAX REVIEW: *** out of (****)<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams' 2009 action-heavy extravaganza (""Star Trek"") was a refreshing summer blockbuster that was not only dependent on special effects but a well crafted script and performances as well. This summer, Abram's ""Super 8"" is the same deal. Except it includes some nods to ""E.T."" and ""The Goonies"" for added measure.<br/><br/>""Super 8"". Think of it this way: Copy and paste the monster from ""Cloverfield"", make it less ominous looking, add the last 30 minutes of ""E.T."", spice in some ""The Goonies"", add the government interference and BAM! You have ""Super 8"". <br/><br/>Since there's been so much positive buzz from Abram's latest project, what are some of its flaws? First and foremost, the clichés. While this is an incredible piece of fiction, the amount of clichés is just unbearable. The adults being oblivious, the government subplot, the love interest, the climactic ending. It's all there. And also, for a film about us trying to have sympathy for the kids, they weren't exactly the friendlist or most caring people. It was hard to have a heart for them when they themselves didn't have one.<br/><br/>Now, onto the positives. First off, the acting is pretty top-notch. Even the people you can't just stand give it their all. Moreover, the film is entertaining from start to finish. Every shot keeps you immersed and drawn in. Oh and did I mention the train wreck scene? That has got to be THE scene of the summer. It was so competently made and authentic that it sent chills down my spine, especially in its IMAX glory. Furthermore, when the film builds suspense, it doesn't just build it. It makes you FEEL the suspense. It's almost secondary. I was literally on the edge of my seat at some moments. And lastly, the nods to the older movies was very classy and well done.<br/><br/>In a time where disposable trash like ""Transformers"" gets green lit, it's nice to see something like this get out to the public. What J.J. Abrams has crafted is beautiful. While it isn't the masterpiece we were all expecting, it's still a solid movie nonetheless. And hey, doesn't every movie have its flaws? Flaws and all, this is one hell of a movie. Thumbs up for J.J. Abrams and his crew."

All hung over from last night and really not feeling like leaving the house at all we decided to go anyway because the trailer, the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg produced film and the current IMDb rating (a 7,6) created some good expectations.<br/><br/>However, this movie shows that having a fairly big budget and a famous mainstream block buster producer not necessarily is a guarantee for an epic production. The annoyingly poor use of after effects, the constantly over analyzing teen cast, the dull dialogs, and the boring, mood swing having, evil creature really made me want to go to my bed to have a nice lucid dream instead.<br/><br/>The story line did not at all satisfy me enough to be excited about what would happen at the end of this movie, basically i was just struggling to stay awake."

","Super 8 has been credited that at above all, at least it is not a reboot or sequel. Isn't it? I went to see Rise of the plant of the apes, and despite being a reboot, is actually more of an original movie than this one. This is Cloverfield set in a small town instead of New York, and the main characters are in their early teens and not early twenties. It could have been called Cloverfield 2 for what it is worth. And its rubbish.<br/><br/>The story could be a good one, the kids can act and I'd agree it starts well enough (even though the dynamic of the kids friendships is instantly worrying because of its familiarity). But the basis of the story makes no sense, some very dramatic and 'world news' notable events take place and nobody batters an eye lid or changes their daily plans of activities or leaves town for outside assistance (all the town car engines and electronically devices have gone, all the towns dogs ran away on the same day, black outs, major rail crash and loads of people have gone missing). Why are the main characters kids, doesn't make any sense, It's cheesy and corny like the Goonies, but this is too scary a film for young children to watch. It would have been better to see the dynamic of an older group of friends in the town than kids. Because it's kids it introduces serious problems with the story. They are all nearly killed very traumatically at the very beginning (final destination style) and yet all agree to go home and tell no one in fear of getting into trouble. I'm annoyed with the film from this very premise as none of them seem bothered by this event. Then whilst all these horrible things are happening and people are going missing (including one of their dads), they carry on making their film each day as if it was business as usual, what kind of a crazy town is this where kids recover from serious trauma so easily.<br/><br/>Then there's the romantic development between the main character and his love interest, he's about 12 and she's old enough to drive (though doesn't have her licence yet), its a very unlikely and awkward romance. And the two of them are overly emotional and poignant when it doesn't make sense to be or that you would expect kids of this age to be, it seems out of place. True heroism in the face of adversity, fine with pirate ships and cute bicycle basket aliens, not so believable when its a monster akin to Cloverfield, they would be petrified, they are too young to take such roles in the story.<br/><br/>The main kid and his dad, poor effort to build audience empathy for their relationship. I felt more empathy for the Dad of the vomiting child in The Sixth Sense, (and he only had a couple of scenes in his film to manage that), than i did for the father in this film even after the whole movie.<br/><br/>And why the 80's, I didn't even know it was the 80's in the film to begin with, I don't know who did set design and costume, but even when the kid in the petrol shop is listening to Blondie, i genuinely though he just trying to be pastiche. It was only when the sheriff makes the ubiquitous comment 'you kids these days and your modern Walkmans, what ever next', that i realised that it was set in the 80's.<br/><br/>It doesn't need to be realistic, its a film, but it does need to be convincing and make sense and if people are to gain any connection with the characters, they have to at least act in some way proportionately to the events that have happened. Its obvious, predictable (long quiet pause...monster jumps out...long quiet pause....monster jumps out....long quiet pause....you guessed it, monster jumps out), melodramatic and offers nothing new, in fact a little insulting to an adult audience. And if I have to watch another film where characters should be running for their lives and instead take time out and practically stop the film to fit in a romantic or sentimental moment I'm gonna start throwing things at the screen. Monsters don't wait for people to finish their lines, Monsters eat people who stop for a chat. Super 8? super c**p indeed."

","J.J.

Now comes the movie, the first half was really exciting and you get the feeling of Spielberg's hit movie E.T. But the second half, although it had most of the action but was not as captivating or thrilling as the first half. Abrams did a great job directing the movie and a balance between the acting and the visuals but what was realized was the ""Spielberg"" 80's way of directing an alien movie which spoiled what the movie was trying to reach as a blockbuster movie. But overall, it was an enjoyable movie which has it's thrilling parts but it failed to deliver a thrill ride similar to Cloverfield (Abrams was producer) or a memorable alien movie."

","A group of children filming their own Super 8 movie as train derails find the army descending on their town as the crash has released a dangerous presence.<br/><br/>Even though Steven Spielberg produced  Poltergeist and Goonies, they oozed his early hallmarks and Super 8 is no exception. The portrayal of family life, some happy, some dysfunctional, children's seemingly off the cuff dialogue and so on. Director/writer J.J. Abrams encompasses and emulates Spielberg. But it doesn't stop there, like E.T or more so Jaws we only get glimpses of the main creature and then a reveal late in the film. <br/><br/>J.J Abrams is no stranger to mystery, intrigue, tension and fear as was seen with Cloverfield and it's promotion. But what Abrams manages to capture; that few can, is the fuzzy nostalgia of a different time, in this case the 1970's. Excellent  props, interiors, the locations and music take you back or place you in the past. These settings are cemented thanks to some first rate child performances including Elle Fanning and Joel Courtney who's emotional performances heighten the film giving it more credibility. Kyle Chandler plays the father/Deputy out of his depth and dealing with the sudden and tragic lost of his wife perfectly and the supporting cast are perfect.<br/><br/>The otherworldly story is not the main focus as such and similar to E.T it's the plights and friendships that are important. Abrams intentionally or unintentionally dilutes his own talent with an inescapable homage.  Nevertheless, Abrams manages to give Super 8 the edginess and the magic of Steven Spielberg's earlier films in one nice neat package but with todays effects. <br/><br/>The only negative is that given the aforementioned Super 8 hasn't it's own identity, but with the warmth and wonder it generates that can't be a bad thing. Recommend."

","Super 8 is a very funny, spectacular and modern-made mix of a science fiction monster-destroying-a-small-town-movie and a family/kids/teen comedy. The main characters are young teens so the film is made for them, but at the same it is a very intense sci-fi mystery thriller.<br/><br/>The film begins with a funeral of the main character's mother, which clearly marks him as a tragical parent loss. Four months later, he and his friends are working on an amateur movie with the Super 8 camera. Accidentally, they film a monumental car crash. Soon, the military air force arrives and mysterious events start to happen.<br/><br/>The first two thirds of the movie, it is actually just building up suspense and playing with the viewer's expectations. Some scenes are very intense, but in a good way, just making you more and more interested about seeing the monster itself. Aside from the whole monster story, the movie follows the main character's typical and untypical young teen problems.<br/><br/>The storyline is interesting and entertaining, the monster scenes intense and a bit frightening, there is lots of amazing suspense, but still on the level, that is okay for older children. The young actors are incredible and the humor is amazing. Super 8 is a great movie, in short."
"t-hunt910","8","0","0","13 August 2011"," Excellent popcorn film , however not one for serious film buffs .
","A film with many echoes from the past. Some movie goers may accuses J. J. Abrams of shameful plundering Spielberg's back catalogue, but for myself and other movie goers who watched the film this was not a problem. In fact they reminded us how many big budget fantasy films of recent times are devoid of geniue moments of wonder and surprise.<br/><br/>Even though Super 8 has many derivative elements, my review is based on the entertainment value of the film. If you want to analyse the picture, you may find it lacking. The story to be trueful has some lapses of continuity , some of the characters have no real depth and the slight nature of the story is sure to irritate.<br/><br/>However if you want to to be entertained the film does the job. The story moves along it the right pace, not wasting time with irrelevant sub plots. The many unknown Juvenile leads are excellent cast. Additionally the CGI used in the movie is used to tell the story, but is not part of the story. The only time this is overused is the protracted and over the top train crash sequence. <br/><br/>In summary go to see Super Eight if wish to be entertained and remember most movies are truly not original. If you looking for serious fantasy or have post Spielberg hang ups the film is best avoided.<br/><br/>If you do decide to see Super Eight wait for the end credits, its worth it"
"mirwais-orbit","4","0","0","12 August 2011"," Another great marketing effect
","I didn't like the movie and you cannot blame me for that.<br/><br/>First of all, I was a lot interested about it. The trailer did what was supposed to, lighting the flame of curiosity as a massive campaign should always do. Then it was released and received huge positive reviews from the critics and also from the audience but people never tell you what the movie is about to not spoil it as if there's something really interesting to cover. J.J. Abrams as a director was attractive since he is becoming a great one. Spielberg producing means that maybe the story would possibly be ""interesting"". That's why I think that this movie is being so overrated just because of these huge names and because seems that nobody dares to dismiss Spielberg. But in the end it was a totally disappointment and a waste of time comparing to what I was expecting.<br/><br/>The art direction is amazing for sure reproducing the late 70's in the best possible way, some anachronisms are there but forgivable. Also, Abrams direction is extremely similar to some of the traditional characteristics that made Spielberg a reference like the abusive use of dynamic and open shots. The young actors are convincing and have a great chemistry together, giving you that Goonies feeling that we haven't felt for a long time. References to the classics are there, from Romero to Spielberg, from Ridley Scott to James Cameron, fulfilling its intents. So, technically, the movie is great.<br/><br/>But then comes the train crash. First, I'm sorry, but it is impossible for a simple car to destroy an entire train like that, the physics can explain it better than me. Second, how could someone drive a car directly to a train, crash it, explode it, take entirely train off its trail, make wagons fly and destroy everything around but still alive and just with some few scars on the face? Absolutely nonsense. Not even the worst action movie would do something so lame and absurd.<br/><br/>Then comes the plot development, it takes hours for something interesting to come, and it keeps hours using that old suspenseful element of never revealing the great threat entirely till the last couple minutes, which is a formula that isn't so much effective anymore. So, after 1 hour watching the movie, I was completely bored and the action and the thrilling moments just end as fast as it happens. The ending is another thing that was disappointing. There's this monster that makes dogs disappear, kills and sometimes kidnaps people, but then a small boy with a pure and in love heart says this magical words that comes from his pure spirit and then this monster finally stops creating the chaos and decides to go home. WTF!<br/><br/>I was expecting more than it is. But one thing is great, it's a teenage movie. It never tries to catch different audiences, that's why maybe I didn't like it or do not agree to be one of the best movies of 2011 as people and critics are claiming it to be, but teenagers will love it for sure or some older people that will be affected by this teenage nostalgia that the movie provides.<br/><br/>I would give 10 for the technical qualities, but movies aren't just that, so I give it 4."

","The premise of the movie is not that bad, but as it progresses so do the plot holes and the usual Hollywood attitude - over explaining every scene and not caring about plot holes - is obvious.<br/><br/>To enjoy this movie you have to believe that a kid won't tell anybody about a transforming cube which flies by itself and bust through his wall to anybody!<br/><br/>Under a total military shut down a couple of kids outsmart the military and get back into town.<br/><br/>The military person in charge of hunting the alien, who know the alien very well, will travel into town in a school bus with only 2 other armed soldiers - basically without any protection or plan on what to do if he encounters the alien he is looking for.<br/><br/>One scene particularly bothered me, right before they open the garage door there is an added soundtrack where when kids ask another, ""Why are these windows dirty"". I can see in front of me how some retard during a screening did not understand why they were going back to that garage and Hollywood of course have to dumb the movie down and over explain which always takes me out of a movie.<br/><br/>And could it me bore cliché! We understand he misses his mother. We do not have to see him visiting her gravestone. And oh my god, holding your hands over someones mouth to prevent him from screaming as he is getting scared. Is this Scary Movie?<br/><br/>And why would they go back to find a girl which they know was attacked by the alien after they have seen the alien just slaughter people. What reason do they have to risk their lives, for all they know the alien could have eaten her.<br/><br/>The ironic twist in the whole movie is that when the kids make the movie they talk about having a depth to the story, having good characters, they are discussing twist in the plot, not using any CGI - I almost think the makers of Super-8 were doing the exact opposite as a twisted joke. Super-8 is a bad movie about kids trying to make a good movie."
"martinrobertson300482","8","0","0","11 August 2011"," A Nice, old fashioned movie
","I was pleasantly surprised with ""Super 8."" Mainly because it is not a remake, or sequel, and even if it is on familiar turf, approaches its subject in an old fashioned and humorous way.<br/><br/>Flick follows some teenage kids who are attempting too make a movie with their ""super 8"" camera in the 70's, only too witness a train crash and get a climse off the mysterious creature that was on-board. Trying too keep quiet about this thing, soon strange stuff starts happening around the whole town, so they get caught up in events even further.<br/><br/>Though there is action and special effects, the film is more mysterious and likes keeping things hidden in the dark, working better as a drama. What goes on between the characters in normal everyday life is focused on just as much as the weird stuff that's happening, making it a movie that works on many levels, and it was nice too see a reasonably different alien movie looked at through the eyes off the kids over the adults for a change. Something I can't really think off having been done successfully in years.<br/><br/>The ""Aliens"" motives are questionable. One minute its killing people, the next it's tying them up, then later just looking at them, then letting them go. Still, a nice film, that'll have you sitting back down during the credits, and not too wait for some teaser at the end, but too see another short but hilarious movie."

Boom ba-doom-boom, baby. Super 8.<br/><br/>Now that that little tick is out of my system, let's get to the review.<br/><br/>Super 8, writer/director J.J. Abrams' nostalgic love letter to vintage Spielberg, centers on a young boy named Joe (Played by Joel Courtney), who has recently lost his dear mother, and has a rocky relationship with his father, the local police deputy (Played by Kyle Chandler). He's part of a group of kids filming a home zombie movie to enter into a local contest. But their plans go awry when a mysterious train crash occurs, and the local government is sent in to keep things quiet. Eventually, disappearances happen across town, the culprit being a creature that barely anyone knows about.<br/><br/>Abrams is very gleeful in the way he integrates these old styles of storytelling. And while the format is basic, he makes up for that with how he uses those elements. He likes to sprinkle in bits of humor and action, but the one thing I praise him for most is that he doesn't lose his focus. He makes sure there's a strong, beating heart beneath the surface. It's also worth noting that the movie's ending is the best ending I've seen all year, so far.<br/><br/>What about the cast? They are exceptional. The teen actors and adult actors are quite good. Joel Courtney gives a very nuanced, quietly emotional performance as Joe, especially when acting alongside Joe's love interest, Alice, played gently, and terrifically by Elle Fanning. The chemistry between these two put the adorable rating off the charts.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is also very well designed. The editing by Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon is right on the nose, and the VFX of Industrial Light ad Magic are quite lively. I have even higher praise for the sound. I was quite thrilled by the work of my two absolute favorite sound designers, the legendary Ben Burtt and Gary Rydstrom, and Michael Giacchino's John Williams/Jerry Goldsmith influenced score is enough to make one's heart soar.<br/><br/>All in all, Super 8 is a wonderful experience, and I give it ***1/2 out of ****"

","I have got to say Super 8 was a breath of fresh air. I have read a few of the reviews here on IMDb and have to agree with them that the film does have the old Steven Spielberg, E.T feel and in my books that is a great thing, however it is not any any shape or form the same as E.T, I just wanted to make that clear from the start. The references to the directing style and E.T are more centred around the story telling and feel of Super 8 not the actual physical content.<br/><br/>J.J Abrams gives us a masterclass in writing and directing. He somehow manages to capture your attention and draw you in to the film, the actors, mainly the children, do the film proud and it is fascinating to see them act well at acting bad. (This will make sense once you have watched the film). It has everything you want from action to comedy, drama to romance and it is all seamlessly weaved together.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved Super 8, it's an instant classic and recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>Go and see it."
"freemantle_uk","9","0","0","10 August 2011"," There is only one J.J. Abrams!
","Super 8 was one of the most anticipated films of 2011 but like with any film with high exception there is the risk becoming a major disappointment. Luckily it delivered and is both a highly entertaining film and has a heart.<br/><br/>Set in the late 1970s in the town of a Lillian, Ohio, Joe Lamb (Joel Courntney) is a 13-year-old boy whom mother dies in a work place accident. His father (Kyle Chandler) is the Deputy Sheriff of the town and obviously struggling with the lost of his wife and having to care for his son. Joe's friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) is directing a zombie film, wanting to ever it into a film festival. Joe helps his friend and one night they film at a train station with Alice Dainard (Elle Franning) and the rest of their crew when a truck drives into a train and derails it. Quickly strange things happens in the town; dogs runaway, people disappear and there are power cuts. The military rolls into town. But whilst all this goes on the teens attempt to complete their film and Joe and Alice become closer.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams is a highly skilled writer and director and modelled his career on Steven Spielberg, not a bad model. But unlike say M. Night Shyamalan who did the same thing Abrams is able to vary his style. Whilst Super 8 is an entertaining, first pace film, Abrams made sure that the family and human drama was central to his film. We got to know his characters and their issues. We basically see the mystery and the events through the eyes of children and original people some unusual is happening. Some critics have compared Super 8 to Spielberg's early films, which makes sense because of his influence on the director and produced it, but I personally was reminded by of Stephen King stories, a group of original kids who get cause in some extraordinary event. There was fast paced action, the train clash was a really well made sequence, but the social drama was also interesting, whether it was Joe and his father having to face up to their relationship, the investigation by the police or Joe and Alice's budding relationship.<br/><br/>Abrams was able to make his film a success without the need to cast big name actors. His young cast were skilled and natural, they actually felt like they were ordinary kids, not what some Hollywood hack thinks what they are like. They are made out to be individuals, they are slightly nerdy but Abrams avoided the clichés of cliques and bullies. The adults too are made out to be normal, ordinary people trying to cope with their domestic issues and affects on their communities.<br/><br/>Super 8 is not perfect, there is a bit too much comic relief involving the characters for its own good and there are a few clichés: but it still a whether movie."

","It has been months since I first saw the Super 8 trailer and had all sorts of wild speculation as to the plot and the meaning, I only recently realized it was the film format. Not an especially interesting subject to make someone consider learning more, but the fact that the film had J. J. Abrams name on it was enough for me to want to see it. I couldn't help but to wonder if there were some autobiographical elements at play relative to having a passion for film making even as a youngster. <br/><br/>At the start of the film I wasn't sure when the story was based and then came an amazingly pleasant surprise from the soundtrack, it was The Commodores song Easy. I was immediately transported to the Seventies, so many favorable memories what a fantastic era. As the movie progressed I thought OMG what if right in the middle of all my teenage fun, an extra terrestrial crashed the party. It is well into the film before we see the creature, but the effects used to convey size and girth were just as menacing as if it had actually been seen on screen. My imagination started to run wild, I fully expected a Cloverfield-like creature, but no we do get an original. In fact after having seen the recent trailers, I thought the creature was Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman) who was pretty much a mess the entire film. <br/><br/>This story was so much more than a coming of age tale with young people filming a movie, it was chalked full of life lessons, a father and sons bonding experiences, military cover-ups, the collateral damage from excessive drinking, the power of forgiveness, I really could go on and on with the lessons but I just have to take some time to talk about the talented young actors. Joe (Joel Courtney) really carried this film which is truly amazing since this is pretty much the net of his film resume (IMDb). The young actor completely held his own against a real veteran Alice (Elle Fanning), and I kept thinking wow, she is acting at acting like she is acting now that's an actress! The future for these two as well as the other members of their crew looks very bright. The thing that I love most about J. J. Abrams work is his ability to make you think what if. This film gets a green light from the earth to the stratosphere, it was thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>BTW, the showing of the short film The Case during the credits was a hilarious treat."

","Super 8 is the latest offering from the juicy sci-fi-tastical mind of Lost creator J.J. Abrams, the brains behind other fabulous yet also sometimes kind of annoying things such as Cloverfield (2008) and Star Trek (2009). And I think this film may be another one of those oft annoying but undeniably amazing movies.<br/><br/>The plot hovers around the concept of it being 1979 and some kind of crazy stuff going down in town. We witness the film alongside the protagonists, a group of kids, amongst them the latest girl in what I can only presume will eventually become the Fanning Dynasty- Dakota's younger sister, Elle. Young Elle must be feeling the pressure of success following in her sister's rather large footsteps (having worked alongside Robert De Niro, Denzel Washington, Tom Cruise and dare I say it R-Patz to name a few) but here is the real kicker- this young ingenue bursts on to the screen and pees her scent mark all over that movie tree. With the once awesome Dakota joining the Twilight alumni, for me there is only one Fanning in town and Elle acts as a young Chloe Sevigny, blessed with maturity and a wise and believable ability to express small nuances in her performance. I was totally wowed by her, with the strength of her performance acting as one of the main crutches holding this film in the ranks of Spielberg's other classics, in particular E.T. and Jaws.<br/><br/>The entire group of kids are a smart selection of young and skilled actors that we can all relate to; there's stereotypes that we love in this kind of movie. Overweight guy. Geek guy. Big teeth guy. Pretty bad girl. Slightly nicer guy that we guess is probably the main protagonist, but he's not our favourite. These are staples of your Stand By Me, The Goonies, Home Alone, E.T., Hocus Pocus. Basically the kind of the movies that I consider 'classics' - I was born in 1988, so for my generation, they are. Hush your old school tastes.<br/><br/>The kids are budding film makers and upon shooting a scene at an old run down train station, an epic and ridiculous train crash unfolds in front of them, exploding trucks up in to the air and having a jolly ol' Hollywood time. This exasperating train crash is slightly over the top, but we allow it because it's 2011 and these effects, particularly when witnessed in IMAX, are simply too beautiful to resist. I'm a techno-boy; if you can have a sick CGI explosion that's going to look completely real, throw it in there. It's the movies. Anyways... after this train crash, of course more craziness goes down and we just basically follow the kids for a couple of hours and watch them crush on each other and run away from scary stuff and try and save the day.<br/><br/>However, it must be noted that whatever I say here cannot actually express how much I enjoyed it. It's a film that will stick with you, and then you'll buy it on Blu-Ray and you'll watch it every Christmas. It's a family movie that will give the children of 2011 the same warm, scary, funny, touching, memorable experience as E.T. did for the children of 1982. This Spielberg / Abrams mash-up needed a capable and skilled group of child actors if they wanted it to legitimately stand in the ranks of great movies before it and not fade in to trashy obscurity. They needed the actors, the effects, and the heart- and whilst Abrams is apt at providing the first two, it is Spielberg who delivers with that classic stamp of approval. It feels big, and it's enjoyable, and I want to watch it again when it's snowing outside and I can be warm inside on the sofa drinking whiskey. And eating. Always with the eating. But also the Blu-Ray.<br/><br/>This film gets a huge flaming big fatty 9 Ollywood stars out of the maximum possible star- age that is 10. Because this film is really good. For all.<br/><br/>9/10.

","The story in Super 8 isn't something new. The special effects and CGI are quite convincing and spot-on. Directing is adequate, such as the pacing. What really takes off the film is the kids'performances !!<br/><br/>Seeing this film reminded me of Goonies and other kid-focused films where friendship, curiosity, recklessness, bravery and selflessness define the film. If you approach this movie as another alien sci-fi film you may not be that satisfied because there have been a lot of identical films out there with much more special effects, deeper plot etc.<br/><br/>Instead, try to see it as a film about 5 young teenagers, their troubles, their friendship, their hunger to do things and explore new stuff, all these being told through a disaster and a crisis due to an extraterrestrial creature."
"valadas","5","0","0","9 August 2011"," two stories one movie
","This movie tells us two stories indeed in two different plots intertwined: one is about a group of high school kids trying to make a zombies movie and the other one about a war between air force and an alien whose ship has fallen on Earth some years before and is desperately trying to repair it in order to be able to return to his planet or galaxy while the air force men try to prevent that and eventually kill or capture him. This fight is shown through enormous and appalling explosions and scenes of huge destruction taking place in a small Ohio town. This second plot is poor and not very inventive in itself and what saves the movie of a total collapse is the first plot, the kids one, which is vivid and shows a team of kids united by friendship, cooperation and solidarity bonds almost limitless not only about their zombies movie project but also amidst the catastrophic scenes above referred. Just a passable movie, to put it in a nutshell."

I watched the whole film and i took it for what it was, An average science fiction movie with some good acting in it. The story was a bit lame i mean.. a bunch of kids in a car, The only car on the road and the army missed it completely and it took a small boy to figure out where the documents were but the army couldn't find them. Those were the bits of the script that made it an average film for me but overall it was watchable It will go in the good kids films shelf for me, Not on the top with the blockbusters"

(Funny that Spielberg has a talent for finding good child actors) The story is typically Spielberg story, I know it's by Abrahams but it has so much of an old nostalgic Spielberg movie, you don't have to like it but I loved it.

","A likable film with just the right amount of postmodernism... enough so it's a wink to the audience but never so it gets ostentatious or fails to charm. Sure, Super 8 is a movie with its influences on its sleeve, but it's genuinely likable stuff with some nicely drawn characters.<br/><br/>While it loses its way a little with the alien section in the middle, what kills it stone dead is the Hollywood ending. Stirring strings, ""emotional"" payoffs, letting go of a dead mother's memory in the sake of love, ""I love you Dad"", learning to understand one another... the film collapses under the weight of mawkish, overstated sentiment, something which had never troubled the other parts of the film. In this respect then it can, at least, claim to be a genuine tribute to Spielberg, a talented director with candyfloss in the place of sincere emotion."

","I know this one came out in a lot some territories quite a while ago, but (for some reason) it has only just appeared here on UK screens. As a consequence I have read many reviews praising it, with a few dissenters too. This intrigued me and, when it finally arrived, I decided to go and see it. They were showing it in the little screen upstairs at my local cinema and I had a little trepidation when some teenage girls came in and started complaining about the size of the screen. I shouldn't have worried; once the film started they settled down. Many likable characters came across the screen and I could see just what J.J. Abrams was aiming at More of my thoughts later after this brief summary.<br/><br/>A group of kids are making a film; it being the time before video tape, they have to film it on a Super 8 cine camera. The group's leader, Charles, wants to make a zombie movie for an upcoming competition. He is helped by Joe Lamb, Cary, Martin, Preston, and latterly Alice Dainard. Joe has recently lost his mother in an accident and his dad, a deputy sheriff, is struggling to adapt. He has a thing for Alice, whose dad had worked with Joe's mother and blames himself for the accident. But I digress whilst filming one night by the railway tracks; they witness an accident that derails a military train. They capture on film something escaping from one of the carriages, but, of course, they don't know about that until they can get the film developed (3 days later). By that time the town has gone crazy; disappearances of equipment and people even all the dogs have left! The military come in to clear up the train wreck and end up evacuating the town. Can these young filmmakers get to the bottom of what's going on? Well, just in case there is someone out there that hasn't seen it, I'd better not say. Them spoiler police will be hanging me up to dry.<br/><br/>A very well made film with likable characters, some neat CGI and some very clever effects. I cannot fault the performances, the young cast all did a great job, in particular; Joel Courtney as Joe Lamb, Elle Fanning as Alice Dainard and Riley Griffiths as Charles. All three stood out (for me) and I'm sure they'll all go far. Also worthy of a mention were; Kyle Chandler as Jackson Lamb (Joe's dad), Ryan Lee as Cary, Gabriel Basso as Martin and Zach Mills as Preston.<br/><br/>As I've already said, I can see what J.J. Abrams was aiming at, and that is the Spielberg films of the late 70's to the early 80's. Films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and even the Spielberg-produced, The Goonies (1985). Unfortunately this doesn't have the warmth or the magic of those films, but it is still a worthy effort. There seems to be quite a long time where not much happens and this disrupts the pacing towards the middle. But even so, by the end I really quite enjoyed it. Some great music, both the original soundtrack by Michael Giacchino and the songs of the period that were chosen. As far as the cinematography goes, I've read a lot of comment about ""flaring""; this didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I like that they show the film the kids were making while the end credits are rolling It's pretty neat. Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7.5/10 IMDb Score: 7.6/10 (34,903 votes when this review was written).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 82/100 (236 reviews counted when this review was written)."

","I been looking forward to this for over a year now and although I enjoyed it the film was disappointing. Yes I thought the alien was Clovy and was a little disappointed when it wasn't. It seemed too much of an homage to that idiot Spielberg and as such the ending was poor instead of brilliant like Cloverfield. Some good thrills in it but ultimately left me feeling a little cheated. The Goonies did OK and the acting wasn't that bad. Some of the dialogue and set pieces reminded me of several Spielberg films that without the SE were utter crap. Plot holes abounded but you have to suspend belief a little for these things. The ending seemed rushed as if they had ran out of money and seemed a bit strange as the alien was doing all this stuff and in the end suddenly did something totally different. Not enough creature for my liking even if it was hardly Clovy. Does not live up to it's hype and was neither brilliant nor sucked and another summer failure but all said and done a solid 7 but it should have been a 10."

Its a very predictable movie and one of bad taste. <br/><br/>The action scenes are very good, but not anything special.

","I won't go through the entire plot line...you all know the story by now. The actual craftsmanship in creating this movie is just fine. the effects are good, the sound/lighting/camera work...all just fine. The actors are VERY good...particularly the children.<br/><br/>Abram's directorial style, especially in relation to the kids, mimics the Spielberg style as used in ""ET"" and ""Close Encounters"". You know...people talk over each other...families depicted in the seventies look very ""busy"" and hyperactive, etc.<br/><br/>The story is so full of holes you could drive a truck through them. If the alien could not be stopped with the combined might of the pursuing military just how, pray tell, were they able to control it at Nellis airbase? And how were they able to get it on board a train? And if the alien has the power to suck away energy forces...why didn't it do this to the train??? Sorry...far too illogical.<br/><br/>Now...to the music. Michael Giacchino is no John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith...no way. Oh yes...the music is okay, in a TV show kind of way...but it doesn't have the thematic development and magic that Williams would have brought to this film. The only decent piece of music appears in the last ten minutes of the film and even then the theme is very underdone. Perhaps, Michael, you should go and have some long talks with John Williams before he leaves us for good.<br/><br/>Overall this film was like a junk food meal...quite delicious and filling but still leaving you with a certain feeling of emptiness, of being let down by much promise but limited delivery."

","I loved the trailer for this movie. The way it was put together, the mystery, the music... What a let down the actual film was! It seemed to me like one giant ego stroke for Spielberg with Abrams trying to replicate what made Spielberg's Amblin films so unique back in the day. Even his camera shots were trying to be Spielberg but without the panache or iconic creativity the former had in his prime.<br/><br/>It's like trying to trace the Mona Lisa – it'll always be second rate. And everything here is. The kids, while good, are pale imitations of the kids in the Goonies and not quite as believable and real as the kids in E.T. The music tries to echo John Williams but Giacchino cannot even touch the master. Even the music from Cocoon used in the trailer exuded a magical awe that Giacchino fails to echo. His music even tries to give the military the same sound and feel as the military is given in Close Encounters but again it just feels pastiche and not homage. Speaking of the military, they couldn't have been more cartoonish if the filmmakers tried. At least the military and officials felt real is E.T. There the officials are an unspeaking presence as our characters try make sense of what is going on.<br/><br/>All in all it felt overly conscious. Even moments like a little kid slamming the table was a direct take from a moment in Close Encounters, as one of the children of Richard Dreyfuss character was doing the same thing with a doll. Abrams uses it as background stuff not realizing it served a thematic function in Close Encounters.<br/><br/>This is my main problem with it, it seems too focused on jerking off on Spielberg that it fails to become a unique and memorable film onto itself. Spielberg was a contemporary filmmaker who made contemporary set films back in the late 70s and early 80s. He wasn't making 'nostalgic' films set in the 50s and jerking off about a director he admired. That's what Abrams should have done. The super 8 was a pure Mcguffin and did nothing more than show the characters something they would see for real 5 minutes later and I feel that there is no reason why, with a bit of thought, this film could not have been set now and made into a movie kids today could make their own the way kids of my generation owned and connected to E.T, Goonies etc.<br/><br/>It's sad in one sense. I applaud anything that is new (like Inception) in a movie land that saturated with sequels and remakes and reboots. But is this really new? Isn't it just another form of reboot? We need new stuff for these times. Come on Hollywood, get the finger out!"

","Super 8 is good film, technically well put together, well cast and acted, and pretty to watch. The story keeps moving and drags you along with it. Still, it is unoriginal, stereo-typical, and cobbled together as if from a Hollywood script Job Lots. J. J. Abrams deserves no credit or acclaim for this film since not one aspect of it is actually his ~ he wandered through the grocery store of thematic elements and picked from this shelf and that till the story came together. The card-board cut-out military characters and nature are painful and distracting unless you lean to the left and drink the kool-aid. It is clear that Abrams has little actual knowledge about the military and possibly less about government.<br/><br/>I am a harsh critic. All I ask is a modicum of believability. Perhaps I'm wrong, but the Air Force uses planes not tanks ~ I could be wrong though. Given the nature of American culture in 1979, how does Abrams explain the fact that there were no whistle-blowers, no political over-sight, and no pesky reporters poking into this project? He doesn't ~ the audience is just supposed to buy into the Evil Government Big Brother mind-set. What insults most of all though is the American soldiers ignoring Posse Commitatus and murdering civilians."

","Not since films such as E.T., The Goonies and Stand By Me has there been such an exciting and magical experience presented to us at the theater. It's main characters are a group of kids. It's location is a small town in Ohio in 1979. It's feel, however, is larger than life. A grand sense of adventure that speaks to the child that still lives within all of our hearts. Under the guidance of Steven Spielberg, J.J. Abrams has written and directed his masterpiece.. the film that will forever define him as a brilliant director.<br/><br/>The story focuses on a group of six middle school age friends who, while filming a super 8 movie, witness a disastrous train wreck that is suspected to be more than just an accident. It is only the very next day that unusual disappearances begin to occur, and as this small town mystery unfolds... the truth is much larger than anyone could have ever imagined.<br/><br/>From the first few moments of the film, Abrams perfectly paces this story and keeps you on the edge of your seat as the pieces of the puzzle begin to connect in a thrilling and, also, heartwarming way. Lead by newcomer Joel Courtney, you will not find a more talented group of young actors anywhere. Each brought their own individual style and an authenticity to the characters and delivered performances that could rival those of some of Hollywood's elite. It was their job to carry the story and the likes of Elle Fanning (who could easily give her sister a run for her money), Ryan Lee (who brought the laughs as a great comic relief), Riley Griffiths (who stole every scene he was in), Zach Mills and Gabriel Basso just did a phenomenal job! It is great to know that this new generation has a film like this, one they can watch over and over again and find something exciting about the ride each time! I, myself, saw it three times in theaters, and never once got bored with it. Each time I laughed, I was frightened and I left with a smile upon my face. You don't see many truly great films these days, but this is one with a lot of excitement and a lot of heart that will not leave you disappointed."

I 'm glad i decide to go see super 8. This sci-film is about a group of friend's wannabe films makers doing a class project at a local train station when they witness tragic train accident and what happen afterwards. JJ Abrams did a wonderful job crafting a classic sci- fi horror movie that keeps you on your toes the whole movie. This film stars Kyle Chandler and introduces some fine young actors, Joel Courtney, Ryan lee, Elle Fanning. Super 8 is written and directed by J.J. Abrams and is just shy of 2 hrs.<br/><br/>J.J.

The story revolves around a young man Joe lamb trying to adjust to life after the death of his mother after a work place accident. He finds solitude with his friends filming a movie for a class project. While filming their class project they witness a train crash and make a pact not to say anything, because they weren't supposed to be there that late at night, kids what you are going to do with them. The military leap's into town to clean up the mess and hide what there transporting across country. The boys get the film developed from the night of the crash and discover the military is transporting something looks like it belongs to area 51.While trying to figure out how to finish their film lots of strange things are happening. The mysterious train cargo goes about stealing power lines off poles, car batteries, people, and the towns pet population is disappearing.<br/><br/>The one thing that stood was the acting. The cast wasn't filled with any really big names but that didn't stop the quality of the story being told. I love how you saw the story unfold in the eyes of the children throughout the whole movie. The use of the small town as a back drop for the film adds to the appeal/ charm of the film, and the story line involving the kids and their quest to find out about what was on the train and why the military was so interested in the cargo.<br/><br/>I can't understand why JJ Abrams is so hush hush with his projects he does good work for the most part You really didn't know what to expect in this film because he is so hush hush. I think if he marketed it more it might have gotten a lot better press.I thought JJ Abrams did a wonderful job crafting a classic sci –fi film not a lot special effects, more story driven.

","What would you get if you mixed the imagination and story telling of JJ Abrams with the imagination and story telling of the legendary Steven Spielberg? Super 8 that's what. You can see Super 8's tell tale inspirations from a mile away. Part E.T., Part Close Encounters, part Cloverfield, Part War of the Worlds. There is a little bit of everything rolled into one and add a coming of age story, a 70's small town setting, and a group of relate-able youngsters and you have a film that will just generally make you feel good, get excited and really enjoy every minute. Its the perfect summer, popcorn flick and there is not a thing wrong with that. It isn't quite a family film as it definitely has some dark moments, and some scary creatures but it also isn't a throw-down violent space flick either so there is a little something for everyone. Many reviews have some very common threads. Many say that there is some time based plot holes (Rubix Cube couldn't have been there, a song that was too early to be in the picture) but this is Abrams and Spielberg and their story is so well told and the adventure is so much fun that someone looking for pure entertainment can let these things slide. I certainly never thought once about any glaring plot holes. Not that there weren't any but more that I didn't care.<br/><br/>The urban legend is that Joel Courtney came to stay with family for the summer, ended up auditioning and landing his first role as the lead character in a JJ Abrams film. Not bad for a newcomer but I promise you this isn't the last you've seen of this kid. He has such a fresh face, and a down to earth look about him and his character is perfect in the role reminiscent of E.T.'s Elliot so many years ago. You can just sit there and think of him as you when you were coming of age (in the seventies with Aliens...it happened to us all.) Elle Fanning who is no stranger to acting gives a truly great performance as the slightly rebellious but sweet Alice who basically is meant to be the first love of every young boy and is for Courtney's character. They are cute together and have good chemistry. Riley Griffiths is terrific in a supporting role as Courtney's best friend and the man behind the lens making the 'zombie' movie with his Super 8. He doesn't stand out compared to Courtney and Fanning but I think he is meant to support them. Same could be said for Ryan Lee who plays their other friend. He has a smaller supporting role but is still vital to the story. Kyle Chandler is Courtney's father and the grieving widower and the town Sheriff. Cleverly his adult character does not overshadow the kids, they are the main characters but at the same time adults need someone to relate to, the protector, the hero and Chandler is perfect as the quiet strength behind everything. He has an emotion and a strength about it and does well.<br/><br/>The cast all around is good. They aren't mind blowing, they won't hear ""...and best performer goes to..."" but the fact is Super 8 is about the story. Yes the characters are integral to that but the story is where it lies. This is a story about a bizarre situation and a mysterious entity, and eventually a monster that is taking people prisoner. When all is said and done we discover that ultimately this 'monster' isn't so bad, in fact he's just angry and wants to go home. Super 8 plays a similar game to Cloverfield or other 'monster' movies and that is not showing you the monster until they absolutely have to. Certainly this makes for some terrific drama, and intensity and mystery but JJ Abrams knows all too well it can also open the door for huge disappointment when something is finally revealed. He dealt with this on Lost for 6 seasons. But the cool thing about Super 8 is I don't think anyone will be disappointed with the monster. He fits what you could picture, he is mysterious and disturbing and I didn't feel at all that it was disappointing. Plus the concept of his ship and putting it together makes for a very cool twist. If you want to see a great summer film don't miss this one! A terrific and fun adventure/Sci-fi flick that could become a must see classic! 9/10"
"ginovolpe","Null","0","0","12 July 2011"," Something different (minor Spoiler)
","So it goes, the summer movie season. Beginning with Spielberg's ""Jaws"" the summer run of films have generally consisted of big budget tent pole studio releases that run the gamut from: ""Highly anticipated adaptation of insert-your favorite childhood action figure, comic book character, camp television show, etc."" If not that, we get at least one or two gems from the Happy Madison crew- I died on the inside-that will at least earn a $100 million. Most if not all have been the dominant film franchises of the past three years, with the exception of harry Potter as the purely literary adaptation amongst the tier of Transformers, X-Men sequels, and others of that ilk. Though on the periphery, there's a little film called Super 8, directed by J.J Abrams.<br/><br/>In the late 70s, our protagonist, 12-year-old Joe Lamb (Joel McCourteny) is working with his determined friend Charles (Riley Griffiths); make an 8mm Zombie flick for their local film festival. Part of their daily production schedule is under tight secrecy as to avoid the attention of their disapproving elders. A majority of the production includes scouting locations, making their own makeshift costumes, and gingerly apply zombie make up to their stars. One of the requirements of a monster film is your love interest; here Charles and Joe have Alice Dainard, who plays the dual role of love interest as zombie and female star. She's a volatile talent for the production; not just for her good looks but that fact that she drives her father's car to the pivotal train station.<br/><br/>Once at the stop, the boys and Alice resume shooting when the frame of a century happens. A train comes roaring out of the night. Always the opportunist, Charles calls for Action and Alice on Joe proceed to perform as the train passes them by (which is odd considering the sound of the train would inevitably ruin any usable sound form the dialog. Despite that flaw in shooting, the scene goes on without a hitch till out of the darkness comes a pickup truck driving dead set into the train. Resulting from this is spectacular array of violence, from train cars taking flight into the night sky, to the terrific explosion of the engine itself, overall very entertaining. Predictably, something breaks free out of one of the cars. What was it and how did it get there? I cannot divulge too much, to put it bluntly, see the movie for the reveal or think on your own.<br/><br/>This is part of the fun of the film, the manner in which Abram's ratchets the suspense is a joy to watch. For example, Joe's dog disappears. When he posts the note on the police board, through a pan out, it's revealed to us that multiple dogs have been missing. Later on there's a map with the dots revealing all of the dogs in the town's disappearances. It's through shots like these that give the viewer an uneasy feeling. Also there several scenes where metallic objects through mysterious means fly away from people's homes. Or in some instances fly away anywhere period. A key moment occurs at a gas station where the hubcaps of a car are violently ripped from their tires by an n invisible force. These all work to the film's advantage as what we're imagining is much more frightening than what's going to be on screen. Concurrently U.S. Air force (investigators and troops) arrives into town, making a great effort to quarantine specific areas of the town as well as investigate the dubious cargo of the train car. With this as their starting point, Joe and company make it their top priority to get to the bottom of this mystery.<br/><br/>On the flip side, you cannot have a monster movie without compelling human characters to carry the film. Joe's father, Deputy sheriff Jack Lamb is played by TV's Kyle Chandler, best known as coach Eric Taylor from Friday Night Lights. Prior to the main events, Joe's mother dies in an accident at the local factory, at the expense of Alice's father, Louis Dainard. This immediately creates a rift between both Joe and his father. Joe mourns for his mother, constantly clutching a heart shaped locket. Jack Lamb on the other hand is depressive and cold, with a strong focus on his work over quality time with his son. Count-less times throughout the film they try to discuss the incident but due to the circumstances at hand, neither have adequate time to communicate. Instead, Joe begins to bond with Alice, instead she being the more reciprocal in showing affection. This is realized in a truly tender scene where he applies zombie makeup onto her.<br/><br/>Then we move onto the second half of the film. While the first half was a brilliant exercise in suspense and character study. It felt as if Abrams had successfully channeled the creative mind of a young Spielberg. However, things take a turn for the unrealistic and over the top. The Air Force becomes almost Nazi sequel in their take over the town, violently threatening Joe and his friends while incarcerated in a military bus. The actual threat itself was mishandled through a fault of in -minor spoiler- creature design, The main fault is that if you want to have a creature that is readily empathetic, it all comes down to the to the design. It also doesn't help that none of the characters get to interact all with the creature till the very end of the film. But to alleviate this shortcoming, Abrams shoehorns an iffy telepathy subplot that undercuts much of what could be dramatic tension during the film's climax.<br/><br/>Overall though, Super 8 is worth your matinée ticket if you are seeking for atypical summer feature this year. Not interested in seeing your favorite superhero get the big screen treatment, nor would you want to see Will Ferrell get evicted from his home, this movie is the one for you."

","Another great film from J.J. Abrams who worked with Steven Spielberg to bring us a new twist on an alien presence. Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) is a young man who is friends with Charles (Riley Griffiths) since kindergarten. Both create a movie for a festival so they can get their names in lights, but on their movie set, they are witness to a catastrophe of a train derailing by a mad doctor who the boys later learn was a part of an experiment gone wrong. Small disappearances occur in the sleepy town of Lillian, until Joe finds a few answers of his own to this mystery. As the military jumps in to burn the town down because of a past catching up with them, Joe and his friends take it upon themselves to find a girl who has been kidnapped by the force for which people cannot see until it is so up close, you can smell its breath. The girl, Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) is held by this force because whatever it is, wants to go home. A kind of ransom demand on its own behalf so that the military and their way doing things can kiss its butt. All in all Joe understands the creatures point of view, and with the mad Doctor Woodward's (Glynn Turman) notes, finds its lair and Alice and other people who are still alive in a dungeon of sorts under a cemetery. Now with releasing his fellow townsfolk, Joe and Alice reunite with their respective fathers to look upon the creatures way back home. Giving it a chance to escape as the military stops the hazing of Lillian. This film has a really good story, a bit of E.T flavor blended in with close encounters of the third kind. Music was top notch, and using the oldies such as ELO for the track was such a relief over the constant bombardment of the usual hip hop gangster crap. I cannot fathom films that use the monotonous tunes of rap in a movie. It throws my concentration off and it does not sound good except to those who listen to it. All in all, a very good flick for the price. Great effects. And a good learning curve that not all humans are butt wads on this planet, like the military demonstrates nearly all the time. Recommended to those like myself who love a good Sci-fi."

","Super 8, 8, 8, I love you Super 8, give it to me Super 8. OK, I sound like a silly Celi Bee there (only hardcore 70's Disco fans got that opening). But it is true! Summer Popcorn Cinematic Entertainment a la 70's style is alive and well in J.J. Abrams ""Super 8"". The movie's executive producer is Steven Spielberg, and why not because ""Super 8"" has Super Spielberg written all over it. Before its release, the film's plot points were supposed to be kept super secret, and even in the trailers all one would see is a railroad trailer of a grandiose train crash. So I don't want you to super-hate me, so I will not reveal too much of Super 8's plot during my review. I will inform you that if you are an aficionado of ""E.T."", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""Poltergeist"", ""The Goonies"", and ""Jurassic Park"", you will also become a super fan of ""Super 8"". The film is based during the late 70's in an Ohio town. A few Middle School kids are filming an 8 millimeter short film to help their peep Charles, who is directing it, so it can be entered in a youth film contest. But during its roll, the kids witness a colossal train wreck. After that, havoc runs amok and bizarre occurrences start occurring in the town. The town's deputy sheriff Jackson Lamb is now in the center of the madness trying to investigate what is going on. The train wreck and the town's strange happenings do have a connection, but I will not wreck it for you by providing information on that either. The movie's primary focus is on the kids though; the film is primarily presented through their subjective responses to all the madness that is going on, especially those of the tween protagonists Joe Lamb (yep, the Deputy Sheriff's son), and the young girl he crushes on Alice Dainard. All the other kids do play an integral though. So what is the mystery of the train wreck and how it affected Jackson Lamb and his son Joe Lamb? Not gonna tell you! It will be my Silence of the Lambs. I will say that J.J. Abrams' direction & screenplay of this super flick will have you on the edge of your seat, you will not be derailed with flat boredom or insignificant subplots; every aspect of the film bears semblance and swiftly aids in the progress of the narrative. Turn out the Friday Night Lights because Kyle Chandler has now entered into the movies playing field quite nicely with his game performance as Jackson Lamb. Nice to see Ron Eldard back in the thespian game with an impressive effort as Alice's dad Louis. But it is the kids that dominate ""Super 8""! I am not kidding! Whopper performances all around- Joel Courtney as Joe Lamb, Elle Fanning as Alice Dainard, Riley Griffiths as Charles; Ryan Lee, Gabriel Basso, and Zach Mills were the other kiddos who round out the young thespian super crew of ""Super 8"". So get behind the 8 ball or at least your vehicle, and drive to the nearest multiplex to witness the ""Super 8"" phenomenon! ***** Excellent"

","Films like this constantly remind me why I continue to support film making and choose to believe there is something better to life than the numerous bland sequels destroying the public's taste for great cinema. In a summer full of pirates, Kung Fu fighting animals, and drunken band of friends, this movie sticks its head out of the ashes of poisoned American films and shows itself to be something to be notice and taken seriously. Abrams show the audience that there are some directors out there that take the movie making process serious and do not create films just for a quick buck. Super 8 is a part of a rare breed of movies that are being made not only to entertain the audience and gives us something captivating to watch, but also giving the audience a sense of connection to films. Its gives us a great story to connect with our minds, likable characters to connect to with our hearts, and great visuals to connect with what we see to give the viewer a well rounded movie. Not destroying our intelligence with just visuals and a 8 year old written story line. This movie has a cast of very strong children that act way beyond their age. They seem to work well with each other and the audience can tell when watching the film. Super 8 also feels to be something that would have been released in the 80's, but works quite well in 2011.The director did a great job on keeping a level of secretes to conceal the viewers knowledge of mysterious monster to increase viewing pleasure. Beside a lot of positives this movie has it does lack in the horror aspect that it was going for, but makes up in the mystery department and it keeps the pacing of the movie flowing and never loses a beat while the film is playing. There is also a action scene that shows a train crash and it was beautifully done and revs up the movies. The ending kind of lacked what I believed or was lead to believe on what was going to happen, but the movie as a whole was wonderful to watch.This movie has no re watch value in my opinion because it offers the viewer nothing new that we have not seen before, but creates a great mixture of past films dating from ET to the Close Encounters of the third Kind to Clover field. Abrams takes various elements from those films That we enjoyed and makes something that is full of entertainment and fun to watch in the summer full of lackluster films."

","Having just come from watching Transformers which was supposed to be the summer blockbuster I appreciate super 8 even more now.<br/><br/>There was great acting by very young actors, a great story within the story and a real connection to the creature in this film. At the end you were rooting for the alien which means that through the film the audience was able to attach emotionally.<br/><br/>I found the main characters to be funny but perhaps too brave for their age since, given the somewhat introverted personality of the lead he continued to show a lot more resolve and grit that would be expected from a 10/11 year old boy who makes model trains and does make up ...<br/><br/>Very little to criticise on this film ...

I thought it was like a mixture of the films The Goonies , Cloverfield , E.T. and Stand by me. I liked the acting from the group of kids and their cool super 8 zombie movies , the SFX was great and the creature looked cool even though there was some CGI involved but as you can imagine with a massive budget the CGI looked good in most parts.<br/><br/>Anyway i really enjoyed this and it really reminded me of the cool 80s flicks that i grew up with so hats off to JJ and SS for making this.

","When I went to see Super 8 I had pretty high expextations for this movie. Sitting in the theater I felt like I was watching one of Steven Spielberg's classics, like E.T., etc. The movie is fast paced, intense, and nostalgic but still managed to stay on topic. The movie was sprinkled with heartfelt moments. It shows the bonds of family and friendship. Leaving the film I had the story stuck in my head and for the next week I couldn't get it off my mind. So finally I made the decision to go see it again. Watching it for the second time I loved it even more. Films like this show that the movie industry hasn't lost its touch, no matter how many remakes it produces. Steven Spielberg and J.J.

Great special effects, though! The train crash was pretty destructive... The part where the alien picks up the sheriff and destroys the gas station was pretty scary and provided a jump-out-of-your-chair moment. The movie actually had A LOT of those jump-out-of-your- chair moments, but that's what made it fun and exciting. If you're into those action-adventurous kind of movies, then you should go see it. Not really good for young kids though because of some ""bloody scenes"", explosives, and they'd probably get scared."

","There are lots of great reviews for this film, so I'm not going to say much. I suspect that everyone has compared it to E.T., and that's very true -- even in the scariest places, Abrams has managed to infuse both the sweetness and humor. <br/><br/>However, I have a hint for those of you who haven't seen it (and perhaps some who have). Find a copy of the _original_ version of Close Encounters and watch it carefully. It's worth it for the small homage that Abrams has included to that wonderful film. Just sayin'.<br/><br/>I think that Abrams has become a worthy successor to Steven Spielberg, something which we've increasingly needed as Spielberg has turned more toward production and mentoring younger directors. However, I hope that these two continue collaborating for a long time to come."

","*This review contains spoilers!* I saw this movie a week ago and I have to say, it was very enjoyable; for me, that is. My friend hated it due to the fact that it was somewhat predictable at times. For example, *SPOILER ALERT* when the alien has the kids cornered in its underground cave and the main character is the only one that can reason with it, my friend became annoyed because so many other movies use that same scenario. I somewhat agree with her, but I was so engrossed in the beginning of the movie that these small cliché bits were overlooked. The noise in the movie was also a tad too loud, but that's just my opinion. All in all, this movie was highly enjoyable with a slightly weak ending. If you love movies with a lot of carnage and explosions, this is the movie for you."

","Super 8 really brings you back to the 70's such as music, lifestyle. The monster part of the movie made me think of those double bills from the 50's with a monster from another planet and the army trying to dominate it. I liked the friendship between the young kids, their enthusiasm about film making and their courage to stand up against the monster. The monster from outer space landed in 1957 or 1958. It was just trying to go back home, but the army stopped its efforts. The army wanted to do experiments on the creature, so that they could learn more about how it ticks. Professor or Dr. Woodward was just trying to help the creature get back home. He understood what the monster from outer space was going through."

","I didn't really understand the movie in the beginning...I thought it was a science experiment gone wrong or something like that but then it ended like an alien leaving earth. So, in short, confusing, but the camaraderie theme, the friendship theme, the love theme, the courage theme, is all presented in the movie in full form, which make it way above average. <br/><br/>I have always been interested in movies where children are the main characters, somewhat like Oliver Twist. Other movies this reminded me of was The Butterfly Effect starring Ashton Kutcher, where the role of the children is a major factor in the movie. This is why I liked this movie more than usual; because the children were portrayed very realistically.<br/><br/>A must watch for any serious movie watcher, and not the casual movie goer."
"napierslogs","7","0","0","25 June 2011"," Like it for its nostalgia, cuteness, or possible aliens
","Building a film out of nostalgia is exactly what ""Super 8"" is. Nostalgia for the Steven Spielberg films from the '80s, jokes about the '70s, and the pure joy that Spielberg and Abrams would have had for filmmaking as young boys. A movie about movie making. It might also be about aliens.<br/><br/>We start by getting to know our six young protagonists and the love they have for making a movie. As Charles always says, ""Production value is key."" In the real world, I can't imagine production value is a concern anymore for Abrams. The budget for this movie is $50 million and it shows with trains crashing, over and over again, and cars flying through the air, over and over again. From there we go to the main Hollywood story which involves a teenage love story, strange occurrences in the town with dogs missing, and a mysterious Government cover-up. Hint: It might involve aliens.<br/><br/>I liked ""Super 8"" because I like nostalgia. The jokes about the '70s were quite funny (I could be wrong, it might not be aliens, but the Russians!). Kids making a low-budget zombie movie is funny, especially when all six of them can actually act. If you ignore the whole Government conspiracy angle, then everything was quite cute, even the possible aliens."
"bellantoni1","8","0","0","24 June 2011"," It Came From Outer Space
","First--I had a heck of a good time watching this film with my daughters (who couldn't help covering their eyes at times--and I don't blame them!) Most reviewers mention the homage Super 8 pays to 80s blockbusters like E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and I would put Stand By Me in there, too. Now I'm sure others have noticed this also, but the essential elements of the story line go back much further--to the 1953 SF film It Came From Outer Space. A really terrific film! The story idea and first treatment were created by a very young Ray Bradbury, though the screenplay was taken out of his hands and given to a more established writer. Who didn't quite bung it up completely, thank goodness. I don't want to ruin anything for anyone, so suffice to say that if you watch both films you'll see that in bare outline they are strikingly similar. Of course Super 8 is an updated, big budget film that cost about 50X more to make than It Came From Outer Space. Yet, strangely, the 1953 film is actually more believable. That's my one complaint about Super 8--too much of the action, events and characters soar glibly beyond credibility. An incredible premise is okay--but outlandish scenes tend to take me out of the story as I ask: ""how?"" ""what?"" ""why?"" and ""no way!"" Another problem--and this is true of about 85% of films--is a bad guy or gal with absolutely no redeeming qualities, nor any positive elements to his or her argument or position. A story is just so much stronger if both the ""hero"" and ""opponent"" have credible, sympathetic reasons for their conflict/positions/actions. But I quibble. Super 8 was the most fun I've had in a theater in ages. See it!"
"howard_Patrick","8","0","0","24 June 2011"," Sci-fi flick shows an entertaining homage to Spielberg
","With every movie buff, there is one movie director and his or her films that each movie geek grew up with over the decades. Whether it's Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Penny Marshall, George Lucas, Frank Capra, or Clint Eastwood. This year's nostalgic film is Super 8 directed by J.J. Abrams (Star Trek & Mission Impossible II) and produced by Steven Spielberg (Shindler's List & Jaws). Super 8's characters, story, and atmosphere give a justified and memorable two and a half hours of rekindling of the films by Steven Spielberg that made us go ""ooh"" and ""aw"" for four decades and decades to come. <br/><br/>The movie centers around 13 year old Joe Lamb played by newcomer Joel Courtney. The opening scene is of the funeral reception of the death of Joe's mother after a tragic accident at the machine factory where she worked. Six months later, Joe's relationship with father, Sheriff Lamb played by Kyle Chandler (The Kingdom) hasn't improved since his mom died. In order to get away from it all and mourn, he hangs out with his friends while they try to finish Charlie's, his best friend, amateur zombie flick with his Super 8 camera. During a night shoot at the town's local train station, the gang find themselves, while filming, right in the middle of a horrific train wreck caused by their school teacher who purposely derails it with his pick- up truck. During all of the on-going destruction, Joe and the Super 8 camera witness some mysterious unseen being or creature escape from one of the storage cars. After, all of the mayhem stops; military troops immediately arrive at the scene of the accident and begins to investigate. Joe and the others quickly flee and promise each other not to speak a word of this to anybody.<br/><br/>A few days later, more military forces begin to arrive at the town and starts to surround the entire crash site and sanction it off from the town citizens. To make things even creepier; dogs, appliances, car engines and eventually people begin disappearing and calls come in from people who say they saw something big that they can't fully explain. Joe dotes it upon himself and the crew that they should snoop around find out what really escaped from the train wreck. Of course with every group of kids who get too nosey, they reveal something that none of them are prepared for.<br/><br/>Director J.J. Abrams does a subtle, but recognizable job at blending in all of the memorable aspects of Spielberg films like the funny relationships between the kids, as they are this century's Goonies, even though there is only one Goonies. Increasing the curious tension of the appearance of the creature like the ingenious method in Jaws. The combination of visuals and musical score to create an E.T.-esque feel to the popcorn eating wonderment that is the film itself.<br/><br/>There is a lot of pressure on new coming actors especially child actors in impressing critics and audiences across the world because it's that first impression that decides whether or not that actor or actress is worth looking into. The newcomer up to bat is Joel Courtney who plays Joe, definitely brought the emotion, combined with Abrams' direction, of a small boy losing his mother and never being able to let go of her and move on. I'm sure Courtney was relaxed, while being surrounded by experienced child actors like Elle Fanning (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) and Gabriel Basso (The Big C). Courtney and rest of the kids do a fine job in adding little traits here and there that make the gang and each of them even more entertaining. <br/><br/>The flaws are, first of all, forgivable. There are a few questionable historical references of products like The Walkman and The Rubik's Cube, which is debatable whether these two pop culture icons actually were released to America in 1979. The Rubik's Cube for sure wasn't released to the states until 1980. The Walkman's release, on the other hand, is questionable. Another quick complaint was the noticeable, blue camera glare that kept popping up very often from time to time. Now, Abrams did this in Star Trek and I believe that he does this to add some realism to the fact that there would be glares from the camera metallic objects or something. All in all, certain audience members and I found it very distracting and it acted like a tick that wouldn't go away.<br/><br/>Super 8 is a great film that contributes to the hopefully satisfying ending of June. If you're a huge Spielberg buff and you appreciate his work then this is a film that will have you remember all of the classic moments of his films that astounded viewers for decades and decades to come. Super 8 will receive three and a half out of four popcorn bags."

This was written (and directed)by J.J Abrams (Lost, Star Trek). Steven Spielberg produced it. I thought that the story/script was great, even though there were a few violent jump-scenes and A LOT OF UNNECESSARY PROFANITY, most of it said by 12 year olds.<br/><br/>The Visuals were great.

Not much to be said here.<br/><br/>Now comes the part where people have really been complaining. Many people have been complaining that the film was unoriginal, and I agree. Before the film's release, people were saying things like 'Goonies 2'. Well, this is only true with the group of kids, no other relation to 'Goonies' story wise. But the two movies that relate to 'Super 8' the most are 'Cloverfield' (which Abrams produced) and 'E.T' (Which Speiberg directed). There also hints of other movies in there, like 'Jaws' (remember what I said about not wanting them to see the monster). Sure, this movie is not original, and probably not as good as those movies I just listed. Believe it or not, I actually haven't seen E.T or Jaws, but I have seen 'Cloverfield', and although 'Cloverfield' has a faster pace and stunning visuals, 'Super 8' has a better story that flows BY FAR.<br/><br/>I really leave it up to you if you want to see this film or not.

","Not out in the United Kingdom just yet but people will be seeing a lot of 'high-praise' reviews before it hits cinemas on August 5th. I neither liked or disliked this brave attempt at re-living family orientated entertainment. It had that 80's vibe to it but its actual feelings and outcomes were inconsistent at best. Was it trying to be a modern take on E.T. or The Goonies, perhaps a hybrid of both, perhaps it wasn't trying to be anything other than a summer slice of entertainment. And it does this well, especially the first half hour. A magnificent but scary train crash near the start which sets the films plot going is a brilliant piece of film-making and the whole thing is shot pro-actively by JJ.Abrams, if only Mr.Spielberg could have been bothered to put his 2 pence worth in. just like with the last installment of Indianna Jones, he is running out of integrity and a batch of fresh ideas. Super 8 is passable stuff, i would'nt not recommend it, the kid actors are all terrific and lift the film from potential drowsiness, Elle Fanning, struggling with a secret, and the obligatory 'fat' kid being very good. It can not be easy to capture the essence and the trials and tribulations of growing up. I might have preferred this if i was a kid myself, technically i am not, but it did remind me of being a late teen and messing around with film scripts and trying to perform a film called ZombieMaster, but thats another story. The Monster in this was always in the shadows, and that actually became a side issue for a long time while they focused on bringing out the characters a little more, which is no bad thing(but in a summer blockbuster, some may tire of the pacing). The film also ends on a bit of a bummer with a far too obvious, and corny finish. So after seeing the nifty trailer and reading some exciting early reviews, its nothing more than a walk the lines, airy bit of fun with a couple of noteworthy performances and scenes. Kudos to the kids though!"
"classicalsteve","7","0","0","20 June 2011"," Sort of ET meets Close Encounters meets ALIEN
","Even though this film was written and directed by J.J. Abrahms, the film oozes with Spielberg-ness. The film centers around a group of kids who have much more insight and wisdom than the adults, much like ET. The military branch of the US Government moves in, trying to hide whats really happening, much like Close Encounter of the Third Kind. And there's a large hulking space creature that I guess is not quite as malicious as the creature from Alien but he's tearing up a small town. As you'll see, some of the creature's victims are treated similarly to Alien.<br/><br/>The film involves a group of kids of junior high school age in 1979 shooting their own zombie-horror flick; one of whom has just lost his mother. The director Charles (played very convincingly by the young and talented Riley Griffiths), a sort of 12-year-old throwback to Orson Welles, replete with pipe, is the obsessed and ambition filmmaker doing everything he can to make a great film. He is constantly speaking of ""production value"". My guess is his character may have been somewhat based on the young Steven Spielberg who pressed his friends into little film projects shot with his super-8 camera back in the 1950's. The two other characters which emerge as the main focus are Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) two people thrust together because of their involvement with the film project who become somewhat intimate in a way that only 12-year-old's can. A supporting character of note has to be Cary, played by Ryan Lee, who carries around fire crackers just to make the older folk cringe.<br/><br/>The group is shooting a scene at a train station with the boy main character and the only girl in the movie. Their production literally becomes derailed by a train wreck which obliterates everything in sight, not to mention the station, although the super-8 camera which continued to film was surprisingly untouched! Of course, this is not just a train derailment: the whole train looks like it was in the middle of the front lines in WWII. A man in a busted up pick-up, looking half-dead, who may have intentionally derailed the train, tells the kids to run for their lives. The kids escape in their car, which was also surprisingly untouched, before the military guys show up with flash-lights and guns.<br/><br/>The story then moves on several fronts: the mystery of the train wreck, Charles' obsession with completing his movie, and the relationship between Joe and Alice and their parents. Eventually, when more of the mystery is revealed, the film becomes largely about a kind of reconciliation between the two kids and their parents. At a certain point, the movie-making aspect takes a back seat to the relationships of the two kids and the two adults. It seemed like Charles, the director, at one point, seems more like a supporting character.<br/><br/>Although I definitely enjoyed this film, largely because of the believability of the kids which is first-rate by any standard, I was frustrated on a couple of points. I thought the movie was trying to do too many things given its parameters. To me, the relationship between the two main kid characters and their parents distracted away from the really interesting idea about the kids trying to make their movie. Also, I thought there would be a lot more about the footage which was gotten at the train wreck. <br/><br/>The one character who I felt was slightly under-developed was Charles, the kid director. His screen time was sacrificed in order to develop more about the adult relationships, which I found less interesting, some of which seemed just a touch cliché. I wanted to know more about Charles, why he was shooting his films and other information. Only late in the film do we learn more about him and why he was engaging in this project.<br/><br/>Two stories which are very similar to this film, Spielberg's ET and Stephen King's IT, focus almost exclusively on the kids, who they are, and what they are trying to accomplish. If a story begins about a group of kids, I think it is better for the story to stay on them rather getting off on tangents. Super-8 started out that way, but then took a bit of a side turn and focused more on a couple of the adult characters. I was sort of expecting the kids to be on the lead and in the forefront for most of the story, and I wanted them to be the ones who solve the mystery without intervention from dear-old dad. Still, a very enjoyable movie, and the acting is first-rate to take you all the way. One surprise is at the end during the credits, which was actually my favorite part of the film, but I won't give it away!"

","I want to start of by saying that I, even though I know I should never have, had huge expectations for this movie due to the people involved with it and all the hype for it. Therefore I now have mixed feelings about the result of the movie. Whilst Abrams and Spielberg have proved themselves to be masterful many times, it seems like this co-work panned out a little bit out of focus. It's like someone in charge couldn't agree on if they were doing a E.T sequel or a Cloverfield sequel.<br/><br/>Super 8, to me, is at it's best when it has that mysterious Cloverfield/Lost tone and not the E.T storytelling where characters literally tell every answer to every question you're having as a viewer. Whenever that happens in this film, it ruins the excitement for the mysterious plot and main villain's purpose. It's like someone forgot that a well-done mysterious movie is exciting because it's mysterious, however that happened. <br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, it's enjoyable, but it could have been so much more if they would have left parts of it mysterious and unsolved."
"jdesando","Null","0","0","20 June 2011"," Right at home
","Audiences will feel right at home in director J.J. Abrams' and producer Steven Spielberg's Super 8, an homage to Abrams' Cloverfield with its found footage motif and to many of Spielberg's child-like, home-driven imaginative films such as E.T.<br/><br/>Summer action doesn't get much better as adolescents like Elle Fanning struggle against the army, aliens, and parents who just don't get it. The cinematography is Abrams worthy, action dominant but with the camera frequently at a distance that allows full appreciation, rather than claustrophobia. The team of adolescent buddies filming a zombie movie can't be anything but Spielberg as an enterprising young filmmaker.<br/><br/>That team witnesses and films a horrific train accident that is not your garden variety disaster: it carries inside it strange Rubik's Cube objects and the hint of alien life that gives life to what could have been a standard teen alienation-from-parents story.<br/><br/>As in several of Spielberg's film, getting home, be it kids reconciling with parents or aliens trying to leave, is the central motif along with the splendor of fighting the teen age monsters within and growing up amid disaster. In Super 8, the teens' comic relief is regular and sophisticated, the interaction with parents and other authority figures just mature enough to keep respect flowing both ways.<br/><br/>Summer is reaching its peak, the skies are full of stars, and motion pictures will offer relief from the heat as well as, in the case of Super 8, a fun action film that will make you remember other sci-fi but acknowledge that the Abrams/Spielberg team does it all better than anyone else could do."

","This movie was pretty fun. Spielberg and Abrams both have noticeable presence in the film, meaning there's signature things in the movie that relate to past works. It's full of good action, suspense, and acting. This movie also did a lot to bring back memories of when you were a kid and the conversations you'd have with friends.<br/><br/>The action and effects where cool. The explosions were semi-tame, meaning not too over top keeping in mind that this is some-what of a monster movie. (***SPOILER***) Even though you don't see the creature/monster much, from what you could see it was very well done. This brings back the memories of Spielberg's ""Jaws"" where the lack of visual presence of the shark made it that much more suspenseful. (end ***SPOILER***). However, there seemed to be some unfulfilled desire that I felt wasn't met when watching this, mainly the ending.<br/><br/>The acting is what really made this movie, though. The way the kids interacted by poking fun at each other, each having a signature phrase they use often to describe something (""mint""), and basically the common arguments/dilemmas friends face together. Elle Fanning was especially impressive with her scenes. Most of the adult actors were forgettable, however, which may have been the main reason for me feeling something was missing. Characters that were suppose be antagonists I never really felt a feeling of anger or dislike towards.<br/><br/>Overall, good movie with great action and acting. 7 Stars."
"petit76","Null","0","0","16 June 2011"," a perfect throwback to the era of ET!
","Super 8 is one of the best summer kid movies in ages. In fact, it is a throwback to ET, The Goonies and other movies Spielberg (and Joe Dante) made so deftly in the 1980's. Amazingly, the movie set in the gateway to the 1980's: 1979. We begin with 12-year-old Joe (Joel Lamb) and his father, Jack (Kyle Chandler) dealing with the death of their mother and wife, respectively. As school lets out four months later, Joe wants to work with his friends, Charles, (Riley Griffiths), Cary (Ryan Lee), Preston (Zach Mills) and Martin (Gabriel Basso). The odd man (or woman) out is Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) who wants to join them for a few scenes. They all meet at midnight to shoot a scene as a train passes by. Then, the train is derailed in a spectacular crash. Strangely, it was caused by someone deliberately driving on the tracks towards the train. It turns out to be their Jr. High Science Teacher who warns them to not say anything to protect themselves and their parents. The Air Force responds unusually fast - leaving the town police force (now led by Joe's father, Jack) in the dark of their work. At that same time, people, dogs, appliances, and car parts mysteriously disappear. Something is wondering the woods. Something escaped. Something dangerous. Or is it the Air Force that's dangerous. So much works for this film - mostly in story and acting. The kids involved pull off great performances, especially from newcomer Joel Courtney who takes the lead. He plays the role so well, shifting from friend with a bunch of Jr. High kids and an adolescent suffering from a lost mother and estranged father. Alice has her own problems stemming from her dad. Amazingly, all of them are intertwined in the drama that unfolds evenly. Another strength is the special effects, which are used as a background to the story as opposed to being the feature. This is related to the creature that is not fully seen until close to the end. And the story related to the alien is not as predictable as the one with the humans. More than anything else, though, it captures the mindset of seventh graders as they wonder through adolescence. The conversations have the same quick-wit and unfocused meandering in kids of that age. Everyone knew a Cary who liked to blow things up and play with fireworks. We knew a Charles as the bossy kid who has a passionate project. I did have two strikes against the movie: the third act was a little disjointed and did not provide cohesiveness. Also, the ending was a little abrupt. And while some people complain the ending was a little over-the-top, I think they forget the flying bicycles in E.T. Still, overall, it is far better than most summer movies of late. Not to say there are some good summer movies, but this one outshines most of them because Super 8 relies more on story and character instead of overblown special effects. It has the feel of a 1980's Spielberg movie and is taken in the same spirit. J.J. Abrams is one of the better talents who seems to have grown instead of stagnating and backsliding like M. Night Shyamalan. I look forward to Abrams next project ... as long as it is not a sequel to Super 8. Evren Buyruk"
"will-105","6","7","24","5 June 2011"," Not great but not bad...until the climax
","This director's 'Star Trek' made for great entertainment and a movie (not film) that I absolutely loved. Sorry, but I can't say the same for this one. The first hour or so sets up some very intriguing major dramatic questions and really pique the audience's interest. Unfortunately the payoffs to most of the setups are a bit weak, except for the resolution to the big question, and that payoff is flat out puny, bordering on ridiculous. In recent interviews Abrams has proudly cited the films that inspired this one and the evidence as to which ones they are is in full display very soon after Joe, our young protagonist (a stellar performance by newcomer Joel Courtney)is introduced and continue throughout. <br/><br/>Joe's relationship with Alice (an astonishing Elle Fanning) is the ONE thing in this movie that rings absolutely true. They are wonderful together. <br/><br/>Other than that the rest of the movie is a series of rehashed set pieces that do not engage us so much emotionally but rather ask us to sit and take in a tonally uneven and bland mash-up of what has come before and was done better. Not good, not bad, but if you're looking for an exciting time at the movies this summer, look elsewhere."
"blackmambamark","8","5","16","7 June 2011"," Wish they never stopped making kids movies like this.....
","Funny that Abrams is working with Spielberg.....seeing that i consider JJ to be the next Stephen. But has Abrams ever created an idea on his own? Every single movie he has directed has been from someone else's hand. He has proved that he can direct one hell of a movie, but can he create one out of thin air? Remember those old late 70's early 80's kid movies? Ex: ""Stand By Me"", ""Goonies"" ext. This movie really strikes a cord with those. Not in the adventure sense, well....that too......but the comparison that i'm trying to make is the overall presence of these main characters and the dialog they exchange with each other. The humorous cussing and funny scenarios....it fits right in with those classic films that we all remember. And it made me think.....Why aren't kids movies like this anymore? It was a nice trip down memory lane for any film geek.<br/><br/>As far as story lines, the movie is pretty damn solid. It has that certain Spielberg vibe to it with a little JJ spice thrown in. I mean come on, a bunch of kids filming an amateur zombie flick and witness a train crash carrying contents from Area 51.....you couldn't ask for a better summer movie set-up. But i know most people walking into this will think that everything is about discovering this creature......much like ""Stand By Me"" with the body, and the treasure with ""The Goonies"". But if you understand those movies, you will also know that there is a much deeper subtext. With ""Super 8"", it's got a lot more heart. I wouldn't say it has more heart that ""Stand By Me"", but it comes pretty damn close, and that in itself is a big compliment.<br/><br/>But what really sells this story are the characters. The kids in this crack me up like you wouldn't believe. And oh my god.....Elle Fanning just made her sister look stupid with her talent.<br/><br/>But the transitions between the adults and the kids are great. Each one is entertaining, and there is always something physically going on to keep your attention. From beginning to end, the movie does not stop moving.<br/><br/>And next we move onto the alien, which i have been dying to see for over a year now. I won't go into too much detail, but it's really similar to the ""Cloverfield"" monster, just a smaller version. The back story behind this creature is pretty cool, i really wish they could have gone into more detail. They give you enough to wet your hands, but i wanted a full bath. The cool aspect they did with the creature is to the same effect of ""Jaws"". You don't really see the entire thing until all hell breaks loose, which comes somewhere in the third act.<br/><br/>I know most nerds like myself will dislike the ending, but i however enjoyed it. It wasn't cheesy or over the top......it fit nice and snug with the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Bottom Line.....i know it will take a couple of days for this movie to fully sink into my brain, because like i said before, once it starts, it doesn't stop. But judging from what i just experienced, they really don't make summer movies like this anymore. It's a nice trip down memory lane with the nostalgia. The characters are all enjoyable. The Sci-Fi aspect is really cool. The action is top notch. Everything a summer movie should be. I just wish every kids movie was like this......because 20 years ago.....it was."
"changmoh","7","4","12","8 June 2011"," Nostalgic Trip Into the Era of Spielberg's Hits
","""Super 8"" takes us back to the glorious days of Spielberg treats like ""The Goonies"", ""E.T. The Extraterrestrial"", and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". Indeed, written and directed by Jeffrey Jacob Abrams, ""Super 8"" is a collaboration between Abrams and Steven Spielberg who serves as producer.<br/><br/>As a teenager, Abrams' film-making exploits caught Spielberg's eye and it earned him a gig restoring Spielberg's own 8mm movies. And if, after viewing the movie, you thought that this is Abrams' homage to Spielberg, Abrams has denied it, saying (in an interview) that ""It was never intended as homage to him, but really to that period of my life, which was really the first impulse of this movie."" For many, ""Super 8"" will also remind them of their own childhood adventures and maybe even their first love.<br/><br/>During the summer of 1979, a group of school friends led by aspiring director Charles (Riley Griffiths) and make-up trainee Joe (Joel Courtney) are making a zombie movie in a small town in Ohio when they witness a catastrophic train crash. The boys, and their volunteer actress Alice (Elle Fanning), soon suspect that there is more to the accident than meets the eye. Soon people and dogs go missing, and violent, inexplicable events begin to take place in town. And as the US military arrive, Joe's dad Jackson (Kyle Chandler), the local Deputy Sheriff, tries to uncover the truth - which turns out to more terrifying than any of them could have imagined.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed about ""Super 8"" is how the young cast, led by Dakota Fanning's sister Elle, draw us into their movie-within-a-movie. Fanning's Alice may be talented and pretty and the romantic interest of the boys around her, but she is the gutsiest among the kids. Needless to say, she grabs our attention whenever she is on-screen - as do the other youngsters as they strive to make sense of what is happening from the events captured on the Super 8 camera.<br/><br/>The movie may deal with an alien 'invasion' but it is mainly about that time when American adolescents learn about friendship, loyalty, survival and love. Joe, the protagonist, has admired Alice from a distance and boy, does he revel in the chance to touch her face - while doing her make-up. These 'soft' scenes are interspersed with hard-core action sequences like the train crash and the devastation by the alien (which looks quite like the monster from Alien). It is to Abrams' credit that he has resisted the temptation to give audiences a proper view of the 'extra-terrestrial'. Anyway, sustaining curiosity is Abrams' forte, having created TV's ""Lost"" and ""Fringe"" series.<br/><br/>Among the adult cast are Noah Emmerich, who plays the nasty military commander, and Ron Eldard as Alice's father. They put up credible performances but it is a pity to see them upstaged by the outstanding young cast. Bravo to the youngsters. - (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)"
"neji107","8","4","12","8 June 2011"," J.J. Abrams does it again!
","As you might expect, J. J. Abrams has churned out another exhilarating experience with solid entertainment. Imagine, if you will, a combination of The Goonies + Cloverfield and you will get Super 8, the story of a young boy and his friends that witness a creature escaping a crashed military train while filming with a super 8 camera. As I heard an audience member say after the screening, J. J. Abrams put his fingerprint on this movie, then smeared it all over. The mysterious creature is only glimpsed a handful of times during the first half of the film, and the story will keep you constantly guessing and engaged. With the aid of some fantastic special effects, Super 8 will no doubt be one of the most exciting films of this summer, additionally offering a nostalgic reminder of the times of Spielberg's E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. So the bottom line is: Super 8 is good, and if you're watching it as a J. J. Abrams fan, you're in for a real treat.<br/><br/>But the film is not without its flaws. Within this young cast you can sense a lot of rising stars but that's just it. They're still ""rising"". It is a common problem to have some amateur acting with kids. The story is not entirely original either. However, these are only minor complaints against the movie. The main issue with Super 8 is that it can't decide what it wants to be. Is it a coming-of-age drama? Is it an alien action film? Is it horror mystery? Alien and horror and mystery genres can mix quite nicely, but unfortunately coming-of-age not so much. One aspect of the film focuses on the adventure of kids in a rural town while another focuses on a violently rampaging alien. The result is a schizophrenic jumble of genres that has you shifting uncomfortably in your seat at the idea of kids watching certain scenes. For this reason, I STRONGLY caution adults taking their kids to see this movie. Super 8 had more blood, cursing, and blatant drug references than any movie I have seen in a while. IT's a bit like walking into Kick-ass expecting a child's movie. In my honest opinion Super 8 should have been rated R, but Abrams was careful when pushing the limits of PG-13 rules. Indeed, this movie was a wonderful throwback to the days of E.T., but perhaps should only be viewed by those who watched E.T. when it came out. Don't forget that the Abrams touch is violent, as well as mysterious! 8/10"
"kurtjohnson-84-114323","8","3","8","18 June 2011"," Fun Movie!
","I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a fun, escapist summer movie with nostalgia, monsters, and good music. The acting was excellent, the story was a throwback to the old movies I remember, and it made me jump a few times. If you're not in the mood for deep thinking or being depressed, it is a great way to spend some time at the matinée or the evening show. I'll be buying the DVD when it comes out. I went with two teenagers and my sister. We all agreed it was the best movie we had seen in a while. It's not Academy Award material, but it's what movies were meant to be--entertaining. No four letter words, nudity or gratuitous violence. No over-reliance on special effects, and it had some good acting."
"Grunyen","2","3","8","17 June 2011"," This movie was lame.
","Massively over-hyped. People are completely desperate more movies now. JJ Abrams continues to be financially successful by turning out crap entertainment. I don't know how he convinces people that his work is any good. Super 8 is a straight remix of ET, Close Encounters, and the Goonies, with a little Cloverfield. The monster seems to be from the same neighborhood at least, all elbows.<br/><br/>At no point did I care about any of the characters or why anything was happening. The Spielbergian ""homage"" lens flare was so omnipresent as to be distracting. It would just be blue laser lines in many scenes. I suspect a lot of the lens flare was actually CGI. When the first two paragraphs of dialog are lazy exposition, you know the script is weak. The dad character was non-existent. The rest of the movie consisted of a lot of running around and yelling."
"jdkraus","10","3","8","14 June 2011"," Super 8 is the reason why I see the movies
","Super 8 is not what the trailers build it up as—another science-fiction end of the world scenario. J.J. Abrams has something much more unique and surprising in mind. Abrams focus is not the visual effects; they are actually kept to a minimum, but rather the characters and the plot. I did not recognize any of the actors, but all of them perform flawlessly, especially the kids. They are so amusing to watch on the big screen, as well as engaging. When they laugh, you laugh with them. When they are in danger, you feel that anxiety. When they are in pain, you feel it—and it hurts. If there was a best ensemble cast award, this feature should win it. If I had to pick the best of all of the actors, it would Elle Fanning—though very unlikely, she deserves an Oscar for her performance. <br/><br/>I will admit that J.J. Abrams seemed to borrow some elements of other films, such as: E.T., War of the Worlds, The Goonies, Signs, and Transformers. Even so, this film stands as its own and it is not a ripoff, like some of the more newer sci-fi releases. It is a creative and a special film to watch. Abrams even ties in some powerful symbolism and themes into this film without getting preachy—I will not give these or the story away, for they are that good. One thing that some people may not like about this film is how loud the sound design is. It is really loud, particularly with the jump moments and a train crash sequence. I personally don't like deafening sound in theaters, but this technique by the sound designers and editors fits the film perfectly—the movie would not have had such an impact without this approach. <br/><br/>In short, ""Super 8"" is the reason why I see movies. It has believable, compelling performances, sublime film-making, a creative story, and it is well-paced. There is also plenty of action, suspense, drama, and humor. This film is also beautifully photographed, with awesome sound, and Michael Giacchino's best score to date. If you have lost faith in Hollywood's release of movies, see Super 8. J.J. Abrams has a shot to revive the film industry from the dumper that it has been heading in for the last decade. <br/><br/>Rating: ****/****"
"bigcalkenobi","8","3","8","13 June 2011"," A great piece of nostalgia that reminds viewers where modern sci-fi came from
","Super 8 takes us back to a style of film making that has been long forgotten. Things like camera flare, charming child characters, camera glare, and certain types of camera tricks have been done away with in the modern film making era. This movie goes back to the fundamental style of film making in the 1970s and 80s that inspired J.J. Abrams to become a film maker. Abrams claimed that this film was heavily inspired by the Spielberg sci-fi movies he grew up on and to ensure that this style is felt Spielberg himself produces the movie. The other thing about this movie that has peaked the interest of film goers is the secrecy and mystery surrounding the film. Abrams has always had a habit of keeping his projects under wraps because he wants the audience to be surprised whenever they see the film. This film has held a lot of promise for a lot of different people due to the talent on the project and the the exciting mystery surrounding Super 8. Can Super 8 meet these expectations or will the film fall flat and deliver an unmemorable; unoriginal experience for audiences?<br/><br/>Check out the rest of my review on my film blog http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/super-8-review/"
"dvc5159","6","3","8","10 June 2011"," Excellent storytelling. It's the kind of movie Spielberg would make in the 80's.
","I like this movie. I really do, honest. Most of the blockbusters are mostly solid while most of the others are ho-hum. However, J.J. Abrams has performed a summer movie miracle. In the process of creating a homage of Steven Spielberg movies, he has crafted an extremely entertaining film that has a heart as big as its thrills.<br/><br/>I won't describe the juiciest bits of the story here, since they'll spoil the public. All I can tell you is that it's about kids making a movie using their Super 8 camera, something mysterious happen, strange things start to happen. Having said that, the screenplay is well written, most notably the dialog by the children which is funny, witty and engaging. I especially admire the children's attention to detail - like finding production value for their movie. The way they make their own little movie is a touching, heartfelt ode to the filmmakers who also started out that way. Makes anyone, young or old, want to make their own movies again if they haven't already.<br/><br/>It's an amazing feat when all of the child actors perform especially well in their roles, and actually make you care about them, and bring you into their adventure. I really hope all child actors will get good, promising careers in the future. In addition, it's nice to see Kyle Chandler on the big screen again.<br/><br/>Abrams pulled it off here, not only in writing the screenplay but directing the movie as well with care and focus. He has direction that would make Spielberg proud. Of course, with Spielberg himself producing the film it's no surprise that the entire film feels like a genuine Spielberg movie, the kind of adventure movie that he would make before ""Schindler's List"" changed him into a bona-fide serious filmmaker (not that that's a bad thing). We've come a long way since adventure films like ""E.T."" and ""The Goonies"", but Spielberg and Abrams prove that old school works, and works well. The well-rendered CGI and some spectacular action sequences are actually overshadowed by the mystery, story and characters, proving once again that eye candy is no match for a big heart and good ol' fashioned storytelling.<br/><br/>With good cinematography, production design and a John William-esque score by Michael Giacchino, ""Super 8"" is the best of the blockbusters, maybe for the summer, maybe for 2011 itself (I still patiently await Spielberg's own ""Tintin""). One thing's for sure, in terms of pure entertainment, this is perfect. It has that rare blockbuster movie magic, and I would not be surprised if ""Super 8"" was nominated for Best Picture at next year's Oscars. No, I'm not joking, and I'm certainly not exaggerating.<br/><br/>If J.J. Abrams can keep this up, he would be a potential successor to Steven Spielberg. And lastly, stay for the credits.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 86/100"

","Essentially a pastiche of numerous other movies and film tropes you've seen countless times before (think ""E.T."", ""The Goonies,"" and ""Close Encounters"" with a dash of ""Romeo & Juliet""), ""Super 8"" is that oddly appealing kind of film that amounts to more than the sum of its parts. There's actually nothing original about this film that focuses on a group of middle school students making a zombie movie in their Midwestern town in 1979. Their quaint enterprise is disrupted by a cinematically epic train crash (the most impressive sequence in the entire film) that signifies, of course, more than meets the eye. The titular camera plays a pivotal role in unraveling the mystery behind the train crash, as do our intrepid young hero and his star-crossed crush (the daughter of the town drunk/ne'er do well who may or may not have been responsible for the death of our hero's mother). Despite the clichéd ingredients, this film boasts a strong heart and a dedication to classic narrative and character development—elements that make this film much better than your typical mindless summer blockbuster."
"3xHCCH","7","3","8","12 June 2011"," Perfectly Spielbergian
","""Super 8"" is a very hyped-up movie. The trailer does not tell us much, just a train crash that a group of middle school kids witness. But truth to tell, the name of Steven Spielberg attached to this project still did a lot to bring the audience in. I was one of them. J.J. Abrams as the director also gives the film some pedigree.<br/><br/>""Super 8"" brings us back to the summer of1979. We follow a gang of kids who are finishing a zombie film for a short film competition. While shooting a scene at a train station one midnight, they witness a massive train crash. Following this event, strange goings-on like missing appliances and disappearing pets then people pervade their small town of Lilian, Ohio. Before they know it, the US Air Force comes in and evacuates the whole town. These events are seen in the eyes of these young teens.<br/><br/>The central character is Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney). We share his excitement over his shared film project with his friends, where his role is make-up and models. We share his sadness over his mom's death and his alienation from his busy policeman father (Kyle Chandler). We share his puppy love with Alice (a very pretty and mature-looking Elle Fanning). His personal story was intertwined with the terrorization of his town by an unknown menace.<br/><br/>This is not really a perfect film. The ending (which I found cheesy, overly sentimental but ultimately senseless, especially that locket scene)could in fact have been done much better. However, it is a perfectly Spielbergian film. We see him in the precocious children who play the lead characters. We see him in the passionate hobby of the kids. We see him in the alien monster. So many elements of 80's Spielberg can be seen in ""Super 8"", now for a new generation of kids to identify with. <br/><br/>As the main film faded out, I was thinking they should have shown the film that the kids were working on. Happily, they did! Stay on through the first half of the credits as you see the kids' ouevre, entitled ""The Case."""
"StevePulaski","9","3","8","11 June 2011"," A mix of everything classic
","From online buzz, from friends hammering it in my head, from Super Bowl ads, to theater previews, I've seen the trailer for Super 8 about fifteen times. Short versions, long versions, two to three minute versions, I was sick of it. I said I didn't want to see it and ignored previews of it in theaters. That changed when I read reviews. I heard it was a seventies, eighties homage in a way and Abrams and Spielberg work wonders.<br/><br/>If I would've ignored this film and saw it on DVD, as planned, I would've been angry and ashamed of myself. Super 8 officially earns my pick as my favorite film of 2011 at the halfway mark. We are halfway through another year of movies and Super 8 has outdone itself and certainly showed off more than I could've imagined.<br/><br/>One of my favorite J.J. Abrams' films is the forgotten Joy Ride. he produced/wrote the film which I found heavily enjoyable and mark it as one of my favorite horror films. He sure knew how to develop the characters and conduct them in a believable fashion rather than having them be cliché protagonists. We got backstory and we got action. Enough to keep my intrigued the whole ride.<br/><br/>Super 8 is a film where I'd prefer discussing my feelings about it rather than the plot itself. I'll explain it simplistically so nothing is ruined; a group of tweens in the summer of 1979 are making their own short film on a Super 8 camera. During the filming of a train scene, they witness a horrible and vicious train accident that causes a major derail for the gigantic train and nearly ends the lives of the kids.<br/><br/>Now the town is being faced with something beyond anyone's expectations. Dogs disappear and the military's presence disrupts the town's natural flow. I refuse to go further than that. I knew all of that before going into it. Don't let yourself know more than that, if that.<br/><br/>As for the film, it's one of the most electrifying and riveting experiences I've had the movies in recent years. Maybe it's because the film's protagonist, young teens like I mentioned, have the same interests as me. Girls and movies. I think the most heart-warming thing about Super 8 is it knows where it came from. It doesn't rely on 3D technology or poorly done CGI to make a film. CGI is used, but in the most effective and proper way since District 9.<br/><br/>The film is a main homage to films like Close Encounters, E.T., The Goonies, Gremlins, Jaws, and other science fiction films done by Spielberg himself. It even resembles that of a drive in film you'd catch on a late Saturday in the seventies. It is done like it would be in 1979 minus the computer animation.<br/><br/>The kid actors made the film. I loved the male lead Joel Courtney and the female lead Elle Fanning, Dakota Fanning's little sister. Both play the roles with authentic and believable reactions to this extremely massive event taking place. The music only adds to some of the scenes in the film that are still done with dead on tonality and effective camera work, props to J.J. Abrams, again.<br/><br/>Super 8's ending can spark criticism. I wasn't a favorite of it, but I really believe it's because both Abrams and Spielberg couldn't think of an effective way to conclude a film like this. I will give it the benefit of the doubt and hope the DVD will receive an alternate ending or two to assure more satisfaction. Regardless, this is an amazing action film that blends a perfect mix of comedy, drama, coming of age, apocalyptic, science-fiction, and numerous other genres to make one indescribable film. It's something that needs to be witnessed on the big screen.<br/><br/>Starring: Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, and Kyle Chandler. Directed by: J.J. Abrams."

","This is probably one on the best movies I have seen in a very long time. It's keeps you glued to your seat. You really can't compare this movie with any other recent movies out there. It is not really a horror or a disaster movie. It is not a thriller either. It is just great. The acting is amazing, especially the kids. The direction is superb. I have always been conflicted about Abrams, but this time he did everything right. The way they marketed the movie gave me the impression that the movie will revolve around a creature. Boy was I glad to be wrong. It is a story about kids, families and adventure. Watch it, you will be glad you did."
"michael-3081","10","3","8","11 June 2011"," Slightly exaggerated 10 but amazing!!!!!
","So it is obvious that my hard 10 is a little exaggerated but I really love this film. Spoiler alert!!!<br/><br/>The homage in this film is thick but I can't blame Abrams for loving Spielberg. I, in fact, wish had in on such a man crush after seeing this film because it knocked my socks off. There were a few continuity errors but for the obvious reason of progressing the slow moments of the story, so do not complain about the speed of the story. Yes there was a little that was not explained, okay, well a lot. But those holes in the story ask for audience involvement in the best kind of way, filling in blanks where continuity would just be a hassle. My only problem with the film is at one particular part. The part where Alice is taken by the monster and her father is trying to get out of the car. Some audio was clearly added in post production to dampen the mistake in the diologue. Alice's father is clearly screaming for ""Elle"" as in Elle Fanning and not screaming for ""Alice"" the name of Faning's character. Oops. Other than that I can only speak highly of the feeling that the movie left with me and will continue to leave with me until I personally own the film."
"virek213","10","3","8","11 June 2011"," SUPER 8 Gets A ""10""
","One of the things that make certain summers at the movies something more than just an endless stream of special effects blockbusters that promise a lot of bang for your buck, but in the end seem to offer precious little in the way of substance, is that sometimes there is that special kind of ""blockbuster"" that has everything you could want, and something more. SUPER 8, from writer/director J.J. Abrams, who directed the 2009 STAR TREK and 2006's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE III, is certainly one of those films for the summer of 2011. Abrams got a lot of help in bringing this film to fruition thanks to the generosity of his mentor Steven Spielberg; and while some will inevitably compare certain aspects of SUPER 8 to Spielberg's own directorial efforts, but the comparisons are just in the way that Abrams seems to understand that special effects alone do not a great movie make.<br/><br/>Instead of going with a big-name cast, Abrams went with comparative unknowns, most of whom were young kids. The film is set in a small Ohio town during the summer of 1979. Several kids, including Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning, are in the process of making a zombie horror flick using Super 8-millimeter Kodak film when, one night, they witness a violent train wreck that involves a truck being driven by their biology teacher (Glynn Turman). The accident is caught on camera, and they really think nothing of ituntil the Air Force mysteriously moves in to seal the accident scene. Turman warns the kids that if they tell anyone about this ""incident"", they and their parents may suffer some consequences too horrible to contemplate. The local police, led by Chandler, get precious little cooperation from the Air Force guys, including Noah Emmerich, and there's a good reason why. which is revealed step by step and not all at once. This is a film where a certain amount of brainpower and thought is required, even with a young cast in charge.<br/><br/>Abrams clearly doesn't make things easy by setting this film back in 1979, nor should he. There are no Blue Tooths, Blackberrys, IPods, the Internet, or digital cameras; instead, the means of communication are traditional telephones, citizens band radios, and the titular Super 8-millimeter camera that the kids use--this, and the sight of souped up and loud Trans-Ams. Abrams does utilize several elements of his mentor's films CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and E.T., in the way things go haywire and the power goes out with the aliens' presence (the aliens remain mostly shadow figures until the climax). And as happens in E.T., the military and the law seem to be depicted in a much more sinister light than the aliens themselves (even with all the mayhem being caused), and the kids, including Fanning (who looks like a dead ringer for a grown-up Drew Barrymore), are far more sympathetic. However, he is wise not to be so overtly slavish of his mentor.<br/><br/>The presence of such great 1979 hits as ""Heart Of Glass"" (by Blondie) and ""My Sharona"" (by the Knack) amidst Giacchino's dramatic score give us a good feel of what it was like back in those days. And while it is tempting in a film of this nature to hype up the special effects work, all of which is extremely good, the effects themselves don't swamp the movie. Even if the alien story part of the film is pretty much part-and-parcel of special effects blockbusters, it is what Abrams does with this plot that makes SUPER 8 more than just another high-budget blockbuster; it is a film worthy of comparisons to Spielberg himself."

","Super 8 derails all the infantile movie-making of explosion artists and delivers a nostalgic return to the subtleties of cinema.<br/><br/>In retrospect, it's funny to think that Steven Spielberg was condemned by many of his contemporaries during the '70s and '80s, that movies of such material merit were criticized of stripping Hollywood of its depth and reducing substance to spectacle. We can only laugh at at the thought of what those same detractors would think of filmmakers like Michael Bay. But Spielberg was, and still is, far from a simple manufacturer of parlour tricks; he was a master storyteller, capable of photographing our most closeted fears and intimate imaginations. Produced by Amblin Entertainment and Bad Robot Productions, and distributed by Paramount, J.J Abrams now aims to pay tribute to the man, his method, and its magic.<br/><br/>In a run-of-the-mill Spielbergian suburbia in 1979, Joel Courtney is Joe Lamb, a timid kid with an estranged father (Kyle Chandler), a recently deceased mother, and a fat filmmaker for a friend (Riley Griffiths). When they're not at school, Joe and the aforesaid weighty Charles make movies and talk movies. Accompanied by their two buddies and the intimidating companionship of a young belle (Elle Fanning), the adolescent Hollywood aspirants take to the night to shoot their 8mm zombie flick.<br/><br/>Super 8's first act is pure pleasure and a joy for the juvenile in all of us especially for those of us who made movies when we were a kid. Pressed for time in the late hours of the night, telling your friends to shut up and stop screwing around because you're running out of film, arguing for twenty minutes about whether to go for a close-up or a medium it's impossible to suppress a smile.<br/><br/>Cue all hell breaking loose. A speeding train springs from its tracks in a massive crash and, unbeknownst to the crew, a perverse E.T. frees itself from one of the cars, setting into motion the military occupancy of the small Ohio town. The rest of the runtime centres on many of Super 8's characters coming to grips with unresolved family issues, notably the Spielberg-trademark of fathers and their sons, and a straightforward 'damsel-in-distress' finale.<br/><br/>Closer to the third kind beings of Encounters than the central titular alien in the Extra-Terrestrial, the creature in Super 8 is more of a MacGuffin monster. It doesn't play a real role except to act as a catalyst for the maturation of Joe, his friends, and their families. It drives the plot forward like a chauffeur not really there, and you don't really care you just want to get to where you're headed. This excuses the fact that the alien is not nearly as memorable as notable others, although Abrams does well in adhering to the principle of what you don't see is more frightening than what you do see, as blurring and obscure angles prevent you from almost never having a clear view of the monster, making it all the more menacing.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, Super 8 is a virtuoso comparable with the works of the maestro it models. Whether it's the mechanical madness of a tank crushing the innocence of a child's playground, or the seldom shot of a silhouette against the skyline, the images here compliment, rather than dominate the established world. Frankness forgiven, I've said it once and I'll say it again movies with balls are nothing without heart. The explosive images employed here are powerful because Abrams understands the principle that we don't give two f**** about a propane tank exploding we care about the people that the blast could harm. Of course speaking of our director, what would an Abrams film be without a hundred lens flares, except that this time the visual device is actually relevant, continually reminding you that you're watching a movie and that's what this one's all about.<br/><br/>The awe and wonder of Super 8's legendary producer trump the cheap cookie-cutter 'blow it up and they'll keep entertained' strategy. Its monster forges these people by being, rather than interacting. Understand this it's not E.T. or Close Encounters it doesn't quite match the sentimentality of those films. Nor does it wield the same amount of scriptwriting focus – I felt as though J.J. was working to too many things instead of one sole objective – but it undeniably possesses the heart of its producer's predecessors, and similarly challenges its heroes to grow up and yet stay young. It tributes Spielberg, the frustrating fun of amateur film-making, but more than anything, it tributes imagination once again And the power of ideas over imagery."

","i have to say film had potential to be the next ET but failed even getting close to it. on the positive side it had good acting from the cast so downfall of this film was not their fault. directing was way of target film jumped from one place to another. effects are not worth mentioning action was almost not there. they did not know what to make of the monster so he was bad killer one minute softy the next. it was the last few minutes you actually see him or the thing even then i was not impressed. so would not have paid to see this at pictures rather wait for DVD version to see and decide. where it stands it is a one time watch"
"SeanDTheFilmMaker","10","3","8","11 June 2011"," Definitely a new classic!!!!!!!!
","Excellent family film, even better than I hoped! The child actors stole every scene and every moment they were in. Even during scary parts their antics had the audience and myself in stitches! Really reminded me of the Goonies with a sci-fi edge to it. Not to mention that for most kids who were between 12-15 in the 80's the whole thing felt authentic, I think most of us had the same toys and into the same thing as these kids. I was expecting a fun sci-fi film but they gave it a bit of a trip down memory lane, playing with our parents Super 8 camera making goofy movies. I already can't wait till the DVD release, or maybe just go and see it again in theaters."
"Teazrq","8","3","8","10 June 2011"," An excellent fairy tale
","So, I went to the movie after watching the trailer several times. I wasn't sure what to expect, since from the trailers, it looks like a ""monster-attacking"" movie, but I thought they wouldn't use kids as main characters if it's just like that.<br/><br/>So, anyways, after about half an hour, I realized that this is going to be a good movie (or at least the type of movie that I will enjoy). The reason is, first, there is a fair amount of character building, which I think is always a key element of good movie. Second, the performance of these kids are amazing, especially the girl (you will see when you watch it). And also, the music gives this movie a big boost.<br/><br/>You will probability say some of the scene doesn't make sense, like, ""I will never do this"", or, ""how can he do that"", that might drag you away for a couple of second from enjoying it. That's why I would rather call this movie a fairy tale (with a lot of modern filming technologies). It actually recalls me when I watched ""Stand by me"" a while ago, it is really just watching these kids doing their adventure and you feel like you are a kid again.<br/><br/>I guess I said enough about it, you have to watch it yourself. But if you expect this to be a summer blockbuster with a lot of monsters and explosions, this might not be the right movie for you. I'm just a movie goer, I watch all kinds of movies and I enjoyed this one. I think it's this summer's best one up to now. It would be a good movie for a family to watch too."
"Skullbussa","7","3","8","10 June 2011"," Worth it for the first hour but ultimately derails in the end
","I simply cannot understand how someone who is clearly talented can put together an hour or more of really fun summer movie and then blow it.<br/><br/>The homages to Jaws, Close Encounters, and E.T. are a real hoot but really ring hollow when you start to see the chinks in the films armor. The interaction between the children and the period costumes and set design are the star of this movie, not the script. The monster and his tale of trying to get home are simply there to push the narrative and it is clear that Abrams has no joy in telling that story.<br/><br/>Once the girl disappears from the group the film basically loses all energy, the characters begin to act erratically, and the suspension of disbelief is exhausted.<br/><br/>I wonder what Spielberg must have thought previewing the final cut of this film. Did he shift in his seat and wince at the absurd ending? Did he think of ways he could have done it better?<br/><br/>I'd love to see Spielberg go back to making movies like this. It will never happen. And it's a shame, because he did it better than anyone."
"jerrilynnbthomas","6","3","8","10 June 2011"," The kids are best part of the movie
","I know what a blockbuster is. Super 8 is not. It's a good family film minus the dirty language used by one of the kids.

Big things are in store for them.<br/><br/>I don't understand why it's called Super 8 and the missing dogs. It's a movie that you can wait to see on DVD. I only went to see the movie because Steven Spielberg was associated with the project.<br/><br/>I would honestly watch it again when it comes out on DVD but I wouldn't spend money to see it another time on the big screen. It's a great Saturday afternoon movie when you have nothing to do."
"BobbyPG","8","3","8","10 June 2011"," The overall product is wonderfully nostalgic, while successfully being its own work of art.
","J.J. Abrams has released his first complete brain-child, something completely his own. Well, sort of. For a long time he's had the idea and the characters for a movie about a group of kids making movies in the early 70′s. This was not enough to bring people into the theaters, or to hold a serious plot. So, this second idea of a monster movie, which Abrams also has had in his pocket for a while, was thrown into the melting pot, and Super 8 was born. The combination of the two ideas is actually pretty obvious while watching the movie. It's almost one half characters, one half monsters. But the synchronization and blending of the two was done well enough not to detract from the actual movie.<br/><br/>Something about the story and production of the movie that has gotten a lot of attention from critics is the comparison and similarity of this movie to classic Steven Spielberg movies like E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Firstly, the people are right. The camera work and angles, the similar story idea about a kid and an alien, and other aspects really are very similar to said movies. But the last time I checked, those were incredible movies, and this follows suite. It is like a band covering another, and doing it well enough to be called their own. That's the best analogy I can make. Secondly, while very similar in some areas, it sets itself apart with it's new-age effects, and I think the characters are immensely deeper than those of movies past.<br/><br/>If there is one thing that made this movie as good as it was, it was the cast, the group of kids specifically. Most of them had not seen much work, so finding such a great combination of people is awesome to see. These kids were incredible. They bring thoughts of The Goonies, a pack of friends that are just an absolute joy to watch go through some crazy adventures. These kids' on-screen presence was palpable, begging to be called perfect. Joel Courtney, the new-coming lead role, was great. You can feel both his pain and his compassion throughout. His cast of movie- making buddies, with Riley Griffiths playing the control freak director, Ryan Lee playing the wacky pyromaniac and Gabriel Basso playing the quirky actor, are virtually a non-fictional group of friends making movies together. Last, but definitely not least, we have the enchanting Elle Fanning, who from her first time being on-screen in this movie, completely blew me out of the water. She is an older kid brought into the gang's movie to play the leading actress, and even her in-movie acting is insane. Since her role in Somewhere, which I thought she killed, she seems so much more mature and grown up. She is so lovely and adorable, much more-so than her sister, who is nothing to scoff at herself, I can only wait patiently to see what her extremely young career can blossom into. Kyle Chandler also turns in a very solid role as Courtney's absent, mourning father.<br/><br/>As far as the actual monster goes, there are some holes that can be punched in it's story-line, but as a whole it does its job to thrill, and even scare us and put us on the edge of our seats. There is more I'd like to say, but that is flirty with spoiler territory, so I won't get into it. There is also the ending of the movie, which I thought left questions unanswered, and maybe wanting a little bit more, but won't take too much shine from the whole thing.<br/><br/>One specific scene I was very excited for was the train crashing scene. Abrams and Spielberg both said in an interview that they loved the idea of doing their own trail derailing scene in a movie someday, and it really shows in the early part of this movie. The crash scene itself is spectacular, awe-inspiring. The other effects are great as well, with a typical Abrams monster, that you get to see a lot more of than Cloverfield.<br/><br/>As a side note, I was really hoping that the soundtrack would match the potential of the visuals of the movie, but I think it was a little disappointing. Probably the only forgettable thing about the entire movie, which is a great thing to say.<br/><br/>Be sure to stay for the credits!<br/><br/>My Rating<br/><br/><ul><li>Super 8 is almost a tribute to movies of its own in-story time, with a near perfect cast and characters, and delicious looking special effects. While the meshing of two ideas, characters and a monster, struggles at points, and the ending is slightly disappointing, the overall product is wonderfully nostalgic, while successfully being its own work of art.</li></ul><br/><br/>Find all of my reviews at robpg.wordpress.com"
"Eternality","8","3","8","10 June 2011"," While I will fall short of praising Abrams for his work here, I still think it is a decent tribute to the wide-eyed wonderment of 1970s sci-fi cinema.
","One of the most anticipated films of the summer, at least from a sci-fi geek's perspective, Super 8 is a mixture of all things good and bad about Hollywood filmmaking. With a strong team working behind the camera including Steven Spielberg as producer, Super 8 is technically stunning for a US$50 million blockbuster. However, it is the essential matter of plot and character that ruins the film in ways that we do not come to expect from a J.J. Abrams' film. As evident in Mission: Impossible III (2006) and Star Trek (2009), Abrams can direct an action picture. Unfortunately, he does not seem to write as well as he directs.<br/><br/>In Super 8, the basic premise goes like this: Some school kids including lead protagonist Joe (Joel Courtney) use their Super 8 camera to shoot a zombie short for a local film festival. When shooting outdoors one night in a deserted train stop, a train zooms past before colliding head-on with a vehicle, leaving the kids to scurry for their lives amidst explosions and flying metal in the film's first and most satisfying action set-piece. The mystery of the train wreck slowly reveals itself to be something more sinister, and it is up to the boys and a girl, Alice (Elle Fanning), to find the answers.<br/><br/>A tribute of sorts to Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), while referencing his other works such as E.T. The Extra Terrestrial (1982), War of the Worlds (2005), and even Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Super 8 is like seeing, and I quote Roger Ebert, ""a lost early Spielberg classic"". Well, at least for the first hour that is. The setup of the plot is excellent with specific attention going to the production design, which evokes a fairly strong mood associated with 1970s suburbia. The cinematography and editing are praiseworthy too. Like I said earlier, this film is technically flawless.<br/><br/>But the problem with Abrams' film lies past the halfway mark. Plot becomes unrealistic as situations unfold not with logic but with convenience. A plot device involving a vibrating cube is not explained thoroughly. Worse, Joe and Alice's fathers are not developed well enough such that the respective father-child relationships appear to be less emotionally potent than expected. While sometimes Spielberg is accused of overindulging in sentimentality, at least his films are realistically depicted and his characters strongly motivated. For Abrams, the characters in Super 8 may be far from paper-thin, but there are flaws in the way they react to change.<br/><br/>The visual effects are amazing to look at though. Unfortunately, the climax is short-lived instead of the lengthy spectacular extravaganza it should have aspired to. Speaking of which, Super 8 could have done with an additional 15-20 minutes because the final act seems awkwardly paced, as if there is a mad rush to complete the film. Super 8 may have its flaws, but it is still generally quite an entertaining picture. While I will fall short of praising Abrams for his work here, I still think it is a decent tribute to the wide-eyed wonderment of 1970s sci-fi cinema. But if you look into my eyes, I am clearly only half hypnotized.<br/><br/>GRADE: B (7.5/10 or 3.5 stars)<br/><br/>www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com<br/><br/>All rights reserved."
"Nth","6","4","13","13 June 2011"," There's no there there
","I really wanted to like this movie, but had the same problems with it that a lot of folks are having. It has no soul. It's like having to change from vinyl LP's to CD, some strangely sterile difference that ""technically"" is unprovable. It tries to fill-in with forced dialogue that was almost condescending. Not cool. Maybe the real problem is that the sci-fi genre has been done to death. Or better yet, the money-making genre is all that matters. Not anything new there, but nonetheless discouraging every time I run up against it. I joke with my pacifist friends about what literature or entertainment would look like if, suddenly, the world changed to their way. I used to say it would be a bunch of books that nobody would want to read. Now, after seeing Super 8, I may have to back-pedal and pray for something honest."
"ultramatt2000-1","10","3","9","11 June 2011"," This is one awesome movie.
","I love this movie! Since I enjoyed CLOVERFIELD, I know I will enjoy this movie. These kids are shooting a Super-8 movie and they get interrupted by a horrible event that results in chaos and terror. The film pays homage to Steven Spielberg's film like CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF A THIRD KIND, E.T., THE GOONIES (not a film directed by him, but he got involved in it), JURASSIC PARK, and the 2005 remake of WAR OF THE WORLDS. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll wonder why (and get some scares along the way). Now let me spend the rest of the review on why I liked it (specifically). I have been reading articles about special effects pioneers. When they were young, great movies with special effects inspired them an they were passionate to make their own special effects films and find out how they were done. They were reading movie-related books and magazines like ""Famous Monsters of Filmland"", ""Cinemagic"", and ""Super-8 Film-Maker"". When one of the characters were working on the film, I was amazed by the equipment the used. They ranged from rinky-dink to clunky. Going back, when the pioneers read that stuff, they began to experiment and master the techniques and try to perfect it. They end up making up their own films based on, or inspired by the films they saw. Why did I point that up? Well, I would like to point out the following recommendations for those who enjoyed this movie. These TV shows: MOVIE MAGIC (1993-1998) MEGA MOVIE MAGIC (1998-2000) CINEMA SECRETS (1999-2002) These DVDs: EQUINOX (1967/70) MONSTER-KID HOME MOVIES (2005) Trust me you would love it. If the movie is released on DVD, well then, watch it and some extras like the commentary."

","I really enjoy this movie. It has elements of ET, with government coverups, a creature from space, kids, and single parents, but with deeper emotional conflict. The setting (late 1970s) provides a great soundtrack, and it's a time before cellphones and one-hour photos. The subplot involves a struggle with survivor's guilt and grief, with a satisfying resolution. I recommend this movie. It's a gem."
"joeybecker11","7","2","5","27 June 2013"," Dear God...Embarrassing
","It's hard for me to say this movie is anything but terrible. It has to be one of the most absurd and pointless plots I have ever seen for a movie. The first part you bare through just to see if it will connect with the climax but it doesn't! You have a group of friends making a movie together when a train is completely destroyed by a truck (Which I found a bit ridiculous that a small truck could completely destroy a train of that size). Then an alien gets involved that has been hidden from public eyes and minds and comes into the story out of no where. It just seems to break off into an even more ridiculous story as the movie goes on. I don't understand how it got from a kid and his friends making a movie, to a kid falling in love, to them witnessing a train explosion, to an alien taking over the city and kid-napping the boys first love. Don't get me wrong I understand the movie, I just don't understand how Abrams or Spielberg believed this movie could actually be good. I'm still going through an extreme case of shock wondering how this movie managed to get a 7.1 from viewers...and a 72/100 from critics? I'm utterly CONFUSED. 112 minutes i wish i could have back. That's 112 minutes i could have been punching myself repetitively in the face. And still have enjoyed it more then this film."

","A group of stereotypical teenagers accidentally discovers something really bad. Although directed by Abrams, it has all the earmarks of a Spielberg film, as it is focused on kids in peril and borrows bits and pieces from the likes of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""The Goonies,"" and ""E.T."" Abrams shows that he can match Spielberg when it comes to mind-numbingly stupid movies. The film starts off as merely bad but ends up being utterly ridiculous. Apparently the alien here is not of the friendly variety from ""Close Encounters"" and ""E.T.,"" as this one sucks electricity out of the town, kills people, causes dogs to go bonkers, and causes stuff to explode."

","This movie really sucked, After the first agonizing 8 minutes, what kept me going through this movie was the vague hope, that some of the kids died horribly. Especially the fat kid, was so annoying, that it was hard to focus on the main ""plot"". Sadly this is not the case, and the whole thing ends predictably happily, in an explosion of family love and harmony.<br/><br/>Apart from the bad acting, the storyline is incredibly shallow and predictable, and the whole film is littered with plot holes and inconsistency. Maybe it is OK for kids, but everybody over the age of 14 should stay clear of this title."

","Super 8. If like me you loved the movies of the 80s, this will be one for you. If not, you will still love it. It's like a cross between The Goonies and Cloverfield. One of the best Sci-fi films released in while. If you are not into sci-fi, I still think you will enjoy it. Set in the summer of '79, in and around the small fictional town of Lillian, Ohio. The films focus is on a group of kids are making a school film. During which something happens that changes everything for them and their town for ever. <br/><br/>Now, I have looked at what some on here have said and I can not believe the overall rating is just 7.6! If you want constant sci-fi action, stick to Star Wars. The is a brilliantly written and made film and has no need to rush through it.<br/><br/>Fun, dramatic, special effects...This film has one of, if not THE best Special Effect moments in many years. The Train Crash. I was actually sat there, open mouthed going ""wow"" while watching it. <br/><br/>Most of the acting in this film is done by young teenagers such Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths, their first ever big screen roles and were great as they all were. The most known, to me, adult actor was Kyle Chandler who plays Deputy Sheriff Jackson Lamb. He is probably best know for his staring role in the series 'Early Edition'. His acting, as always, was spot on.<br/><br/>To end, if I have to suggest a film to watch made in 2011, it will be this one."

And giggle with gladness.<br/><br/>Have I mentioned that it's awesome? I don't think I'm too old to remember how my childhood summers felt. I would have been nine in 1979 and we lived about a hundred yards from a disused train line, and this film sent me right back there.<br/><br/>Some people. Horrible, ignorant people will say that the movie is riddled with clichés and the penultimate dénouement is lack lustre, but I say pooh to them. The sheer love and reverence that went into making the film seeps out of the celluloid (whether its Super 8 or high tech digital film) and embraces us with a carefree abandon that makes us want to be children again. Or is that just me? Anyway, if you've read to the end of this review. Go and see the movie. It. Is. AWESOME."
"aaronthomastuttle","10","2","5","10 July 2011"," A new classic!
","It is so refreshing to see Spielberg back to his old ways. Yes he was the executive producer, but this is clearly heavy handed with his influence. The story is taken from our young hero's point of view when he ventures into the world of the supernatural. Much like ET, our hero is young, is the product of a single family home and whose compassion and inner strength are pushed to the limit when forced to tackle something beyond his world. Yet it is his compassion and inner strength, thought to be weak by the other characters, that saves him and much of the community. Fans of Spielberg will recognize the elephant/lion roar mixture of the creature, which can be found in other Spielberg films such as Jurassic Park, and as far back as The Duel. And of course, this is collaboration with J.J. Abrams, who we can only imagine was heavily influenced by Spielberg's earlier works such as Close Encounters and ET when writing this script. This is a new classic that will be remembered as this generation's ET. Flawless in every shot! Bravo Abrams and Spielberg!"
"ackstasis","8","2","5","7 July 2011"," ""Production Value!""
","'Super 8' was my first film from 2011, and it was a fantastic place to start the year. The film's teaser trailer enigmatically promised something along the lines of 'Cloverfield (2008)' (which I still haven't seen), but the second trailer was pure Spielbergian nostalgia – not surprising, given the ""Amblin Entertainment"" logo that opens the film. But what really distinguishes 'Super 8' is its love of filmmaking. The story is set in 1979, when director J.J. Abrams was just a kid, and probably running around with his own Super 8 camera. The film's characters are a group of children who spend their free time making a hokey amateur zombie detective thriller, though their equipment still looks more professional than that in my latest filmmaking project. A massive train derailment, a huge military presence in the town, and an ominous entity on the loose, cannot dampen their enthusiasm for completing the film. To each new turn-of-events, the boy directing the film (played by first-timer Riley Griffiths) keeps getting excited and exclaiming ""production value!"", which was funny until I remembered I did the same thing when the annual Festival blocked off my town's main street in 2009. All of the child actors (including Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning) are impressive, given that they're carrying the entire film on their little shoulders. And, of course, be sure to stick around for the final credits."
"jjnoahjames","10","2","5","4 July 2011"," Goonies mixed with Jurrassic park! An almost perfect film!
","Super 8 growls like a classic. The name Super 8 is derived from a kind of film used in old films. It's about a group of young kids filming an amateur movie. Joe, Alice, and hilarious character, Charles stumble upon some secret government information which opens up the film. Elle Fanning, and Kyle Chandler do an amazing job performing their awe stricken roles! Along with that there's a lot of cool tricks going on, like how there's a movie in a movie, and a lot of comedy which makes fun of movies themselves(clever;).<br/><br/>Super 8 does almost everything well, from the ""production value"" (you'll understand after you watch it), to the 1980's cinematography, to the acting, and to the directing. Which even though the film states is all Abrahms, you can really feel a pull sometimes back in forth between scenes that Abrams company may have done, or scenes that Spielberg may have done. <br/><br/>The films becomes a little slow in the middle, but it's nowhere as slow as with most movies that do this, the rest is just so good that it's noticeable.<br/><br/>Overall this film is completely re-watchable, and I think almost anybody could enjoy it. That's why I gave it a ten. Go see it!!"
"DEATHSukka4","4","2","5","24 June 2011"," Goonies Meets ET, how could you go wrong? Leave it to JJ Abrams...
","While I think JJ Abramas' homage to Spielberg's films resulted in enough interest for me to go buy a ticket, I definitely can't say it's all that comparable in terms of storytelling, movie production, cinematography, and directing.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, kids from the 70's and 80's seem to be much better actors than today. The kids in Super 8 don't really capture the candid, unscripted qualities in Spielberg's previous films. Everything the children do in Super 8 looks forced, scripted, and just very unnatural - especially in dialogue.<br/><br/>One scene that stands out in particular is the train wreck, which is also figuratively a train wreck. Firstly, they all nearly die as a train, which was transporting explosives, derails right next to them because someone drives a pick up truck into it. No, the train doesn't just push it out of the way like it would do in normal, every day life - it dramatically derails. Miraculously all five kids and the car they stole are unharmed (though, I distinctly remember a scene of the car seemingly being destroyed). This in itself is quickly overshadowed as everyone regroups and laughs about fake blood splattered on some of the wreckage. Despite living through the train wreck, they also live through the human killing monster that escapes in the epicenter of it all. If this wasn't enough survival for you read this: the man who drove the pick up into the train (which, let me remind you, was transporting explosives) that caused it to derail also SURVIVES! Nobody dies in this scene - nobody! Turns out, it's a history teacher from their school. Apparently he's all caught up in some military conspiracy and drove his truck into the train to try and free the alien. So after a stern talking-to from the suicidal teacher, military men appear out of thin air and approach the scene with flashlights. As if they didn't defy all the odds enough - they scramble to the car (which should've been DESTROYED) and escape from the United States Airforce. I must say, for transporting something so dangerous, A MURDEROUS ALIEN, the Airforce seems to be packing rather light and be rather un-organized.<br/><br/>Anyway... this is an actual scene from the movie. All of it is accurately worded here. But despite seeing a military train derail from a suicidal teacher allowing a space alien to escape and themselves having survived the whole situation - barely anything from the experience is discussed on the car ride home from the accident. Even more creepy, the accident is barely discussed in any detail between any of the kids throughout the entire movie. I guess teenage romance is more important, although they are of that age where Mommy and Daddy give ""the talk"" - well except Joe (hero and awkward dork) doesn't have a mommy and his daddy is too busy trying to make this movie into an Indiana Jones ripoff.<br/><br/>This movie is just rittled with massive plot holes, terrible character development, and is just overall really inconsistent. While Spielberg films had their fair share of ridiculousness - Super 8 does a hell of a job homaging that aspect and I do find great humor in it. Even the title itself is misleading because the film that captured the alien is shown one time and is never seen or mentioned again. The military isn't after the film, rebellious ogranizations aren't after it, the film itself is not a key point in the movie at all. It bares no significance to the story or to anything... it's more like it was the catalyst to start this project and maybe the movie was originally based on it but then that was sidelined for a lazier, boring movie."

","Some times I really suspect IMDb's ratings! after seeing the 7.9 rating me and my friend decided to see the movie! Call me totally crazy but I am not very honest fan of Mr. Steven Spielberg but we went to see the movie. I kept waiting for supernatural action in the movie but the movie never reached to the saturation point! where I could have action such as ""I am number 4"" type! I dono what I was expecting! <br/><br/>Story line: Story about a small town where four/five teenage friends witnesses a train accident when a truck tries to stop the train by driving towards it on the tracks. later they found out that it was their biology professor who tries to stop the train where further later the town found out that it was military train............then strange things starts to happen in the town... people; pets; and things disappearing etc! ....... Rest about this movie is so predictable that I am sure I snored more than once! <br/><br/>Super 8's plot is a ditto copy of 1988 movie ""The Blob"". (1)High school boys/girls, (in super 8 its younger boys/girls) (2)Small Town (3) Military Conspiracy (4)One person (doctor/professor etc) trying to stand against military's agenda (5)An Alien Creature on demolition mission (6)A guy/man roaming around in the town in car/jeep for no good reason (6) At the End the whole town witnessing ""the big moment"" <br/><br/>Super 8 has all the above! PLUS Steven Spielburg's Touch as Bonus when - the lead boy tries to communicate with alien (In English) and the alien reacts favorably -The Ending... typical Steven Spielburg<br/><br/>Summing up my view about the movie - very Predictable and over and over told story - unexplained events; - only chosen metal objects flying... like a bike next to military car flew but car stood there where even heavier object flew. - Military shown so dumb that they never searched for Professor's bunk and left it there for kids to have an insight - Nice Special Affects; but toward the end they just seems TOOO Much! - I found un necessary suspense for nothing.......<br/><br/>Bottom line If you are under 15 and currently living during 1980's - PLEASE go and watch the movie :)"

","Saw this last night with high hopes. Movie gives what the trailer promises. Starts with a band of kids with the likes of a new Goonies but with a bit of broken home life reminiscent of Stand By Me. Story a bit wayward at times, spending a bit to much time slowly force feeding the viewer with indefinite character development and at times completely away from the surrounding story. <br/><br/>The ever present occupation by the USAF was also weakly written and at some times even silly. not funny silly, rather ""Really?"" silly. I believe they could have shortened the character development and put more effort into writing about the effects of occupying the town took place. However big PLUS was the portrayal of the focal creature. I actually enjoyed the fact that you really didn't see it till towards the end. Still don't get that with all it's collecting of town resources, how it got the engines out of cars, then closed the hoods without a mark. Finishing with a rather ET moment. <br/><br/>Directing was very good, The kids were great! I thought the crush relationship could have been written better. Something about the diner scene bugged me though.. cant really put my finger on it, but it just seemed to be put in weird, maybe at the wrong time of the film.. <br/><br/>This could have been a 90 minute film that 'cut to the chase' a bit more. Supporting roles, Joe's father could have been written better. Alice's father was written well, you wont get that till nearly the end. The USAF roll as a whole really disappointed though, not the acting but the weak presence. AJ and the Stoner were a mild comic relief. All in All.. a good movie that could have been better. but was still worth the admission."

People have been saying that the story wasn't very good, but i definitely think it was great. The special effects were very good as always but i was glad that was not what stole the show. The relationship between Alice and Joe is definitely at the forefront of the movie and I think was a good decision.

"peterlane5","9","2","5","17 June 2011"," Best film of the summer by far.
","""I've seen it... nobody believes me..."" ""I believe you."" If E.T., Cloverfield, and The Goonies had a baby, this would be it. Plot: In 1979, A group of young friends filming a zombie movie for the local film festival witness a horrific train crash near their small town. Afterwards strange things begin happening. People go missing, dogs run away only to be found in the next county, and electronic appliances are stolen. Things get more strange when the military shows up. The friends along with one of the friend's father, a sheriff's deputy begin to realize that that was no ordinary train crash. Director J.J Abrams once again shows that he is one of the best directors in Hollywood. Keep in mind that this the guy who actually got me to like Star Trek. This isn't just a monster movie but a coming-of-age movie as well. It has elements of a drama as well as elements of a classic sci-fi/ monster movie. The main character, Joe Lamb, lost his mother in an industrial accident four months before the events of the film and still hasn't let go. His father, a sheriff's deputy hasn't really let go either. Unlike most movie nowadays, I actually cared about the characters. Each is well developed. Heck, even the monster has more character depth than most of the characters in some of the movies released this year. As for the acting, I thought it was pretty good except for Ron Eldard, who while not bad, just isn't as good as the rest of the actors. I have got to say I was impressed with Elle Fanning. I loved her performance in Sofia Coppola's Somewhere and she does just as good if not better in this. I really do think she has the potential to outshine her older sister. While there are many references to Steven Spielberg's(who produced this movie) earlier films such as E.T. and Jaws, Super 8 is a movie that stands on it's own. I'll be very surprised if this doesn't get nominated for any Oscars. This is without a doubt the best film of the summer and I'll be first in line to by it on Blu-Ray the day it comes out. Until then I'd gladly pay another 10 bucks to go see it again which I have no doubt that I will. Total Score: 9.2/10"

I go to movies to be entertained and this failed miserably. Sure, there were a couple of good scenes, Elle Fanning rehearsing at the train station comes to mind, but the movie dragged and couldn't hold our attention. And the ending was pathetic. Walked out of the theatre feeling totally ripped off."

","This movie was just incredible, let me say that. It really made the summer kick off. It starts off with a great story and that, then is halted by an insanely awesome train crash. After that, the story continues, but keeps getting hooked up with odd things happening in the hometown of the characters. In the end, the creature starts to fully reveal itself. I will not spoil anything about the creature. Anayway, the story is awesome, the creature is awesome, the ending is awesome, and the acting is surprisingly awesome as well. There are some scary scenes, i could easily handle it but if you are thinking of taking a six year old or under to this film, you might want to consider rethinking it. I still believe that transformers 3: Dark of the Moon is going to be the best movie of the summer, but this is still definitely worth seeing. I would not be surprised if this wins an Oscar.

","This is a rather unremarkable movie in every way. The pacing was poor and the effects far below average but what really hurts this film is the fact that everything feels forced. You can actually feel the creators of the film try to inject humor or sentimentality where there's no room or where such things aren't earned or warranted. Even the drama feels forced and the danger not very palpable. Trying to tie the loss of a mother or the guilt of an alcoholic to a creature feature may seem like it adds emotional depth but when it's done wrong, it just comes across as shallow. Toss in an evil military presence and dumb as dirt town folk and I'm not sure even the creators of the film knew what they wanted this movie to be about. I was somewhat interested as to the outcome as a viewer so, I guess the movie did it's job but, again, does so in a completely unremarkable way."

What a waste of $$$"
"japamo","8","2","5","14 June 2011"," A Collision Between ""The Goonies"" and ""The War of the Worlds"", with ""E.T."" as an afterthought
","Under producer Spielberg's assumed tutelage and inspiration, director J.J. Abrams has constructed a more-than-serviceable homage to the master in ""Super 8"". Okay, here's the umpteenth reiteration of the plot - a group of charismatic junior high adolescents shooting a zombie film for a contest stumble upon a train wreck, a government space conspiracy and deception, and a monstrous alien that escapes the wreck. Therefore, as I said in the title, you have an amalgamation of ""The Goonies"", ""War of the Worlds"", and ""E.T."", but not in equal proportions.<br/><br/>Abrams handles the ""Goonies"" component skillfully and appealingly. The preteens are spirited, energetic, clever, occasionally profane, but always endearing and sympathetic. I especially appreciated their accurate, amusing speeches, especially the exchanges between the sweet, Elliott-like Joe home movie special effects artist) and his bossy, portly friend Charles (the home movie director). The budding relationship between Joe and the older, more mature, but demure Alice was also convincing and engrossing, especially since both have the loss of a mother in common. All the kids' reactions to and investigations of the train wreck/alien mystery were finely tuned and interesting. Abrams does not neglect kid/adult interactions either. Joe and Alice each have to deal with distant, emotionally reserved fathers and somehow manage to connect with them.<br/><br/>The ""War of the Worlds"" component was handled nearly as well, although some logic lapses do occur. The train derailment is suitably spectacular, but as another poster pointed out, it's highly unlikely that a pick-up truck, even ramming into the train head-on at full-speed, could cause such damage. It's like trying to trip a giant with a toothpick. The train would have stayed on course, but the pick-up and its passenger would have been throughly mangled. Therefore, the pick-up's driver, Mr. Woodburn, would not have survived to give the kids the dire but cryptic warning about the train and its contents. Nonetheless, the infiltration, evacuation, and surreptitious behavior of the nefarious, devious U.S. into the Ohio town where the train collision occurred are workmanlike, efficient, and well-handled. Many of the military adults, and some of the townspeople, may be corrupt and selfish, but they are not boobs. And Joe's dad, the deputy sheriff, is neither corrupt nor foolish, as he tries to penetrate the military's cone of silence regarding the crash.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the ""E.T."" aspect of the film, despite being its focal point, is the least developed. Abrams keeps the elusive alien beast largely concealed for most of the movie as it smashes its way out of the box car, randomly attacks the townspeople, and burrows underneath a cemetery for refuge. This suspense-building works. However, it leaves the audience (and the kids in the movie) little time to bond with or even communicate with the alien. (MAJOR SPOILER WARNING ABOUT THE BEAST'S ORIGIN AND APPEARANCE). The alien and his crashed spaceship (now broken down into magnetic cubed components) was being transported from a Roswell-type military base. The roughly 12-foot high (I guess) alien looks like a hybrid of Alien, the ""Cloverfield"" monster, the Transformer Optimus Prime (especially about the face), and the Ymir from ""20 Million Miles to Earth"". And, oh yes, a spider. It's described as frightened and distrustful because of the mistreatment it received from the U.S. Army, and actually benevolent. But throughout the movie, he acts malevolently, smashing cars and buses, apparently killing at least two people, and hanging people (including the kidnapped Alice) upside down in his subterranean cave apparently for food! Joe's short, calm confrontation with the alien in his cave seems to change its mood. At the movie's end, he assembles a new spaceship out of magnetized metal (including the locket containing a picture of Joe's mother and him as a baby), and takes off. See, very inconsistent and abrupt. Was the alien inherently sinister, or benign? Why didn't the alien construct a new spaceship immediately, as soon as he escaped? Why bother terrorizing the townspeople? ""E.T."" gets shortchanged here.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I do recommend the film as a funny, suspenseful, kinetic good time. If you are a Spielberg fan, you'll probably enjoy it even more, and be more inclined to overlook its flaws."

You know the military gets involved to cover up their tracks. You know that it takes place in some quiet midwestern town in the 70s. Seriously this movie was hyped for no reason.

"aharmas","10","3","10","11 June 2011"," An Instant Summer Classic
","When I first saw the preview and read the teaming of Spielberg and Abrams, I crossed my fingers and hoped it would be much better than the sensational preview. That preview gave us a taste of what was coming, without telling us the entire story or trying to show us the latest dazzling special effects or the new tied-in merchandise. The movie is just what we expected: an exciting, warm, and most satisfying summer adventure/thriller.<br/><br/>Most of the film is quite entertaining and amazing for the most part, from the great job done by all the child actors, particularly fanning, who has a difficult role and acts mature beyond her years but manages to retain a hint of innocence. She is part of a group of pre-teens who are engaged in making a super 8 movie, full of cheap and shocking special effects in order to fulfill their dreams and avoid the less than perfect real world situations they have to deal with everyday.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, and it has the children, literally becoming part of a scenario involving a rather suspicious train wreck. As the story moves forward, strange events occur around the small town, and soon the children must confront the ever threatening military forces. At this point, it is where the film becomes more interesting because instead of just concentrating on the noise, visuals, and the overwhelming special effects of other summer releases, this one looks inside the relationships between the main characters, and we get to understand their history and might be able to predict the final outcome.<br/><br/>Soon, we have friends dealing with love problems, father/son misunderstandings, and some difficult alliances are formed where the audience doesn't have to feel like an uninvited guest to the party where only the actors seem to be enjoying a exchange of ""clever"" lines that are only thrilling to them, or the producers and directors hope the lull in the action can be ""improved"" by a desperate insert of loud and confusing noisy and poorly choreographed or edited special effects.<br/><br/>The train wreck is as thrilling, if not even more sensational than the one in ""The Fugitive"", and when things explode, we are treated to some old fashioned cinematic tricks. This time we want to dodge the flying debris, while we hope the actors don't get hurt or mauled. The danger looks and feels genuine, not just a pastiche of very expensive CGI.<br/><br/>So, with the combination of good acting, expert directing, and a solid piece good, old fashioned solid screen writing, we have a film that recalls the best of the 70's and 80's classics, a tribute and a refreshing new entry on its own. Both Spielberg and Abrams have added their own personal touches: a sense of never ending wonder, with masterful handling of a mystery that relies more on us participating on its slow revelation than on just a half-cooked attempt at giving us a poorly developed idea.<br/><br/>Five stars all the way!!!"
"aronnyc","7","3","10","9 June 2011"," A Solid B movie
","I've wanted to see this movie since the first teaser came out. I really wanted to like this movie. I wanted to be blown away by it. But I'd have to say, I didn't feel it lived up to my expectations.<br/><br/>People use the word ""nostalgia"" a lot when talking about this movie. I suppose that means a couple of things: 1) The movie is set in the late 1970s, in small town America, when friendships were made through real face-to-face interactions. 2) It's a thriller told through the eyes of kids, which has been done most successfully by Spielberg, who had a hand in the story. (M. Night Shyamalan would be the next guy in mind, but it's not great to be compared to him right now.) If that is all you need for a movie to work, you're all set. Super 8 has all of that. It has a fantastic cast of child actors and a story that works. It wasn't trying to blow you away with explosions (although there's plenty of that). In fact, it's the polar opposite of a Michael Bay action film. It's an action film that focuses on story, not action.<br/><br/>I feel that the excitement Abrams had in making this movie reflected the excitement the kids in the movie had in making their own movie. I think many kids (including myself when I was that age) who managed to get their hands on a camera liked making movies and telling stories. But if you're familiar with Abrams style of storytelling, you know that he likes to start of with a big mysterious happening and tease the audience along. That works only for so long because eventually, you need to reveal what is really happening. The movie as a whole becomes a tease that grows gradually over the movie. You see a flash, a shadow, a glimpse, you see things that suggest size and power and you picture something awesome.<br/><br/>In many ways, Super 8 follows the dangerous path that M. Night Shyamalan followed in movies like ""The Village"" and ""Signs."" In this case, I'm not talking about a twist ending. I'm talking about the build-up to the mystery core of the movie. If you're going to spend most of your marketing and most of the movie teasing your audience about a mystery ""thing,"" you'd better make sure that ""thing"" works. One thing about Spielberg's movies like Jaws and Jurassic Park is that there's no mystery about what you'll see. You know what a shark looks like and you know what dinosaurs look like. With a movie like Super 8, a lot of the expectation rests on what exactly this ""thing"" is and whether that ""thing"" turns out to meet or exceed your expectations. For me, it didn't meet my expectations. It was just okay. I felt like I've seen it before. You probably have as well."

","Written and directed by J.J. Abrams, SUPER 8, is an alien invasion flick that takes place in 1979 Ohio. A group of middle-schoolers led by producer, writer, director want-to-be Charles(Riley Griffiths)plan on spending the summer making a zombie movie. His best buddy Joe(Joel Courtney)is troubled by the recent death of his mother; but is an important cog to the production. The oh-so too cute Alice(Elle Fanning)is talked into playing the female lead, well only female role; and it is obvious she is the one breaking all the guy's hearts. In the process of filming at a small train station right after midnight, the kids witness a horrific train accident involving their science teacher. During all the confusion a lot of the chaos is unknowingly filmed. Mysterious disappearances begin happening and when the Air Force arrives to investigate, Joe's deputy sheriff dad(Kyle Chandler) wants the truth on why the town is being evacuated.<br/><br/>Surprisingly efficient acting from a cast of mostly unknown young actors. Abrams' presentation is spirited, humorous and enjoyable to watch; and makes it very easy to like the characters. Part of the cast: Ryan Lee, Zach Mills, Gabriel Basso, Britt Flatmo, Jessica Tuck, Ron Eldad and Joel McKinnon Miller. The story gives a feeling of throwing your emotions and memories back to the good old days. The brightest spot for me is Ms. Fanning. There is also the bold stamp of Steven Spielberg all over SUPER 8; and that isn't a bad thing."
"benjaminrodriguez360","6","3","11","10 June 2011"," ughhhhhh Its OK I guess
","I have to admit this was better than I expected. I love the whole concept of teens making a movie throughout this whole film. The story was decent but it just felt like a remake of E.T. except the alien isn't friendly. At first it didn't bother me not to see the creature but as the time went on, you get a bit anxious and then I was disappointed. It was just another family film where the dad doesn't get along with the kid or understand each other but I couldn't help but see a bit resemblance to Jurassic Park. Oh but the ending, man, was that just sad. I mean, wow, talk about a remake of E.T. BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, it's better than Star trek. I also enjoyed the credits, that was original."
"rangex","7","3","11","8 June 2011"," True to the requirements of its plot above all else
","Super 8 is a film that I wanted to like, whose characters I wished I cared about, but whose thorough preposterousness (the fault of persistent lapses in logic stemming from graceless, hurried set-up) crippled any possibility for real, enthusiastic engagement. It requires incredible suspension of disbelief in terms of both its basic plot/story structure, and – more damagingly – its young characters' relationships.<br/><br/>Emotionally, the film hinges on Joel's attachment to his mother, who recently passed away. Without this grief, there effectively is no story, no emotional conflict. And yet, the emotional and familiar trauma is established so quickly and so bluntly, the death is wholly instrumentalized – bypassing any kind of emotional affection it might have elicited, and emerging simply, and transparently, as a plot requirement. So much of the first hour of the film feels this way: from Alice's introduction, Joel's reaction to finding out that she's joining the cast, to they way the characters are introduced (via a few shorthand traits), and their faux-slice-of-life style of interacting with one another. Abrams has a way of both writing and directing 'on the nose' – telling and showing us (via dialog, visual cues, etc) exactly what we need to know when we need to know it, without art or subtlety. Instead of slowly discovering these characters, their relationships with one another, with their families, others, and the town itself, the exposition is dealt with rapid-fire, most often through shots and dialog that render the characters' feelings and ideas unmistakable. In this way, the machinations of the set-up are all-too-visible; rarely does a moment pass in the first half of the film in which some element is not made transparently and immediately visible as simply a plot or character 'requirement' that demanded setting up.<br/><br/>Alice, emerging as if from a social void, quickly becomes friends with Joel, Charles, and the gang after the night of the train crash; from here, Joel and Alice's relationship begins to take shape. Abrams deserves some credit. There are moments in the film of beauty and authenticity, however, Super 8's tendency toward rote sentimentalizing coupled with its dependence on unlikely timing and chance, often deadens their effect. Take a scene in Joel's bedroom: a few shining lines of emotionally authentic dialog between Alice and Joel is undermined by the fundamental unlikeliness of everything about the scene.<br/><br/>The film insists on getting to its proverbial feet too quickly. However, once it does begin to act on the plot and character situation it has so deliberately set-up, the machinations to some degree recede into the body of the film, and things run more smoothly – even if the film never relinquishes its fundamental reliance on the preposterous by way of the literal. The monster set-pieces are consistently entertaining – even when the relationships are at their most blunt – and the stakes amp up as things move along. The timing remains always just right, and everyone is always in the right place at the right time.<br/><br/>Visually, the film operates at, really, only two levels, vacillating between incredibly shallow DOF close and medium close shots of characters and objects, and CGI wide shots (of the town, the train, a bus in the woods, etc). Visually, the film is at its most interesting in those rare moments when it takes a step back, brings everything into focus, and shows us the characters in relation to the town around them. But, due to the paucity of such shots, there's never any real sense of space (or place), which greatly inhibits the ability of the film to sustain atmosphere (for, in an adventure scenario, the ambiance of spaces is critical). However, for the characters to plausibly move from location to location as they do, seemingly able to get from any one point in the town to any other in a matter of minutes, the shallow focus c.u. is an all important tool.<br/><br/>The kids' reactions to the explosions, mayhem, and general disorder that so often surrounds them tends to be closer to that of spectators, awed but abstracted (like the cinema audience itself), than of real human beings in imminent peril. As they run from tanks and explosions, we hear exclamations of ""Whoa! That was crazy! Did you see that?"" Even within the diegesis the kids seem positioned more as spectators than actors in the environment, emerging always unscathed with no more than the most superficial marks (with small scrapes, covered in a film of dirt).<br/><br/>This point, however, returns us to one of the film's central fissures. What is required by the plot takes precedence over what is plausible in the world the film has set up. In all, the film too often feels rote, flat. It hits the proper notes, but artlessly – without having effectively or convincingly established this world, these characters, and the situation they're in enough for the spectacle to amount to much. The confrontation with the monster/alien is ultimately trite and mostly unsatisfying: following in the footsteps of its cinematic forebears, the film humanizes the life-form, yet without expending much energy toward allowing us to understand its plight, preferring to take care of all that more efficiently, via some perfunctory audio-tape exposition from Dr. Woodward.<br/><br/>The film has its pleasures, and at least a handful of shining, beautiful little moments. We care enough about the characters, despite the too-often-thin material with which they're provided, to engage with the action/horror/danger set pieces; in general, the pure cinematic thrills of the monster-centered sequences are enough to carry us through the film (via the mostly expert sound design and effective staging). Ultimately, however, as an evocation of childhood adventure, friendship and first love, it doesn't hold up – committed only (and misguidedly) to getting the surface details/plot highlights right, putting to screen its abbreviated, summary version, but failing to either atmospherically or narratively convey the depth (emotionally or spatially) and textural richness a successful characterization would require."

","I didn't liked the movie, I felt like being watching ET part 2 with a B class script, lots of gunfire, monsters, but no essence, no message, just a silly ""forbidden relationship"". Is there any particular reason for advertising marijuana to children's? From director Abrams I wasn't expecting too much, since he's a pot head ( documented) but from Mr. Spielberg it was a surprise, how could he produce a movie that seems to be sponsored by some Mexican cartel to incite children's to consume marijuana ? I went with my nephew to the movie and he kept asking, what's being high? why is he sleeping in the car ? Putting an actor smoking marijuana in a children's movie wasn't funny at all, it was just sick idea. Mr. Spielberg, If one day a member of your family suffer from any drug related problem maybe then you'll realize that what you've produced contributed to that addiction.<br/><br/>PS- I've tried to post the same review in Portuguese but the system detected ""too many error""..."
"big_ryan15","10","2","6","21 June 2011"," Abrams does Spielberg. With the help of Spielberg
","OK. So im gonna let you all know right now. This is easily in my top 10 movies of all time. A group that includes The Shawshank redemption and The Dark Knight, Pretty good company huh? JJ. Abrams, whom until Start Trek in 09' had slipped under my radar, has created a movie with the look and feel of all the 80's Spielberg classics, without losing his own voice as the director. People that complain about the slow decline in movie magic this past decade with trash like TRON:LEGACY,BLACK SWAN & THE SAW SERIES will rejoice in the news that this is as awe inspiring, scary, heart warming and adrenaline fuelled as all your favourites, some it even out does. The sheer class of the production is incredible, the way the director has made you feel every bit as involved in the aspiring love interest betweem the two young main characters and the importance of unravelling the mystery surrounding the strange occurrences in the small town in Ohio, is a triumph in every respect of the word. The characters, of which there are a lot, all have their own back stories and character arcs, are made as human in this film as any in the past. The cast in this movie is incredible, especially Elle Fanning, good luck keeping your eyes off her in every single frame she is in! Super 8 is the reason the clichéd ""you'll laugh, you'll cry"" slogan was created to help decribe the emotions you will feel on this ""hell of a ride"". Easily one of the best films in decades, ill be rewatching this one a few times. Be sure to stay for the credits. 10/10 ""The reason i love cinema""!"
"esoteric-raven","9","2","6","20 June 2011"," Fantastic Story that goes deeper than a Monster Movie
","Absolutely wonderful. This movie goes back to the weeks just before I was born. The TMI scare (the power plant just miles away from where I grew up in PA) is even mentioned on the news in one early scene.<br/><br/>While I may not have been alive at the time of the events depicted in the movie, this took me back to that era. I have three older brothers and a sister that would have been the ages of the kids. Watching this made me miss the early 80's and the hope and purity life had in store. Back when movies like The Goonies, Labyrinth, Return of the Jedi, and E.T. were ""the"" movies to see.<br/><br/>So thanks to JJ Abrams and all the rest of the folks involved for making a movie like this. The lack of angsty teenagers, gadget obsessed kids, and the expression ""social media,"" made this movie a great escape.<br/><br/>Now about the movie itself. The acting in this movie by the child leads was phenomenal. Joel Courtney knocked his performance out of the park. He was the heart and soul of this movie. The story line between him and his father (Kyle Chandler) was fantastic. Their scenes ranged from powerful, to subtle. All moving.<br/><br/>Elle Fanning has the potential to be an incredible actress. In fact, she already is. See ""The Nines,"" or ""Phoebe in Wonderland,"" if you want more proof beside ""Super 8."" The other kids were all just as good. They reminded me of kids I knew growing up. It was as if Abrams found a group of friends like mine, in a town like mine, and just happened to catch them in the moment of this huge event.<br/><br/>All aspects of this movie are top notch stuff. The editing, fx, sound, score, acting, directing and everything else is excellent.<br/><br/>Super 8 is the movie that has taken me on the best overall experience so far this summer. As much as I'm looking forward to Transformers 3, the final Harry Potter, and a few others, I think this one has taken my memory and imagination to a special place."
"laura_456789","10","2","6","16 June 2011"," Super 8 was Super Great!
","Super 8 is a movie that will remind you of a better place and time. Even if the premise of this film is that some form of a ""monster"" is attacking innocent civilians the film manages to take you to a place of youth and innocence and leaves you with a feeling of nostalgia. An opening scene of the ever so wonderful last day of school before summer brings back that feeling of being a kid. What I loved most about this movie was that for the next two hours I felt this way. To be reminded of a simpler time is something that a movie rarely does for me.Although there was this ominous creature for the majority of the film I managed to keep a smile on my face. The cast had a great significance in those smiles. Every actor brought something unique to the table, particularly Joe's filmmaker friend Charles.The young and innocent love between Alice and Joe was another treasure. J.J Abrams is absolutely wonderful here as both the director and the writer. He takes you to that place in your heart where you go when life gets too tough. Your childhood. This movie is brilliant. Abrams presents us with children who aren't Beiber and video game obsessed. He gives us smart, thoughtful and selfless children which is refreshing and rare. Hands down one of my favorite movies of all time. Like I have been reading the best way to put it is ""E.T, meets The Goonies, meets The Sandlot!"" Well done Abrams,Spieldberg,and cast. You warmed my heart"
"samratrc1417","9","2","6","16 June 2011"," Super 8 is superb!!!
","I just watched it this afternoon!It surpassed my expectations which was heightened by the trailer. The trailer made me curious as to whether this was a sci-fi movie or a monster flick. There might be a lot of holes in the storyline but cinematic-ally the script was awesome as it kept me riveted to my seat. J J Abrams is turning into one of the greats of the cinematic medium. The concept/premise of the movie is nothing new but its the treatment that makes it such a delight. <br/><br/>We have a bunch of youngsters who are student filmmakers. While shooting a scene from their ""zombie flick"" they witness a train crash(that much you might have garnered from the trailer). The rest i leave it for you to watch as i might give away the storyline...<br/><br/>The strength of the movie is the young cast who puts in a superb performance..I loved them especially because most of them are completely unknown and fresh. That made them totally believable. We all know the Fannings can act. This movie has something in it for both teenagers as well as adults. The teen romance, loss of loved one, horrifying disappearances, military cover up...the list goes on. Its a good film to study if you are a budding script writer. Its teaches you how to write a movie that satisfies everyone.<br/><br/>Anyway...Its one hell of a popcorn flick.. I assure you..your wont repent watching it..Go watch it."
"lozareth-1","7","2","6","14 June 2011"," A movie to be watched
","I really enjoyed the storyline of this movie. It is a bit different to other movies but followed the basic storyline of a typical 'monster take over world' movie. The idea of having children as the main characters and trying to discover the secret the U.S Air Force was hiding was brilliant and somewhat unique. It also reminded me of the storyline of Cloverfield. JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg has made an excellent team in the creation of this storyline. <br/><br/>The acting of the main characters was not the best. I specifically didn't like how Elle Fanning portrayed Alice. Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths on the other hand both did an excellent job with their acting and a portrayal of two of the main characters. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the two new actors throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The main thing I didn't like with the movie was the filming. The filming itself was terrible and the special thing with all the lights really put me off (not sure what you call it). This type of lighting and filming was a real let down especially when the blue lighting was covering the screen and blocking out the picture. However, the special effects has really supported this movie and they have done an excellent job.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 7 out of 10 because of it's original storyline and the brilliant acting of two of the main characters. It is definitely a movie to be watched and enjoyed."
"poicop","8","2","6","13 June 2011"," Well Made film that reminds us of CLASSIC Spielberg time period / Our childhood.
","Good movie. Maybe great to the younger generation who do not know of the classic Spielberg I grew up with. <br/><br/>Maybe. <br/><br/>Maybe J.J. Abrams is REALLY GOOD at paying homage to other ideas/directors/writers. I would be more impressed with his own idea.<br/><br/>Maybe he just knows/wants to make money, and instead of pissing people off he get's Spielberg to produce a movie which is a WELL MADE - little bits of -E.T.-JAWS-CLOSE ENCOUNTERS-(with a little touch of M. Knight Shamalan) Also his last movie was Star Trek. Again done very well. Makes me wonder. Well Done.<br/><br/>Even with the NEAT TIED UP ENDING it was enjoyable to watch. <br/><br/>Brings back memories of my life in the cinema when I was a child.

"galaxychick","8","2","6","12 June 2011"," An instant classic!
","Super 8 had a nostalgic feel of ET, or ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND to it! And as such I totally enjoyed it! And instant classic, IMHO!<br/><br/>Some critics deplore the choice of placing the story in the late 70s. As if Sci-Fi plots can only be contemporary to be truly enjoyable. Had this plot been written for the 2010s era, the age of smart phones and instant news feed, the mystery shrouding the train wreck would have been much harder to write in a believable way. Logically videos/photos of the whole thing would have immediately been tweeted, face-booked, or you-tubed by the kids or someone else in the city, and it would have been a totally different dynamics. And there would go the suspense element too! Surprises/suspense can be hard to pull out in an instant news gratification society.<br/><br/>Sometimes back to the basic works best!"
"brockparks","9","2","6","12 June 2011"," Great, fun movie, a worthy addition to the legacy of the films it emulates
","I really enjoyed the film, and am a bit surprised at the mixed reviews. Although clearly inspired and paying homage to movies like the Goonies, ET, and Close Encounters, the themes and production are woven together in a fun, engaging way. All of the actors are enjoyable in their parts, and I loved the very 'Stand By Me' vibe of the kids on a journey. The whole 'kids coming of age, giant mystery, the government is after them' plot, though common enough from other films, is fun and a bit surprising in the twists and turns it takes, particularly when compared to modern films that plot by the numbers. The pacing, the acting, the special effects, and the atmosphere of the film were all top notch. I highly recommend the film to anyone who liked the eighties movies I mentioned."
"shatteredrifle","8","2","6","12 June 2011"," What is Super 8?
","Trailers, television spots and advertising materials like billboards usually give the viewers a pretty good idea of what a film is going to be about. Usually. In Super 8's case, they just make you wonder more how it will play out. There are just a few things you are sure of: 1) A group of kids are shooting a movie, 2) A train goes unbelievably bonkers and obliterates everything on its path while they're shooting, 3) A life form inside the train gets out and 4) All hell breaks loose. Not even the reason for the title Super 8 is given away. This is a gamble that may or may not pay off. Clearly, the appeal of the unknown can work for or against its success. Which C do you care about more, curiosity or clarity? Thankfully, watching the film makes us discover that the plot is not that complicated after all, which is not necessarily a good or a bad thing.<br/><br/>To limit the spoilers in this review, I will plainly say that Super 8 tells a story of teenage awakening with a monster movie backdrop. Aside from the explosions and pandemonium, it features a lot of emotion and humor – just like how everyday life is. The film shows us that even if something bizarre happens, life goes on. The only difference is that normal people do extraordinary things when faced with something that they don't understand. At the end of it all, it's not the specialists that triumph but it's people like you and me. What makes Super 8 stand out from your regular monster movie is that although it is about a very serious and dangerous situation, kids are at the helm. Given all of these things, the film becomes more accessible to a wider audience. Although it may alienate hardcore sci-fi fans, Super 8 ends up as a way cooler version of your average family movie.<br/><br/>Super 8's plot accomplishes much. However, based on the hype that was built around it, watching it leaves you with a sense that it could have been so much more than it was. Moreover, there was not enough explanation about why erratic behaviors were everywhere (technology going haywire, dogs losing their minds).<br/><br/>In terms of performances, the cast of Super 8 proves that you don't need all-star actors to tell a good story. The most recognizable actor here was Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights), who is, after all, not new to the monster movie scene after playing the self-absorbed actor in King Kong (2005). Interestingly enough, Super 8 has a lot of common with King Kong, things I will let you find out for yourselves. Joel Courtney as a protagonist was very convincing as a small town boy trying to cope with his mother's death, and at the same time figuring out his relationship with his deputy sheriff father (Chandler) and with his friend Alice (Elle Fanning). Careers of both Courtney and Fanning will surely skyrocket because of this production.<br/><br/>Over the years, J.J. Abrams has created and revamped a lot of material. One can't help but remember Cloverfield when watching Super 8. Of course, the monster-video camera tandem was present in both films. Fortunately, the comparison stops there. Super 8 has a lot more story to it, and has many characters you just can't help but sympathize with. Additionally, there is no immediate need to barf after watching the film since unlike Cloverfield, it isn't filmed with a shaky camera the entire time. Going back to Abrams, there is no doubting his genius. He created Alias, which received a huge following and propelled Jennifer Garner to stardom, and revived the Star Trek franchise with his 2009 theatrical version. However, not everything can be a hit, as evidenced by his recently-canceled show called Undercovers, and by the reception that he got from major Star Trek fans calling him the ""Star Trek Killer."" Whatever you think of him, the man certainly knows how to entertain, and we can expect a lot more things from this guy.<br/><br/>Finally, at the end of the credits, we discover what Super 8 is. However, after watching the film, knowing the title does not matter that much anymore since we realize that the journey of how we got there is enough to leave the cinema feeling good about ourselves, and feeling good in general. I recommend this film for people who have taste."
"msanjelpie","8","2","6","11 June 2011"," In a simpler time...
","I went to school in 1979 - as the kids were running from the school, I felt like I was right back there. There were only a couple of phrases that I felt were from a later year, but the time period felt very authentic. With a small exception... most of the cars were American gas hog cars... there were very few Toyotas, VW bugs etc... I remember seeing a lot of those back then too.<br/><br/>I have 3 sons, all love sci-fi, math, nerdy stuff... so watching 5 young nerdy boys made me feel right at home. The relationship between Joel Courtney (Watch out Bieber!) and Riley Griffiths was very authentic. I wish I could see them 15 years from now, still best friends and talking about 'that train wreck'...<br/><br/>I am quite amazed that this film was made as cheaply as it was. It plays like a much more expensive film. I guess the lack of big name stars really helped with the budget. It was very smart on their part... I saw the characters as who they were playing rather than who I knew them to be.<br/><br/>Kyle Chandler baby! Where have you been all of my life! Wish they had given you a love interest in the movie too... (although I guess that would have messed with the whole missing the just departed wife plot line)... OK, I forgive them... but when they release the directors edition, perhaps we can see some past scenes between you and your wife, a la Casper? ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" didn't make you a star... Grey's Anatomy cut your part short... hopefully Super 8 will launch you finally...<br/><br/>Elle Fanning reminded me more of a young Lindsay Lohan with blonde hair than her sister Dakota Fanning whom was highly annoying 6 years ago in War of the Worlds. Elle was not annoying in the slightest. It was nice to see an actual 13 year old playing one on screen.<br/><br/>I knew when I laughed during the first scene (the funeral) that I was going to enjoy the movie. The theater was crowded and it was great to hear everyone laughing from beginning to end. I wish half of the audience hadn't left before the kid's super 8 movie was shown... It was adorable.<br/><br/>Anything that has the name J.J. Abrams on it makes me want to see it. As a very devoted fan of Lost (which I only got hooked on because I enjoyed Alias) any scene in the movie that reminded me of Lost (mostly the monster in the tree scenes and the black and white films) made me miss it again. Of course the tree scenes were also reminiscent of Jurassic Park so I knew exactly when to look away from the screen (usually when it got real quiet...)<br/><br/>The ""love"" story between the two teenagers didn't quite play right. It was obvious he had a crush on her, not so much the other way around. I'm glad they didn't try to stick a kiss in there, it would have been awkward. I could see them as very close friends throughout school.<br/><br/>The scene where he is trying to hold on to the locket lasted way too long and the music was too sappy... We got it... don't pound us over the head with it.<br/><br/>So this alien has been on earth for over 20 years and has yet to build his ship to return home... but all of a sudden at the end of the movie, voilà, the ship is built and off he goes... Ummm, what took him so long? Why hadn't he left before? That needed some explaining... I wasn't so sure why after such an amazing movie they had to rush the ending... it wasn't like a commercial was coming up or anything...<br/><br/>I think this is the best movie of 2011 so far, the second being Source Code, (if I had to pick one.) There was never a moment during the movie that I didn't want to be sitting there. The last time I felt that way was watching The Social Network last fall.<br/><br/>I will be seeing it again in a week, I want to share the experience with my family who haven't seen in yet. I have read it compared to umpteen other movies all of which are seen in snippets throughout, but this movie will definitely stand on its own."

I laughed out loud often enough to be down right embarrassed among strangers. I also gasped more than once loud enough that I had to question whether I had actually screamed. So so entertaining.

","This movie was a breath of fresh air. I saw all the comparisons to E.T. before viewing this film and being 25, E.T. was one of my favorite movies as a kid, but I was honestly desperately hoping they could do an alien film with kids without trying to pull needless tears out of me. I just didn't want that type of emotional ride. <br/><br/>That being said, let me say this movie is NOTHING like E.T. We all know E.T. is about children who *befriend* an alien and he parts at the end and we're all just devastated. That is not the case here at all. The only remote similarity to E.T. this movie holds is the ""style"" in which it is shot, but if we are judging by ""style,"" we can also say at some points this movie is comparable to The Goonies. The hairstyles, clothing, cars, etc have a very 80s feel to them, but the year is very ambiguous. It could be taking place in present day, it could be in 1982, it could be anytime. <br/><br/>If you are a sci-fi fan, you will absolutely love this movie. If you are nostalgic for ""the way movies used to be made,"" you will LOVE this movie. As soon as the credits begin to roll, I was already ready to watch the movie again because I just couldn't get enough. Although, they could have carried the story a little further, it really wasn't necessary. So, if you choose not to read any further, just know this movie is definitely the best film that has came out this year and totally worth all the hype. Thank you for reading. <br/><br/>***STOP HERE, MAY SPOIL*** <br/><br/>My only difficulty during the movie was Elle Fanning's character and the one boy's creepy crush on her that goes undiscussed for quite a while. Her character is sort of clueless and really seems to have no place other than to be the one girl and to take part in the film the kids are making. I found myself, at times, kind of wishing she was not there. Her dad is depicted as a a-hole and we are not supposed to like him, but I found myself agreeing with him *just* because the boy had not really stated his purpose and was kinda ""hanging around"" just waiting on her to profess her undying love for him. However! I must say there's eventually a conversation and it was not really addressed how I thought it would be, but they were able to relate to one another in a way we were not aware of until the scene takes place. This redeems their relationship a little and makes it much easier to understand and to watch. Whew! <br/><br/>***DEFINITE SPOILERS*** Towards the end, I was pleasantly surprised to find the boy was willing to confront the alien face-to-face when I was *just* thinking, ""Man, he should totally take on the alien himself instead of all of them running like idiots"" and as soon as I thought it should happen, it did. The lesson was completely gratifying. The boy confronts his fear and verbalizes to the malevolent alien that ""Bad things happen, but that doesn't mean you can't LIVE,"" which we know wasn't *just* about the alien situation currently taking place. We learn about ""letting go"" and acceptance. I was shocked they even thought to do this. It could have easily taken the direction of a war movie with the kids having some kind of insight into the situation, but this, oh, it was so much better.

","The theme of ""aliens"" have been tainted much in modern cinema such as in the abysmal Skyline and the mediocre Battle:LA. Even Steven Spielberg had spoilt his latest Indiana Jones installment with aliens. This theme has reached its overdose and keeps on firing at all of the wrong directions.<br/><br/>Thankfully, director J.J. Abrams saved the theme gloriously with this film. With an interesting plot, a fresh band of young (very potential) actors and great special effects, J.J. Abrams have unleashed one of the greatest aliens films easily in this decade.<br/><br/>The story is told very similar to 1980s Steven Spielberg alien films (ET & Close Encounters Of The Third Kind) where suspense play a large role to keep the viewers hooked.<br/><br/>Therefore, I strongly recommend to give this movie a go and exit the cinema with a brand new feeling that has been missing in the films lately. Also, like Inception, the lesser you know before you watch the movie...the better."

No development whatsoever. That arc with the protagonist's mom having died in an accident was abused to hell for cheap sympathy. They just throw it at you ""HIS MOM DIED! FEEL SORRY FOR HIM!

","12 June 2011. The biggest problem with this movie is that ET may have grown up too much and the target audience of this movie is well...confusing. There are kids in this movie and in some ways ET forms a basis for it and there are the Goonies (1985) resemblances as well as the Stand By Me (1986) suggestions, yet there are also more juvenile and adult themes going on as well, including suggestive horror mutilations more commonly found in older teen films. There is a great special effects sequence reminiscent of The Fugitive (1993) and the close up shot making especially in the beginning sequences that confirm that a picture is worth a thousand words as the, brief non-verbal headshots used by J.J. Abrams, the director really captures the quality physical acting of the son, girl, and father in this movie. The storyline is so simple, yet the construction and development of the plot is presented in such a way as to geometrically expand the simplicity of the story in an amazing and compelling way. The relational conflicts in this movie are solid, disturbing, and yet well suited in the final product. The best comparison to Super 8 is that it is a bigger budget, more mainstream version of the hard to find Wavelength (1983) which is itself an overlooked sci fi classic. Super 8 is one of the best movies of the year and takes a lot from Jaws (1975) in its direction and style of presenting drama and thrills to the audience."

"zkonedog","8","1","2","15 July 2018"," A Little Bit Of Everything
","Despite being a fan of J.J. Abrams and what he does with his Bad Robot productions, I'll be the first to say it: At its core, ""Super 8"" is J.J.'s homage to his childhood cloaked in the storytelling techniques of Steve Spielberg. However, because JJ imparts so much of his own flare and personal charisma into the film, it ends up mostly transcending its ""copycat"" label and producing a result that is quite enjoyable on a number of fronts.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Super 8"" focuses on Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), a young teen growing up in the 1970s who loves making movies with his Super-8 camera and building miniature models. When viewers are introduced to Joe, he has just lost his mother in a factory accident, and father Jackson (Kyle Chandler) struggles to be a single father while also serving as town police deputy. While filming a movie scene with his buddies, and notably crush Alice (Elle Fanning), Joe witnesses a train derailment in which some sort of creature is released and the military intervenes. With the film in Joe's camera being the only evidence of the incident, ""Super 8"" unspools into a race against the clock both for the military (to destroy the evidence) and Joe's crew (to figure out just what exactly is going on).<br/><br/>I think the hallmark of ""Super 8"" is that it's a film that has a little bit of everything. It features tremendous action/adventure sequences, emotional family/character drama, and a mystery plot that keeps things moving forward. There is not one wasted scene in the entire film. Though it clocks in at about 2 hours, it doesn't feel ""that long"" because the action is always moving forward (a trait of Abrams films).<br/><br/>The use of the child actors in the movie are also spectacular. They carry long (and most) stretches of the film with absolutely no qualms or drop in performances that adults may have given. In a way, JJ was kind of ahead of the curve here on the ""kids riding bikes around the neighborhood"" type film that ""It"" & ""Stranger Things"" would later bring firmly back into fashion.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the only reason I can't give ""Super 8"" an even higher ranking is a big part of the reason why it gets the 8 stars to begin with: The film is so slick and filled with relentless energy that I felt, at times, it doesn't take quite enough time to stop and savor the character moments (the highlight of the film by quite a bit). This is especially apparent in the ending, which should be even more touching than what ends up transpiring. This isn't a huge fault, but I think stems from the film coming from a Spielberg/nostalgia place instead of one of complete originality.<br/><br/>Overall, though, ""Super 8"" is a fun and compelling film that can be enjoyed by a wide swath of audiences. No one will ever be bored watching the film, and it dips into enough genres to find some nerve in every viewer. Not quite at the top of my ""favorites of all-time"" list, but certainly in the tier right below it."

","Science Fiction is a genre that its hard to pull off. I'd put it on the same difficulty scale as Comedies. Every person has their own expectations and preferences when it comes to these genres. Some people will be impressed by the material while others will scoff at it. Super 8 received mixed reviews and I think that could be attributed to different people having different expectations.<br/><br/>For me this Sci-Fi renewed my faith in the genre. Amidst the many remakes, sequels, and superhero movies there haven't been much show of original stories in recent years. Super 8 took a few ingredients from other successful Sci-Fi films and blended them together to make a up to date recipe. Now some people might not like this, but I think J.J. Abrams (Lost, Star Trek) did an excellent job bringing back Sci-Fi. It may be an old wine but it's in a new bottle. <br/><br/>Super 8 follows the story of Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and his friends as they try to make a short film. While the group shoot at nearby train station they experience an event that they know they need to keep secret. After the incident mysterious happenings occur in their town and the kids realize that what they experienced might have more consequences than the single incident. <br/><br/>The film impresses on a lot of levels. The writing and the directing is something you come to expect from J.J. Abrams. And the cinematography is excellent. But what stands out are the performances. Joel Courtney does a solid job of leading the film at such a young age. And opposite him Elle Fanning (Deja Vu, Babel) makes her presence known as Alice Dainard. A nice surprise is Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights) playing Joe Lamb's father. <br/><br/>All in all this film did a decent job of doing a well celebrated genre justice. Your preferences may be different to what this film offers, but it is definitely one to watch to see if it does meet your expectations."

Unfortunately, travesties such as Super 8 are reviewed positively by professionals for reasons that are beyond my comprehension.<br/><br/>Professional movie critics, I suppose, are meant to analyze several aspects of each presentation to find a ""fair"" or ""rational"" overall conclusion concerning the quality of a film. Apparently, the majority of these ""qualified"" persons conveniently overlooked the poor writing and cinematography, the inhuman acting, and the overall laxity in effort and emotion in production. This somewhat high-budget film resembled a ridiculous Michael Bay explosion-ridden flop at some parts with the rest looking like Tommy Wiseau's magical amount of nothingness splattered across the screen for the viewer to be in awe of folly.<br/><br/>I am being very ambiguous about the events in this horrific movie because it provokes excruciating pain in me to even recall such incidents.

There is this feeling of mystery and adventure, like the Goonies had. There were some minor problems. Many of the adult characters I did not care for. The design of the alien was not that great.

"aturban718","4","1","2","23 November 2012"," Super 8
","The primary issue with Super 8 as a horror film is that it has essentially two plot lines, which draws attention away from the creature. This means that the film itself is very good as a story about the children, but the story about the creature doesn't work. A horror film's main purpose is to frighten the audience, and this is clearly not the case with Super 8. Abrams leaves many answers around the monster unanswered, and the audience only learns enough information to understand what the creature wants. We never learn how the creature was found, or even why it was being moved. There are no plot twists, even in the better half of the film, and the sequences that create fear and suspense are few and far between. As an entertaining film, Super 8 is very well done, but as a horror film it fails completely. It simply does not scare the audience with any lasting effect."

","(SPOILERS) Boring but sometimes unintentionally funny splicing together of pieces of better films (such as It Came From Outer Space, I Married a Monster From Outer Space, Alien, ET). The ""creature"" acts irrationally, eating both good guys and bad guys, but not little kids. The director gives mixed signals as to whether we are to feel sorry for the creature or not. US military people in the movie are depicted as murderers. The CGI is sometimes so over the top as to be unbelievable. There are multiple scenes of the raining of debris all over the place with miraculously no one being injured. For a much better example of the use of CGI in a recent SF film, see District 9."

","Apparently, this movie had all the formulaic trappings of a Spielberg blockbuster. Unfortunately, it did not hit the mark. The storyline left a lot to be desired with a number of improbabilities, not the least being the alien, who after many years of tormented imprisonment by the U.S. government/Air Force, is suddenly able to re-assemble his ship and blast off -- as in ET goes home. How does an empathetic exchange with our young hero facilitate this miraculous re-construction of the space ship? The plot is left hanging at the end of the movie because we have an implied happy ending but an alien that is fleeing home with a pretty bad impression of Earthlings. God forbid that he comes back with an invading fleet with vengeance in mind.<br/><br/>Fortunately for Spielberg, he is only credited with the production and not the direction. Whereas this movie's concept had potential, Spielberg and Abrams simply excreted a real stinkeroo."
"parallel_projection","9","1","2","19 June 2012"," Original? Not really. Captivating? Yes!
","I went into Super 8 knowing that the reviews were pretty good, but that most people didn't like the ending. I didn't see much wrong with it,but I'll go into that later. Overall, I was highly entertained by this movie--the atmosphere it sets is one of growing up in the late 1970s, and I found myself being nostalgic for an era where I wasn't even born yet.<br/><br/>The plot, if you've seen the classic sci-fi films of the 1970s and 80s,isn't that original. However, I haven't seen those movies, or at least not many of them, so I thought the plot was good enough, although there were a few clichés, but that's almost expected in movies today.<br/><br/>This movie, though, really isn't about the plot, it's about the characters, and on that note, it deserves a perfect score. The characters pull you into this movie--they are so believable in the way that they act around each other and in the situations they are faced with throughout the movie. The actors did a wonderful job, too. Joel Courtney was great, as was Riley Griffiths, especially considering it was both of their first times acting in a movie. They were both able to get into their character's persona well, and it really came through. The best performance, however, hands-down belongs to Elle Fanning, who conveyed so much emotion as the girl needing an escape from her alcoholic father. Often times with only a few lines, or even just a single glance, she was able to bring so much to the screen, that she definitely stole all the scenes she was in.<br/><br/>Now, about the ending. I personally didn't think it was a let down, but you have to fully understand the fact that this movie was never about the alien/monster to begin with--that was just something for them to react to, something around which they could attach all their emotions and feelings. So, in essence, the ending is obsolete: it is about the characters and what they do along the way to get to the ending. In some movies, the ending is a huge surprise and it is supposed to leave you thinking, and I believe this is what many people were expecting, seeing as this was written by J.J. Abrams, but this is just not one of those movies.<br/><br/>Still, it was highly entertaining, especially the dialogue between the children, not to mention the incredible sound and special effects, as well as the enthralling and, at times, tender score by Michael Giacchino. Overall, I'd say it was one of the best movies of 2011."

Totally suspenseful and hilarious in spots (I really did like the kids!) It really just keeps rolling along.

","There was a lot of anticipation for this film following the success of J.J. Abrams previous monster movie Cloverfield (2008). I really enjoyed Cloverfield and was looking forward to this and fortunately it didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The film is set in 1979 and starts out by introducing a group of kids making a zombie movie. Late at night they go to a train station to film some scenes in time with when a train passes. A few seconds later there is one of the best train crashes ever put to film. A creature escapes and the children realise that there is a cover up going on.<br/><br/>Using a cast of young unknown actors works really well for this film. It gives the film a feel similar to Goonies (1985) and Stand By Me (1986). The young actors are great in this, come to think about it everyone is great in this. It is hard to find a stand out performance. I was torn between Elle Fanning as Alice Dainhard and Joel Courtney as Joen Lamb. I decided to go with Joel Courtney as it is his first acting role and acts like a veteran.<br/><br/>The effects in this are as you would expect, incredible. It is a CGI heavy film but you hardly notice as the effects blend seamlessly with real life.<br/><br/>This has a brilliant cast, amazing effects and a good story. But for some reason I felt something was missing. I feel the story was what let it down. As I said it is a good story but not a great one. It gets a little predictable and cliché. When the film ended I wanted more, not for the film to keep going but more story. There are so many small stories in this that it seems cramped. This is a Sci-Fi/Thriller but there was a lot of drama added into the film and for me it felt too much. I would have loved to see a film with the young actors just focusing on them. They have a great story without the monster and I found myself more interested in their lives and then the monster would arrive on screen and change the pace of the film. During these parts there was nothing that you haven't seen before in monster movies.<br/><br/>This is a good film and it is very enjoyable to watch. Keep watching the end credits as you get to see the kids zombie movie."

","I sat to watch Super 8 with the expectation of seeing the science-fiction / fantasy film of the year. The director is after all J.J.

No other than Steven Spielberg is the producer and rumors have that he had quite an active part in this production. And yet I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Super 8 has a very spielbergian look, colors and cinematography-like. It is set in 1979, at the same period when Spielberg's great science-fiction films were made. Kids are in the center of the action, and Spielberg likes and knows to make movies and maybe understands better kids than women for example. The first 15-20 minutes when we get to know the heroes are pure fun, as a gang of kids get together to make a film, kind of an homage to the films noirs of the 40s - all is fine as in a good Spielberg film. But, hey, wait a moment, this is a J.J. Abrams film, isn't it? And actually trouble starts exactly when the aliens and the rest of the grown-ups world interfere. I mean trouble for the heroes, but also or merely for the film.<br/><br/>Here is the problem of this film as I see it. There are too many Spielberg ideas here, and too little of J.J. Abrams. It looks like the master threw a basket of ideas, many ideas, good ideas, and the apprentice did not really succeed in putting them together in a convincing one story line. There are too many quotes in this film, from Humphrey Bogart passing through the special effects a la 50s and reaching to E.T. Many pieces of magic, a few scenes to remember, but here I am a few weeks after I saw the film and I cannot remember well the story line, which means that it did not really matter. Many people will like the film, and I also liked the passion for cinema and for alien encounters, but the overall impression is of a collection of beautiful scenes wrapped in a conventional and unconvincing story.

Unfortunately, it was instead made to be a big budget Hollywood blockbuster. As the scope of the film widens, there's soon too much happening to leave room for the small moments and interpersonal relationships that made the early parts of the film so watchable, and yet, clearly aiming for its PG-13 rating, the action never produces a real sense of peril, which prevents the build-up of suspense that would have been necessary for the latter half of the movie to really work. In the end, there's an attempt to thematically tie together these two halves and make it feel like one cohesive plot, and enjoyment of this movie largely hinges on that final, pivotal scene: if it works for you, you'll likely leave the theater happy. For me, the connection it strains to make is just too big of a stretch, so I left unsatisfied."

This film is nothing more than an expensive link in the chain of Spielbergian schlock, and I am way, way weary of his endlessly repetitive tricks. Yes, I know he didn't direct, but it doesn't matter; he's been an industry forever, and his plant spews out the same, button- pushing garbage all the time. We have young kids being ""real"". We have parental angst. We have last-minute, soulful bonding. We have a misunderstood alien. We have comic relief stoner dude, and we have arch villain from the military. Etc., etc. If this isn't insulting enough, there's the really, really absurd situation of a man surviving driving into a massive freight train going full speed, AND a supposedly intelligent deputy hinting to Evil Military Dude that he's onto their secrets, and he wants answers, damn it.

","There is a great trend of Kids on a mission movies. Just look at Stand By Me, the Goonies and ET and now JJ Abrams has tried to revamp the idea for modern audiences. I say try, because sadly there is absolutely nothing new in this whatsoever. Mysterious attack on a gas station by an unknown force? Check. Quiet lead character lost a love one? Check. Same quiet lead character is in love with a seemingly unavailable girl? Check. Group of misfits? Check? Antagonistic military? Check. Seemingly evil monster, that turns out is actually nice but misunderstood? BIG FAT CHECK. I could go on and on. Filmed in the usual Abrams style (thats either good or very bad) the story in set in the very late seventies and revolves around a group of kids making a zombie movie using the Super 8 camera of the title, but they get more than they bargained for when a train crashes (and my word, what a train crash. Imagine the Fugitive ramped up to eleven) when they are out filming a scene. Its not all bad thou. Yes there are no real surprises, but overall it is well made and well acted, but as a previous reviewer has stated, if you've seen Close Encounters, ET, Cloverfield or The Goonies you know exactly what to expect.

","First of all, I DID enjoy this movie. It was interesting, and thrilling, but it was rather unfulfilling. The first half of the movie was a great piece of movie-making that I will always relish, but the last half was somewhat underwhelming, and frankly, stupid. Poor choice of word? Maybe... but I use the word ""stupid"" because it's not a very strong adjective, and the ending to Super 8 did not produce any strong emotions for me. To put it bluntly, the conclusion was rather boring. The entire set-up kept making you wish with all your might that the secret, supernatural, mysterious something wasn't an alien. There was nothing I would've loved more than for it NOT to be an alien! Sadly... it was an alien. This came as no surprise. In fact, when I first saw the preview for the movie I was certain it was an alien. And I was right.<br/><br/>The thing I did like about the movie, was that it kept you guessing. At points, I thought I might be wrong. That maybe, it was something other than an alien. Something more. The writing was excellent, because it forced you to think; to mull things over. The sudden twists and turns had you changing your mind every second! ""It is an alien! No wait, it isn't... Yes.. yes it is! Nope, I guess not.. Yes, it's an alien!"" <br/><br/>It was exciting! The constant guesswork that the in-depth dialogue put me through was almost worth the disappointed ending! Yet, it wasn't. And in the end, your short 10 bucks, and your left with a sense as if you were robbed. As if someone waved candy in front of you, then took it away at the last minute. During the last 15 minutes of the movie, I found myself hunched over and dejected. Sad and disheartened, and wishing that I was watching the Breakfast Club... or literally anything else."

","When I told my mom about Super 8, I mentioned it was probably one of my favorite movies of the past several years. Then, I had her watch it. Her reaction was particularly funny, because she was thinking period drama, and Super 8 may be a period piece (1979) and it may be a drama (if a Science Fiction one), but it was certainly not what she meant... <br/><br/>Super 8 was a huge dose of nostalgia for the great movies I grew up with. Child actors who engage on a journey of excitement and growth - much like Goonies or ET. <br/><br/>In 1979 in a small town, there's a horrifying train crash. The train appears to have had something large and scary aboard! Our heroes are a young filmmaker and his friends who are working on a zombie movie. <br/><br/>Like all sci-fi films, a suspension of one's disbelief is necessary - the train crash scene, while exciting and done really well, was so unrealistic in cause and effect, that one has to view it through a child's eyes.<br/><br/>Super 8 has some action, several scares, impressive special effects, a little bit of pre-teen romance, and some fabulous one-liners. <br/><br/>Written and directed by J J Abrams and Produced by Stephen Spielberg, I was expecting greatness, and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you're wondering, my mom thought the movie was really good, too."
"MovieGuy109","9","1","2","5 December 2011"," An action film with emotion.
","When we look at the limited genre of stylized action films, there are few that really take us into another world. Super 8 is a rare breed of action film that engages us on an emotional level along with a visual one. What I really like about it is how personal this is to director Abrams. Abrams is engaging in parody, which he is no stranger to, but this is his finest film yet with a plot that makes sense during the action scenes. He's got nothing on Spielberg(who produced this), but he does manage to succeed in terms of fluid storytelling, American charm, and enthralling visuals. This is one of the better Spielberg impressions and definitely the best of Abrams."

While some wanted new stuff I expected a mix of everything which made mainstream cinema amazing in the last decades. It is funny and sad, loud and quiet. It is about family and friendship. About growing up and becoming an adult. The late 70s setting is implemented outstandingly. Characters are great. This group of kids just works excellent together and I caught myself rooting for them from the beginning. The whole movie is well paced from start to finish. The ending? Just right.<br/><br/>For me personally - an instant favorite."
"jantoniou","9","1","2","3 December 2011"," Spielbergian bliss as interpreted by J.J. Abrams
","Few films evoke a time and a place well. Fewer still hone that evocation with a style of film-making that gives shape and context to that time and place. <br/><br/>""Super 8"" is such a film. Set in the late '70s in a small Ohio steel town, it focuses almost entirely on a small group of kids who are intent on making a zombie movie in and around the town. <br/><br/>The emotional core is formed from the very first scene by the accidental death of the protagonist's mother at the steel mill. Joe, played by a superb Joel Courtney, was a mama's boy and his father, a town deputy - another superb casting with the great Kyle Chandler - is out of his depth in the parenting department. <br/><br/>Summer vacation starts and Joe follows around and helps his best friend Charles, a budding director, make a zombie movie. They shoot around town then find themselves late at night shooting at a deserted train station. While shooting something unfolds behind them - a massive, unexplained train derailment. In the midst of the derailment, the Super 8 camera falls over and records the crash. It records something unknown escaping from a rail car . . . <br/><br/>. . . thus begins the movie's mystery that unfolds steadily throughout. To say much more is to give away the plot, which never wavers to hold your attention. It's pretty much edge of your seat suspense beginning to end.<br/><br/>The wonderful Elle Fanning as Alice has Joe deeply infatuated. Alice has her own family issues including a drunken father who wants her to stay away from Joe, which of course she doesn't. Her mother, having escaped her father, is not around. <br/><br/>All of the young cast is great and Riley Griffiths as Joe's best buddy Charles really stands out. <br/><br/>""Super 8"" works so potently as a film of place and time and style for the following reasons: One, the dialogue is genuine - this is how kids talk, especially of that era (though the use of ""douche"" an an insult felt like an anachronism more suited to today); two, the group of friends are real and interact in a manner that's not contrived or forced; three, the friends are unique, if somewhat cookie-cutter in their differences - for example, one is the pyromaniac (yep I had one of those friends and I got into trouble a number of times with him!), one is the scaredy cat barfer, one the ""fat kid"" who overcompensates by being bossy, one the total nerd (yep, had one of those friends too), and one the sensitive artist type (that was probably me); and, lastly, it works because it feels exactly like a movie set in that era should feel.<br/><br/>It's unsurprising Stephen Spielberg was involved in the making of ""Super 8"" because it feels almost exactly like one of his movies from the '70-early '80s- the closest probably being ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" but you can probably throw ""Jaws"" and ""E.T."" in there as well. J.J. Abrams is effectively making a Spielberg movie with a little help from his idol but putting his sure hand on the wheel to give it his unique vision. <br/><br/>It's impossible for a child of the '70s such as myself to not love ""Super 8."" To avoid total hagiography on measure it has its formulaic moments but through my lens it appears almost pitch-perfect in characterization, casting, look, feel, and dialogue. The acting is incredibly good and the young actors who are at the core of the movie have to take most of the credit for that, especially Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning. Hearing them talk and watching their interplay it was nothing less than time travel back to my youth. On their faces I saw a lot of the same faces of the kids I grew up with.<br/><br/>People who were born in the '80s, '90s and beyond may not have quite the same appreciation for the era, but ""Super 8"" certainly works brilliantly as a gripping, suspenseful action/quasi-sci-fi movie and it has a level of innocence and charm and a tinge of nostalgia that is usually missing from the pure action popcorn movies of today. <br/><br/>""Super 8"" is not to be missed."

"Meven_Stoffat","1","1","2","21 November 2011"," Super 8, or ""The Epic Abrams/Spielberg Masterpiece of Beautiful Cinematography and Not Much Else"" (also known as Goonies 2: Extra-Terrestrial Boogaloo!)
","I have never been so disappointed in my entire life. I was stoked, Even staying up until 10 PM on opening night just to catch the last showing of it after the Cappies Gala here in my city. And what a waste of $12.75. there's a limit on how many words this review can be, and the things wrong with it are too much to fit into a small, confined space. So I'll try something different. I saw someone use this format on their review of Transformers 3, and felt like this would be the appropriate format, because there's so much wrong with this pile of horseshit I don't even know where to begin.<br/><br/>So let's start at 10/10, shall we? I mean someone here has to provide a bit of balance with all the people who are so easily pleased. <br/><br/>10/10 <br/><br/>You know, I admire Abrams for going for broke and using mostly unknowns, with the inly big actor being Kyle Chandler. But these actors were so bland and boring it's beyond belief. The main kid actor says all his lines as if he was in a hypnotic trance of some sort. How Abrams let these slip past him I don't know. The fat kid replaces good acting with LOUD YELLING AND SWEARING, with the occasional whispered confused jargon. Kyle Chandler was the one good actor in this tripe... and even he wasn't that good, but I didn't expect this boring mishmash to have made him care. And Elle Fanning was cute, but being cute just isn't enough.<br/><br/>9/10 <br/><br/>You know, an homage to Speilerg may sound like a great idea on paper. In fact, I'm a fan of his early films. But doesn't mean it would be good on film, nor does it mean you have to blatantly steal from Spielberg. Watching this film was like a Spielberg greatest hits reel- every shot is from a Spelberg movie. And not in a good way. The two biggest tippers in the movie are Goonies and Close Encounters. Every one of the kids is like one of the Goonies. And the events are essentially Close Encounters. Truth be told, nobody should let homage fraís keep them from making their own movie.<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>The monster's design is terrible. It's essentially like some giant spider-turtle-lion. We rarely get good views of the monster at all, and when we do, it is enough to drag the film down. Seriously, the design made me laugh several times. It's freaking awful. <br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>Logic. Look, I know this is a movie, and I can suspend my disbelief to great lengths, but come the frak on!!! First why would a train just carry plenty of weird magnetic cubes? Where is the government in all of this, and would they know what it's for? Why do the military act completely dumbfounded when they see the cubes? How can someone survive A DIRECT IMPACT OF A TRAIN HITTING THEM?!!!!!! How does the dad just easily escape a military base that was heavily secured? How was the monster rampant and the stoner dude didn't get captured?<br/><br/>6/10 <br/><br/>Wow, the logic failures are so bad they require another point. Actually, I'm about to get into a huge rant here: HOW THE HELL DID THE MONSTER CREATE A PORTAL THROUGH THE FRAKKING GARAGE WITHOUT DESTROYING IT?! And how do people survive being captured in the monster's material?! This is as stupid as Cowboys and aliens!<br/><br/>5/10 <br/><br/>Again, it seems like Abrams can't go without shining obnoxiously bright lights in our face every 5 seconds. It worked for Star Trek and here's why: it gave the movie a documentary feel. The hand-held camera and lens flares made it seem like we were watching a documentary about a group of ambitious scientists on the enterprise, and I loved it. The problem is here: this is a freaking homage movie, and is just annoying. Considering he apologized for the ST lens flares.<br/><br/>4/10 <br/><br/>The score by Giacchino. I love him but he just recycled cues from Star Trek and Mission Impossible 3. And not that the music was particularly bad but I expected so much more from a man who is extremely skilled and musically articulate. Here he just recycles cues from previous scores. <br/><br/>3/10 <br/><br/>Let's not forget the ever so brilliant scene at the end where the protagonist is being held by the monster and sweet talks it into Not destroying the city. Somehow it understands English and follows his instructions. So it causes a bunch of metal objects (including a bike) to fly to the water tower, which turns into a spaceship (face palm city) and takes off. Wow, there's so much wrong with this ending I don't even know what to say. How did people not face palm at this? It was as stupid as the scene in the Dark Knight where the Cell Phone technology was introduced.<br/><br/>2/10 <br/><br/>Wow, this will take two entire points off! Holy crap, what horrible writing. Almost every line is the dialogue saying the plot out loud. Laaaame...<br/><br/>But what do I know. The special effects were great, so I give it 2/10."
"The-Last-Prydonian","6","1","2","8 November 2011"," Could be as much inspired by King as it is Spielberg
","In the small town of Lilian, Ohio 14 year old Joe Lamb(Joel Courtney) has only just tragically lost his mother in what was a freak factory accident. Finding barely any real solace in the presence of his father(who is the towns deputy-sheriff), what little he does find is in the company of his friends who are filming an amateur Zombie flick. Directed by the portly and bossy Charles Kaznyk (Riley Griffiths) , he convinces young Alice Dainard, a pretty young girl who both he and Joe have a crush on to be the film's leading lady. While filming a night- time scene at an old train depot a pick up truck drives on to the train tracks and in front of an oncoming train, derailing it. The kids, then forced to come to terms with what's just happened soon learn that this is only the beginning of their problems as it is for their small town. Something unearthly made up part of the trains cargo and makes it's ominous presence felt when a series of seemingly inconceivable events gradually leads to the town being thrown in to chaos! <br/><br/>The latest project from J.J. Abrams, the clever mind behind one of TV's most cerebral enigma's which was ""Lost"". ""Super 8"" is his own undeniably affectionate Spielbergian homage, fitting as it is seeing as it comes figuratively packaged with the iconic film-maker's name on the box. It's small town backdrop and it's use of events being seen through that of children's perspectives inviting instant comparisons to Steven Spielberg's highly influential ""E.T."" It's never the less an alien movie but one less cutesy and certainly without a creature needing to ""phone home!"" Indeed Abrams is borrowing much of the schmaltzy sentiment, a notable hallmark of a man who he undeniably considers his mentor and chief counsel. But while he delivers on the requisite tugging of heart-strings the movie has a distinct feeling of de-ja-vu. Had it not been for the fact that Abrams had previously produced a certain cult monster movie named ""Cloverfield"". A picture which also utilised the basic tool of a film camera to forward the slight plot there wouldn't be an overawing sense of ""been there, seen that about"" the film. <br/><br/>In fact it doesn't stop there. The sentimental reflection on small town Americana could be accused of being just as influentially Stephen Kingesque. There are visibly shades of ""It"", ""The Body""(which was brought to the big screen as ""Stand By Me"") and ""Dreamcatcher. Where as in ""The Body"" the youthful Gordie Lachance was having to come to terms with the death of his older brother and is the victim of disapproving rebuke from his father, Joe Lamb has to cope with the death of his mother and try to somehow reconcile with his grieving, over-bearing father. Abrams piles on the apparent nods to familiar cinematic and literary works unashamedly although to his merit there is a deftness to the skill with which he applies and moulds it altogether although the outcome is a somewhat routine and superficial.<br/><br/>The show-stopping train crash that acts as the catalyst that sets the main plot in motion is however a testament to Abram's formidable talents as a director. The fact that it involves children rather than adults being thrown in to the lions den marks it out as a daring set-piece and one that no doubt was a challenging one to film.<br/><br/>The young cast that are undoubtedly the heart of the movie are the epitome of a rag-tag group of feisty, nerdy or just plain bossy kids. There is a likable, exuberant chemistry shared by the young actors which benefits the film so they are not irritating. Their idiosyncrasies being for the most part endearing. Although ultimately it is chiefly left to Joel Courtney to give the story it's emotional centre with both Riley Griffiths and Elle Fanning just bringing up the rear. A combination of wide eyed innocence which is monumentally shattered he also exhibits a courageous yet gentle conviction making him a worthy hero. The adult stars though don't disappoint either and offer reliably, solid support with both Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard endeavouring to apply further emotional weight behind the film with their respective performances. But as any film of this kind it needs it's human antagonist that works as a common antagonist to both the Alien fugitive and the townsfolk which takes shape in the form of the air-force headed by Noah Emmerich's obsessive, single minded Col. Nelec. A character that could so easily have been in some part inspired by ""Dreamcatcher's"" merciless Col. Abraham Curtis. Brutally and efficiently militaristic with an unnerving, imposing calm he is a far cry from the more amiable and kindly government agent ""Keys"" played by Peter Coyote in Spielberg's ""E.T.""<br/><br/>As for the Alien itself when it finally rear's in to full view on screen while it is excellently brought to live with the most advanced state of the art CGI. It's a rather less than overawing experience seeing as it's not something we really haven't seen before. Although younger less experienced audience members may be less inclined to be as unimpressed and stare open-mouthed in wonderment or rush behind the nearest chair or sofa in fear. It's merely a less than sweet cherry on a cake of middling quality. Although not awful ""Super 8"" is a second rate, bitter-sweet attempt at a family friendly salute to one of cinema's leading pioneer film-makers. Honourable in intent but passable when it comes to the final analysis it will appeal more to a less demanding audience while those more cynical of us will find something of adequately diverting time-waster."

"darklydreamingrahu","9","1","2","27 October 2011"," A New American Classic
","""Super 8"" is a magical film. While an homage to the ultra-classic science fiction and child adventure films of the 70s and 80s (e.g., ""E.T."", Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""Stand by Me"", and ""The Goonies""), ""Super 8"" manages to blaze a new trail and emerge from the shadows of similar frameworks. The production value, setting, acting, plot build-up, character development, and action rivals all of the films it represents. <br/><br/>The replication of the 70s is done with masterful precision. The houses, the costumes, the cars, the lingo, and the props are meticulously taken care of. The settings are tight-lit and sometimes claustrophobic (when they need to be). This is Spielberg doing what Spielberg does best....setting the mood. <br/><br/>J.J. Abrams and Spielberg get the best performances out of children I have seen in a long, long time. These kids are amazingly convincing at every turn. Not since ""The Sixth Sense"" have I been so moved by a child. Every actor in ""Super 8"" shows professionalism and real talent. Every one of them carries his or her own weight on set. Coming of age stories can sometimes be extremely melodramatic and pointless, but here the acting is first rate.<br/><br/>The plot moves at a slow and steady pace. Every character is fleshed out and all the subplots intertwine with each other perfectly. The writing is crafted with care and the plot devices are constructed around good ideas. Mystery and excitement permeates the entire piece.<br/><br/>The train scene is breathtaking and is the best action scene in a science-fiction movie in recent memory. After that, the action doesn't really pick up until the final act. Instead, you are given clues and intriguing plot elements that piece together the exhilarating conclusion. One the action begins again, it keep you on the edge of your seat and glued to the screen like well-thought-out action scenes should. Movies like ""Transformers"" overload your frontal lobe with so many nauseating action scenes that you are numbed by the end. ""Super 8"", on the other hand, crafts well-timed and well-executed action sequences that come to fruition based on the context of the plot. It mixes action, drama, and sci-fi so awesomely that you are never bored by any of these elements. <br/><br/>""Super 8"" is a new American classic. If you enjoy nostalgia or the brilliant sci-fi films that defined a generation, get ready to be blown away. This film was obviously made by two men that have mighty respect for the time it represents. It belongs in the same category of classic as the films it seeks to connect with. A time in the film industry where plot, characters, and build-up mattered. Spielberg has done it again! Abrams has proved himself worthy of Hollywood. 9/10"

","The movie has a nice touch to it. Bringing a few good friends as kids kinda remind me of the old movie Stand By Me. But that's where the good ends. The suspense built around how the monster/alien looks like is dragged far too long. At the moment I caught a glimpse of the alien, I waited a little more to see how it looks like. And the wait became too long. I can only see how the alien looks like near the end of the film, which spoils the suspense.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is getting old I guess. But on the plus side, the alien effects are pretty good. Appears authentic. But there are scenes where it does not make sense. for example, after the boy rescue the girl, if I were them, i'd be running away from the like hell. But no, they decided to chat and hug first. Meh. Come on."

I have watched this film at least 4 times since its release and although i knew the ending i loved the focus which centred on the young actors and the way they interacted with each other, and not the alien which to me took a back seat in the over all plot. The cgi was very awesome. loving scifi films since early Star trek,i would say if your looking for a great family film with a good mix of scifi and soap/drama ""This is It"" i rated this film on how it made me feel which was very good."

"PittsburghFilmCritic","Null","1","2","17 October 2011"," With Super Eight J.J. Abrams Proves He Has Not Lost His Touch
","The new sci-fi thriller, Super Eight, proves that writer/director J.J. Abrams has not ""Lost"" his touch. Super Eight was advertised in an extremely risky fashion – neither the movie poster nor the movie trailer divulge anything substantial about the film itself – indicating that Abrams and executive producer, Steven Spielberg, had faith that the movie would stand for itself. In short: their gamble paid off. <br/><br/>Super Eight reminds viewers what's missing from most of the big budget, CGI-laden Hollywood movies of today – emotion. Due to a poignant combination of phenomenal acting and impeccable scripting, the on screen emotions seem organic and genuine – transforming the seemingly implausible sci-fi film into a believable, emotional roller coaster for the viewers.<br/><br/>Abrams' admiration for his mentor/coworker, Steven Spielberg is palpable in the movies' nostalgic atmosphere. The story takes place in 1979, long before cell phones and YouTube gave every kid the opportunity to make ""movies."" It also happens to be the period in which Spielberg captured the imagination of moviegoers around the world with the impassioned films that made his career legendary: Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. The Extra Terrestrial. Despite the clear links between Super Eight and Spielberg's' movies Super 8 never feels old, stale, or recycled in any way. <br/><br/>Although the movie may not satisfy the disgusting CGI-thirst of the younger (okay, fine, my) generation, the movie brings back the emotional, enjoyable elements of older movies. Absent are the effects of the surrealistic, 21st century, Avatar sci-fi movies, and the repulsive influence of the Apatow generation. Super Eight is a movie that reminds viewers, especially older viewers, of the power of film. This film brings viewers back twenty or thirty years to a time when filmmaking was about much more than nukes and nudity."

"dougwintersmusic","Null","1","2","11 October 2011"," Super 8: Elle Fanning, America's Sweetheart
","The delightful movie ""Super 8"" takes place during the summer of 1979 in the fictional suburban town of Lilian, Ohio, centering around a group of engaging eighth graders fascinated with writing and directing a bare-bones ""zombie"" movie. Armed with little more than a single Super 8 camera, a single spot light with props and costumes ""borrowed"" from their parents' closets our intrepid group of young thespians soldier on. Stay seated at the end of the movie because for what provides us with a charming sense of closure, we are treated to a viewing of the actual completed short ""zombie"" movie as the credits roll. <br/><br/>""Super 8,"" directed by JJ Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg, is seen through the eyes of our young protagonist, Joe (Joel Courtney) and opens with the (unseen) accidental death of his mother. The only significant adult role is that of Joe's emotionally remote widowed father (Kyle Chandler) too caught up in his own grief and dedication to his job as the town's Deputy Sheriff to even think about his new role as a single parent. <br/><br/>Joe is a quiet, rather normal thirteen year old boy, whose hobby is assembling and painting model trains. It is his knowledge of painting his trains makes him the natural choice one to take on the role as the ""make-up"" artist. The object of Joe's affection is the lovely Alice (Elle Fanning,) a beautiful young girl who begrudgingly accepts Joe's invitation to play the female lead role in the boys' ""bare-bones"" production, but clearly enjoys the attention of playing the leading lady, as she slowly, yet inevitably, grows to return Joe's adolescent affection. Alice is also the only child of an emotionally distant single dad played by Ron Eldard (who coincidentally lost his mother in a crash when he was a child,) In one of the of the movies most charming moments Joe delicately applies make-up to Alice's enticingly beautiful, yet totally innocent, face. She is also the only significant female role in the entire movie. In addition to Alice, we meet Charlie (Riley Griffiths) who is the director and driving force behind the making of this distinctly amateurish ""zombie"" movie, that he hopes to enter in a local film competition. Rounding out their gang is the perpetually frightened ""leading man"" Martin (Gabriel Basso), the endearingly adorable cinematographer/pyromaniac, Cary (Ryan Lee) who carries a backpack full of homemade firecrackers as well as a mouth full of braces, and Preston (Zach Mills) who is basically just hanging out with his buddies.<br/><br/>What makes ""Super 8"" unmistakably Spielbergian, is that at the heart of an engrossing adventure film about a violent train crash, and the havoc, fear and panic created by the existence of an unseen alien monster hidden on the derailed train, is a very charming, poignant story of friendship, loyalty and young love, <br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but although JJ Abrams is listed as the sole director, when was the last time you saw a movie poster that included the producers name in the same size font as the directors? Interestingly enough, in the opening credits, both JJ Abrams ""Bad Robot"" logo appears right after Steven Spielberg's ""Amblin"" production logo. Any fan of televisions hit shows ""Felicity,"" ""Alias,"" ""Lost"" or ""Fringe"" can tell you that the ""Bad Robot"" logo is a childlike sketched red robot head, hiding in black weeds in the light of a huge gray moon. Amblin's logo needs less description, it is a simple black and white sketch of ET and Eliot flying across an enormous white moon. Hmmmmmm.<br/><br/>It's certainly no insult to Mr. Abrams that ""Super 8"" seems like a finely tuned jigsaw puzzle of Mr. Spielberg's most enduring films including ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,"" ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"" ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind,"" ""Jaws,"" and ""Jurassic Park"" (whose logo is a sketch of the head of a huge red dinosaur in the shadow of an enormous white moon.) We can only hope that JJ carries on in the master's groundbreaking footsteps.<br/><br/>Parenthetically, I find it interesting that Spielberg is credited as the Executive Producer of this summers' enormously successful, yet entirely soulless, box office smash, ""Transformers: Dark Of The Moon."" Not only had the greatest director of our lifetime been the Executive Producer of all three ""Transformers"" movies, which get discernibly worse with every sequel, but he has just added the same title to the completely inconsequential tribute to Sylvester Stallone ""Real Steel."" Between Spielberg's Executive Producing choices and Tom Hanks' bloated, absurdly unfunny, instantly forgettable ""Larry Crowne,"" I'm truly starting to get worried about these two extraordinary talents. With extraordinary talent, comes extraordinary responsibility to your audience. Come on guys...we've grown to expect far more from both of you."

","""Do not speak of this or else you and your parents will die."" When a group of kids set out to film a scene for a movie they want to submit to a contest they witness a train crash. When the man that caused it gives them a warning and people start disappearing they begin to investigate further. This is a difficult movie to review. Much like ""Cloverfield"" the preview gives nothing away, and I don't want to ruin anything or give too much away. I will say though that you can really tell that this is a JJ Abrams movie, and Spielberg's ideas are all over this as well. I would have to say that this is a pretty good mix of ""Cloverfield"" and ""Stand By Me"" with a steadier camera and more tense. The biggest problem with this movie to me is that it was too slow in some parts. Trying to put too much in the movie it takes a lot of repetition and long drawn out exposition scenes which hurt the flow of the movie to me. If they simplified it just a little or had more faith in the viewer it would have been much better then it was. On the other hand this was much much better then I was expecting. Overall, a tense and entertaining thriller that is definitely worth a watch. It was just a few tweaks from being a classic. I give it a B+.<br/><br/>Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.<br/><br/>*Also try - Cloverfield & Skyline"

"otherwoldlyreviewer","10","1","2","10 September 2011"," Heart-warming adventure...don't miss out!!!
","I had been waiting for this film for a long time, I think it had been at least a year before I watched it that I first came across the teaser trailer that we are all familiar with. Having watched and admired JJ Abrams' work on Cloverfield and being a Spielberg fan from my yester years, this was a greatly anticipated film for me to see what magic these two film making greats can bring to the silver screen. I had, however, started to get cold feet upon watching the full trailer in which the story seemed to be about kids, etc. My brother, however, encouraged me to make sure I watched it. He said not to get put off just because of the kids, that it would be definitely a mature audience appreciation of good cinema.<br/><br/>I'm glad he did, because after watching this film, my faith in the possibility of Hollywood brewing up and serving true cinematic magic and wonderment has been completely restored for at least another generation. This film had everything: depth, soul, heart, horror, comedy, action, drama, romance, tragedy, adventure, you name it. A TRUE AND ORIGINAL CINEMA EXPERIENCE!!!! From the very beginning of the film, there is real emotion and drama and one by one the characters each steal your attention at every comment, gesture and act. The kids in the film work work very well together, it's really fun to watch. The whole film is also one big homage to the art of film-making and the creative drive that these children have in realising their vision of a film to its fruition. Then the dynamic of the film builds around the impending train crash and the subsequent events that then snowball into an adventure in true Jurassic Park/Indiana Jones/ET-esque fashion.<br/><br/>The way that the whole film is developed is pure artistry and this is why the two film-makers are so renowned. The pacing of the visuals, the sounds, the story, the characters, the action,, the music soundtrack, the sequences are perfection itself. It's a rare type of film (in the image of ET, Close Encounters, Indiana Jones) that you can give yourself over to completely and be just taken away on a treat of a ride through an adventurous viewing that you'll want to experience again and again.<br/><br/>As far as peoples' complaints that it is too much of a copy of those previous movies made by Spielberg movies, I beg to differ. It's meant to be a bit of a throwback to those films to show audiences that it can still be done. With everything that could have been original, Spielberg and Abrams made it exactly that. For example, the entity is nothing like anything I have seen before and the craft is also very unique and the surrounding elements to that part of the plot is also unique. The characters have unique roles, the whole story of how these kids are trying to make a film and the way these events turn their worlds upside down and 360, all serve up a satisfying and as original film as can be with having to be compared to so many good films that came previously. There is an air of nostalgia within the film not only for the filmmakers, especially JJ Abrams, but also the viewer with being taken back to the type of enjoyment one had from watching a great adventure film made for all ages. <br/><br/>Super 8 is a once in a lifetime movie and I urge you all to watch this, so you can say, "" I watched Super 8!!"" This is movie-making at its best. The actors do an incredible job,, the cinematography is precision itself and Michael Giacchino's score just seals the deal. People keep calling him the new John Williams, that may be the case and if he is happy to be compared to that soundtrack writing heavyweight then there's no loss there!! I was asked how it compared with Cloverfield and I feel that it is as good, if not better. If it's better, it's because JJ Abrams is a rare breed, like Spielberg, who know how to make an imaginative, captivating and endearing film. If you watch this cinematic treat, you will be thinking about it long after."

","I have to say, this movie really brought a smile to my face. It had that classic feel to it, with the usual monster terrorizing the city, and only getting a few glimpses of it until the end. The thing about this movie though, compared to other recent films around the same idea, is that it got it right by keeping things simple with the usual nice twist on things. Isn't that how a lot of good classic films worked, with similar ideas, but done in there own unique fashion. Half way through the movie you already know whats going to happen at the end , but you still want to keep watching because you want to see in which ways the movie surprises you and gets you to the end. The special effects were very good through out the whole movie, especially the train scene. Overall, I can't really say that I had a problem with the movie, considering that I expected as much, especially out of a Steven Spielburg movie. Even if there was the occasional fault, the movie as a whole was enjoyable, and certainly one of the better monster movies in the past while."
"kkentuckywoman","10","1","2","3 September 2011"," Shows Why We Love Movies
","This film will remind you why we love movies--it is entertaining from start to finish. It's suspenseful, scary, funny, and even heart-warming. The child actors are unbelievably good, particularly the star-crossed youngsters at the center of the group of friends making the Super 8 movie. Be sure to stay for the final credits so that you can see their movie at the end of the film. The sense of place and time achieved by the filmmakers is awesome--supposed to be Ohio; looked like southwestern Pennsylvania's old industrial areas to me; credits identified the locations as West Virginia--so yeah, right ballpark in the Old Rustbelt of the country. I also liked the fact that there were no ""big stars"" at the helm of this movie, though I know Kyle Chandler is a TV favorite--the casting added to the impact as the film was an ensemble effort, not, for example, a Tom Cruise vehicle. Also interesting was the use of African American actors in key supporting roles as both heroes (the science teacher) and villains (the military men). I was also pleased with the way information about the characters and their interrelationships wasn't spelled out for the viewer, but unfolded gradually over the course of the film. I'm not a fan of special effects and all the previews shown with this ""action film"" are not things I would see, but in this film, as in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" I'm a believer. In both cases, there is a genuine story at the heart, not just things blowing up. But when they do explode or catch fire or whatever, they're great! <br/><br/>See ""Super 8"" on the big screen as it is meant to be seen."
"drqshadow-reviews","6","1","2","2 September 2011"," Modernized Love Letter to 80s Adventure Flicks is Sometimes Too Indulgent
","For better or for worse, this certainly wasn't what I was expecting. At times an innocent, slice of life glimpse back at childhood in the very late 1970s, the film's sudden, jolting leaps into completely different genres left me disoriented and on edge for its duration. Mixing equal parts of The Goonies, Cloverfield, ET and Red Dawn in the same blender, the final product admittedly feels a bit blotchy and uneven. Rather than running from the stereotypes inherent in each ingredient, like a cast of minors fleeing a destructive unseen monster, Super 8 wears them boldly on its chest like a badge of honor. In many ways this plays out like a picture from the distant past, more concerned with upping the ante and bringing an excess of action and adventure than delivering any messages beneath the surface. A broad, varied lead cast toes the line between strong characterization and oversharing, while their less-than-stellar supporting characters bring the cheese in lethal doses. It's a fantastic popcorn muncher with a fascinating knack for the unpredictable, but much, much more shallow than anything else in the Abrams catalog. Fun for a single viewing, I doubt I'll be back for more."
"ty-jensen","10","1","2","26 August 2011"," Good sci-fi thriller! Something different for once!
","This movie is noteworthy because it's not a franchise movie or an adaptation, the cast are completely or mostly unknowns and the alien wasn't shown in the marketing.<br/><br/>It takes place in the '70s in a small Ohio town. Several teens, five boys and one girl are making a Super 8 movie at a train station, a train crashes into a truck, an alien escapes and a few nasty, weird things occur. This movie is fun, compelling, touching and maybe scary. What I mean by ""maybe scary"" is I used to be a wimp when it comes to being scared in the theater, I would cover my ears when a horror movie trailer comes on or when a scary scene or moment is going on, I no longer do that, I will give the scary elements a chance to scare me.<br/><br/>Everything about the movie is good. Don't worry, I won't spoil anything, especially not the alien. The teens were written realistically, they hang out, joke, curse and sometimes do what is right. There is enough humor to help entertain the audience, if there were hardly any, this movie wouldn't be as enjoyable.<br/><br/>This movie is a homage to old Spielberg movies and it really works like that. If it wasn't a homage to Spielberg movies, I guess it would be less enjoyable or bad. If you like ET, The Goonies or Close Encounters which I haven't seen yet, watch this. This movie is a real treat and no this isn't a catchphrase."
"info-130-288696","Null","1","2","24 August 2011"," A film with a mighty big heart, and every inch in the right place. A modern classic in the making and amongst the year's best.
","As summer marches on and the remakes, reboots and adaptations continue to fill our silver screens, we are treated to the occasional little gem and this year's big-budget yet kind hearted feature comes in the form of J.J. Abrams' Super 8.<br/><br/>Set in the small fictitious town of Lillian, Ohio, in 1979, Super 8 follows Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and his group of friends making a zombie film on a Super 8 camera. After convincing Alice (Elle Fanning) to get involved with the project, the group sets off to continue movie-making. During a shoot, a devastating train crash occurs, leaving mountains of burning rubble and debris. Suddenly something unexplainable bursts from the fiery ruins and sets its heart on causing havoc to the town. The group decides to pursue this strange mystery villain and aims to save Lillian from this threat.<br/><br/>Super 8 mixes 80s sci-fi classics E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.<br/><br/>Super 8 mixes sci-fi classics E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.<br/><br/>Many have compared this picture to film director and producer Steven Spielberg's earlier works including E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and other 80s escapist pictures such as The Goonies (1985). Some critics also have accused Super 8 of being a carbon-copy of Spielberg's films.<br/><br/>Granted there are similarities between this picture and some of the above, but Super 8 should be compared to actor, director, producer, writer Rob Reiner's masterpiece Stand By Me (1986) – although the film lacks any Sci-Fi element, Super 8 is about friendship, about life and learning through experience; the group of boys set out to find a body and consequently find themselves along the way.<br/><br/>The film's life lives with its characters. The public follows the group of children throughout and finds comfort in their presence. As with many films where children lead, the group is slightly type-cast (the fat one, the geeky one, the brave one, the mad one and so on), but the type-casting and formatting ends there. Thankfully Abrams knows the importance of character and development. Each member of the group is rounded, dimensional and interesting, as well as being frequently funny and effortlessly charming. Director JJ Abrams' fantastic script gives the group believable and naturalistic dialogue, so yes the kids do swear, quite a bit actually but that's how youngsters talk.<br/><br/>Super 8 has been dubbed a family film too by some. I'd slightly argue against this – there are certain themes and messages here that are clearly aimed for the family audience: imagination, wonder, exploration and so forth, but there is also a lot of 'adult' material, and I don't just mean the language. A key narrative theme throughout is loss; the film opens with the funeral of Joe's mother and ideas of loss and misplacement are heavily implied throughout – even everyone's dogs run away. The film is also 'quite' scary and violent in places; there's no gore and just a very tiny amount of blood but the first hour is weighted in tension and suspense, something that may either terrify or bore smaller viewers. I would not see any particular harm in letting an under 12 watch it, just maybe not if they are under 8 or 9.<br/><br/>As well as a brilliant group of characters and a cracking script, the film also sports some wonderful cinematography and breath-taking special effects. The train crash is incredible and one of 2011's best CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) sequences - the epic pyrotechnics, flying carriages and deafening sounds make it a stand-out scene in this grand work. What is even better about the CGI is that there is very little of it. After the train, there isn't much more catastrophic action until the picture's climax, but filling that void is easy due to just how good the young actors are. The picture's duration simply flies by.<br/><br/>Every performance is strong with Fanning and Riley Griffiths, who plays Charles Kaznyk (the fat one), being the show-stoppers. The pair bring charisma, skill and productiveness to their roles. Courtney is also great as Joe and does very well with carrying the emotional sequences as well as the escapist elements.<br/><br/>Super 8 is certainly a homage rather than a 'suck-up'; it's a homage to simpler times, better cinema and the sense of awe and magic that swept through youth. If any film is going to embrace and bear-hug your inner child for 112 minutes, it's this. Abrams has crafted some unforgettable characters, a gripping and often tense environment and has breathed life back into retro science-fiction.<br/><br/>Verdict: ●●●●● Read more on www.theupcoming.co.uk"

","Well, where do I start? This film is bland, boring, tedious, ridiculous and a disgrace for J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg. When you see their names billed on the poster, you must think that this film will be of some sufficient quality some way or another - but no, this film simply isn't good enough and I was disappointed. The story begins where some kids who are well, pretty decent actors to be fair to them, are making a film for a festival. At this point there is a highly exaggerated train crash which makes you wonder whether Michael Bay had anything to do with this film. Generically, everybody are somehow fine with no cuts or bruises. They then find that a man drove into the train which caused the crash. After a whole hour of panicking ( I'm being serious, an hour. ) they finally realise that some weird stuff is going on and people are being abducted and the film concludes with something very very very very ridiculously stupid. If you have the money to waste then watch it just to see the most amusing part of the film. Honestly, this film is awful. I want to give it something to defend J.J. Abrams' name, but I can't find anything to defend. J.J. , stick with Cloverfield and Steve, stick with Jaws. This simply isn't good enough. 2/10, Oh dear."

","This is a great, very interesting and different film.<br/><br/>Original, fresh, valiant, a classic movie concept which grants entertainment for all the family, ironically a concept that was lost in time, at least, 20 years ago. Trust me, this film if full of magic.<br/><br/>What I want to say is that this movie has enough mature content for being considered ""just for kids"" and, in the other hand, it has the necessary sense of humor and limits in visual violence in order to satisfy the youngest without boring the adults.<br/><br/>The direction is awesome. Everything is well fitted, the camera is always well located, the sense of rhythm is brilliant, but it's in the work with actors, specially with the youngest where Abrams does his best.<br/><br/>In my opinion, casting unknown actors has been a triumph. Elle Fanning actually is an incoming superstar, but the other children are totally unknown for the average public, and all of them do an incredible work. It seems that they aren't acting, trust me.<br/><br/>The setting in latest 70's USA small town is also a good point. Perfect costume, location and make-up that help you getting into the movie.<br/><br/>About the plot... the story is OK, the dialogues are well built, sometimes brilliant and funny, but there are few (always in my opinion) mistakes that didn't satisfy me at all.<br/><br/>As I've said before, this is a great film, but it's not, unfortunately, an immortal, masterpiece, all-time classic, and I'll try to explain why: -First of all, I have to say, that if I were 12-14 years old I would give this film a 10 out of 10, but I actually have 31, and my duty is to be, as much as I can, objective.<br/><br/>-Abrams's work is unbeatable, I can't say anything else, but there is the Spielberg factor. Spielberg is ""the master"", the director and producer who has never done a bad film, but also an artist with some bad habits that he can't avoid and his touch can be sensed in the entire movie.<br/><br/>Then, if you mix Abrams and Spielberg's magical touch, the result is a true masterpiece, but if you add the last one's bad habits, which are clearly shown in the film's last ten minutes and some story's weak points ( I thinks that it's is unnecessary to spoil anything, just watch it and you'll see that those little flaws are clear) the result is a great film, sometimes outstanding, but never perfect.<br/><br/>In conclusion, an excellent and fresh film, not perfect just for few details, but always recommendable for the entire family. One of this year's best films, much better than the average level of our days filming. And the most important thing: don't forget it, this movie recovers a style from a time where the cinema was magic."

","Sometimes it's just nice to watch a simple, well made, well acted, well written film.<br/><br/>Nothing about Super 8 blew me away, in fact I was actually a little disappointed in the SFX for the train crash given J.J.Abrams stellar work on the Star Trek prequel, however SFX would never make or break a film for me. My one reservation going into the film would have been about the quality of the kids' acting playing the leads given they would capture most of the screen time but I was pleasantly surprised, all of them did really excellent jobs and were very watchable, I can see solid box office careers for some of them.<br/><br/>The story was interesting enough and sufficiently well written that there were no points in the film where I had to suspend my disbelief. (although I do have a particularly high tolerance for fantastical story lines). Super 8 is an incredibly well made film that I can see being shown on TV networks regularly in coming decades. Quality entertainment for all ages. <br/><br/>Finally, I never judge a film on trailers but generally on the poster as I like to go into the cinema not knowing exactly what is going to happen, I think Super 8 is a film which definitely benefits from not knowing too much about it before seeing it.<br/><br/>Thoroughly recommended for all movie watchers."

","In 2011, we have the technology for incredible special effects,but a movie can't be just a series of explosions and others effects.. A movie need a good story and complicated and sympathetic characters.. Many of new movies is just stupid because they try to make a movie just in studio,with characters that have 2-3 replies.. This movie has it all!.. Is a grate story that will keep you in suspense every second,will scare you and make you want more.. Will cry and love the characters.. Another thing that plus the movie is the cast - kids!..Love it,each other is very different and has different character, thinking and talents.

"Rockwell_Cronenberg","7","1","2","6 August 2011"," Genuine movie magic for the first time in a long time.
","There are many reasons why I was destined to really hate Super 8. I have lost practically all interest in summer blockbusters. I have a deep hatred for Steven Spielberg. However, J.J. Abrams does something absolutely magical here. He creates a genuine spectacle, an experience that somehow feels familiar yet entirely unique. In a time where every other week we're seeing some diluted $150 million blockbuster, nothing feels genuinely epic anymore. Entire planets can be destroyed and it's hard to even fake interest, because it's all done over and over again. Each week is an attempt to up the ante from the last massive explosion-fest and at this point they're all just boring to me. People get confused when I claim that things like Transformers and Iron Man 2 just genuinely bore me to tears, but how could I not be bored when nothing can be a spectacle anymore. Somehow, some way, Abrams has done the impossible and made movies...magic, again.<br/><br/>This picture is basically the epitome of the summer blockbuster, but Abrams makes it unique by essentially bringing it back to basics. He strips away the superheroes and the explosion after explosion peril and actually builds a film around it's characters. He creates this human drama, a coming-of-age story in the most interesting of circumstances, and then builds this alien blockbuster around it. Whereas all of these other big pictures are starting off with the explosions and then trying to add character filler to keep it going, Abrams starts at the ground floor by building real people and working outwards from there. In doing this, he creates an emotional drama with the kids in the picture and as a result all of the enormous action sequences actually feel epic because they feel so out of the ordinary. We're just focusing on the story of these children, first love and tested friendships, and then the unthinkable happens. And this time it's actually unthinkable, not just a run of the mill expectation.<br/><br/>The train crash near the beginning of the film is the perfect example of this. When huge explosions of this nature occurred in films like Terminator Salvation or Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, I didn't blink an eye. I was legitimately bored because there was no surprise or out-of-this-world extravagance to it. But here we are just focusing on these kids telling a story and then this huge explosion occurs and they are thrust into the middle of a terrifying accident where their lives are on the line. I honestly can't remember the last time that I actually sat with my eyes open and my mouth dropped, stunned by the intensity of such an exciting action sequence. This film brought to me things that I never thought I could experience again; it made me feel like a kid one more time.<br/><br/>It's obvious that Super 8 draws a lot from the Steven Spielberg pictures of the '70s and '80s, but I think Abrams is a much more skilled director than Spielberg ever was. Yes, he's only directed three films so I'm sure this comment will get a lot of flack, but I firmly believe it. This one film is a better creation than anything Spielberg has done, and I think the primary reason is because of what Abrams does with these characters. In building the story around these kids he makes it all feel so real. The sentimental moments don't feel like typical Hollywood schmaltz like they do with Spielberg's work, they feel genuine and therefore hit my heart pretty strong. Some of the moments between Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning (who gave two extraordinary performances for any actor, let alone children) honestly brought tears to my eyes. He creates real people here and therefore the stakes are genuine, the emotions are authentic and everything is a real life spectacle."
"rparham","8","1","2","5 August 2011"," A fine piece of nostalgia
","Minus the computer generated visual effects, and if the credits at the end were lopped off, you might think that Super 8 was made in the late 1970s or early 1980s and was directed by Steven Spielberg. However, while Spielberg is a producer on the film, he did not direct it, that task was handled by J.J. Abrams, but the film plays like a love letter to many of Spielberg's best known works from that era. This isn't a soulless imitation, though, for Super 8 manages to recapture what made those films work well, delivering the audience back to a time, for many of us, of cinematic innocence.<br/><br/>Set in 1979 in a small town in Ohio, we are introduced to Joe (Joel Courtney), Charles (Riley Griffiths), Cary (Ryan Lee), Preston (Zach Mills) and Martin (Gabriel Basso), middle school friends working on Charles Super 8 film for entry into a contest. Late one night, driven to a location by Alice (Ellie Fanning), the daughter of a man believed responsible, to an extent, for the recent death of Joe's mother at a nearby factory, the kids manage to capture footage of an immense train crash just outside town. The crash appears to have been instigated by their Biology teacher, Mr. Woodward (Glynn Turman), and the site is quickly overrun by military officials, led by Nelic (Noah Emmerich), who begins a cleanup and encampment in the town that proves worrisome to Joe's father, Jackson (Kyle Chandler), a deputy in the town. When mysterious things begin happening (power flickering, pets disappearing, engines missing out of cars), followed by disappearances of townspeople, Jackson suspects there is more to the situation than the army is revealing. <br/><br/>In the midst of these happenings, Charles is trying to finish his movie, but Joe can't help but be pulled into the search for the truth of what is happening as well, while at the same time experiencing a budding young romance taking shape between him and Alice, complicated by their individual fathers not wanting the two kids to intermingle due to the accident at the mill.<br/><br/>Super 8 pays homage to so many films that Spielberg either directed, such as E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or films that he had a hand in producing, including The Goonies, but not just by utilizing plot or character elements. No, Super 8 goes the extra mile, to the point that visual and auditory components feel ripped right from that period of time. Individual shots, especially those of the city below and the stars in the sky, match the feel of similar shots from Close Encounters; the lighting, film stock, all of it just oozes respect for those well loved films of that era. Even Michael Giachinno's score echoes the work of John Williams. Giachinno is an exceptional craftsman who has proved able to meld his work with the styles of other composers, and with Super 8 he has worked his magic once again, capturing the heart of the music in Spielberg's earlier works. None of this has the feel of a crass rip-off; it is all assembled with a deep felt love of those films from that period, and works beautifully.<br/><br/>One element that Abrams has also managed to capture is the very ""ordinariness"" of the characters. These are not superheroes, top trained military operatives or mathematical whizzes. They are average, small town boys, girls and adults, and they very much reflect the audience, much as Spielberg did often in that same era. Abrams has also assembled a fine cast, especially the very capable child actors, led by Courtney and Fanning, who have strong chemistry between them from their first scenes together, and it builds into a sweet, innocent romance that is effectively realized throughout the running time. The other boys also feel as if they are good friends, filled with a degree of curiousness and fear at appropriate times. The adult characters aren't ignored, focusing especially on Jackson, a man who is somewhat lost without his wife and not sure how to raise his son on his own, while also juggling the responsibilities of trying to figure out what is going on in the town. Chandler gives a strong performance, showing both the hard and soft of Jackson appropriately.<br/><br/>If there is one element that doesn't quite work in Super 8, it is the central mystery of the film, most specifically its payoff. The ""monster"" of Super 8 is well-handled early in the proceedings, Abrams again taking a page from the book of Spielberg, specifically Jaws in this case, taking care to not reveal the central antagonist, keeping it in the shadows for the most part. But as the film builds to its climax, the revelations about the creature, and its eventual full reveal, are somewhat underwhelming, and the degree of emotional resonance with this part of the story is limp, at best. <br/><br/>That being said, overall, Super 8 is successful, filling you with a strong sense of nostalgia for an era, and a subset of work by a particular filmmaker, gone by. In a time when directors and writers seem to be constantly trying to cram more and more noise, frenetic action, and jump cut editing into movies, a refreshing look back at when that wasn't the case is welcome, and enjoyed."
"rabbitmoon","Null","1","2","2 August 2011"," Seemingly misunderstood by many
","I'm surprised at the many negative reviews here. My only guess is that those people weren't in synch with what the film was trying to accomplish, which I think it did incredibly successfully.<br/><br/>Its a specific genre piece almost as niched as a grindhouse film - and if you aren't in that groove, then you won't enjoy it as much as those who are. And that genre is ""Spielberg eighties"".<br/><br/>The monster in the film is a red herring - a catalyst that drives many other stories elements forward and together.<br/><br/>The film is really about growing up and letting go (of the past, of grief, of regret, of grudges). I noticed many subtle moments where characters are either forced to, or choose, to let go of something. The way that these moments are interwoven with the story are brilliant.<br/><br/>If you're in synch with Spielberg style nostalgia, then there's a lot to appreciate in this film. If you're part of the soulless CGI Facebook generation, then you probably won't find it."

The friendship between the kids is the only good element I can think of throughout the movie. As the movie proceeds, the plot gets boring and disappoints the audience.

"SingingAnalyst","9","1","2","27 June 2011"," Spielberg's tribute to Gen X nostalgia
","The summer of '79. The movie got the songs, movies, fads, cars and decor right. The kids were our age (if you're a Gen-Xer like me). With a thrilling storyline and special effects, this movie is a throwback to early Spielberg hits like ""Poltergeist"", ""E.T."", and ""Back to the Future"". A heart-warmer.<br/><br/>Like ""Witness"", this movie features children who are told not to tell what they've seen. Like ""Minority Report"" (another Spielberg great), the human spirit contends against all-powerful Science. This movie packs a lot into 112 minutes-- proving that a movie does not have to be long to be great.<br/><br/>Spielberg is among an elite few-- others being James Cameron and Ron Howard-- who can spellbind an audience year after year, and tell a good story and inject some humor in the process. ""Kids having their own stereos-- it's a slippery slope"". Nice 20-20 hindsight!"
"The_Dead_See","7","1","2","27 June 2011"," A kids film, perfectly done in the style of the mid 80's. Expect that and you'll enjoy it.
","I think the marketing strategy in part is working against Super 8 - preventing it from getting better reviews. For months we were fed mysterious viral footage online and teased with images of something huge and terrifying beating it's way out of military train wreck.<br/><br/>Obviously when you set a film up like that you're going to get a lot of disappointed reviews from audience members who expected something a little more adult, more serious... more... Cloverfield.<br/><br/>But let me tell you what this film is, straight up: it's a kids film.<br/><br/>It's 100% nostalgia - a pleasant trip back to the mid 80's. If you fondly remember The Goonies, The Explorers, Flight of the Navigator, ET, Gremlins and their ilk then you're going to dig this. There's no attempt at an evolution or updating of those styles - the film is pure homage and JJ Abrams nailed it.<br/><br/>There's a certain sadness here for the thirty-somethings that grew up in the 80's - a realization that those old films you loved weren't *that* great and were in fact, kind of shallow and cheesy - as is this one. But there's also a big deep breath of fresh air - a momentary relief from the current trends of rapid editing, shaky cam, perversely convoluted plots and arcless characters. This is good, old fashioned three-act, well-arced storytelling. The camera, for the most part, is firmly fixed on a tripod. There's a simple love story. Some simple parent-child relationship stuff, and a clear theme of moving on from loss. I for one found myself grinning from ear to ear through most of it."
"noradar","9","1","2","26 June 2011"," No clue what it was going in, and fully entertained after watching
","For the most part, I had no clue what this movie was about or even who was in it before going in the theater. I can honestly say that I was completely entertained and felt it was one of the better movies I had seen in the past couple of years. It has humor, suspense, drama, and action. It gave me a sense of nostalgia for the movies I watched as a kid. I love the ways that Abrams pays homage to Spielberg in his compilation that is Super 8.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed classic films such as: The Goonies, Stand By Me, Jaws, and Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, then I know you will enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Just go for the ride, don't think too much and have a good time!"

","I would categorize this movie with the Goonies an ET. It has a similar style and feel. The characters really made the movie for me. Elle Fanning deserves awards and accolades galore, she was amazing. I am blown away that a child her age can act with such brevity and emotion! Super 8 combines comedy, suspense and action in a way that hints of classic Spielberg. I feel that Super 8 is probably not the best title, however, I'm not sure what a better one would be. I was entertained, the way summer blockbusters used to entertain before tasteless sex and ridiculous shock factor scenes became trendy. Super 8 is clever and exciting, but only time will tell if it will go down in history with the films in whose footsteps it closely follows. As for now, it was worth the money spent to see it in the theater, and that's good enough for me."

","Brevity is the soul of wit so I'll be brief. Super 8 isn't a very original piece. It feels like composite of Spielberg's early works with liberal serving of 'The Goonies' with a side of 'Cloverfield'. Plot is pretty standard family problems, story told many times before. But what this film does is work. Acting is solid, characters believable, action exciting, jokes funny. This movie made me smile all the way home. J.J. Abrams took all the parts that make the film ""Spielbergian"" and made it own. Entertainment of the highest sort. If you're after that elusive feeling you had when watching 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' that's your best choice."
"DavidTL","7","1","2","22 June 2011"," ""Super 8"" isn't so Super after all
","Super 8 wasn't so super. JJ Abrams practically tried to make it the next ET crossed over with The Goonies. It was also an obvious homage 70s/80s monster flicks and to Spielberg (who I bet he with his huge ego) is proud of it. It didn't even feel like JJ Abrams was even trying to make a good film. It might as well have been listed as a remake of ET. You could probably go and look at any film from the 70s or 80s and edit them all together and what you would get is this pointless disappointing film Super 8. It is the EXACT same story as ET but if it was crossed with The Goonies but barely any character development, stereotypical characters and situations for them and no good humour. The good thing about the characters were that the child actors were not that bad at all and I'll give them credit as I have nothing against their performances as they were perfectly cast but their characters created by JJ Abrams were just way too two-dimensional.<br/><br/>The monster wasn't even that great. It was a re-hash of the Cloverfield monster but a tiny bit less angry and not as big. Also he seemed like ET because he wanted to get off the planet and ""go home"". His back story felt exactly the same as the alien Paul from ""Paul"" about him being kept locked up and experimented on. The monster was way too over-hyped and won't be remembered in years to come. It seemed violent for no reason but yet really intelligent. Imagine the T-Rex suddenly being able to build a trap and DIY stuff but can also eat men off toilets, well thats what this one is. <br/><br/>The film started off good but seemed to fail. The dogs all disappeared in the film and ended up in the next towns but that was never fully explained. The main character Joel was supposed to have a dog but I didn't know he had one until he went searching for it and put up a ""missing"" sign on a billboard. The main story of the movie was basically a group of friends and one of the friends gets kidnapped by the monster and all of the other friends go and search and be brave little 13, 14 year old kids. That's practically the story and everything else before it seems pointless. At the end of the movie I didn't care about them. The ending even came quite sudden and if you actually watched the trailer then you would know what would happen in the end, the alien manages to go back to his home planet because this isn't an 18/R-rated film where the aliens don't get a good ending, the alien practically builds a spaceship that looks like ETs and then floats off while all of the public and military don't seem to be bothered by it even though they are looking at it. Even the military don't seem to care, funny how they were all secretive and protective about it and seemed to want to capture it back or kill it.<br/><br/>But the thing I do NOT understand is why is it every film this year that looked good turned out to be really disappointing or not that great? Yes I know trailers are meant to do this but this year they seem to be way over-hyping the films that they are advertising. Battle: Los Angeles had a great trailer and looked really intense and scary and the new ""Independence Day"" but without the humour and that ended up like watching a walk-through video for Call of Duty but with weird saucer-shaped headed aliens. Sucker Punch looked great too but it was boring, I even thought I was playing a video game because of how video-game it felt, forget Scott Pilgrim as being a video-game like film, I even though I would have to tap a few buttons to defeat a boss a few times. The film could have been great if there were a few plot changes and a character or two excluded. The great story would be that they escaped the institute and then the entire world seemed to be after them but instead the action was ""fantasy moments"" and was pointless because they weren't real. Super 8 was my last hope and now I do not think I can ever trust a movie trailer again.<br/><br/>Super 8 isn't a bad film, it just tries to pay so much homage to Spielberg and monster movies from the 70s and 80s and the film doesn't feel fresh or innovative. It felt lazy and Spielberg himself might as well have made a loose remake of ET and turned him bad and you would get Super 8 exactly. But what I don't understand is how is it I, a 18-year-old college student who adores movies can come up with great ideas with what these films can be but the film makers fail at doing it? My ideas for this movies aren't impossible, you could do them on the budget each movie has but every movie seems to be failing with scripts now and it's annoying knowing that professional Hollywood film makers can't even come up with a good film anymore. How is it I, and it's not just me it's my friends too, how is it we can come up with good ideas for films but Hollywood can't anymore? It defiantly seems like movies are now just business and have no heart to them (apart from the odd few of course, but the funny thing is these ones are done by less-famous film makers)."
"Vinegaroon3","5","1","2","21 June 2011"," This movie largely fails....and is unoriginal to boot
","Honestly, this film was a mess.<br/><br/>It tries very hard to be mysterious and suspenseful, but fails. I would summarize it as a ""slice of life"" portrayal of the kids in the movie. They go through their lives, acting and thinking like the adolescents that they are. In the background we know something (something largely predictable) is going on related to the train wreck and the presence of the military. The problem is that during the long, agonizing middle of the film, this ""situation"" has virtually nothing to do with the kids and is largely ignored. The movie drags horribly during the middle (2/3 of the film) because quite simply nothing is happening.<br/><br/>The character development is pretty good, and for that reason I at least gave the movie a mediocre rating. But, in terms of the story, it falls flat on its face.<br/><br/>Having said all that, it was the complete lack of originality that really bothered me here. It seems Spielberg has dipped too many times into the same well. If I described this movie as a compilation of ET, Goonies, and Close Encounters, you would have a very good idea what to expect. Yet, where all those other movies succeeded (at least on some level), Super 8 fails. It was boring, predictable, and felt cobbled together.<br/><br/>I recommend you skip this one, or perhaps watch it in TV."
"jickweez-1","4","1","2","20 June 2011"," Kinda works as a homage only
","Just know going in that there is absolutely nothing original in Super 8, nothing whatsoever unless this is the first movie you've ever seen. I read that JJ Abrams guarded the secret of the movie's plot like a classified Homeland Security document. Um, OK. But that secret is a complete letdown if you've seen three or more of the following movies this borrows heavily from: ET, Goonies, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Jurassic Park, Poltergeist (yes, lots of Spielberg here), Alien, Aliens, Eight Legged Freaks, Jeepers Creepers, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and many, many others too numerous to mention here.<br/><br/>I want to give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt and say this is an homage to other far superior Science Fiction flicks, but the huge budget and clunky storyline lean more towards a derivative mishmash. Still, there are some semi-decent scenes and the young boy actor and Elle Fanning do a fine job with their stories. It's just when they come together with their contrived pre-adolescent romance that the chemistry fizzles like the 80's candy Pop Rocks abundant in the era this movie supposedly takes place in. But the music choices are great as are the 80's throwback costumes and setting.<br/><br/>The action drags along, and by the end I gave it a should shrug and a ""meh."" There are worse ways to spend a weekend day and $15, though."

","I was really looking forward to watching this movie. It looked like a fun, sci-fi flick with some cool action and decent characters. <br/><br/>Well, it kind of was... but not really.<br/><br/>First of all, the story was very predictable. I more or less had it figured out in the first 20 minutes or so. And it was really cheesy- all the creepy monster attack scenes were at night, when the victims were alone and helpless. I mean, seriously?<br/><br/>I can't tell if this movie was supposed to be primarily about the alien or about the death of the boy's mother. It started off with the kids filming their zombie movie and focusing on the boy (I already forgot the character's names, which tells you how connected I was to them) dealing with the death of his mom... but after maybe half an hour it was all about the alien. Also, the ending was really anti-climactic and cheesy. <br/><br/>I know these types of movies aren't supposed to be realistic at all, but some of the situations in this movie were so ridiculous that I couldn't help laughing during the ""serious"" parts.<br/><br/>I will say that the acting was very solid, and was the score, editing, cinematography (for the most part), and effects.<br/><br/>But there's more to a movie that the appearances. A good movie needs a strong plot and three-dimensional characters. This movie has an average plot with too many subplots that get mentioned and dropped. I really didn't care about any of the characters in general. There are some emotional scenes between two of the kids, but the rest is very average and I found myself frequently getting bored and staring at my watch.<br/><br/>Super 8 could have been so much better... but, alas, it was just average and very forgettable."
"daveygandthekeyboard","9","1","2","19 June 2011"," Like seeing an old favorite for the first time
","Super 8<br/><br/>Right off the bat, I have to say that this movie pays homage and reminds me of so many movies that I love: E.T, The Goonies, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, District 9, Cloverfield (ok, I didn't actually see that one). It has a little bit of Lost thrown in, but all in all, it is a thoroughly enjoyable JJ Abrams creation. Super 8, set in 1979, is about a group of kids who are making a zombie film for a super 8 film contest. One night, in the middle of filming, they witness an extraordinary train crash, created by an apparently insane motorist who drives his truck on to the tracks, directly in the way of the oncoming train. There is a terrific explosion--one that actually seems too far-fetched to be plausible (I used to live 60 feet from train tracks and have seen the results of a derailment, so my BS meter was going off--but I held it in check--besides, there does turn out to be an explanation for thisÂ…) and this sets off the chain of events which involves a military cover-up and one very-angry-but possibly-misunderstood-alien who, as it turns out, really just wants to go home. If it doesn't sound like the first time you've heard this, well, it isn't. But ten minutes into this film, it won me over. The parallels to the movies listed above are obvious: an alien who wants to go home (E.T.), a conspiracy with a large dose of ""what the hell?"" happening (Lost, Close Encounters) a misunderstood alien who is ultimately a benevolent being (E.T., District 9), and a plucky group of young kids who save the day (Goonies.) Plus there is a sweet tale of adolescent first crush, first love set against the background of tragedy which is almost universal. Yeah--while I can't say I haven't seen any of this before, I find myself absolutely delighted by the way this all turned out. You could certainly do much worse than to pay homage to Spielberg. Super 8 is a wonderful film that is worth seeing if only to remind us of what it felt like to be a kid and to see any of your favorite movies for the first time."

I am not an expert, but, that train looked like it was moving at light speed, and that truck seemed to magically make the whole thing (100 cars or so) de-rail.<br/><br/><ul><li>The dog theme went nowhere. We find out the dogs left town, and the movie. Good decision there. Oh yeah, that is another alien theme, animals don't like aliens.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Did I miss the growing suspense, possible impending doom, climactic ending? I saw the start of the above items but they all fizzled out. This was a cheezy movie from beginning to end. Things that really bugged me: Why waste time on linking townsfolk asking about their missing relative or friend who was wearing curlers, and then, Ta-Daaaa! they appear in the alien's underground lair. The super 8 film the kids were making had more originality that that.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why show Air Force personnel (or were they just a secret force?) going through the town portrayed to make us think they are looking for the alien, and then, Ta-Daaaaa! coincidentally, they are on site, ready and prepared to evacuate the entire town and surrounding areas -after- they start a fire, that looks like it may have taken a barn out, but, not an entire town. And, they are also broadcasting supposedly highly secret information freely over the airwaves.</li></ul><br/><br/>-Enough with the floating objects whenever we work with aliens in movies <br/><br/>-I wonder how they were able to control the alien when they had it in captivity in the first place? And, oh yes, let's send it on a cross-country trip in a boxcar. Did anyone notice that the M16's did not seem to have any affect on the alien? Not that they should, but, again, the Air Force seemed to know exactly what they were dealing with, and then again, not sure at all what to do, depending on which scene in the movie you were watching.<br/><br/>-What was with the tanks and the RPG's, bazooka's etc? All there to just create explosions and more fluff.<br/><br/>I like the attempt, the design of the alien,the ensemble acting from the kids, but, the overall results, to me, did not work or fit quite right."

","A children's movie about an alien invasion.
The story is very similar to the movie ""Invaders from Mars (1986)"".
When I saw ""Invaders from Mars (1986)"" during my childhood, it was just OK.
And ""Invaders from Mars (1986)"" is better and with more interesting plot
than ""Super 8"".
I am now 39 years old and I do not like children's movies."

","Others have already pointed out the many major flaws and plot holes of this movie, so I won't waste time on that here. I love sci fi adventures and the basic idea is pretty good. The special effects are nicely done too, but the story is just so amazingly bad and the plot holes so enormous that the film ultimately becomes unwatchable."
"wyatt514","6","2","7","10 June 2011"," A great film overall, much better than Cloverfeild
","Walking into this film, I figured that this would just be ""Cloverfield in the '70's with kids"", but I was totally wrong. The film exceeded almost all my expectations The plot is very basic: a train wreck with mysterious cargo crashes in a quiet, rural town. 5 children witness the crash and run off in fear. The town is then tormented by a mysterious creature from the train. I don't want to give any major details away, so I'll stop there. What I will say, however is that the film has the tension and excitement that Abrams fans have come to expect from all his latest films. The acting in this, however, exceeds all that I've seen this year (and I've seen a lot this year). The child actors SHINE compared to the adults in the movie (and in some other films this year: Pirates 4 for example).<br/><br/>Abrams really got rid of all the negative qualities of Cloverfield and replaced them with audience-friendly traits: the most important being ANSWERS!!!!! Many (including myself) walked out of Cloverfield with questions about everything: what happened to the characters, what is the monster, where did the monster come from, etc. ALL of these are answered in Super 8. Some could argue that the lack of answers added to the mysteriousness of Cloverfeild, but others want to know backstory about the film's characters (myself included). However, Abrams still sticks to the Cloverfeild formula; giving the audience little glimpses of the monster to keep everyone interested Abrams stuck with his editing team from Star Trek for Super 8, lens flares and all. The lens flares weren't as annoying in this as they were in Star Trek, but you still notice them as they fill the screen with a bright light. I found it really annoying (I wear heavy prescription glasses and have to put up with lens flare all the time) and at some times it was worse than Star Trek. Abrams really toned it down, all considered.<br/><br/>In close, I really have to say that this has been my favorite film this year (and putting up with trash like Fast Five, it's not a surprise). The acting is superb, especially from the children. It's a must-see"
"Likes_Ninjas90","7","3","13","6 June 2011"," As the explosive experts take over in the final quarter, the film starts to read from the Jurassic Park Handbook of Escape Routes
","In the 70s a boy's mother is killed during a factory accident. The boy is Joe (Joel Courtney) and rallying around him are his young friends, led by Charles (Riley Griffiths). Charles is making a low budget horror movie with them on his super 8 camera; much to the disapproval of Joes father Jack (Kyle Chandler), the deputy Sheriff. One night Charles invites the group to a late night filming session. He invites along Alice (Elle Fanning) and Joe takes a quiet liking to her. While filming at a train station they try to use an incoming train as a background to the movie. But the train derails and explodes, forcing the kids to run for cover. When they reach the wreckage a dying man points a gun at them, telling them not to talk about anything they've seen. Days later and strange things are occurring in the town, like metal objects disappearing, suggesting that something otherworldly has escaped from the train. It leads to a military intervention on the town, which is disrupting for the filming of the rest of Charles' movie. Alice is also reluctant to come back because of her alcoholic father Louis (Ron Eldard). <br/><br/>There are three films being made throughout Super 8 and only two of them work. The kid's amateur horror production and J.J. Abrams' tribute to a young, free generation have a nostalgic quality to them. There's a level of sweetness about the trouble these kids get into and how they interact with each other. The dynamics of the group are sharp. Their interactions are often very funny and their diction is sound. It's very difficult to capture how children speak to each other but here it's authentic. And because of this and the unique personality of each child the scenes with the group are the most enjoyable in the film. This is essentially a picture for anyone who has ever played with monster makeup, fake blood and plastic soldiers. But rather typically, the adults spoil the fun. The studio's vision seems at odds with Abrams'. The film is louder and more inflated than E.T ever could have been. The little guy probably went home so he could hear himself think. Too often there's a lack of restraint here. Take the film's biggest set piece, the train crash. It's deafening and visually striking but it's not enough to simply have the locomotive derail. It also has to be packed with explosives so we can watch it go boom. Then there's the assumption that without caricatures like the pot smoker and the scantily clad rebellious daughter we'd never know the film was set in the 1970s. The clean neighbourhoods and stereotypes make this look like a movie version of the era. <br/><br/>It's also the side characters who obstruct the more interesting main story and provide tonal issues too. There's a disjunction between the playfulness of the kids and the square jawed militarism. It's strange that a film so intent on paying homage to B-grade horror compromises itself by being so serious at times. It's unfortunate because of how funny so much of Super 8 is. The amateur film played over the end credits is hysterical. But as the explosive experts take over in the final quarter, the film starts to read from the Jurassic Park Handbook of Escape Routes. Spielberg is one of the film's producers, which also explains why the film is caught in a tug-of-war between being an aggressive monster picture and something more sentimental. At least the film is never dull, courtesy of the fine performances by the kids. They're all very natural and Elle Fanning grows most emotionally here. There's one noted efforts by the adults like Kyle Chander. His character might as well have been called John Law. Lighten up dad. But as the political climate around the US's immigration policies heats up we're likely to see even more films from Hollywood about alien arrivals. Super 8 is an often engaging and entertaining sci-fi entry to this phase, but those looking for a leaner and more sophisticated alien film would do better with the British film from last year, Monsters."
"judywalker2","6","2","8","13 June 2011"," Definitely could have been a lot better
","For a film by two good storytellers (Spielberg and Abrams)this movie lacked a compelling story. The actors were very good I have to say they did the best they could with the material they had. It was slow and really didn't get going until well after the train derailed (not a spoiler since it's in every trailer). The human story was okay but the monster story sucked. On another note I wish that writers could find a way to write stories that didn't have unnecessary foul language in it. The way these young kids talked was ridiculous and really turned me off. This is a scary movie and really isn't appropriate for kids under ten and that's part of what's wrong with it. It should have been more ET and Close Encounters and less Lost. 6/10"
"ken1848","7","2","8","8 June 2011"," Move Thee Reviews: Looking at the Adult World through the Children's Eyes
","The nostalgic trailer of Super 8 Directed by J. J. Abrams is reminiscent of E.T. and Cloverfield. The movie is a cocktail of sci-fi, comedy, family, romance, friendship, teenage growth, monsters and zombies. If you expect to watch a monster movie, you may be thrilled by the second half but disappointed by the first half as it slightly drags. If you intend to watch a family drama, it may not be a great success as the relationships between the fathers and their kids can be further developed.<br/><br/>What surprises me most is that the children are perfectly cast. Joel Courtney is adorable and Elle Fanning, with her nuanced facial expressions, brings the audience one of the most engaging moments when her character acts as a detective's wife in a train station. While the two leads have a great chemistry, their friends are hilarious. It is also amusing to look at the adult world through the children's eyes. For instance, the kids act as a soldier, a zombie, a boss, etc. There is a thought provoking scene in which a boy's leg is injured because of a bomb explosion while the kids are still in costume and make-up. When the ""war"" becomes real, the kids are forced to grow up hastily. Indeed, Super 8 can be viewed as a coming-of-age comedy.<br/><br/>The movie emphasizes the importance of letting go. Make sure you stick around during the closing credits. This is probably the BEST part of the movie."
"IamInnocent2","8","3","15","8 June 2011"," Very well made
","To be honest I didn't know much about this movie going in and I'm glad I didn't. I didn't expect much either because I thought this was going to be a children's movie since it centers on the kids.<br/><br/>The kids are surprisingly well cast. They act like kids their age. Joel Courtney carries the movie well for a boy his age. The rest of the children are a great supporting cast.<br/><br/>If I had to complain about some of the performances it would be on some of the adults. At times the children seemed smarter than some of the ""grown-ups."" Kyle Chandler on the other hand was good, finally see him do some action.<br/><br/>The movie is very well made, very well written.

"critic_w","9","2","9","14 June 2011"," The Future of Filmmaking Hinges on THIS Movie!
","Movie lovers, we are at a crossroad, and nothing shy of the future of filmmaking hangs in the balance. Call me a forecaster of doom if you will, but ask the record-industry of the precarious point the movie industry now finds itself. In Super 8 we have a bridge to the future which hails from movie-making past; a connection to an open door of variety and comedy and emotion that we had better not be too dull to see, less we lose it forever.<br/><br/>Super 8 is more than just the excellent thrill ride that others have so adequately described in this forum. It's a break from the rut that the industry is slippery sliding its way into. A movie that actually delivers more than it's trailer promises. And one that rises above the super-trailer-formula-for-success that appears crucial to survive the increasingly difficult and competitive battle to claim your entertainment dollars.<br/><br/>In our times, and in a darkening future looming on the horizon, movies do not need a good story, they just have to have a great promotional trailer and solid first two weekends at the box office to cover the investment. Anything that can be sufficiently hyped qualifies as entertainment in that sad world. But Super 8 seeks to stem the tide. Not only did it eschew the wham-bam super-trailer--it was more curiosity invoking than anything else--but the strength move was in its story! With layers of intrigue and plot angle like you get from a first rate novel, it will stands up well on small screens, and works for adults and children alike. The great books that became movies in the 70s had that. The outstanding screenplays of the 50s had that. And if we have any sense at all, we'll rush out and see this movie in droves and encourage others to create great cinema. Movie-going is depending on you, GO!"

","SUPER 8! I went into this movie with big expectations and I have to say it didn't disappoint but I will say right off the bat though that the alien did disappoint me.<br/><br/>First off the alien. It looks like a mini version of the CLOVERFIELD monster. It's only like approx 20-Feet-Tall and is only shown at the end of the movie. Plus it picks up the main actor and then puts him down and leaves to go back to it's planet... What The F**k!<br/><br/>Secondly the movie. JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg created genius here! This movie is brilliantly scripted with a mix of horror, comedy and romance. Think THE GOONIES meets CLOVERFIELD. THE GOONIES as in the kids are the main actors. And CLOVERFIELD as in you don't really see the alien until the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Even though there are kids in this movie so you think it shouldn't be too bad. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TOO THIS! It even freaked me out at moments and I usually think horror movies are funny. If you want your kids to sleep at night don't let them see this.<br/><br/>Overall 8/10 GREAT MOVIE =)"

"Richie-67-485852","5","1","3","21 February 2020"," SUPER FLOP
","In all fairness this should be disclosed upfront i.e. its a kiddie movie. But then, it introduces other elements that enter in to the sci-fi fields and you have to ask yourself what does this movie want to be a kid or an adult? I am surprised to see this in the movie-making of today leading me to believe there are favors, secret agendas or tax write-offs behind the scenes for the reasons of this movie. Hollywood tried combining Cowboys and Aliens awhile back that not only flopped but confused the audience. Is this a cowboy movie or an outer space one? Something similar is going on here. Movies are made to target certain audiences. They can be broad in that targeting so as to capture a diverse audience of viewers therefore making more money or be of a specific genre and go with that success. Think: Godfather, Lord of the Rings, Aliens all standing on a specific subject. This movie doesn't hit what it is aiming for whatever that is. Furthermore, I have a dislike for movie-making that presents children or kids talking and acting like adults to serve as entertainment. It can work if innocence is presented accurately but then the movie plot would not be driven effectively unless we are doing a Shirley Temple movie or Lassie come home or any of the early Disney cinema. I walk away with this. Sometimes the rich and powerful do and say things because they can but that doesn't mean its good or real. Many a plot for flops have come from the friends, relatives and families of Hollywood moguls who say lets do that knowing it can be a write-off if it flops and memorable to those that had fun. Nelson Mandela movie was made to please the Mandela clan not movie goers as an example. If you are a kid and want to have your inner kid come out and movie watch go at it. Adults be prepared to yawn and fidget"

It reminds me of Monsters, another lower key scI-fi movie I really like. The train scene about twenty minutes into Super 8 is a blockbuster scene, so much so that I believe most movies wouldn't be able to keep the rest of the film from being anti-climactic. Usually a tremendous scene like that is saved for the end of a movie, but the plot required to be right where it was. But although the action and suspense ramps down a bit following it, the movie goes to work on building up the rest of the plot.<br/><br/>The young actors starring in this movie are great. They are smart and witty at times, but are clearly kids with kid behavior at other times, rather than miniature adults with adult lines. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie snuck its way into my 20 favorite movies ever list. You notice I said favorite, not best ever.

"Screen_Blitz","9","1","3","6 April 2017"," A dazzling science-fiction spectacle blooming with stunning special effects and enthralling Spielberg nostalgia
","J.J Abrams's Super 8 is not just a film that feasts the eyes with chord-striking special effects and visuals, it is also a love letter to the nostalgic days of Steven Spielberg classics such as'E.T: The Extra Terrestrial' and 'Close Encounters of The Third Kind'. This investment is greatly paid by the collaboration of visionary director Abrams and acclaimed Hollywood mogul Steven Spielberg who serves as the producer behind this summer spectacle. Channeling with both emotionally resonating storytelling and a powerful surplus of visuals that echoes the style of the aforementioned films, the influence of Spielberg's works definitely bleeds through. Although Abrams incorporates plenty of elements that defuse it's originality, it is difficult not to admire what a dazzling vision he delivers in this science-fiction piece. Set in 1979 in a fictional town of Lillian, Ohio, this film focuses on 14-year old Joe Lamb (played by Joel Courtney), a young lad coping with the loss of his mother who was killed in a train accident. With his relationship with his deputy father Jackson (played by Kyle Chandler) grown distant, Joe escapes his grief by filming monster movies with his friends Charles (played by Riley Griffiths), Cary (played by Ryan Lee), Martin (played by Gabriel Basso), and Preston (played by Zach Mills). Later joining the group is Alice Dainard (played by Elle Fanning) who's mother was also killed in the accident. While filming their Super 8 film at an abandoned train station, the children witness a horrific train crash that not devastates the train station, but leads to some unnatural events that begin to threaten the town.<br/><br/>The leverage of Steven Spielberg's classic works is greatly sprinkled throughout the picture, from the emotionally stimulating narrative, to the eye-striking scenery. Abrams and Spielberg both effectively captures the innocence of childhood through the story that not only echoes the vibrant atmosphere of 'E.T' but also their passion of filmmaking that grew on them as children. The premise follows the lead character as he escapes into a world of filmmaking in the wake of the tragedy that struck him and his father, and emotional tax it puts on their relationship serves as the emotional crux of the story. He ends up finding levity in making short films with his rag-tag team of friends who's fun in greatly disrupted by when a bombastic train crash, a scene that kicks off the movie's special effects mayhem. With train cars blowing up and crashing in every direction, this scene not only exhibits Abrams's astonishing talent for effects but sets the whole mystery plot in motion for the terrifying chaos that is about to come. As the story advances, chaos lurks throughout the picture, and Abrams successfully delivers a hodgepodge of suspense-ridden thrills and stimulating visuals that keeps the story moving. In the final act, which pays a heavy homage to one of Spielberg's most acclaimed films, Abrams's visionary style greatly pays off. While some may argue that the film towers nostalgia over substance and plot, it is hard to ignore the ambition that Abrams brings to the table. As for the performances, the young actors do a swell job in their roles as do the adults in their slightly more minor roles, none of which truly stand out. <br/><br/>Super 8 is a dazzling science-fiction spectacle that grips with exhilarating special effects, visual imagery, and an emotionally touching narrative that strikes at the heart. Most importantly, the film also makes an enthralling achievement at reminding people what it was like to be child. In conclusion, this cinematic achievement inspires hope for another Abrams/Spielberg collaboration."

","Here was a mildly entertaining movie about an alien getting loose in a small town. There is some bits about kids trying to make their own film and a huge train crash. They figure out there is an alien trying to get home who is misunderstood and they kind of befriend it. I really can't even remember any of the characters from this movie. It's kind of like Stranger Things with none of the interesting storytelling or likable characters. Which is to say, not nearly as good. In fact, I'd say Stranger Things does such a better job of honoring 80s Spielberg as to render this movie irrelevant. You don't get to see much of the alien. And I didn't find myself caring much about what any of the characters did. Hard pass."

","As I sat back in my chair, I could not help but return to a time of riding my BMX dirt bike, and being denied an opportunity to play Dungeons & Dragons with my older brothers. Super 8 hearkens back to a time where the imagination was not hindered by technology. This is a story of six middle school kids, making a horror flick within the backdrop of a small iron town in Ohio during the late seventies. The super 8 camera, these kids use to make their film, becomes the central character, that not only unites the kids, but captures the brooding antagonist, that eventually terrorizes this sleepy town.<br/><br/>Just watching this film, I could not help but to feel that I was a eight year old, transfixed as Elliot was whisked away with ET, or frightened as Carol Ann announced that ""They're Here"" in Poltergeist. The cinematography, acting, and pacing lets me know just how much of a protégé of Steven Spielberg, JJ Abrams truly is. It is refreshing to see a Summer blockbuster movie concentrate more on story, characters, and suspense more than special effects. Don't get me wrong, as an animator, I enjoyed the animation and realism of the foreboding creature. But the monster and the effects became a secondary piece to the film as a whole.<br/><br/>I think it's a wonderful change to revert to a style of film making, and even a period of time, where the imagination and creativity were king. When people inevitably become older, we always say that times were better when we were kids. In my biased opinion, I believe that applies to the style and story of this film. I just hope that the younger generations could unplug for a little while, and find at least some inspiration from this film."

","Hailing from early 80s cool and super exciting (and unfortunately long gone) aura, Super 8 is a nostalgic and fun movie which successfully merges the old and the new.<br/><br/>It is fun just not for the times, but for the type of film-making too. Obviously, there is an homage to producer Spielberg here, and even though there is that, the film is still it's own movie. It's a good original one from Mr. Abrams wrapped in touches to Spielberg and other films from that era, like E.T., Gremlins, Close Encounters of The Third Kind, and even Goonies. Lens reflections, story over spectacle and kids you instantly like, care for, and you want to see what happens to them. Back when kids were kids and they talked and acted like kids, just like those great films of the 80s. It was so refreshing to see this instead of the typical modern kids in movies who like so polished and like they just stepped off of the newest low rated TV show. These kids are from 1979, but I find them relatable and interesting. Really good storytelling, at least for me.<br/><br/>The love and detail Mr. Abrams puts into his scenes, characters, and era the film is set in, is so lovingly detailed. On the other hand, not everyone will enjoy Super 8. It has a broad appeal, but the tone and style won't appeal to everyone, probably most particularly those over the age of 60 and/or those not around in early 80s. Nevertheless, most viewers will find something to enjoy in it especially if they focus on the relationship between the characters and not the overall story.<br/><br/>8/10"

It takes you to a journey from the worst to the most compelling behaviors of Man. It tells you how good and how bad can we, humans, all be or become. The special effects are from another World. The music keeps you going and fits every one second. The acting, especially from the kids is impeccable, to say the least and so moving. The atmosphere is breathtaking at all times, there is not one dull moment in this movie. Everything flows so perfectly that it just gets you going on and on, you're dizzy, moved, scared, you're crying and smiling, you're amazed...At a certain point you get so involved in the movie that you realize you know everything about every one of these character's lives and you get surprisingly moved (""what's going one here!??"") by how every separate, but not that separate, story develops, you are THERE. You see yourself, and it gets you thinking, mirroring with your own actions, considering how you're going to live your tomorrow. A movie that *moves* you like that, is Cinema in all its splendor.<br/><br/>It is missing one only thing, one star. This director, he had to realize: the OST HAD to be ""The Suburbs"", by the Arcade Fire :)"

","I mean pls... what were the producers thinking when producing this movie ?? I mean this movie is for no more than 10 year old kids. Yes there were some good shots out there but come on there was nothing original.<br/><br/>It seemed like just another alien movie but with an utterly horrible ending. The alien plane crashed on earth and the scientist were able to capture the alien back then in 1963 but now after over a decade they are clueless on how to control it.. All the electromagnetic stuff and lights going out and dogs getting scared.. why didn't this happen when they first captured the alien and more importantly didn't the alien knew how to do this back then so that he could escape right then? Maybe not but in captivity of over 10 years he somehow gained the skills to do all this weird stuff. Come on who are you trying to kid? You cant just keep the logic out of a movie and try to fill it with some special effects.<br/><br/>The most stupid part was that of all the scientist only one of them realized that he needs to help the alien and so he sets up a plan to free the alien.. and what exactly is the brilliant plan ? A head on collision of a car with a speeding train.. And he is even able to do it. Bravo!! and most entertaining is the part when we see that the doctor is still alive after a head on collision with the train and the car which took the collision head on is not even much damaged... Explain me how!! And also explain me how a top notched scientist who was researching aliens chose to join an elementary school to teach kids?<br/><br/>Still manageable but the last 30 minutes or so of the movie were horribly insane. all the firing and the explosions looked so childish as if some fire crackers going off in a backyard. Kids running around in between these fireworks without fear. Please!!<br/><br/>Then as if this wasn't enough the kid, the one desperately in love with the chick somehow manages to communicate the with the angry alien convincing him that not everybody is bad and that he can go back to his planet. As if the alien was waiting for some earthlings' permission to go back. And more surprisingly the alien then remembers how to build a ship out of the scrap, which runs on air and flees from the earth. Oh! God can anything be as lame as this movie ??"

","***** REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS *****<br/><br/>DO NOT READ BELOW IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE SPOILERS<br/><br/>I had a big problem with the premise of the movie.<br/><br/>The alien just wanted us to give it its square ""blocks"" so it could build its ship and return to its home in outer space. <br/><br/>Without that, there would not have been all of this violence on Earth.<br/><br/>Neither would there have been a movie premise or a reason for me to waste two hours of my life watching this ridiculous movie.<br/><br/>In other words, if the military had done the reasonable thing and safe thing -- give the alien back its ship so it could stop the violence on Earth -- there wouldn't have been any premise for a movie. <br/><br/>Thus -- stupid movie, stupid premise, stupid waste of two hours of my life. <br/><br/>Who cares if the kids were cute and they were making a movie? J.J. Abrams bases it on a very flawed premise, then he stretches it out much longer than he should ever stretch such a thin plot, and thus he end up with a boring, disappointing movie.<br/><br/>It has creep factor, and great special effects, I'll give it that. Too bad he didn't do a better job with the basic premise and the plot."

","This movie was Spielberg's lame attempt to recapture the so-called magic of E.T. Difference is, this time the alien was very ugly and mean.<br/><br/>Just like with E.T,, the children in this movie all talked like sailors. Considering the language that was used, this probably an insult to sailors.<br/><br/>Just like with most of Spielberg's movies, not a functional, normal family was in sight. Spielberg seems to believe that ALL children are like this. Of course, some are. However, not anywhere near as bad as he tends to portray them.<br/><br/>Taking away the cuteness of ET and replacing it with a blood-thirsty alien, as well as a stereotypical blood-thirsty military contingent, took away what little was good about E.T. It made this movie just a shell.<br/><br/>You wound up not caring about the creature, the children, heroes or the town itself.<br/><br/>E.T.! Please, go home for good."

","Happily I bounced out to buy this one after seeing such a high rating on here, but I am sorry to say, I was vastly disappointed! its my guess that there are a heck of a lot of under 16's on here! This is quite simply a Children's adventure film, on a par with Goonies. Also the very fashionable ""loud bangs"" and too quiet dialogue is very annoying. Do they put these in on purpose to wake folks up when they are so bored they are dropping off to sleep? The plot is weak, in my opinion, and there is nothing of interest in this that Mr Spielberg has not already done before. This is just old hat to us adults...the only thing that was pleasant is the use of ELO's ""dont bring me down"" in the movie. Never heard of it?? Ask your grandparents hehehe.. This should be billed as a children's/family adventure movie ONLY. Perfect rubbish that will no dought be aired next Christmas Day! But if your an adult looking for serious adventure/Sci Fi/fantasy...well avoid this cods-wallop like the plague!"

","Of course it would be unfair to compare it with Goonies (a true classic). Still the comparisons can be made. But it's only part of the fun. The movie is a mix of two ideas as Abrams has stated himself. He had his idea (kids filming with a Super 8 camera as homage) and mixed it with another idea he found. I won't say what for those who actually haven't heard about it and do not want to spoil their surprise.<br/><br/>Having said that, the kid actors (Dakota Fannings sister is in it) are mostly newcomers, with about half of them making their debut in this very film. If you consider this, they are naturals and everyone is very good at what they're doing. Cinematography and effects are great. If you could fault something, it could be the unbalanced story. Is it for kids or maybe more for adults? Still this might be nit-picking, the fact is, that this is a great movie to enjoy"
"sraines321","10","1","3","3 January 2012"," A Gem in a Coal Mine, Anyone who does not like this should grow up!
","Sorry for being so harsh, but this film should be rated R for mature audiences only. Why? Not for content, but for target marketing. This film is not for lazy bucket-heads (again, sorry for being so harsh) who watch movies like transformers 2 or Final Destination, and think it is cinematic masterpiece. This is a family movie! This (even being a monster movie) contains moments that Destination fans call ""cheesy"". Destination movies do one thing right, what George Meleis designed films to do, take your mind, and inflict it with emotions. A movie's greatness is determined by how much it changes and/or forces emotions. Final Destination does this with fear, but Super 8 does it with way more that Gory shots (there is ONE in the feature) but does it with scenes that are so emotional that it seems to reach out and whack your brain, (Michael's score helps allot with this). These scenes are what make Destination fan's feel it is cheesy. So if you are a Destination fan, DO NOT RATE THIS MOVIE!!! It was not made for you, it was made for human beings. (Again, sorry for being so harsh) <br/><br/>Also Spielberg fans are enraged that Steven put his name on this one. People are complaining that it is EXACTLY like his old films, well this is a quote from the good man: ""This isn't a Spielberg movie, this is an Abrams movie, his past films are all not fully his, but this is, he is just unleashing his creativity that happens to be allot like mine"" THAT WAS BY STEVEN Spielberg!!! This is JJ ABRAMS movie, so if you don't want to see a movie that is LIKE a Spielberg Don't WATCH OR RATE THIS MOVIE! IT IS NOT FOR YOU!!! This movie is truly a gem, and in a world full of coal it is an ease on the mind JJ Abrams knew this, and so did Steven, that's why they made it."

","I cannot believe I waited this long to finally seen J.J. Abram's Super 8. <br/><br/>The film brings to mind all of those classic sci-fi kids' films that are built upon mystery. It has so many things going for it. It has mystery, but it also has a real connection with its audience. I was fully connected with the characters, and the action sequences were amazing (the highlight being the train wreck in the beginning). This feels through and through like a film Spielberg would have made two decades ago. <br/><br/>I also want to talk about the great performances from the kids. Seriously, they drive the plot. I want to specifically talk about Joel Courtney. He expresses so much with his performance so subtly. Not once did he feel awkward. He was able to give a very professional performance full of feeling. <br/><br/>Like I said, Super 8 also brings back the nostalgia from when we were kids. Many films have tried to do this, but in all honesty, I don't remember any recent film that has succeeded quite like this. Super 8 is a charming, very entertaining, and completely satisfying science-fiction film that is sure to stay among the 10 best of the year."

","This movie recycles E.T., Deep Impact, and the Goonies, and probably a half a dozen other movies. This movie is a money-burning exercise. Only in a Spielberg production would a train explode like it is being propelled by a rocket. Hey Steve, when a train goes off the track, it quickly drags to a stop. It doesn't throw refrigerator-size items into the air for five minutes. The dialogue in this movie is wooden and cutesy. These silly boys talk about the darnest things! Aren't they funny (not)! The actor who played Martin is the worst actor I have seen in a while. Is he maybe the son of a friend of the director? Just asking. The creature is never really shown very well. His motivations make no sense. The military is portrayed as a sadistic entity. The hero is a zero. His dad is a zero. The ending is a 00."
"KQ6QY","4","1","3","26 November 2011"," Derivative and annoying
","Take a half-dozen early Spielberg films, throw them in a blender, and out pops ""Super 8"". I also must mention J.J. Abrams apparent continuing obsession with lens flares. Not quite as bad as in ""Star Trek"", but unnecessary, distracting, and annoying, especially in the night scenes at the beginning of the film. I was looking forward to seeing this movie based on the trailers, and I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie turned out to be the completed amateur zombie movie shown over the end credits. If J.J. Abrams had made the making of this movie the focus of the film, it would have made for much better entertainment. Minus the lens flares, of course."
"jbe-6","Null","1","3","3 November 2011"," The Harry Potter kids could learn from this...
","This movie has Steven Spielberg written all over it. The camera angles, the set-ups, the kids' acting, the baseball bat being thumped on the table, the electricity cables, the era, the adults, the bikes, the alien, the gang of kids... I could go on.<br/><br/>J. J. Abrams has crafted an homage to American popular cinema of the late 70s and early 80s. Yet it's no pastiche. The pace, the relationships between the kids and tight direction and editing make this a very enjoyable film in its own right. I loved it, and so did my kids.<br/><br/>For me the best things about this movie are the young kids in it. Their talents are amazing. There's no way that these kids are in front of a camera, acting. They're real live people and they never falter. The scene where Elle Fanning tries her acting skills at the impromptu railway shoot is just stunning. In fact, when I recently saw the final Harry Potter film again I was struck by how wooden the three main characters are. They just can't do it. As a Brit I would go as far as to say that the large majority of British movies that have kids in them are usually very lame in comparison to American movies. We just don't know how to direct kids here. There have been notable exceptions of course, but generally we suck.<br/><br/>Super 8 is predictable and very mainstream in its conception. But it's popular film making at it's very best and keeps you entertained from start to finish.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend it to those wanting to see a good family action movie."

","I read comments here before watching this movie so I went in with an open mind expecting maybe to be disappointed a bit. After seeing the movie I fail to understand the really negative scores and remarks? I have seen people here say that would give it a zero out of 10 if possible, this is just nonsense! It has a good story, even though we have seen this story before, which can be said for most movies today. I would assume that some of these people people who gave this movie a one out of ten probably gave the new star trek movie a nine out of ten, even though that was a remake. I enjoyed the young actors acting, their ribbing of each other and the plot twists. There are few moments in the movie that made my wife jump with fright, so thats always good ;-) A group of kids making a zombie movie for a competition witness a train crash, the Airforce rocks up, all hush hush, strange stuff starts to happen, big climatic ending. I can say after seeing thousands of movies over my 45 years that this was a good movie and certainly no waste of time. Production quality was very good, as mentioned the kids acting was very good, the story was very good.<br/><br/>The problem here is many people expect every movie they see to be some brand new idea, that is just not possible. Any movie today can be compared to some movie from the past, remakes can be judged against the original but movies that have some similarities cannot be compared one on one with some great big hit movie from years ago.<br/><br/>Lets face it, if we stopped watching movies because something similar has been done before then we would probably only see one movie produced worldwide every five years. If some people here don't like seeing movies with similar plot lines then perhaps there should never have been any science fiction movies made after the movie ""2001"". No maniac truck movies after ""DUEL"", no danger in the oceans movies after ""JAWS"", No slasher movies after ""FRIDAY THE 13TH"", and how about no gangster movies after ""WHIITE HEAT"" with James Cagney ! Its just stupidity to suggest every movie released must be an Earth Shattering new idea, its just not possible.<br/><br/>What do I look for in a movie ? To be entertained for 90 minutes or more, did SUPER 8 entertain me? Yes it did, Would I recommend it to family and friends ? Yes I would. Do I recommend this movie to you? Yes I do, its a good movie."

Every review I have read has nitpicked this movie to death. ""DUH! It is just ripping off E.T."" or ""ITS GOONIES WITH ALIENS!"" Personally, I never liked Goonies. There, I said it. Suck it. Super 8 is a great film. It reminds us of a time when movies were bold and fun. Enjoy it and stop acting like it is the Satan of movies. Seriously, a 1 out of 10 people? It isn't perfect, obviously! The alien could've been explored more and maybe the movie could've explored some of the minor characters a bit more, but it was great. Is it a classic? Probably not! A great movie? Hell yeah. It was fun and entertaining. We have been spoiled by so many sequels and reboots, why not enjoy Super 8 for what it is instead of moaning about it? 9 out of 10!"

","A group of friends consisting of kids of about 12 years old works together to make a film. Using a Super 8 camera and whatever scenery they can find they attempt to put together their master piece so that they can send it in for a competition of sorts. Things get really interesting for them when they see something they shouldn't have seen during one of their sessions.<br/><br/>And so the story rolls. Story wise this one isn't exceptional. It begins with people being at the wrong place at the wrong time and from that point on being the unwilling victim of sworn secrecy. Most of the things that happen make some kind of sense and that makes the story good enough.<br/><br/>The way it is played out, carried on the shoulders of the children, is cool. Their way of acting is both natural and designed and this works wonders, especially as part of the film hinges on them making a film themselves so there's plenty of acting to be acting so to speak. Most of the adults feel to be at their place too.<br/><br/>The first thing I was reminded of when seeing this film was The Goonies, a feeling that never went away during the rest of the film. That film had the same kind of touch to it, but it's a good touch so nothing lost there.<br/><br/>All in all, surely worth a watch, even though it's based on a story that is a little too overused 7 out of 10 shots in the dark"
"michaeltdowling","10","1","3","13 August 2011"," Can't see what everyone's complaining about....
","I went to see this movie somewhat nervously, as I had been looking forward to it for a while but the recent reviews from this site proclaimed it to be - well - terrible.<br/><br/>I came out of the cinema amazed. The movie was incredible, with well written dialogue between the teenagers, and a marvellous realistic recreation of the 70s. The teenage cast was well chosen as well - they were appealingly not very photogenic (save the lead boy and girl) and their interactions were suitably childish, notably a scene in a diner where there are about two lines that drive the story onward and otherwise just bickering, a refreshingly honest depiction of teenagers.<br/><br/>And while I was worried that the death of the main character's mother was going to be handled cheesily (which was true on occasion) it simply became part of the backdrop, as did the monster, and the army for the most part.<br/><br/>I think the main problem people have when coming to see this is expecting it to be a groundbreaking new sci-fi horror movie with a completely original plot. Given that when you break things down there are only about five different plots in the history of storytelling, this is a little unreasonable, but it's also not what the movie is. The movie is basically a movie about movie-making, and about being a kid in the 70s. The monster is really just window-dressing, as is shown by the fact that we don't get a pointless 'money-shot' reveal of it ever, with us lingering on it more than is really necessary.<br/><br/>So, if you want Cloverfield 2, this ain't your movie. If you want Explorers 2, please watch."

The lines are punchy, full of youthful exhuberance and child-like wit and the setting is so brilliantly painted that you could be excused from thinking you were there.<br/><br/>Abrams set out to make a ""creature feature"" or B-Movie homage and hit the nail on the head.

HATE! when directors give every joke or action clip away in the previews. J.J Abraham's knew that, his movie was too good for that. Also i love the time frame he placed it in! using a Super 8 camera was genius! also its more believable that this could go on in the past and not the future. Now a days we have cell phones and over protective parents and it just would not have been believable. In my sixteen years (don't disregard my opinion because of my age, i'm no twilight die-hard) i have seen a number of movies with monsters and i feel that every single type of alien has been done and overrated and that his monster was just going to be another smiley alien with tentacles and super technology. But no, he took a different approach. I thought the fact that no one noticed the gigantic hole in the cemetery shed was a tad unrealistic, although the creature could have killed everyone who came across this. But it does make sense that the animal would live underground because where else would a huge alien hide?

"dsa_ca","10","1","3","17 July 2011"," Renewed Memories
","Moments are captured and touch our heart. They can be as banal and nostalgic as a human touch or remembering your closed one, but if captured in an emotive manner would reflect accurately with the audience mood and emotions. For such emotions we have our usual critics, who would make a movie look like some rehash trying to cash in on audience nostalgia. But they are wrong this time around. To discard this summer's big movie ticket 'Super 8' as 'E.T on steroids' or some others gag insults is plain ignorance and bias to their own false sense of nostalgia and pride for those eighties memorable Spielberg movies. The movie that takes its audience back in the seventies along with memories of E.T, Close Encounter of the third kind and Goonies surely was lapped up by the young audience of eighties over the past few weeks, but was also appreciated by the new generation.<br/><br/>Mr. JJ Abrams latest monster thriller (with a pretty similar looking monster from Cloverfield) takes you back to the seventies small town America, where a recent work place tragedy has unsettled the family equations of a father son duo. The work place tragedy takes the life of Joe Lamb's mother (Joel Courtney), which complicates his relation with his very seventies Hollywood father Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) who is the town deputy sheriff. Joe has a healthy bunch of friends that adds a certain childish charm to the movie. <br/><br/>As the summer vacation starts, Joe begins to dedicate his entire summer holidays to help finish a short zombie movie that is being made by his friend Charles. His excitement about the movie grows further with the involvement of Alice (Elle Fanning), though his father is excited neither about him wasting his summer making monster movies or his friendship with Alice.<br/><br/>During their first night of shooting with Alice at the local railway station, the zombie movie takes a turn for something very grim and real, as a military train is deliberately derailed by the local school professor. As Joe and his friends run for their lives they live the super 8 cameras and equipment stranded at the destroyed station. As they flee from the scene of tragedy they gather their equipment before the military arrives. Flustered and scared by the whole event they decide to not speak about it to anyone. <br/><br/>As the news of the crash spreads Jackson tries to find out what was in the cargo that was derailed, but the military personal do not let any details known to him during his visit. But soon the deputy realizes the town has a much bigger problem than the crash train to deal with, as the town witnesses' sudden disappearance of electrical appliances along with human's vanishing.<br/><br/>As the paranoia about the events related to the crash spreads over the town, the deputy takes the matter into his own hand and tries to know more about the crash through intercepting military frequencies. Through the military intercepts Jackson uncovers that the armed forces are planning to begin operation 'Walking Distance' inside their town Lillian. What he does not realize is that the military is ready to go at any extent to keep their motives secret and hence further pays the prize.<br/><br/>While the military is busy finding their lost asset before the locals find out, Joe and his friends use the chaotic scenes around the town as production values for their movie. As their movie shoot progresses there is a blooming romance between Joe and Alice that has stern opposition of their respective father, due to the families entangled past related to the death of Joe's mother.<br/><br/>While all emotional drama is being played out, the military's biggest secret, the alien monster is on the loose and the military is finding it difficult to trace and capture him. While the alien is nowhere to be seen by anyone, Joe and Charles have the Super 8 camera that has captured the footage from the accident that will uncover the mystery surrounding the train accident. The search and the eventual rescue of the alien by Joe and his friends becomes a joyride that was not witnessed by this generation on the silver screen. <br/><br/>Super 8, time after time give a shout out to its inspiration i.e. 'E.T' and 'Close Encounter of the Third Kind', something that will be appreciated by the fans of those movies. But what truly strikes a chord with the audience is the emotional relation Joe has with his Mother which Mr. Abrams successfully binds with the film's final conclusion. <br/><br/>The maker uses all the clichés available to spike the emotions around the drama and succeeds to avoid and possible trappings. The music is another high note that is used passionately around the evolving scenes. Super 8 has successfully recreated the magic of the seventies and has given further impetus to Spielberg's brand of movies."

I hope to see more movies like this in the future."
"pmc127","10","1","3","8 July 2011"," An EXCELLENT throwback, a touching drama, and the best summer blockbuster in YEARS.
","Let me start by saying that I ADORED Super 8. I assume you know the basic plot. When I saw Iron Man 2 last year, the teaser played,and that's just what it did - it teased. And it did it brilliantly. I don't think there was anyone who wasn't intrigued. The next few trailers, I must say, diminished my interest. I learned it was starring kids, which made me think it was going to be excessively juvenile. Looking at reviews before the movie, my hopes lowered once again because the reviews weren't uniformly positive as I wanted them to be. I saw this movie nonetheless on the Saturday after it came out. <br/><br/>Wow. What a surprise. <br/><br/>First, let me say that the best part of this movie wasn't the action. It wasn't the comedy (well, partly). It was actually the kids! Overall, the movie is phenomenally acted, and the kids are the best actors. In 95% of movies I've seen, the kids are the worst actors and often bring movies down (The Phantom Menace). However, the kids were great All of them have their moments, and you will discover that you can relate to at least one of them. There are 6 kids. The main kid, Joe, played by newcomer Joel Cortney, moves the story along nicely and he is very believable. The boy who plays Charles (the fat kid), Riley Griffiths (I think), is the funniest character and is great as well. However, the best actor in the whole movie is Elle Fanning (Dakota's sister). EASILY. She was so good! What a talented family! She is a beautiful young girl and she plays Alice, Joe's crush. She's kind of naughty and has a troubled family life. She and Joel have EXCELLENT chemistry. Look up the zombie scene. I, being young and male, actually have a bit of a crush on Elle because of this movie! Also, the kids work so well together, and, best of all, act like actual kids. My friends and I do this. ALL the time! The diner scene in particular stands out for me. They nail the comedic timing really well, also. This movie is partly meant to be an homage to Spielberg movies of the 70's and 80's, and it succeeds so well, and the main reason is the kids. <br/><br/>Next, the plot. There are essentially 4 plots in this movie - the alien, Joe's relationship with his father, who is a policeman and trying to solve the alien mystery, Joe's and Alice's father's ""disagreement,"" and Joe's relationship with Alice. The kid's experience making the movie involves all 4 of these. Since I'm about a year older than most of these kids, and don't have a troubled relationship with my dad, the one I related to the most was Joe and Alice. They do have some touching moments together (again, the zombie scene). The other ones I was invested in greatly, and they did interest me. <br/><br/>Finally, the action. This being my first J.J. Abrams movie, I didn't really know what his style was. However, he did not disappoint. The train scene is extremely intense, really cool, and also really loud. Coolest scene (not necessarily the best). There are quite a few jump scares, but they are fun instead of annoying. Since this is a throwback to the Spielbergian movies of the 70's and 80's, there are some homages to many famous movies which I noticed on my second viewing. The special effects are great. This movie stands out to me because it is an original story that isn't super special effects-heavy. Most movies that currently are qualified as summer blockbusters are extremely special effects-heavy and, well, that's it. This being said, though the special effects and action scenes aren't what make this movie, this movie, especially in the last 30-45 minutes, is so THRILLING. My goodness. The train scene in particular - good job, Abrams. I was still excited an hour after leaving the theater. <br/><br/>After all that being said, is the movie perfect? (sigh) No. There is some slightly cliché humor. You know when the characters think someone is dead, and the person they think is dead is really alive and walks up behind them, and everyone's like ""Oh, you're alive!"" (Indy 3) I hate that, and there is one. Also, something very similar to that happens RIGHT AFTERWARD. Ugh. Thankfully, it moves on, and you forget about it. Also, there's one scene with Joe when he is told big information that could possibly change how he views a certain character, and he doesn't really do anything. What? Now, if I'm talking about flaws, I have to talk about the ending. Everyone else is. Yes, it's kind of cheesy. However, I thought it wrapped up 2 of the plot lines really nicely, and it showed Joe's emotional arc with his dead mother come full circle . It is still kind of cheesy. <br/><br/>However, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. It's awesome. To everyone who is calling this movie unoriginal, that's like calling Indy 1 unoriginal because it copies serials of the 30's too much. It not trying to be mindblowingly original. Yes, it has many homages, and many of the themes and ideas are Spielberg-esque, but I'm pretty sure there aren't any movies like this. This movie succeeds on so many levels. The reason that I think people are saying it doesn't live up to the hype is that they didn't know what to expect. People are saying that this movie is boring and slow. No, it's not, if you know what you're getting into. (Not hating on anyone in particular. I do respect other people's opinions) Best movie of '11 so far. Though I may change my mind in the future, I still give Super 8 an extremely high rating.<br/><br/>They don't make 'em like they used to. Well, they do, with Super 8.<br/><br/>9.6/10<br/><br/>Stay during the credits."
"jmythstone","10","1","3","6 July 2011"," Great Film
","This movie had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. I kept wondering what was going to happen next. I really connected with the characters. When they were sad, I felt sad. When they were happy, I felt happy. Spielberg took many elements from E.T. and put it into this movie. It has a great moral, funny lines, frightening scenes, and a lot of excitement. I highly recommend this to any comedy, horror, science fiction, and Steven Spielberg fans. It takes place in the late 70's, so a lot of adults from that time can really connect with with the pop culture that took place in that time. Also, teenagers can relate with the kids in the movie, because the kids face similar problems that teenagers deal with. Besides the fact of being chased by a scary alien. This movie is great for ages 12 and up. Please take the time and see this movie. The Abrams and Spielberg team work great. And they did a great job in making this film awesome."
"moviemavens","9","1","3","29 June 2011"," ***The E.T. of the 21st century... spellbindingly super*** http://themoviemaven.posterous.com
","The ""E.T."" of the 21st century.<br/><br/>Growing up overseas, I never saw the original ""E.T."" But I had the pleasure of seeing the 2002's remake. ""Super 8"" is a reminiscence of that, with a homage to ""Jurassic Park."" I saw it a couple of weeks ago, but due to a variety of factors, I wasn't able to write a review around that time. It may not be an instant classic, but ""Super 8"" has a magical quality. It stays fresh in my mind as one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>If you're not a fan of ""Cloverfield,"" fear not, ""Super 8"" is nothing like the shaky docu-style film. While both share the director, J.J. Abrams, that's where the similarity stops. It's also worlds beyond Spielberg's own ""War of the Worlds"" (starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning). Inspired by Spielberg (acting as producer here), ""Super 8"" has all the footprints of an old-fashioned kids' adventure, family movie.<br/><br/>Set in 1979 Ohio, the story opens with several kids (Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, Riley Griffiths, Ryan Lee, Zach Mills, Gabriel Basso), filming an amateur movie with a Super 8 camera in front of an old train station. They witness and survive the impact of a horrifically breathtaking freight train crash, which is derailed by a pick-up truck driven by a familiar face. Almost immediately the U.S. Air Force (led by Noah Emmerich) swarm in and sweep around the area, recovering tons of small white-cubed materials from the train. They continually roam around and even set up makeshift camps in town.<br/><br/>Not long after the town begins to experience strange occurrences. Pets running and found many miles away, people mysteriously disappearing, pools of blood streaming through, random power outage, electrical interference, neighborhood posts destroyed, loud scary noises in the dark. And during the Cold War era, suspicion gravitates toward the Soviet Union. Little did they know that something far sinister lurks in the background, threatening the lives of everyone. A pandora box has been opened.<br/><br/>The filmmakers did a super job in keeping ""Super 8"" under wrap and thus raises the ""shock and awe"" value. ""Super 8"" is a throwback to a nostalgic era - rotary telephone, walkman, camera film - filled with memories of childhood friendships and the wonders of exploration and discovery about the world. The kids are the true stars here. Relatively unknown, they're a talented bunch. Ellen Fanning is especially stunning. The natural interconnectedness yet underscored by distinct personalities create an authentic innocence and camaraderie.<br/><br/>The strength of ""Super 8"" lies in the execution. It's executed exceptionally well that every moment is precious... The ambiance is just right that you could literally feel the chill in the air. With spectacular cinematography, special effects, sound editing, it's tense and thrilling.<br/><br/>And the story is the draw. It's purely poignant, sweet and funny. It's a story about a boy's grief, coping with the loss of his mother, and dealing with his overprotective father and the town's sheriff (Kyle Chandler). It's also a coming-of-age story, interlinked with genuine interactions among friends.<br/><br/>Perfectly paced, the suspense builds gradually and keeps its momentum until its heartwarming ending. Stay through the closing credits roll for a special treat. ""Super 8"" is spellbindingly super.<br/><br/>The MovieMaven (http://themoviemaven.posterous.com)"
"www-facebookalex-com","10","1","3","29 June 2011"," Near one of the best movies I have seen
","Super 8 is an instant classic I saw super 8 expecting a scary sci-fi movie but when i saw it it was more than a sci-fi and scary movie it was a buildup of a comedy sci-fi reminders of the school days in the 70's and 80's i would totally recommend this to anyone who loves movies and especially classics!<br/><br/>******SPOILER******* The end credits shows the finished Super 8 zombie movie and during the film Charles is using a Super 8 camera and film to make a Zombie movie for a contest and I really enjoyed all the cheesy effects that were used and the movie would not be the same without the super 8 filming. I will savor the memory that was given in the super 8 zombie movie for years to come!"
"dissendiums","8","1","3","26 June 2011"," Wonderful film that focuses on character development rather than simply action
","I'll keep it brief - I am not a huge fan of monster movies, but I caved in to seeing Super 8 and I absolutely fell in love with it. It was fun, witty, charming, suspenseful, and genuine, and as a potential film maker I found it great that Abrams included the depth in the characters as he did. I gave it an 8 out of 10 due to some slight inconsistencies which left me a little confused when I thought back to the plot after I had seen the movie, but I still found it fun and heartfelt. As I saw another reviewer say, I also felt as if the monster aspect was a subplot and the actual focus was on the development of the kids and their home lives and the struggles of growing up in their situation while the world (literally) crumbled around them. Great performances from the kids especially, was surprised to see that it was the first acting gig ever for Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths -- they were great! Elle Fanning was spectacular and I am looking forward to seeing all of them grow up and do more films. Yes, the ending was corny, but I felt it was somewhat appropriate for an otherwise serious movie. To those that feel the need to nitpick and whine about a fun summer movie such as this, I feel sorry for your inability to sit back and enjoy a fun flick! Stand By Me meets Transformers meets ET meets The Sandlot meets Cloverfield. Give Super 8 a shot if you're looking for a good time!"
"neenahhh","7","1","3","26 June 2011"," Lack of backstory and plot development was the downfall of this movie
","While watching ""Super 8"", I found that I was really enjoying myself. The actors were great. They were all young kids and had a lot of talent. I think that many of my favorite scenes in the movie were scenes where it had the all of them, just interacting. I felt like they were just a normal group of friends who got caught up in this whole whirlwind of events. They acted like any young teenagers. The actors made this movie.<br/><br/>After the movie ended, I still kept thinking that it was great. It was only after time had passed and the adrenaline set in, when I began realizing that this movie wasn't perfect. Not at all.<br/><br/>""Super 8"" really lacked a good backstory. For example, (SPOILERS:) in the beginning of the movie, we see a young boy mourning over the death of his mother, Elizabeth. Pretty quickly after, we see the boy's father arresting a blond man. Later on, we learn that the blond man was the guy who was sort of responsible for Elizabeth's death. (/SPOILERS) I kept waiting for more explanation on this event. How did it happen? What were their jobs? But I got no explanation. That sucked.<br/><br/>But the real downfall of the movie was the ending. Aside from some questions that were left unanswered (see example above), the movie was pretty great. The acting was very good, the dialogue was witty and smart and the whole atmosphere was just fit for the movie. The buildup to the climax of the movie was brilliant. I was really interested in it. But the ending really disappointed me. These were some questions that I had after the movie: (SPOILERS:) Why didn't the alien kill the humans? What was it keeping them around for? Why didn't the alien just build a spaceship already once it was free? Did it have to wait for someone's approval and/or encouragement? (/SPOILERS) Those things really bothered me.<br/><br/>""Super 8"" is a pretty good film. Disregarding the plot holes, it's a very interesting movie. It's not the best science-fiction movie out there, but it's good. If you had to choose between ""Green Lantern"" or this one, go with ""Super 8"".<br/><br/>Viewed on: June 26, 2011"
"jjankel123","6","1","3","26 June 2011"," Maybe it was just me but what is the point of this movie?
","When i walked out of the cinema with my dad and brother i have to admit i was a little confused. They both thoroughly enjoyed the movie but i found it a little pointless. <br/><br/>To begin i would say the acting in the movie was very good for young child actors, and i really enjoyed that aspect of the movie. Furthermore the graphics were UNBELIEVABLE as we have come to expect from proper producers like Spielberg the graphics were incredible, and the derailing of the train early on in the movie is one of the best destruction scenes ever. <br/><br/>the relationships between the two families of the lead girl and lead boy were very shallow, didn't build that connection nearly enough left loving hug and make up at the end seem a little redundant.<br/><br/>What was the morale of the movie? i generally like movies that don't fall into the 'boy meats girl' or 'chosen one' category but in this case i simply couldn't work out what the movie was trying to say apart from maybe don't judge a book by its cover.<br/><br/>Definite throwback to Spielberg classics such as E.T where the alien always turns out to be just a little unloved and misunderstood. Also the constant repetition of the Spielberg/ Michael bay Esque technique of having quiet and then a huge explosion of noise got quite annoying by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>So i would say that it wasn't a bad movie but these problems infuriated me into not really thoroughly enjoying it, in any case i think that a rating of 8/10 is a little high for this movie. However i would advise seeing this movie.<br/><br/>BTW i know Spielberg only produced this movie and didn't direct it"
"cedddelage","Null","1","3","25 June 2011"," Awww What a surprising boring movie
","I really do not understand why People give good reviews for this movie,After Star Trek I was really expecting a good movie from this director,but I was wrong,Really really wrong on that one. The acting is really bad,the story just makes no sens at all,script is really awful ,the music is not great either,I just didn't see a good point in this movie. This is a total director failure. The Monster looks just like the one from cloverfield,the love story was real bad,the evolution of the characters are just ridiculously rushed, I think JJ abrams just tried too much to make a big new E.T Movie type with deep characters and story,the movie turned out to be a joke. The worst thing of all I think it's that you only see the monster 3 or 4 minutes and the end is just as awful as the acting in this movie. Really if you're interested in seeing this movie because you think is going to be a kickass alien movie,well you're totally wrong as I was before seeing it.Do not waste money for such a lame movie,DO NOT trust IMDb rating on that movie."
"mistarkus","3","1","3","23 June 2011"," No Wonder and No Charm
","Overall has the feel of the run-of-the-mill disaster movie with a mindless story and corny special effects. The makers failed to recreate the intended retro/sci-fi speilbergesque feel.<br/><br/>The main reason was the awful story created that had tremendous holes and things that don't make sense even for something that isn't realistic. It didn't stick to anything as the movies it was trying to recreate did. The old Spielberg movies stuck to a unique premise with a wondrous charm and fun sense of adventure. Premises such as interesting children's adventure saga, a huge Shark, dinosaurs or some mysterious aliens is what made you want to go the movies. These premises were unique at the time, fun and had tons of heart. Super 8 on the other hand tried to throw everything in there, all the Spielberg premises ultimately creating nothing. It was just a special effects movie centered around a nonsensical story with a few of Spielberg's old techniques thrown in and none of his heart.<br/><br/>Frequently there were those annoying (and in this case gratuitous) ""jolting awake"" moments occurring from a span of quietness followed by something drastic happening that created a sudden loud bang.<br/><br/>The children trying to make a movie were mildly cute but it lacked intrigued because that aspect didn't get into enough depth since it had to go into the more boring, corny over the top special effect areas. The ending got absolutely ridiculous even for something that is fantasy/sci-fi."
"optionsf","5","1","3","23 June 2011"," Lather, Rinse, Repeat
","ET, Close Encounters and Jaws were some of my favorite movies growing up, and as a child in the suburbs my friends and I made Super 8 movies to relieve our boredom too! So I loved the nostalgia in the movie and had great expectations. But like everything else about this film, the nostalgic bits were just formula, tossed in as just another recipe element, stirred and baked with no thought to what was actually being cooked.<br/><br/>Having just visited Universal Studios and done the back lot tour for the umpteenth time, I was reminded of the tricks to make War of the Worlds, Jaws, Jurrasic Park and others which are simply repeated here. Others have reviewed the detailed examples, so no need to repeat here. I felt like I was on the back lot rather than seeing an original film.<br/><br/>I felt as though the idea of the film was ""more was better"". I LOVED JJ Abrams' Star Trek where the light flares were original but in this film they were gratuitous and didn't make sense. I LOVED ET where the clever kids help ET to go home, but here when the kid finally confronts the alien it just seemed like I was watching a repeat, there was no climactic element to the scene. Then in the next scene, after ending up in a dead end with no escape, rather than showing an exciting way to escape from the alien's tunnel, the kids are back up in the town with no explanation. The alien was that stupid? ""Sure, kids, take off since you are so cute!"" After 30 years in captivity? Right.<br/><br/>If you're 12 years old and haven't seen Spielberg's films this will be very likable. For everyone else, it's lather, rinse, repeat. Too bad."

I've seen this before. <br/><br/>It does nothing new with the material it references. This well made homage seems more like a big jerk off circle.<br/><br/>I enjoyed watching this, but I don't know why it needed to be made."
"Mikeboy0001","6","1","3","21 June 2011"," Huge Disappointment
","One thing is to create a good story which JJ clearly can do, another is to direct and make good movies out of them. I always thought MI3 sucked, just like MI1 and MI2 for that matter. So, when Star Trek came out, it was a good surprise to me, and started to consider JJ a director I should pay more attention to. Now, he made a dull, flat movie again, where even the story is empty, and don't know what to think of him again. The similarities with Spielberg exist, but only with the modern one, that in the last decade only managed to make half decent movies (except Munich, which is good), and not the 80's Spielberg, that would leave us in magic and wonder in almost every scene. I can't understand how it got such a high score at IMDb. Hope JJ does better next time"

","I just watched ET, Jaws, Jurassic Park, The Goonies, Poltergeist, War of the Worlds, Close Encounters and Cloverfield mashed into one frolicking fun ride. <br/><br/>And that's no bad thing at all. Yes it's flawed by giant gaping character and story holes, but it's so nostalgically framed, the kids' acting is so good and the references unashamed, why not enjoy it? At the end of the day it hit the notes it's not hiding from aiming for, and unlike so many films today took me back to a place I'd rather be. Any film in which you could pause almost any frame and get a classic movie photo has to be worth something. Yes, I even fell for the over use of lens flares - pure eye candy and a step aside from video game CGI.<br/><br/>Great fun, take it on face value, and go take some photos with Hipstamatic to get in the mood!

"abecipriano","9","1","3","21 June 2011"," Excellent Story, although...
","I've been a fan of JJ Abrams for a while now, since his Mission Impossible 3 revitalized the franchise from the slow-mo,dove-flying movie made by John Woo in MI:2, and his 2009 rendition of Star Trek.<br/><br/>This was his own story, not a sequel nor a reboot... and I have to say that this was a most excellent story with fantastic acting by the top two actors, Joel Courtney (Joe) and Elle Fanning (Alice), both of whom are children; they're well supported by Joe's best friend, Charles (Riley Griffiths) and Cary, Martin and Preston. Adult acting, though supporting, was well done by Kyle Chandler (who playes Joe's Dad) and Ron Eldard (who plays Alice's Dad). Though the critics have said that JJ Abrams takes several pages out of Executive Producer Steven Spielberg's past movies on sci-fi and centering on children, I don't really care. This is a great movie for these times, and he balances things out pretty well. The story has a good solid base, the acting superb, the emotions (be it sorrow, glee, excitement, fear) were truly felt, there were appropriate sprinkles of humor, and the action/special effects scenes were top notch.<br/><br/>My only qualm or reservation about this movie is that it left me wondering how the ending could have been better; I mean there are quick cuts of a creature of some kind (er, ET?), but I wish there was more closure there; there were questions unanswered (why was it collecting, what was its objective, etc.-- sorry I don't want to spoil it so I cannot elaborate more). Perhaps there was too much set up that I was anticipating more when the creature was revealed. Maybe another few more minutes to give a proper ending...<br/><br/>Anyway, the ending doesn't take away much from the movie (except my rating it a 9 instead of a 10)."

One see in this movie the lives of the children and how the children deal with a supernatural mystery. The movie has the usual Spielberg special effect. Super 8 is well directed where the movie flows smoothly, has a rapid pace, and is not disjointed. I found the movie entertaining. I also like how the movie pays homage to older space movies. The movie is worth seeing. Super 8 is a 8 out of 10. Watch the credit at the end of the movie which shows the teenagers zombie movie. If you leave quickly you might miss it."

","Some young teens in 1979 America are making a Super 8 film for a contest. They decide to utilize a passing train as background for their picture. The train is purposely derailed. One of the teens finds a strange cube like object amid the wreckage and strange things start happening. <br/><br/>There is a subplot of one of the character's mother dying in an industrial accident, and the resulting conflict between the boy and his father and the man the father blames. The subplot slows the film down slightly, but not enough to distract from the main story. <br/><br/>The film has many facets. A nostalgic look at the late 1970s, an adventure story, a mystery, all perfectly blended together. The film has some elements of Spielberg's past films, such as, outside authorities invading small town America, the raucous camaraderie of young teenagers, and a persecuted alien who wants to go home. So, leave any cynicism at the door, sit back and enjoy a good film."
"CaptRon-2","5","1","3","20 June 2011"," A green movie - completely recycled
","WARNING: SPOILERS CONTAINED BELOW. DO NOT READ PAST THIS POINT IF YOU DO NOT WANT KNOW CERTAIN PLOT ELEMENTS OR SPECIFIC SCENES!<br/><br/>Imagine if ET didn't meet Elliot but instead was captured by the government and tortured for decades. You would end up with a less than cute, very misunderstood homicidal maniac as the lead alien. There's no connection between the alien and the audience in this movie. He doesn't help or bond with the lead actor (Joe) and the only benefit of their brief encounter is that the alien decides he might be a nice person and therefore doesn't eat him. Oh lucky Joe!<br/><br/>The real problem with the is movie its too much. There were a lot of great names listed in the writing credits but with all the ideas floating around, no one took charge and said no, let's stick to one character and their situation. Here's a rundown of just a few drama points:<br/><br/>Joe: Mother dies in horrible accident. He is closely bonded with her and is lost. Father is town deputy and is mostly absent both emotionally and physically. He is a bright kid but a poor student (C- on his papers). He also likes the girl (Alice) whose father (Louis) is the nemesis of his father thus creating more conflict. He has a major show down with his father as he is forbidden to see Alice again (think Romeo and Juliet). He and his best friend (Charles) both like the same girl (Alice) setting off more tension. His desire to make a movie runs against his father's idea of going to summer baseball camp. Also, his dog (Lucy) runs away. As if this wasn't enough, he carries around the necklace that belonged to his dead mother. Apparently his father gave it to her when Joe was born and they somehow recovered it after a several ton steel beam crushed her. He eventually surrenders it to the alien as the last piece needed to power his new spaceship.<br/><br/>Charles: Dysfunctional family of pure chaos. Nice, clueless parents with a teenage daughter wanting to be a slut and group of minor siblings that scream and beat on the table during mealtime for no apparent reason. Obsessed with making his movie, he is overweight and lonely for a girlfriend. Tension between Joe and Charles mount over Alice. Tension rises because Alice doesn't want to do anymore movie scenes; Joe isn't allowed to make any move movie scenes; Cary keeps blowing things up during the movie scenes; the store film tech is a dope fiend who wants to date his sister; etc.<br/><br/>Alice: Sweet but poor girl next door (actually across the tracks). Her mother has abandoned her and her father (Louis). Her father is the town drunk, often arrested, forbids her from seeing Joe. She lives in a dirty, unkempt house. She steals her dad's car, drives without a license, and is eventually captured by the alien as her father tries to run her over with the family car. She somehow survives despite being hung upside down for days.<br/><br/>I could keep going on and on with the various characters as some of them are far more complex and have more drama than those I listed. However, I think the point is made and this is why this movie is no ET. With ET, you had Elliot and ET. The father is MIA and you really know very little about Elliot's family outside of their physical scenes. Same for the NASA alien chaser, Elliot's friends, and classmates. Close Encounters was similar in that you know the lead scientist, Roy and his family, and the woman and her child, Barry. In Super 8, the writing team casts so many nets in the hope that the audience will somehow connect to the character but instead leaves us hoping the alien eats them all and ends their miserable suffering. <br/><br/>You are also left with so many questions. Why was the alien being transported? Why would they transport the alien and the parts needed to rebuild his ship on the same train? How did a biology teacher who was dishonorably discharged in 1963 still have access to the alien's whereabouts and the train schedule 16 years later? How is the same officer is still in charge of the program 21 years later but was never promoted? It just endless plot holes which doesn't make this a bad movie, actually very average, but it never rises to the level of what we have come to expect from this group of writers and producers."

","After watching this amazing film, i gotta say it was a good job done by JJ, but it's not like people are saying it's perfect, somethings didn't work with this story, it's really amazing the beginning and u get that sense of a good old Spielberg movie(does he make any good one today?) the scenes inside the houses are miracles of transportation to the E.T. time line, god i was missing that kind of movies, sometimes i would think why we don't have that kind of feeling anymore of a cozy safe environment like in the E.T. and in Close Encounters of The Third Kind, well in that point of view this movie is perfect, it brings u that epic feeling of aliens are good, military are bad(so Spielberg), but the problem of this movie not being good as E.T. or Close Encounters, is that u never get to know the alien and the military so much so u can understand what's going on, and the magic disappears in the end, making this movie only a simple one, with not much meaning, cus the director doesn't focus the story on the two kids, or the friends, or the family, or the alien and the military, and it's a mix of everything, and it's a mix of nothing, OK it's not that bad, this are just a few of the things i think were missing, but honestly i don't like JJ that much, it almost feel that JJ is doing with Spielberg what Tarantino did with Sergio Leone, copying the environment and scenes it's not the same as the real deal, Spielberg is much better then JJ directing as Sérgio Leone is of Tarantino, the kids will like this movie cus it's not so complicated to them, it will be a movie for the kids with the same age as the ones in the movie, but it has some epic scenes this one, but back to JJ, i didn't like Cloverfield, i thought the ending ruined the film for me, it was one of the most dumb and easy endings to make, it ruins all the experience, the same happens with this one, if the ending would unveil something about the story, really give it a meaning like something happening to the kid's dad, or his ""girlfriend"", something that would give u a last ""awh"" and a last grasp of air, but no, JJ (witch is amazing filming this film) gives it a Cloverfield ending, a numb dumb ending, non-emotional, and i won't even criticize the alien, because it seams lots of people, in some weird way of ""how did we let this go wrong"", seam to like this kind of monsters instead of the aliens of E.T. and Close Encounters, if it wasn't for the simple wrap-up ending i would never have written something here, i would have gone home with a happy smile on my face and would have thought of seeing it again, but like this i just want to see E.T. and Close Encounters again to believe again in intelligent life in outer space, and when u already understood u were in the 80's again it wasn't necessary to send a ship to the sky to makes feel again like kids saying goodbye to E.T., it doesn't work, especially not in that way... Good awesome movie to honor Spielberg, but nothing else..."
"Polaris_DiB","6","1","3","17 June 2011"," Hard-edged nostalgia with lens flare.
","You know how James Bond is now tougher, Batman is now darker, and slashers have become ""torture porn""? Stephen Spielberg's nostalgia-laced children's adventure land is likewise more dysfunctional and militant.<br/><br/>This movie is unapologetically advertised LENSFLARE and sold as a Spielberg homage, not just his own movies but the rippled effects therefrom. The way LENSFLARE the PR for this movie went, I was rather surprised they didn't hand out a checklist card with a ""Find the movie reference!"" list on it, but actually the references LENSFLARE were really more understated than it seemed, and the nostalgia surprisingly LENSFLARE more sincere than it was sold as. What's more interesting than Abrams' beloved Super 8mm childhood is the fact that that idea LENSFLARE is put to the background as a series of plot points that serve the popcorn LENSFLARE adventure just as well as any other device could, just as the story could have been told in any decade but forced itself into the 70s/80s to fit LENSFLARE the device. All of LENSFLARE this would be fine but Abrams I feel makes a misstep in actually not keeping the movie confined to the essential elements that he, and we as audience, are LENSFLARE there for: the childhood adventure.<br/><br/>Instead it is more adult and darker. Now the thing about those wonderful Spielberg and company movies is that they were a lot more adult than subsequent generations of children's entertainment, featuring potty language and blood and monstrous thrills amidst the otherwise magical fantasyland. However what I mean by more adult and darker here is the way the movie loses focus, breaks away from the kids' perspective (which could easily have been maintained by sticking to the Super 8 camera motif) to do its evol military thing, investigative local cop, adult grief, and all layered into a movie that handles it well but didn't really need any of it. Again, The Goonies, ET, Gremlins, so on, they had those hints, adults struggling with something difficult the kid doesn't fully understand, forces beyond the community's control threatening their livelihood, the alienation of the kid familiarized by the alienation of the alien, but yet again, from the kid's perspective. Here it's laid out bare and thus much more hard edged and cynical in what is otherwise supposed to be a return to innocence. James Bond doesn't just flirt with Moneypenny anymore, now he's a vengeful force of nature. Batman doesn't just quietly suffer his traumatic past but fights moral conundrums as aggressively as his opponents. Slashers don't just go out for blood but lock victims in rooms to protract the bloodletting. And now we don't worry about Han shooting first or walkie talkies replacing rifles 'cause we've already an entire suburban landscape blowing up from out of control heavy artillery.<br/><br/>So when's nostalgia not nostalgia and innocence not innocent? Perhaps that would be the point except that it clearly isn't. The characters are written very lucidly to type, Chunk is now a burgeoning director, Data is now a fireworks fanboy, Andy is now a neglected loner girl. In this way the movie works, especially when the kids go off on their chatter. There is a lot of ""GEE WHIZ!"" ""THIS IS CRAZY GUYS!"" ""DID YOU SEE THAT EXPLOSION!"" fanfare that really is the heart of the movie and the best characterizations by the actors as they all run around doing their adventurous thing. It's fun hearing their interests and opinions popping up even in such cases when buildings are falling around them. So once again, though the story is fully fleshed out and makes sense in context to how its told, still yet the adult element is really unnecessary and distracts from the point.<br/><br/>This movie will also probably be debated in terms of its choices LENSFLARE of reveal. People are already LENSFLARE rapidly falling into the, ""Should the monster be seen or shouldn't it?"" debate, and actually I didn't mind the movie's LENSFLARE choice. In a way it is a different type of old school, a newer old school if you don't mind the contradiction. This movie LENSFLARE recalls Jurassic Park and early CGI feasts by LENSFLARE keeping things even when in plain view either in the distance or in the dark. Though we've gotten to the point LENSFLARE where South Korea has The Host and LENSFLARE Norway has Troll Hunter, proving that you needn't require even Hollywood production to make acceptable CGI, this movie plays that card safe and leaves the best parts LENSFLARE for actual emotional beats.<br/><br/>In the end the movie is going to be summed up by a variety of people in the same way: a summer popcorn movie that embraces its popcornness. For some, that's exactly what they want from cinema and for others, they'll mean it in a bad way. I'm completely neutral on the matter so unfortunately my response to the film is rather mediocre. I enjoyed it and was glad that I saw it with friends, I especially enjoyed the crowd's reactions to it in the movie theatre as an ""event movie"", and I couldn't really say there's any reason to see it again or own it on DVD or recommend it to anybody or anything. It's a good movie, I'm glad I saw it and it surprised me a little. Something tells me Spielberg's own Tintin is going to blow this out of the water.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"Jim-500","3","1","3","16 June 2011"," The script should have taken a cue from itself
","After hearing a bunch of hype over the much-ballyhooed J. J. Abrams, I went to this movie with high hopes. I love making films myself, and thought watching a movie about how you made a film before iMovie would be fun.<br/><br/>But it turns out that Super 8 really has little to do with kids making films; rather, it has to do with some secret Air Force plot involving a mysterious being.<br/><br/>After a spectacular first act, the film devolves into a lot of malarkey involving strange sounds in the dark, angry townspeople, and military folk with suitcases full of little white cubes. The strange being is revealed, but this only creates more confusion because its origins are barely explained, and after they are, it's difficult to care about them because this plot point has nothing to do with anything else in the movie. We then see some equally confounding scenes involving a big hole in the ground and a water tower with a story arc that defies understanding. And then, before you know it, POOF!--the being is gone. But again, this was anticlimactic; since we knew so little about the whats and whys of the action, there was no reason to care about it.<br/><br/>Early in the film, one of the boy filmmakers tells his friend about how important caring about your characters is to your story. Well, after a while, I didn't care about these characters, mainly because the story was not there. Why things happened the way they did was never explained, and both the characters and story took a back seat to a never-ending cacophony of senseless explosions and fire in which absolutely no one ever seems to be in danger. That does not make for a good movie."

","You can tell Spielberg was really going for an ET 2 here and you could say he achieved that fame(again) I guess. But to me, and to any intelligent adult this movie is just mediocre. It doesn't break any new ground in any of the genres it whips in and out of. I mean the acting is top notch, but thats to be expected in a gazillion dollar Hollywood movie like this. The characters are likable to an extent, but its just not all its hyped up to be. I have to say, I'm disappointed in the fact that so many people get all warm and fuzzy and jump on the bandwagon at these types of,low on the story, high on Popcorn action and explosions types movie. <br/><br/>I understand that its nice to turn your brain off every once in awhile, but movies like this are what they are..100 million dollar Hollywood cotton candy, doesn't really matter who wrote it. Good for the kids, or a family night out, but thats about it. <br/><br/>So if you love loud,silly over the top explosions then by all means go out and see this. The kids will love it I promise you that. Your average dimwitted adult may also praise this, but if your like me and like a little substance with your action, or a story with your movie then you can pass this one over until its on TV or cable. <br/><br/>6 stars is an honest rating for a movie like this. Take the budget away and what would you have? Crap thats what. So 6 stars for the presentation. Anyone voting 9 and 10 has their hat on too tight. Wake up people!"

","You can tell that Abrams and Spielberg worked together on this movie, because it's a cross between Goonies, E.T., and Cloverfield, with some Close Encounters thrown in. This is JJ Abram's worst movie, but it's still watchable. As a gen-Xer, this movie took me back (feels like mid-70's), and the ""production values"" are very good. The tween love between Joe and Alice is realistic and likable - probably the best thing about this movie. Unlike other Abram's productions, this movie doesn't leave you hanging with lots of unanswered questions at the end.

","After seeing the trailer and reading about the production of this movie, I was pretty much looking forward to seeing it. However, it was a bit of a disappointment as it felt disjointed as the story unfolded. The attention to detail regarding the time the movie takes place was remarkable. Every car on the screen was properly from that era, as was every single prop in the film. I actually thought the young actors, especially Elle Fanning, did a great job. She has a LOT more natural talent than her older sister in my opinion. However, much like the Nightmare on Elm Street remake, I kept waiting for the storyline to make a ""wow"" turn, but it never does. It just plods along, and when you hope for some deeper character development from ONE of the main players, it just never happens. I found it entertaining, but it is definitely geared for the teen and tweener crowds, although most parents will not approve of most of the language the kids use."
"jadepietro","7","1","3","15 June 2011"," Super 8 - Not That Great
","This film is recommended. <br/><br/>The film's title is a slight misnomer. Super 8 isn't super entertainment, but it is an enjoyable diversion. It does however have a compendium of, at least, 8 films in this one giant sci-fi kiddie adventure movie: ( In alphabetical order, Alien, The Fugitive, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., The Goonies, Jurassic Park, Stand by Me, and War of the Worlds all quickly come to mind. ) Certain scenes in Super 8 pay direct homage ( or simply rip-off ) those original sources and many others, I'm sure.<br/><br/>The film is so unoriginal and derivative. It's the summer of 1979. We know this by the nostalgic twinge of those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summers past with its hints of Walkmans, garish fashions, and unending pop oldies soundtrack. A group of teenagers are obsessed with making a zombie film with cheap but gory special effects on an Ed Wood budget. They have written, acted, and are filming their movie one night when an unexpected train crash ( the real film's most impressive big budget item ) halts their filming. Barely escaping injury, the Scooby-doo like gang soon realizes that strange occurrences are at work and they have witnessed the source of the town's problem. They also have the proof in the filmed footage from that eventful evening. The military immediately arrives and starts to cover-up the incident, but our intrepid youngsters will still try to save the town.<br/><br/>The success of Super 8 rests on the small shoulders of its talented young actors who save the film from its sense of familiarity with their likable screen personas. The two young leads are especially strong: Joel Courtney plays Joe, a sad boy whose mother has passed away and whose deputy father is still grieving, and Elle Fanning is Alice, a pretty young thing who can't relate to her drunken father. Both Courtney and Fanning have a wonderful chemistry on screen. Riley Griffiths, Gabriel Basso, Ryan Lee and Zach Mills round out the rest of the team.<br/><br/>Of course, the adults in the film are displayed as mere pawns and have no real personalities or any distinguishing traits. It is only the children that show any dimension, courage, or depth of character. The film's plot devices are simplistic and somewhat flawed, especially the investigation scene at the junior high school. The fact that these kids are never killed or severely injured with all the explosions and mayhem around them defies logic but keeps the film's PG-13 rating intact. <br/><br/>Yet the film remains engrossing due to the solid direction of J. J. Abrams, although his script lacks any real complexity. Abrams knows how to set up his action sequences and really builds tension with his use of sound effects and concise editing techniques. The creature is rarely seen until the last third of the film (ala Jaws and Cloverfield ) and that element of surprise works very well, although it is a bit of a letdown when the creature is finally seen.<br/><br/>Super 8 is still a fun time to be had, but just realize that it's nothing more or less than a well crafted children's movie masquerading as a grown-up thriller.

","Set in Ohio 1979, childhood friends Joe (Courtney), Cary (Lee), Preston (Mills), Charles (Griffiths), Martin (Basso) & Alice (Fanning) set out to make a Zombie film using their much prized Super 8 camera.<br/><br/>Whilst nighttime filming at the local railway station, a pick up truck unexpectedly drives down the track into the path of an oncoming train.<br/><br/>No ordinary train but a Airforce locomotive carrying something they would rather no-one gets to see. By the time the colossal, spectacular and very long explosion subsides, there is not much left, apart from a still running camera and plenty of terrified children.<br/><br/>What emerges from the train is the point of the movie, so no spoilers here. Just think small time town, mild horror and the local police deputy doing his best to keep the town safe and calm, sound familiar? It should, within moments most audiences will recognize the influence of Spielberg who produced this J.J. Abraham's (Star Trek) directed film. The period detail, children in distress, extensive use of sound effects to signpost incoming danger, you would be hard pressed to miss the references.<br/><br/>This is not a criticism, early Spielberg films were massively popular and with the added benefit of state of the art effects, this takes the original concept and if anything improves on what came before.<br/><br/>Joe's father (Chandler) is the deputy in question, at odds with his neighbour and father of Alice, following the death of his wife at the steel mill, which is neatly sketched out in the opening scene. Broken families, another early Spielberg trademark.<br/><br/>The children are good, acting naturally and the dialogue is believable. In between effects there are some well drawn quiet character driven scenes, notably the practice scene before the crash and when Joe carefully turns Alice into a Zombie with his homemade make up kit. Proof that you can care about characters in between exploding tanks & trains. The period setting is great, with ELO and other topical bands punctuating the soundtrack.<br/><br/>There is a stand out sequence aboard a bus which is classic ""Jurassic Park"" and together with a electrical pole repair scene, almost cries out for a John Williams penned music score. Abraham's wisely keeps his creature hidden for most of the film and yet shows creativity when finally the reveal is made. The writers also manage a satisfactory ending, just when you start to wonder how this will all turn out.<br/><br/>Initial trailers indicated a monster movie with subsequent clips revealing the film skewed much younger, focusing on it's young protagonists. The finished films achieves both, enough jump scares and peril coupled with a well sketched coming of age story. Joel Courtney is a good find, carefully showing wonder, terror and an inner resolve whilst facing an even greater terror, talking to Alice, the girl he fancies. Ellen Fanning showing her sister Dakota did not steal all the acting genes.<br/><br/>Make sure you stay for the credits where the fruits of all that amateur filming are shown in all their glory. Always fascinating to see actors acting badly, which is good acting in itself.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>If you are looking for a summary, think Jurassic Park crossed with ET and the Goonies, which are all good references.<br/><br/>Add some fine child performances, lots of explosions and scares for older children and you have an easy recommendation, go see it.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"
"markdroulston","8","1","3","15 June 2011"," Delightful nostalgia
","In 2010, amidst the flood of adaptations that filled the blockbuster season, Christopher Nolan's Inception stood out for being not only an effective thriller, but more importantly for being one of the few original concept tent-pole releases of the year. This year you may hear similar things about JJ Abrams' Super 8, but please do not be fooled. Super 8 is in fact arguably the most derivative film of the year, but for people of a certain generation who grew up on 80s family adventure films, it really is a rare treat. Working from the template perfected by executive producer Steven Spielberg in films such as Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and E.T., Abrams delivers a sweet, nostalgic, and often frightening film unlike anything seen in cinemas for many years.<br/><br/>While there is a lot to enjoy in many contemporary blockbusters, it takes a film like Super 8 to highlight the absence of a crucial ingredient in modern movies: heart. Most summer films released over the past decade have certainly been big on action set-pieces and visual effects, but everything else about them seems distressingly interchangeable. There's a lone male hero. A love interest. A problem to be solved. And in many cases a kiss at the end. There's no denying that it's a successful formula (the box office numbers speak for themselves), but it is somewhat fleeting success. It really is a great shame that what people will remember about the films of the early 21st century is the style rather than the substance. In Jaws, it's not the shark itself we remember so much as the pursuit of the shark and interactions between Brody, Hooper and Quint. In E.T., it's the relationship between Elliott and the titular alien. Super 8 is Abrams' love-letter to that period in cinema, and keen eyed viewers will undoubtedly spot many homages to films such as Stand By Me, The Goonies, and most obviously the early work of his mentor Spielberg. The film is rich with sentimentality, keenly addressing childhood issues of friendship, ambition, problems with parents, and first love. The adults in the film (including a great performance from Kyle Chandler) are all crucial to keep the narrative moving, but the beauty of Super 8 comes from its focus on the perspective of the kids. They're a rag-tag bunch of largely unknown young actors who all do a terrific job (especially the freakishly talented Elle Fanning), and Abrams wisely allows the camera to linger on small character moments rather than simply jumping from one set-piece to the next as so often happens nowadays. Allowing development of these characters makes them seem all the more real, and when things get nasty (which they do), there's genuine fear about what's going to happen to these youngsters. Abrams ratchets up the tension with scream-inducing (at least in my screening) jump scares, and opts to keep the threat hidden for the majority of the film, another nice Spielbergian touch. Super 8 really is a masterpiece of tone.<br/><br/>I guess I haven't really mentioned the plot in this review, but this is a film about emotion, harking back to a time where the plot was merely a foundation on which to build authentic character relationships. But yes, ostensibly Super 8 is a monster movie, and unfortunately Abrams fumbles at the goal line as the film draws to a close, hampered by the necessity to finish the monster story. As with any creature feature, the monster is merely a frightening manifestation of a bigger issue facing the characters, and Abrams' attempt at pathos comes off as a little clunky. But where a lesser film would perhaps be ruined by such an obvious emotional climax, Abrams' heartfelt handling of the characters in the film's build-up allows some forgiveness. Super 8 is never going to be the highest grosser of the year, but it warms the soul to know that this type of filmmaking is still around, and hopefully the film will find an audience with today's young and young-at-heart. Now if you'll excuse me, I feel a strong desire to watch Close Encounters."

","In a small town in Ohio, a group of kids are making a zombie flick using an 8mm camera. During their shooting, a train is derailed and something escapes. Odd things start happening around the town and the military arrive to cover up a government secret. <br/><br/>Told through the eyes of young kids, Super 8, which is also set in the late 70's, will instantly feel nostalgic. That's the one word I've been hearing thrown around when people describe this film. Spielberg is the producer, so people instantly make a connection between this film and his previous works. The underlying feeling is there, but this film has much more to offer than just nostalgia. <br/><br/>In the first few scenes, we know the main character has lost someone in his life. It's always hard to convey something has happened without any dialogue, this film tells us so much with so little. The main character is missing something from his life, will this adventure be able to fill that hole? Will he be able to let go of the things that are holding him back in the past? He has a crush on this cute girl, who just so happens to be in the film they are shooting. Their relationship is cute to watch grow, from awkwardness, to understanding, to needing. They are kids, so their relationship isn't based on lust, which most romantic comedies and blockbuster films will be about this year. Instead, it's an innocence that makes the relationship spark. <br/><br/>Abrams manages to invoke the same feelings we all had when we watched Spielberg films as kids, yet he is able to keep his own creative touch in tact. It never feels like a rip-off, or even a homage. Instead it feels like it belongs with those films, side by side. The mystery behind this film is what fuels the fire. Leading up to the release, all we know about it was that it was a monster flick of some kind. A companion piece to Abrams produced film Cloverfield maybe? <br/><br/>Elle Fanning, plays the young Alice, who is the object of Joe's affection. Joe is played by newcomer Joel Courtney. Both do a great job in their roles, Fanning more so, who I enjoy more than her famous sister, Dakota. I would have loved a bit more bickering and interaction between the kids though. The film is more of a family centric piece. The relationship between Joe and his father, the Deputy, is less than perfect. We are given so many answers at the beginning of the film and later on we are revealed the questions. A film that manages to ignite many mysteries that resolves them later is great in my book. <br/><br/>The climax of the film is a little less than stellar. It ends on a more family friendly note than what one might hope. Then again, this is ""Spielberg"" right? Super 8 is full of thrilling sequences and charming performances. It will grab your inner child (for those of us who grew up with Spielberg films) and get him/her cheering. Super 8, with some minor problems is one of the best films this year. Abrams is a talented guy, which we already knew from Star Trek. Here he shows us he attention to detail and how much he admires the craft. <br/><br/>Super 8 is indeed super and it gets an 8 from me."
"paperback_wizard","7","1","3","14 June 2011"," Production values, man! Production values!
","Super 8 holds the almost unique position of being a big budget genre release this summer that is not a sequel, remake, or adaptation of a book or comic.<br/><br/>(I know. I'm just as surprised as you are.) That said, it's easy to discern the roots of J.J. Abrams' latest project, even if one doesn't notice who's executive producing or what long-unused production company label is in the credits.<br/><br/>It's basically the ultimate Valentine yet produced to the work directors like Steven Spielberg, Richard Donner, Joe Dante, and the like had a hand in, back in the late 70s and early 80s. Most specifically the ones that featured snarky but likable kids on a wild adventure.<br/><br/>I think some people forget just what a revelation those films were. Released at a time when Disney and other purveyors of family entertainment produced toothless, faded films that people forgot about (if they even bothered to see them in the first place), these movies drew us in with their humor, their heartand the delicious sense of danger.<br/><br/>We begin the film with a group of kids who want to win the upcoming Cleveland Super 8 film festival. They have the perfect idea for a movie: ZOMBIES! School is finally out for summer. They're refreshed and ready to make the best monster movie ever.<br/><br/>I knew these kids. I used to be one. Sweet, geeky, bickering, goofy, and endearingly innocent.<br/><br/>But, all isn't fun and games. Joe, the boy who budding director Chris chose to be their makeup guy, is still secretly mourning his mother, who died in a terrible accident a few months ago. His dad is the town sheriff and is very obviously overwhelmed with being the local law -and- a full-time father.<br/><br/>To add spice, the girl who agreed to star in the film and drive them around at night is the daughter of the man indirectly responsible for the death of Joe's mom! It's all familiar, involving coming-of-age soap stuff.<br/><br/>The young cast is excellent. They totally sell their friendship, their banter, their heartache, and their desire to do a cool monster movie.<br/><br/>But, as things will, a monkey wrench is thrown in after about 20 minutes of youthful innocence and wistfulness. Sneaking off to the local railroad station for ""production values"", they witness a spectacular, terrifying train crash.<br/><br/>A crash which releasesSOMETHING into their hometown. Something that wants very much to leave it, at any cost.<br/><br/>And it becomes a new movie, with sinister military men, secret monsters, and the kids themselves getting in way over their heads in an attempt to figure out the truthand just possibly save their hometown and the world in the process.<br/><br/>The slow reveal of the escaped alien was actually pretty cool. In fact, most of the more exciting scenes in the film are excellently done. I get the feeling many of these images were in J.J.'s head for a long time.<br/><br/>On the level of being a nostalgic tribute to the late 70s/early 80s work of Spielberg, it works. It's perhaps one of the most well put together Valentines to those films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's never quite able to work on a level deeper than that. The emotional climax of the film is attempted, but they just can't seem to sell it the way it was sold in, say, E.T.. (Or to give a modern example, in almost every Pixar film since Toy Story 2.) I usually enjoy the work of Abrams. I definitely enjoyed this. But it's probably not quite what he wanted to accomplish.<br/><br/>That said, the youthful cast is stellar, the eye candy action pieces are jaw-dropping, and at least a third of the film really is as mysterious and wistful as it wants to be. That's more than can be said for many attempts at creating a retro-classic.<br/><br/>There are so many wonderful moments I want to spoil but won't. Be on the lookout for an oddball but beautifully touching lesson on zombie behavior. Look for the strange link between the eyes of a beloved, much missed mother and the gaze of a bizarre alien.<br/><br/>Look for the way misunderstanding and fear can be replaced by joy and wonderment. Even after bad things happen.<br/><br/>And definitely stick around during the credits, where as a bonus you'll get treated to the delights of the completed zombie film.<br/><br/>(The first person to make a ""Hey, were there LENS FLARES?

""I just feel like now that before the movie starts, I've been told almost everything,"" he says. With JJ, we're lucky we get anything .<br/><br/>His latest installment Super 8 occurs in the rural town of Lillian, Ohio. The year is 1979, and Abrams makes us fully aware we are spending time in his boyhood era. He unleashes a time capsule of greatest hits like ""Don't Bring Me Down"" and ""My Sharona"" listened to on a newly purchased Walkman. The town's main street has the old-time effect branded onto its store signs and streetlights. News reports on Three-mile island make white noise and bounce off the wood-paneled kitchen walls. The scene is certainly set.<br/><br/>Using some of this new technology is Charles (Riley Griffiths), who wields his 8mm camera around while gathering his rag-tag group of friends together for his Zombie movie which he plans to enter in a local competition. The main character, Charles's best friend and chief makeup artist, is Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), a somber kid-artist who paints figurines and designs toy trains. His mother's earlier death at a steel mill heightens tension between his deputy father and also opens a relationship with Alice (Elle Fanning), an older girl who reluctantly signs on to play a part in Charles's movie.<br/><br/>The allusions to Spielberg are evident and for a reason; he is the producer after all. The classic grouping of middle school friends seem omnipresent in Spielberg flicks, take The Goonies and E.T. Abrams combines the familiar collection of kids, mystery, and monsters and it syncs up well for the majority of the film. The plot follows a familiar road but the element of surprise and emotional correspondence give a tired sequence new life, for a while.<br/><br/>In order to shoot ""The Case,"" the title of Charles's movie, Alice steals her dad's car and without a license drives them to an old train platform for a midnight scene. They begin rolling when a speeding train comes charging down the tracks and Charles, seeking ""production value"" decides to re-shoot the scene as the train blisters by. Then things get weird. A reckless truck soon crashes into the freighter that enacts an exaggerated domino-like effect of cars being tossed into the sky and returning to the earth smoldering with mysterious content. Shades of Michael Bay linger on into the fire-lit night .<br/><br/>The group, filled with nerds and oddballs, like the pyrotechnic brace face that keeps fireworks in his backpack, struggles with keeping their twilight account secretive. The military soon bombards the quiet town with oppressive orders. Metal objects begin disappearing, dogs start fleeing the radius, and even some people go missing. Like the great child narratives, the adults are clueless, and the government is clearly hiding something from us. The young film makers are trapped in their heads; worried, determined, but opportunistic. Their small movie becomes the driving force in their quest to stay together, figure out the unknown, and in a less cliché way, find themselves.<br/><br/>Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning bring this blossoming tale some young teen attraction and show their acting chops throughout. However, the relationships soon get sidetracked by the necessity of the monster's plot . Flickering lights and floating cars soon take over the foreground and Joe's stern father gets overshadowed by the military's growing presence. These camouflaged scenes become distracting to our main character's plight and become a beacon of questioning that is never torched properly. Inquiries into this mysterious origin are hinted at, but only serve to miss the point of this group story.<br/><br/>The human element of this film is what glues these kids together. Besides the undeveloped, maternal sentimentality that occurs between young Joe and his deceased mother, the growing friendships and adapting household brings in a Stand By Me appeal where the innocent and curious place faith in untested collaboration. The destructive forces in Cloverfield certainly make their way into this film though, and the ""production value"" is sure to make Charles proud. Abrams puts a heavy dosage of suspense and fire-power that orchestrate into large noise. But this does not crescendo out of control and remains a monster mystery adventure tethered to a coming-of-age, interpersonal maturation.<br/><br/>Though Spielberg's presence, sans a John Williams score, is noticeable, Super 8′s structure is injected with strong performances that refuel a unique group adventure. Abrams is unable to pull the two separate plots into complete harmony but they synchronize just enough; and just enough for Abrams is a whole lot more than anyone can ask for, at least this summer.<br/><br/>Check out my site in its entirety at h t t p://field of films. word press. com"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","3","12 June 2011"," Not a cohesive towering feat, but dependable entertainment from great movie minds
","Created by J.J. Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg. That phrase says a lot. As more and more clues were revealed as to Abrams second secret film project, the mere presence of these two respected names began to connect dots in the minds of film fans. The first teaser — made before the film even began casting — implied aliens. No surprise there with Abrams' viral marketing hit ""Cloverfield"" and Spielberg's classic, ""E.T."" Yet the connection between those two films only grew as more information came out about ""Super 8."" A Super Bowl TV spot revealed child main characters in a late '70s setting, only a few years off from the actual release of ""E.T.,"" and the presence of a mysterious monster evoked ""Cloverfield."" Does ""Super 8"" burst with so much originality as to end those comparisons? No, but Abrams continues to prove he knows how to entertain an audience.<br/><br/>To appropriately continue the juxtaposition, ""Super 8"" ultimately works as a scarier ""E.T."" for adults. To drop another Spielberg film into the mix, the monster attacks feel a lot like ""Jurassic Park"" although the monster itself possesses the same mystique as that of ""Cloverfield."" Yet alien/monster film is just one piece of the movie's identity. In all other senses, ""Super 8"" serves as a period piece, a look back at what it was like to be a kid growing up in the Midwest in 1979. The creature feature part helps bring life to the imagination of the main characters and turn that era into a tall tale setting of sorts.<br/><br/>For Abrams, who would have been 13 in the summer of '79, this project is clearly personal. You cannot divorce the filmmaker from the film in this instance. He was undoubtedly one of the kids out there making movies on his Super 8 camera and the plot of this movie enacts a fantasy of his to some extent; what it would be like to actually capture footage of the events he once so desperately tried to create in his own home-spun features.<br/><br/>The story follows Joe (Joel Courtney), who loses his mother in a construction accident a few months before the events of the film. He's a dedicated friend and make up artist to young filmmaker Charles (Riley Griffiths), who's making a movie on his Super 8 to enter into some Ohio film festival competition. Charles wants to film at a train station at midnight and he convinces his usual cast and crew of friends to indulge him, as well as Alice (Elle Fanning), who Joe becomes smitten with even before she arrives. While filming, a freight train comes by and suddenly a truck zooms onto the tracks and derails it. After narrowly escaping certain death, the truck driver warns them not to say a word of what happened, which gets tougher and tougher in the coming days as people, pets and electronic appliances disappear.<br/><br/>""Super 8"" could've been a drama about kids with big imaginations making movies to avoid dealing with the harsh realities of their family lives — it might have even been better that way — but the big alien in the room quickly changes that. At times, the switch between coming- of-age story and sci-fi horror feels jarring, but both elements exhibit excellent craftsmanship independent of one another. Abrams simply doesn't sew them up into the most seamless of quilts.<br/><br/>But maybe he doesn't need to. ""Super 8"" has a surprising amount of humor, a bit of effective suspense, cool action sequences (if you can brush aside the preposterousness of the inciting train derailment), realistic family drama and a few touching moments as well. Those are all winning ingredients, obviously, and ""Super 8"" is a worthwhile watch because of them, but a large through-line seems to be missing. Abrams' concept always held more weight than his story, and though the integration entertains completely, the transformation from concept to film was not as heavily scrutinized as it might in a project that's not its filmmaker's brain child.<br/><br/>There's a slight air of disappointment, if for no other reason than because of the mammoth secret that Abrams kept from us and the reveal not being mind-numbing. Although ""Super 8"" remained a mystery up until its release, the plot itself has a much harder time remaining mysterious throughout the film. Once the kids uncover information of the monster's origin, the film loses all steam from a ""figure it out"" perspective and ""Super 8"" enters the realm of predictability, which you don't expect when you go see a film kept so tightly under lock and key.<br/><br/>Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment logo and Abrams' Bad Robot stamp certainly suggest greatness, but better to realize that those talents imply a certain reliability more so than than ground-breaking cinema. Spielberg broke his ground; now he's producing ""Transformers"" and bad ""Indiana Jones"" sequels. Abrams has always been more of a television pioneer and did this once before with ""Cloverfield."" As such, ""Super 8"" is a film you can depend on for entertainment, one that's a product of successful films of the past, not a game changer that will move us into a new era of ""top secret"" filmmaking.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","I really wanted to like this movie. With the exception of lens flares it looked beautiful, and seemed promising initially. The second half of the movie really let it down.

"Jack Doyle","5","1","4","4 November 2017"," Poor man's Stranger Things
","This is JJ Abrams attempt at a Spielberg homage, and it has all of the typical Abrams flaws. First the good, the production value is good, it certainly has a lot of references, to just about ever Spielberg movie. The music, the plot, the characters are all reminiscent of classic 80s Spielberg movies most notably ET.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for ever good Spielberg beat, there is Abrams shortcomings. weak plotting, characters making choices not consist with their characterisation just so the plot can move along, and a third act that just falls apart. Abrams is by no means a bad director but he's a journeyman at best, and when he's trying to imitate Spielberg his flaws become all the more glaring.<br/><br/>Essentially this wanted to do, and failed to do, what Stranger Things succeeded to do with such aplomb. Spielberg is now a genre and some can do good genre pieces and some can do failed attempts at one."

","Only an excellent visionary, prophet, artiste (notice 'e' at the end plebs) would come up with this work of genius. The kind of film that will awe, be reviewed, scanned, discussed and adored for decades to come Super 8 is a gala for the eyes of men, women and children tat works at multiple levels. It is famously noted by reviewers and up-voters definitely not employed by Mr JJ Abrams, said visionary, that Super 8 has been inspirational to a new generation of filmmaker, but professionals have also opined that it has influenced and reinvigorated directors like Spielberg anew. Super 8 is clean, fun, non formulaic and, as a layered piece de resistance of Hollywood, also is a metaphor generating machine. Go JJ Abrams, go! We look forward to many more films, movies, statues, paintings and poetry from you. You ""saved"" Star Trek and Star Wars, now go save the world."
"chaiadammason","7","1","4","1 January 2017"," Pretty great but both made and mired by Spielburg influence
","The current index review by Nooch007 ends: ""All in all, Super 8 was a terrific film experience, that will leave you with a smile on your face"". Which I would amend to ""...a terrific film that will leave a smile on your face but a sour taste in the mouth""<br/><br/>I watched this as a remedy for watching and finishing Stranger Things S01 and while I wait for S02 - great, I thought, an American teen adventure movie, set when I was born ('79) so will fulfil most of the requirements of a void left by Stranger Things with its wondrous and spot-on nostalgia. Plus directed by Abrams, who impressed us all with Star Trek.<br/><br/>The film is really great and ticks most of the boxes. That is until<br/><br/>_______________<br/><br/>S P O I L E R S<br/><br/>_______________<br/><br/>the protagonist talks the monster into not killing anyone else and just to go home. Of course it could have just continued to kill everyone and go home anyway. Which is kind of what I could believe. I understand about having to build tension to thrill the audience etc blah but also to have a happy ending etc blah - and I'm not proposing an alternative to the plot but with the drawn out soundtrack and the sudden magical negotiation ability of the kid to talk his way out of being killed. I was about to write about the blatant implausibility but the plot had already delineated with the doctor who communicated with the alien in the lab by being touched (picked up) by the alien and the same thing happened (presumably) when the protagonist kid was picked up in the underground tunnels. Presumably because both their intention was to communicate they didn't get destroyed, whereby the air force guys got mashed because their intentions were hostile - but there's no explanation about why expendable characters who perhaps just scared and didn't have time to be either hostile or want to communicate still just got wrecked. This is typical of mainstream storytelling and is lazy and always pisses me off about ALL of Spielburg's work. Takes a good idea and just saturates it with crowd-pleasing sentimentality. he ruined most of his films this way, except maybe a couple Indy ones and probably Jaws. It's just spiel. Pun intended. And poor old Abrams seems to be musing for Spielburg by exhibiting exactly the same kind of sickening saccharine sentimentality. Of course that doesn't make it bad, just lazy. The whole film was pretty great, until the ending. A monster is a monster, it doesn't get to terrorise and then at the very end be exonerated. I understand why it might in Wollstonecraft/Shelly's Frankenstein or other texts where character and plot is developed throughout the story but here none of that happened. Just annoys me. That's why Stranger Things was so great, no sentimentality, just story and character. I understand that this is ostensibly a kids film and Stranger Things isn't.<br/><br/>Still, worth a watch. Will be liked by fans of SPIELburg and ET which I'm not (though I've always been staggered by how he could make a whole generation love what is basically a talking poo so props to him there) Also it's good that you don't see much of the monster as it builds suspense as should be (but also because it wasn't a very interesting design - looks like a dog's skeleton which has gone soft mixed with an octopus). I was going to rate 6/10 but 7 as it's fairly unique and will have a nostalgic feeling for viewers who grew up in the late 20th century. Probably would have been 9/10 without the crappy touchy-feely ending."

This film isn't realistic as it involves aliens etc..once you understand that then you can enjoy it,its very Steven Spielberg, which i like,lots of effects a unusual story, monsters, laughs, a bit of sorrow. as its based in 1979 they use music from them, and jokes about stuff like Walkmans etc..all in all i liked it, it has a few swear words in it, so maybe not for little ones. i liked it and luckily i taped it so i can watch it again tomorrow."

They get Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) to be the romantic lead. Alice is not happy to be driving without a license with the deputy's son as the sound man.

He's using a lot of that lens flare that he loves so much, but the train crash looks good. The kids' acting is paramount to this and they do an acceptable job. It would be nice if they had a bigger presence. Elle Fanning is like a giant to these kids. I didn't mind that as much as her monotone voice. It's a minor distraction. Other than Elle, none of the kids have a big enough presence. Maybe they're too normal or too new. There is good and bad about that. This has both the innocence of an earlier times and the tension of a creepy sci-fi thriller. It strikes different cords. It's a bit of Goonies and a bit of Close Encounters."

I mean I saw this as utterly beautiful and loved the heck out of the touching acting story, the friendship, the level of humor in using some familiar clichés in the behaviors of the characters. I wish I could tell the spoiler but here is a hint - a famous 70s toy that turns into a famous 70s movie flying thing. (I always think of this era as late 70s though it could be early 80s just as easily.)"
"brando647","8","1","4","10 January 2012"," A Spielbergian Adventure from His Biggest Fan
","I stopped caring so much about SUPER 8 some time before it ever came to theaters. It wasn't that I didn't expect great things from J.J. Abrams. I know he's good for a fun movie, but the trailers never really grabbed my attention. Sure the teaser was interesting, with the ""mystery"" bursting out from behind the sealed door of an Air Force train car. But it wasn't hard to guess what was coming out from behind that door; combine the mystery-less mystery with the fact that I don't have the same nostalgia for Steven Spielberg's 80's films, and SUPER 8 was destined not to have the same impact on me as it had on many others. The film is about a group of children in the late 70's putting together a zombie movie on super 8mm film for a local film festival. Joe (Joel Courtney) lost his mother to an industrial accident four months earlier, and tensions rise when he directing friend invites Alice Dainard (Ellie Fanning) to act in his film. Alice is the daughter of the man believed responsible for the death of Joe's mom and, despite this awkward tension that exists between their two fathers, emotions begin to develop between the two of them. Oh, and the town is terrorized by a mysterious creature of unknown origin. It's more of a B-story, despite what original trailers insinuated. While filming a scene for their zombie film, the friends witness a train derailment that releases the creature into their small town and eventually become involved in their own investigation.<br/><br/>This movie really is about the kids first, and the creature second. That's fine, I guess. I just wish the filmmakers' early marketing efforts hadn't been about the beast's escape from the Air Force cargo train. Once the full trailer was released and I saw the actual scope of the movie, my interested began to fade. I was still interested in seeing it, but I wasn't in any rush. I normally hate children actors (some leftover resentment for Jake Lloyd's performance in STAR WARS EPISODE I, I suppose), but there are occasions where a child performer/cast will come along that makes me eat my words. This is one of them. It could just be proof of J.J. Abrams skill as a director that he's able to utilize kids so well, but the stars of this movie do a pretty excellent job (some more than others). You would never guess this is Joel Courtney's first feature role, and Riley Griffiths proves to be more than comfortable in front of the camera (even if he can be annoying at timesproduction value!!). The real strength in the group is Ellie Fanning as Alice Dainard. It must be something in the Fanning blood, but apparently they make fantastic child actors. She's got emotional power in her performance that stands out amongst her lesser castmates, and it's obvious she's going to have a successful future just as her sister had.<br/><br/>This movie just didn't click with me. I was born in the 80's, so I wasn't really old enough to appreciate the Spielberg films that Abrams is goings nuts over here. I was too young for CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and, even as a kid, I never cared for E.T. I didn't see the Spielberg-produced GOONIES until years later (loved it though). So the homage that makes up the core of Abram's SUPER 8 just didn't resonate with me. I still enjoyed SUPER 8, quite a bit. It's just not what I'd spent months anticipating after seeing the teaser trailer. I wanted another good sci-fi movie, not a coming-of-age drama that just so happened to feature an alien plot. It's an incredibly well-done movie and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it, but I guess my lingering disappointment has given me a slight bias. It looks and feels like a mid-80s era Spielberg family/adventure film and, in that respect, Abrams nailed it. It just failed to really stay with me after leaving the theater and when I tried thinking back to the best movies I saw over the summer of 2011, despite how good this movie was, I'd completely forgotten about it. It was a fun sci-fi adventure with a great heart, and the final act of the film where the entire creature storyline kicks into gear is fun. I'm just glad Abrams got it out of his system so we can move on to STAR TREK 2 or whatever new project he's got up his sleeve."
"davggsco","3","1","4","14 August 2011"," Oh dear this was awful
","Cloverfield crossed with E.T. That's the best way to describe this film. But because it crosses two very different atmospheres (the scary, realistic tone of Cloverfield contrasting to the family-orientated, fun but moralistic E.T.), we are left with a very confused piece. The reason that Cloverfield worked was because the alien was just evil - we could not relate or understand the reasons for him killing people and destroying our favourite city. The reason that ET worked was that the alien was likable, kind and knowledgeable. The problem with Super 8 is that JJ Abrams tries to make this alien a mix of the two. Which just doesn't work. It could NEVER work. <br/><br/>For such a damning first paragraph, I have to say that I was impressed by the initial set-up of Super 8. The opening scene is genuinely interesting and slightly moving. The main character is in mourning for the loss of his mother in a tragic accident, which is a decent back story, and actually many aspects of this film would have made a nice family drama and love story, with the theme of redemption. Unfortunately, as soon as the aliens turn up, the film loses all its appeal.<br/><br/>The child actors are actually very convincing, which is something I could not say for this summer's British alien/kids movie, 'Attack the Block'. Elle Fanning, in particular, stood out as a great young actress. Unfortunately, the acting is undermined by JJ Abram's extra-terrestrial plot which is not scary, interesting or fresh.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, the main character tries to reason with the huge monstrous alien by telling him 'he knows how he feels'. Spare me.<br/><br/>You have to admire JJ Abrams vision of creating a 80s style alien movie in the vein of The Goonies or ET, but it does not get anywhere near those films. It is slightly refreshing to see a return for the regular American kid trying to save the world rather than the typical tough man like Jason Statham, as we're seeing all too much of at the moment. However, this is no way near interesting or engaging enough to make me give much sympathy to Abrams.<br/><br/>A drab 3/10 is deserved."

I found the acting very good there's a scene with Elle Fanning at the train station that I thought was amazing plus I like her so much more then her annoying sister(sorry), The new comer Joel Courtney was very good not amazing but could definitely go on to be a successful actor there was a few not so good moments wasn't sold with Fanning's in film father and a few of the friends where a bit amateur but I forgive because they are young and still quite amateur.

"Aaron1375","7","1","4","18 June 2011"," Not a super 8, but I say it is a solid seven.
","Went to this film hoping it would be a bit of a throwback type film of the 80's, the one's featuring a group of kids in a crazy situation. Basically something that is a bit like ""The Explorers"", ""Goonies"" and a couple of other movies. You know, the one's where the children are actually likable characters before the 90's came and made them brats who were always outwitting adults...'cough' home along 'cough'. This film I happily say did that, I enjoyed the kids and I can imagine a couple of them going on to have very solid movie careers. The movie was not perfect, however, which is why I give it only a seven rather than a higher score. The film is about a boy who has recently lost his mother, he and a group of boys are making a movie for one of them to enter into a super 8 film festival. They are making a zombie film and the boy who lost his mother does the makeup. He and his father are distant with each other, the father seemingly wants to send the boy away to a camp of some sort. Well one night while filming a scene for their movie at a train station a train comes barreling down the tracks. A truck seems to get on the tracks and the train gets derailed in glorious fashion. This is one of the highlights of the film, watching the children run as the train explodes and debris falls everywhere. Well there was something on this train that brings the military to town and the boys along with a girl who has ties to a person that the boy's father who is a deputy associates with the death of his mother end up having to unravel some of the mystery behind what was on the train and why the truck literally went on the tracks. It was good, however, I kind of wish the boy who lost his mother's friends were in it a bit more, at times they paid to much attention to the one kid and the others were good too. There seemed to be more development warranted as some of the scenes with the one boy and girl were a bit to much of a bummer. I also did not care for the conclusion all that much as it was a bit anti climatic as it was really good with the town under siege and the underground scene, but kind of ended with a whimper. I also wish all the kids got to play a bigger role during the last scenes as two got left behind to quickly. However, overall the film was enjoyable, however parents be warned. This is not a PG movie that barely became PG-13, I would say it is a PG-13 that likely came close to being rated R as it is not really overly bloody or anything of that nature, but there is quite a bit of language in this one. Funny, it is like the second film of 2011 to be rated PG-13 that I have seen that has had the F word in it. Probably more than the last two or three summers combined. Once again good film, just not super."

","Abrams film in uniform doses, combines the story of teenage first love and growing up with a monster-movie about how the train ran out of the container creepy and dangerous alien. Originally a completely different subjects, they finally successfully intertwined in an interesting and eventful script. The action takes place in the late seventies, where a group of kids writes a movie about zombies. Particularly curious viewers can wait until the end credits, when they finished work will be shown in full. Meanwhile, the above mentioned alien escapes from a train caught in a catastrophe, and now in a small town lost dogs, people, different things, and electronic devices, and a large group of soldiers occupied the territory under its control.<br/><br/>Meticulously closing the frame escaped monster movie sincerely hopes to keep the suspense until the very end, and there is not quickly hurry to demonstrate solid plans for the creation in all its glory, regularly turning away, with a focus on individual limbs, and only occasionally allowing the establishment to consider.

Nevertheless, the babies are handled with their roles in the cast is not difficult uglyadet hints now known directors, but this whole men's team easily beats the gorgeous Elle Fanning, presenting the most colorful character with the most expressive expression. Still would not fall in love in such a protagonist, but that's only between their families turned Shakespeare's passion and mutual hatred, so that the new version of Romeo and Juliet has run off in secret to each other at night.

In fact more of them and is not required, first be gradually transformed into a near and dear son of man, well deserved second punished for inhumanity, this picture Abrams copes, playing lifeless characters on static relationships.<br/><br/>But the closer to the finale, the lost notes of romance and relationships in the young heroes. Replacing a potential first kiss scene in a terrible episode with a slap, completing a very cool meeting with the parents of a tiny touch of your fingers between the main characters, and all further retreat by intrigues, adventures of monsters, and things happening around the military action of the emotions and feelings, as if Abrams is aware that his characters may be too small for a serious love story, and started for the health of an interesting story, he immediately turns her into an instant, reborn in the romance of friendship, and the story of teenagers in a standoff outside threat.<br/><br/>Yes, and the monster looks ten times worse than Cloverfield in appearance, though several times shorter. The creature stood out so terrible, dangerous and mnogorukoy that doubt, even in the presence of at least some intelligence in the head with a similar palate. Terrible creation is deservedly expose the threat to life, the desperate rush to justify violent actions and motives, and this duality is really not the best way affects the perception of the film.<br/><br/>For a fair share of stones in the garden of the military, and those without pity and little animals inoculated from space are shown in the impartial light, as a much greater evil to the civilian population than the disorderly establishment escaped. And to complement this painting experiments and the cruelty of the visitor from other planets have been superfluous. But the deployed military force with a bunch of explosions and special effects completely delight in the final picture, yet the military is not for nothing in such abundance are presented in the plot. However, no final flight of the spacecraft, or destruction of military equipment, it is not as spectacular as equal to the initial crash of the train, which is only deserved admiration and applause! <br/><br/>Concealing a regular appearance of wandering stranger, the film is not seldom creates a fair amount of tension and even the experience of some of the characters. The mystery plays here and there in favor of the circumstances, I wish only that the answer to all questions are not in a hurry, tying all of just too monotonous scene-teasers. The fact that at first aroused interest, gradually tiring, and even seemed to be extremely tense scene in the bus upside down, instead of the proper emotion is only an analogy with the much more terrible scenes of ""Jeepers Creepers 2."" <br/><br/>Nostalgic, in many countries and quite smooth in structure to the ""Super 8"" attracts, despite its drawbacks, how serious would they have been. Picture deserves attention and looks with interest, though not in the same breath, with a fair amount of boredom and spots inhibiting the development of the plot scenes, but still leaving behind good memories and pleasant aftertaste. Abrams creation of producer Steven Spielberg came out just a good film, albeit without enthusiasm and willingness to reconsider, but the best choice for family viewing. Leaving a pleasant experience and earning interest of the audience, a film about an alien and the company of children is clearly worth a look."
"kluseba","8","1","4","18 June 2011"," A great blockbuster for the cinematic summer of 2011
","""Super 8"" is a very creative science-fiction movie that can be seen as an homage to the works of Steven Spielberg such as ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" or ""The Goonies"". The movie is not only set in the end of the seventies and the beginning of the eighties but also inspired by the movies, the music and the technical discoveries of that time which gives a nostalgic charm to the movie which distinguishes it from other comparable adventure movies starring young actors and the classic inspirations mentioned above.<br/><br/>Even though the story focuses on the adventures of a bunch of friends in a rather unknown and isolated small town in the middle of nowhere in the United States of America, this movie could also please to a lot of adults because of the classic influences, the nostalgic factors and a couple of surprisingly well done special effects and even a few rather brutal fighting scenes. I would like to underline the high budget that was perfectly used in this technically perfect movie as well as the brilliant acting of all actors and especially the young stars like the charismatic and authentic main male actor Joel Courtney and the very charming and breathtaking Elle Fanning that interact in a great way. Their relation is credible, dramatic and romantic and they are one of the best young actor couples I have ever seen in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>The story integrates everything a good adventure blockbuster needs to be a success for this year's cinematic summer: credible and diversified personalities, philosophically touched emotional topics such as first love, friendship and loss, some mysterious events that keep the tension high until the end and reserve some light surprises, some good humour, a lot of dramatic emotions, many and well crafted but not too overwhelming action scenes, many tension filled passages and a typically Hollywood ending.<br/><br/>The only thing that I might criticize is that the makers of the movie didn't always seem to know if they want to address to a younger or an older public and even though both public could appreciate this movie, there are a few flaws: the shooting and killing scenes in the bus are way too brutal for young children while the somewhat stereotypical ending waters the movie down and may seem ridiculous to many adults. The only other negative point is the fact that the homage automatically copies a lot from the initial movies and isn't that original and fresh anymore.<br/><br/>But in the end this is well crafted entertainment for old and young with a multitude of influences and a stunningly great acting that is only watered down by a childish ending after many mature and intense moments. After many weak cinematic months, this is finally a very well done movie for the whole family."
"Hellmant","10","1","4","13 June 2011"," Nostalgia at it's best!
","'SUPER 8': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Nostalgia at it's best! 'SUPER 8' is a great throwback to the 80's sci-fi kids films that inspired it. Just like producer Steven Spielberg's classic flicks from that decade. Writer/director J.J. Abrams has been quoted by many to be the next Spielberg and with this film I think he definitely lives up to that representation (also following the very impressive 'STAR TREK' reboot from 2 years ago). The movie is a classic coming of age film mixed with adventure and sci-fi, much like many of the great films of the 80's like 'E.T.', 'THE GOONIES', 'EXPLORERS', etc.. The film stars a group of mostly unknown child actors like Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths (both in their film debut roles) as well as Elle Fanning, Zach Mills, Ryan Lee and Gabriel Basso. It's complete fun popcorn entertainment with equally impressive parts of alien action flick adventure and emotional coming of age drama.<br/><br/>The movie is set in 1979 when 13 year old Joe Lamb (Courtney) just lost his mother to a work accident. It flashes forward four months to when Joe is helping his three friends make a zombie movie on Super 8 film. The director of the flick Charles (Griffiths) asks one of the most beautiful and popular girls at his school, Alice (Fanning), to star in his film because he has a crush on her (I know this move pretty well). Once filming Joe and Alice hit it off instead though, much to Charles' disappointment. While filming at a local train station the five kids witness a train wreck and capture glimpses of it on film. When people begin disappearing and strange occurrences keep occurring the kids find themselves involved in something well over their heads.<br/><br/>The movie is whimsical and very adventurous as well as touching and full of strong character driven drama. It works best as a coming of age film, despite the cool effects and thrilling action scenes. The mystery and surprises touted in the advertisements are nothing more than a marketing gimmick. The film is pretty straight forward traditional film telling and pretty much everything you'd expect from the trailers going into it. The previews did a good job of not giving away too much of the film or revealing the monster to you but there's really no mystery here. Just a good old fashioned kids monster movie. The effects are impressive and the action scenes are well shot and edited, never showing you more than you need to see until the big payoff at the end. The drama builds at the same rate as the action though and the two climaxes occur at the same time (which is the way all great films like this should play out). Spielberg of course set the mold for films like this, Shyamalan and others have followed to great results. This is another masterpiece in the same league. It will probably disappoint those looking for something more (in the way of action and special effects) but for movie nerds like myself it fulfills everything about cinema we grew up loving.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4tG6zhJxO8"
"EnderAK08","8","1","4","12 June 2011"," Awesome film with a few loose ends
","When JJ Abrams (Star Trek, MI-3), was making Super 8 he reportedly had an idea for two separate movies: one about what might be hiding in Area 51, the other about kids making a movie with those old Super 8 cameras. The two completely separate ideas mesh rather well. <br/><br/>The kids are filming a zombie movie at a train station in the middle of the night. It's a love scene interrupted when the kids' science teacher steers his car right onto an incoming and train, and in a magnificent crash scene, the train derails and ""something"" escapes. <br/><br/>I'll try not to ruin the rest of the story, as it involves ""the something"" terrorizing the town, while Abrams frames the entire story in the context of the main character Joe's relationship with his father and the cute, but older, girl (Elle Fanning) they've hired as the zombie movie's love interest. <br/><br/>The child acting here is outstanding, on par with the few adult characters. Fanning especially stands out, being the eldest and the love interest for two of the other boys. Abrams makes the right choice in framing the story around these kids and their camera, relying more on emotion and laughs than thrills and horror (which are certainly here).<br/><br/>There's Abrams' ever-present lens flare, and Spielberg's influence as a producer is obvious: the entire thing plays like the Goonies and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and in doing so, sends you back to the movies that inspired it. It's nothing new, rather it's a reminder of how awesome those movies were. <br/><br/>The film isn't without its flaws: there's a cheesy sentimental and disappointing ending, some plot threads go unresolved or unexplained, but it won't stop you from enjoying every minute of the movie. The best summer movie of '11 so far. <br/><br/>8/10"

","such as ET. The opening credit of ""Super 8"" shows on the left top corner of the frame a familiar silhouette of the bicycle-cum-baby-carriage against the full moon, bringing back the most joyful moment in ""ET"". Despite the tribute and Spielberg's stamp of approval, ""Super 8"" is not ""ET"". I'll come to that later. Also, that is not to say that ""Super 8"", taken on its own merit, is not a good movie.<br/><br/>In the overwhelming shadow of ""ET"", ""Super 8"" nevertheless has something all of its own to boast about. It is a movie about making movies. If you sit back to think, you'll be surprised at the large number of movies in this category, from Truffaut's lofty ""La nuit americaine"" (1973) to recent whimsical satire ""Be kind rewind"" (2008). Even more remarkable is the absolutely clever treatment of this subject. The kids' effort to make an 8mm movie takes the backseat as a mere plot device, until the final credit roll (don't leave early). Magically, all the scattered scenes about this you saw throughout the movie but didn't pay much attention to are strung together and edited into the final products emerging from the kids' effort, their entry to the contest entitled ""The case"".<br/><br/>""Super 8"" is indeed similar to ""ET"" in a number of ways. Both are focused on children, on the world seen through their eyes, and on strange happenings that forever change their lives. ""Super 8"" builds on familiar material of parent-children relationship, adolescent love triangle, guilt and remorse, reconciliation and absolution. This is the human aspect of ""Super 8"" and has its own charm, especially in shaping the characters of the 6 kids involved in the project. The alien aspect however is where it fails miserably. The role of the big bad government is fine. The alien however is nothing more than a shallow self-contradiction. With the excellent special effect, it would be better if the movie makers have taken the alien to the abhorrence of Stephen King's ""IT"" (1990 – TV) or the aliens series instead of making a limp and half baked effort to try to humanize it.<br/><br/>What makes this movie shine is the cast of children: Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, Riley Griffiths, Ryan Lee, Zach Mills and Gabriel Basso."

There are not one but two single, dysfunctional fathers raising alienated, resentful children. Needless to say, they will all learn valuable life lessons by the time the movie's over.

","Super 8 is a great thrill ride involving teenagers and a monster. The film is about a bunch of teenagers trying to make a film in the year 1979. During filming, they witness an accident involving a car and a train. After that, mysterious things begin to happen like people disappearing. <br/><br/>It reminds me of JJ's Cloverfield, except the monster in this film is different. Unlike Cloverfield, this monster actually has a heart when he decides not to kill a boy who was trying to sweet talk him. Yes this monster can actually listen to you. <br/><br/>Special mention should go for the special effects and sound. It was as if I was actually there in the quiet and dark petrol station when the monster starts attacking.<br/><br/>I was prepared to give the movie a rating of 9/10, but changed my mind when I saw the climax, which I cannot accept. The climax is that the monster actually builds a spaceship and uses it to go home. It feels so ET and I feel that this ending should not be in this movie. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie for those who loves a suspenseful thriller and I am giving this movie a rating of 7/10 just because of the climax. This is truly the best thriller of the year."
"gregeichelberger","7","1","4","11 June 2011"," Spielberg goes back to early roots, takes Abrams with him
","Producer Steven Spielberg took novice director J.J. Abrams (""Mission: Impossible III,"" ""Star Trek"") for a ride with his newest production, ""Super 8,"" and man was it a trip. The veteran helmer - who won Academy Awards for his World War II pictures, ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" - reaches back into his earliest efforts to bring to life a screenplay he had tucked away for decades.<br/><br/>Abrams utilizes elements of ""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" and ""The Goonies"" (written but not directed by Spielberg), among others in this story of a group of small town Ohio preteens making a zombie movie for a super 8 film contest in the summer of 1979. The picture also bears a passing resemblance to 2006's ""Cloverfield,"" but please don't let THAT fact frighten you away.<br/><br/>Led by Charles (Riley Griffith), the brains behind the project, the cast includes sensitive makeup artist and go-fer, Joe Lamb (newcomer Joel Courtney) - who lost his mother in a steel mill accident four months earlier. Others involved in making the movie-within-a-movie are zombie actor, Cary (Ryan Lee), bumbling detective, Martin (Gabriel Basso), the detective's ""wife,"" Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning, Dakota's little sis, ""Because Of Winn-Dixie"") and befuddled extra, Preston (Zach Mills).<br/><br/>While filming a touching ""love"" scene at a railroad depot late one night, the kids are witness to a horrible train derailment - possibly caused by one of their biology teachers (Glynn Turman). The small super 8-mil. camera, however, witnesses something much more sinister. Thank goodness Abrams followed the example of ""Jaws"" and ""Alien"" (and NOT ""Cloverfield"") by waiting until the end of the proceedings before revealing the entity.<br/><br/>Air Force personnel soon begin streaming into the town to contain the damage caused by the derailment - as well as the curiosity of local law enforcement - especially deputy sheriff, Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler, ""King Kong,"" ""The Kingdom""), whose relationship with his son is strained to the breaking point. Headed by fanatical Col. Nelec (Noah Emmerich ""The Truman Show,"" ""Miracle,"" ""Little Children""), the military unit wants to find whatever escaped the wreck that night, even if it means spreading fraudulent information or causing a fake panic and evacuation.<br/><br/>Alice soon disappears and while in Air Force custody, the kids get a close up look at what the boys in blue are after. Abrams is not above throwing a few new tricks into the mix here, but stays faithful to his mentor's love affair with the good side of aliens and the often dark heart of human nature. The children are funny, touching and heart-tuggingly real, just like most of Spielberg's young actors (with the exception of the kid who played ""Short Round"" in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom""), and the ""love affair"" between Joe and Alice is simple and sweet, just like the way we remember our first crushes were.<br/><br/>Adults in this feature range from super good to unbelievably evil, but there is a nice twist with Alice's father, Louis (Ron Eldard, ""Scent Of a Woman,"" ""Blackhawk Down"") and deputy Lamb. Meanwhile, David Gallagher, the cute little blonde kid from the TV series ""Seventh Heaven,"" has a field day as a stoner film store clerk.<br/><br/>Overall, a nice time at the cinema with plenty of laughs to go along with some genuinely frightening moments. Abrams also bring a deft hand to directing kids here, whose stories vastly overshadow the plights of the grown-up population. And for those who like to slip out of the theatre right when the credits begin to roll, give yourself a few minutes at the conclusion of ""Super 8,"" when the children's homemade film project, ""The Case,"" is revealed in its entirety.<br/><br/>It's a wonderful way to wrap up a very good summer edition to the season's blockbuster lineup."

","This is one of the summer's strongest entries and well worth seeing. The kids are for the most part great, and it's even more amazing when you consider that some of them are in their first feature film. Spielberg's influence is very evident and the alien monster looks so much like the one from Cloverfield that I began to wonder if there were unstated connections between the two films. In any case, I like both films, but this one is the better. It obviously had a larger budget and thankfully left out the shaky hand-held camera techniques.<br/><br/>If you like science fiction films that intend to tug at your heart strings, this is a don't miss film.

Super 8, is the savior I have been waiting for.<br/><br/>Super 8 is a truly amazing experience and to say that is a blend of many 80's kids Sci-Fi films is definitely an accurate speculation. However, I feel that the strongest comparison would be E.T. meets Stand By Me. The film has many memorable parts and to spoil them would be a crime so just trust me when I say that it is worth all time and money that you will spend to see it.<br/><br/>Finally, watch out for the train scene because it will send your hearing in to a panic.

What we didn't realize was that every few min one of the kids would be swearing. The movie was exciting and fun but the language ruined it. We had to have a discussion with our son about how inappropriate the language was in the movie. So disappointed... It seams like it's getting harder and harder to watch a movie without horrible language. I would have rated this movie an 8 without all the bad language. The kids did a great job acting and I wish that the writers / directors would have cleaned up the language. If it wasn't for the language I would probably buy this movie when it comes out on DVD. The action and special effects were great!!! and I liked how the movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was happening and what was going to happen next, but again I have to say that every time the kids would say a swear word I was so disappointed. It took away so much from the movie. I wish that move writers would figure out that they don't have to as swear words to make the movie seem real. Their were lot's of other words that could have been used."

","A group of kids from Ohio in 1979 are making a Super 8mm zombie movie when they witness a massive train wreck. They soon realize that the circumstances surrounding it are supernatural in nature. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say that I enjoyed this science fiction thriller which functions much like an old 1950s monster movie. The film takes awhile before clicking together and making sense, and when it does it's a very rewarding ride. I appreciated that even though it utilizes heavy CG effects, these did not overpower the story. The characters are well-written, and we're able to invest some emotion in them. Even though the story depicts a savage and deadly giant monster (sort of echoing CLOVERFIELD), somehow we are able to feel sorry for it and sympathize with his goal as revealed later in the movie. Young actress Elle Fanning is the sister of Dakota Fanning (who I enjoyed in HIDE AND SEEK and WAR OF THE WORLDS), and it's plain to see that acting talent runs in their family. There didn't seem to be any real need to make the incidents occur in the retro period of the 1970s or to have them engulf a group of children filming their own home movie project, but as a fan of monster flicks and the '70s myself, this was an extra bonus for me to treasure. *** out of ****"

","Small town America, the most unassuming place in the entire world for anything amazing or spectacular to happen, and yet it does in 1979 Lilian, Ohio. Super 8 is a fond throwback to the time that the filmmaker, J.J. Abrams, grew up in. A time running around with your friends making home movies, just when you started liking girls, and still at a time when you believed in the mysteries around us all.<br/><br/>Joe is our hero, a 12-year-old boy whose mother recently died. His father, a police deputy, has no idea how to relate to his son. Joe wants to help his best friend Charles finish his zombie movie, and it doesn't hurt that his crush, Alice, is the lead actress. Upon sneaking out one night to film a pivotal scene in Charles's movie, this lovable gang of pre-teens witness a train crash carrying a peculiar cargo, leading to the U.S. military's arrival in Lilian, along with a monster that starts wreaking havoc across the town.<br/><br/>Super 8 is a movie that wears its heart on its sleeve, and it is the better for it. So many monster movies fall in the B-movie tropes of forsaking any sort of character for the monster, and Super 8 is the other way around. In a way, this movie could have been made, and possibly have been better had it not been so focused on constantly trying to give us the monster thrills to make this a Summer blockbuster. The relationship between Joe and Alice develops nicely, and is just plain cute and authentic, with newcomer Joel Courtney and the other Fanning, Elle Fanning obviously having some sort of chemistry. The movie often stumbles when it tries to cut away from our young heroes, and focus on the adult perspective which is where majority of the exposition to the monster portion of the movie takes place, following Joe's dad as he tries to understand what is truly going on in Lilian.<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams' screenplay is exceedingly well written, with his dialogue mirroring almost any pre-teen boy or girl, and the characters seem to represent at least someone you knew at that age of innocence. Whether you were the quiet Joe, or the artistic and bossy Charles, or the pyromaniac Cary (who needs a whole bunch of Ritalin), these characters take the viewer back to their own Middle School days.<br/><br/>As pure entertainment, Super 8 excels, as a monster movie, it can stand proudly alongside many of the 1950s classics, but it lacked that special something that could have made it something more than a monster movie. That something was in there, but the monster overshadowed it. While the monster is incredibly cool, each time I saw it I just wanted to get back to Joe and see what was happening with him, Charles, and their friends making their movie, which is where the true heart of the story lies, and ultimately only three-fifths of the story takes place. Though it's easy to overlook when you have David Gallagher from 7th Heaven stealing the show as the pot dealer working at the local film developer.<br/><br/>I give Super 8 a 7 out of 10!"

","After seeing this film I've been overwhelmed by both Wonder and Awe, and disappointment.<br/><br/>And that is what this movie was. I don't even need to describe the first half of the film. It just pure 70s and 80s movie magic. Albeit a bit slow up until the train crash, which may be one of the best action scenes I've seen in a movie for YEARS, but after that it moves along just fine. The child actors are wonderful, believable, and hilarious. Deputy Lamb and the other father character are great. The only character who proves weak and annoying was the Air force colonel, or captain, or whatever he is. His character was so underdeveloped and badly written that I found that every scene that he was in was hindered by him.<br/><br/>The Alien attacks are mysterious and creepy, exactly what I wanted going into the movie. Another great scene is when the police (I actually enjoyed the moderately humorous group of local cops as much as I enjoyed the kids) are jotting down the locations of the scores of dogs who have fled from their homes and the dots create a perfect circle around the town. That is what movies like this should be like. That is sci-fi mystery movie wonder. Scenes like this continue to carry the film for a quite a while, and it is not until the final fourth that everything starts to go wrong.<br/><br/>First of all, when the train crashed at the beginning many little white cubes spilled out of crates from the rail cars, and the main character ends up with one in his room. Eventually these things come into play.<br/><br/>The scene that marks the beginning of this fourth part is when Deputy Lamb is in military custody. While he is being escorted to the bathroom, Lamb suddenly knocks out the soldier, steals his M-16, and before you know it he's dressed up in a us army uniform and is blowing up a truck as a distraction so he can escape the base. Now, this scene comes out of nowhere and is the first of many that feel a bit out of place. Earlier in the film he is seen being arrested by the military, but this was MUCH earlier. It's as though Abrams either forgot about it, or was ignoring it because he realized that he had written himself into a corner and finally he just used whatever excuse he could think of to get Lamb out of the base and back to town.<br/><br/>Soon after that the kids break into the trailer of their old teacher Mr. Woodward, the man who intentionally crashed the train, and they find plenty of film footage and evidence. They find out through old films that Woodward was in the military and that the air force was holding the alien captive. Apparently the creature is psychic and can communicate through touch. So when it lifts Woodward ten feet off the ground and promptly drops him, he immediately knows that... the alien just wants to go home on its space ship but the army won't let it. Fantastic. All of my expectations were crushed at that point in favor of the oldest alien storyline in the book. But getting past that, they see that those little white cubes can form solid metal and then dissolve into cubes again in the blink of an eye. And so when all of the cubes, including the one in the main character's room, fly toward the town water tower, it's a safe bet that that's where the ship is going to be. They also learn that the creature is subterranean, and they find the entrance to the alien's cave and discover what looks like the skeleton of a space ship being built inside. Not to mention the bodies of several towns people hanging from the ceiling. These are two things that are confusing and never make sense. One being, if the alien is building a ship out of the little white things, of which there are plenty, why is he also building this thing underground? Never explained. Also, there is a shot in this scene where the alien is holding what APPEARS to be a human leg close to his mouth, and one of the kids says, ""He's eating people!"" Ironically this line actually gave me hope that the movie would stay on a darker course, and the rest of the scene where the alien chucks two people to what must certainly be their deaths gave me more hope. But then, just when I was hoping for something spectacular as the children are cornered by the alien, the least spectacular thing that could possibly happen happens. The kid talks to it and it walks away. Thrilling, isn't it.<br/><br/>So yes, it appears that it is a nice alien now, and as stated before, all it wants to do is go home. And that is why that scene confused me. One second he's supposedly eating people and the next he's shooed off by a little boy. surrounding this scene there are some good action shots of the military blowing everything up as the kids run for their lives, but these are soon abandoned for the final, terribly anticlimactic scene. The alien climbs to the tops of the water tower, gets in its ship, and flies away.<br/><br/>But even then, that leaves three fourths of good,solid, summer action movie magic! So why does this one fourth seem to consume so much of what I have to say about this movie? Because everything else was fantastic, so naturally I expected a fantastic ending. And that is why I feel so disappointed right now. Out of all of the parts that they could have slipped up on, they chose the most important."

","This is not just about Steven Spielberg or J.J. Abrams... or paying homage to anyone or anything. So do yourself a favor, and put all of that out of your mind when you go see Super 8.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of movies, movie-making, a good storyline, well acted interaction between characters...<br/><br/>Then you will most likely love Super 8. <br/><br/>There is some action, some blood, a few jump scares etc. But the real quality parts of Super 8 is the character relationships and how their stories unfold. Dialogue between the characters is very good and it moves the story along at a good pace in my opinion. They fill in the blanks with facts just when you start to wonder, ""Why?""<br/><br/>The alien is indeed mean, creepy, and hard to sympathize with. But if you listen to the reasons, then you will understand why.<br/><br/>The creature is not without compassion. In the end you will not only be happy it has left the planet, but you will also be happy for the alien as well."
"vbhman","7","1","5","10 June 2011"," The JJ Abrams Formula
","I'm as big of a Abrams fan as anyone but I am starting to find a formula that he, in my opinion needs to separate himself from. I noticed this with LOST and CLOVERFIELD specifically and now with SUPER 8. As you know in all three of these Abrams likes to keep it very secret and not tell you anything to build up the hype by producing very vague trailers. Then when you watch the movie its almost the same thing throughout the movie or show its all build up. This is cool like once in my opinion to really know nothing until the end and it would be okay if it were more frequent if the delivery was beyond par but in all these films the build up always far surpasses the delivery. The ending specifically in SUPER 8 and LOST are super weak and/or unoriginal with CLOVERFIELD the whole movie is just build up no attempt to deliver a concluding endings. <br/><br/>I also am aware he is producer in those other concepts but I certainly think he has creative control. BUT!!! this still was a great film in many other ways, it was a great homage to Spielbergs earlier films. The kid actors did really well and had pretty witty lines that were constant. The action had great suspense so that's why I gave this film a 7 and the ending or final ""delivery"" I would give it somewhere between a 1 and 3 but had that been slightly more original or interesting I would of easily given this film a 9 or 10 but again the end was so weak to me that it ruined it by at least three stars."

","Super 8 was one of the movies I was looking forward to all year and while it was slight disappointing I enjoyed it immensely. Super 8 looks absolutely great, with superb effects and cinematography. The score also fits well with the movie without feeling too generic, it is tautly directed by Abrams and the script and characters are engaging with the feel of a Spielberg film which made Super 8 somewhat nostalgic in a sense. The story, making the most of an intriguing concept, does have heart and poignancy and also quite intense, while the acting particularly from Elle Fanning is very impressive. Also, the train crash set piece is simply spectacular. If there is a let down though, it is the final act, which feels like a different movie altogether. The looser it gets, the less tense and more heavy handed it gets, and that's a shame because the rest of Super 8 was excellent. Overall, started off excellent but meandered making the final result just very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

It is science fiction, and it has a decent sense of adventure. One of the reasons why I like ""E.T."" better is that some of this movie's scenes were too loud and chaotic. The bike chase at the end of ""E.T."" is thrilling, and one of the reasons why is because there's just the right amount of things going on that you really get involved with what's happening to the characters. Sometimes ""Super 8"" contained too much chaos. Michael Giacchino (""Star Trek"",""Up"")composed the music, so it was pretty good, although I wish the movie had a recognizable theme. With a few exceptions, not many movies these days have musical themes. The suspense was good, and the acting wasn't bad.

"thesar-2","8","1","7","11 June 2011"," Cloverfield: The Beginning
","J.J. Abrams doesn't like to give away much, especially in his film's trailers. It's a wonder they ever make moneyÂ…for those who don't know who he is.<br/><br/>He did it with 2008's Cloverfield and now with Super 8. If the coming attraction was wide open, like most movie previews, it would probably have a tagline such as ""If you liked Goonies, Stand by Me or E.T., you'd likeÂ…""<br/><br/>Dang; I promised not to spoil too much, like what's already been given away by a lot of viewers and critics. Suffice to say: yes, it's like thoseÂ…and it's set in 1979, so anyone up for a little nostalgia, should see this immediately.<br/><br/>I relished in the homage played and the inside jokes for many things, including the ""advanced technology,"" just recently defunct, walk-man. But, similar to the 2009 Abrams reboot: Star Trek, the props and feel are just part of the fun and joy.<br/><br/>Those were fantastic. This guy KNOWS kids, namely adolescent boys. He had them pegged and the timeframe they were dealing with. This feels extremely like it was made in 1979, but with today's technology. So, I guess I'm saying: it's not only great for nostalgia's sake, it's perfect for those of us who not only grew up in that era, but for those film lovers of the above mentioned films/series.<br/><br/>Allow me to go into the plot line, from pretty much the trailer's POV plus a little more that won't spoil too much: several Ohio kids are filming a movie when all of a sudden a train crashes â€“ not just in their presence, but right on top of them andÂ…something escapes. Following that, the town is thrown into turmoil due to lost dogs, appliances and electricity. Toss in the big, bad government/military and intentional confusion and you have another throwback to the 1970's monster movies.<br/><br/>It definitely goes beyond that, as it has a lot to do with the film the kids are making, in addition toÂ…well, young love.<br/><br/>I really don't want to give away too much more. About the plot that is. What I will comment on is all the other wonderful aspects beyond the fantastic re-creation of an era I grew up in. Such as great cinematography, both depth to the characters and chemistry between them â€“ you'd think they really had known each other since kindergarten and special effects that were not only good, but brought you back to another timeframe: the original Jurassic Park from 1993.<br/><br/>Now, the movie's not perfectÂ…the ""creature"" that's hidden from audiences that haven't seen this, is really clichÃ©d and not very imaginative. (It really reminded me of much larger 'Species 8472' from Star Trek: Voyager. Wow, that's a double whammy: it dates me in addition to outing me as both a trekker and a Voyager fan. For all of that, I declare: I am not ashamed.) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_8472<br/><br/>Also, it has severe pacing problems and yeah, a lot of it could've been edited out. I'm curious to hear (in the future Bluray's audio commentary) if this was intentional. For, when you go back to movies of our (or could just be my) era, it was pretty much the same thing. It generally took forever to get to the ""goods."" A perfect example is: Superman: The Movie.<br/><br/>When I was a kid, the same age as the boys/girl in this movie, I loved Superman II. Why? Because Superman shows up all-but immediately and there's tons of action. And yet, Superman: The Movie is 10x the film the first sequel was even though it takes well over an hour before Kal-El finds his tights.<br/><br/>These slow, plot-building/character-developing scenes were common in the 1970s, 1980s and probably before that. Okay, I get that, and I get the yearning to bring us all back. I don't think they needed to go that far.<br/><br/>So, I don't think I'll be seeing this again anytime soon â€“ I'm really testy when it comes to slow-moving films that would be better off with a higher speed, even though, I did have a ton of fun during this. The dialogue between the kids wasn't just REAL, but often enormously hilarious. Not to mention the acting/closeness/chemistry from the kids was genuine, namely from lead children Charles (Riley Griffiths â€“ who really channeled the heavier-set kid from the introduction in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) and lead Joe (Joel Courtney â€“ who is this generation's ""Elliot"" from E.T. He not only did a fantastic job here, he literally carried the entire movie with his acting, emotions and facial expressions. If I was a 13-year-old boy again, he would be the one I would both relate and yearn to be the most.)<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this fun movie. It does get darker and more violent as the movie progresses â€“ something it doesn't promise in the first half â€“ so, leave the little kids at home. If I were back to these kid's ages, when I absolutely loved films like this, I would probably watch this hundreds of times and love every minute of it, despite my ""grown up"" viewpoint nowadays.<br/><br/>Side Note: OHÂ…I forgotÂ…Don't forget to stay through 90% of the end credits. I knew to, thanks due a certain movie-review podcast, http://www.fatguysatthemovies.com/. I did see a lot, if not more than two-thirds of the audience, leave before the ""surprise"" finale during the end credits. Make sure you stick aroundÂ…if you really had a great time, like I did, it'll be enhanced in the conclusion."

Later on, as they were all making their getaway in the yellow vehicle, the car was bobbing or rocking up and down, as if it was moving. Really? Cars don't move in that manner unless there was a series of speed bumps under its wheels. Production value? Went way down on that alone."
"zetes","8","1","10","12 June 2011"," Derivative, but still really good
","J.J. Abrams aims to make an homage to Spielberg (who co-produced) in this summer blockbuster. The homaging is pretty rampant, and you'll catch references not just to Spileberg's films (mostly Close Encounters, E.T. and The Goonies, which he produced), but to Carpenter's The Thing, Romero's The Crazies and Night of the Living Dead, Bong's The Host and Abrams' own Cloverfield (which he produced and co-wrote). All of this can make the film, at times, seem derivative, but, amazingly, it mostly works. The reason is the cast. The protagonists are a group of kids who are making a film. Newcomer Joel Courtney is the son of a local deputy (Kyle Chandler). Elle Fanning is the slightly older girl who is newly joining the group as the film's star (of course, she becomes Chandler's love interest). The other kids are played by Riley Griffiths, Gabriel Basso, Zach Mills and Ryan Lee (particularly memorable as the kid obsessed with explosives). While they're filming their zombie movie, they witness a horrific train derailment that releases something mysterious into their small Ohio town. The air force (led by Noah Emmerich) arrives shortly thereafter to investigate the weird goings-on which are disrupting the town. The film is nothing original, but those kids are so wonderful they make the film thoroughly enjoyable. Abrams also knows how to build a set-piece, although, occasionally, he goes over the top. The film is funny when it needs to be, and it can be very scary at times, too. This is certainly a very enjoyable time at the movies."

","I don't remember why I skipped this movie in 2011. I always wanted to see it, so tonight I did. It's missing an identity/heart/soul. I'm convinced Stranger Things stole it's idea from this movie, but added complexity, visions, the Upside Down, and a female friend with Jean Grey abilities (and fun for its first 2 seasons). Super 8 in a nutshell: One night, middle school friends try to shoot a short film for a contest. They see a mad scientist-teacher trying to stop a train. Things explode. Elle Fanning should have died but she's alive. An alien runs wild. Secretive, shady, unethical and unbelievably violent military guys show up. They clash with local cops. Hollywood really shows contempt for our military based on the ugly, terroristic portrayal of them in movies. Evacuations, fires and family fights occur. Elle Fanning rides a bike and cries. She faces off with the alien. She lives. More explosions. Military and cops argue. Elle Fanning ends up in the aliens lair. Others in the lair are eaten, not Elle Fanning. She faces off with the alien again. A young boy, suddenly an alien whisperer, talks to the alien. The alien runs away. Elle Fanning lives. More running and action. The alien builds a space ship, and its magnetic pull steals a kid's locket necklace with his dead Mother's picture. It's shown as a sweet moment. What?! Townspeople look sad to see it go, despite it eating townspeople and destroying businesses and homes. Nothing is explained. It came. It ate. It destroyed. It left. 1-star for the casting. Mostly likeable and good chemistry. Elle Fanning is a stand-out in 2 scenes. David Gallagher provides some comic relief. 1-star for the first 30 minutes.

","Although at times it seems to have a great premise, and a great story throughout, Super 8 loses its full potential by the end credits. The first 2/3 of the film are incredibly entertaining, suspenseful, and quite funny. However, by the films final act, the tone seems to shift, and all together, it just feels flat. The acting throughout the film is pretty solid, with Elle Fanning providing the best performance from the kids and the adults. The cinematography is quite brilliant, and the special effects are truly terrific. I was not a huge fan of how the film ended, but unlike those who despised the film for being an unoriginal homage to Spielberg, I simply didn't think it was very impactful. The last 20 or so minutes of the film felt pretty dull, and I began to lose interest, which kinda bummed me out. Abrams, who directed, produced, and wrote the film, seems to have a problem finding a true end to the work he seeks out to accomplish, and every time he attempts to do, it seems to be one of 2 things- a cliffhanger, or a lousy ending. In the end however, Abram's vision for most of the film is certainly a very entertaining and thrilling ride. It's sci-fi antics and suspense are very entertaining to watch, even if it loses its way from time to time.

"jayjaycee","7","0","1","25 February 2020"," Supernatural coming of age story
","""Super 8"" is a 2011 mystery thriller directed by J.J. Abrams starring Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning. This movie and I have shared a history together, even if I watched for the first time today. I still remember how I went on a field trip in school and this film was planned to be broadcasted on TV. I was encouraged to watch it with my class mates, but in the end, I was the only one who didn't watch it, simply due to the fact that I was chicken hearted as hell back in then and suddenly decided against it. That's why it was a strange moment for me to finally give it a watch today, with my sisters that are now the same age I was back then and to see that things have come full circle in some way. It wasn't even as bad as I heard, as many complained about the film's nature. To be honest, it's sorta misleading. What else but a masterpiece would you have expected from a Spielberg production in form of an alien film? Another ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind""? Another ""E.T.""? Well, maybe, but remember it's basically an Abrams directed movie. What I immediately realized is that the film is no horror film in the first place, but a coming of age story of eight Ohio small town teenagers trying to make it as a film crew that is coincidentally drawn into the supernatural situation. The film's greatest achievement is how it successfully managed to bring a loveable group of friends to the big screen that stands out even in comparison to the adult actors. Even though he only functions as a producer, the Spielberg type of magic is palpable between the characters. They all also perform on a decent level, but Elle Fanning is terrific in here! She's one of my favourite actresses and really impressed me again, as she's shining in every scene she's in. It fits decently into the atmosphere of the film that's more children friendly mystery thriller than an alien horror flick. Nevertheless, one of the most prominent flaws of this flick are the run time and story development. It's stretching it's substance way too much and this sorta disturbs a consistent and well paced buildup of suspense. Aside from that, it's not overall scary and the design of the alien isn't quite frightening, but it definitely has some unexpected medium level brutality in it that hits if you constantly remind yourself that it's a children suitable film in the first place. It wasn't the most brutal thing I've ever seen in a film, but I personally still felt totally nervous at times, cause I always tried to see it from the perspective of my teenaged sisters who sat next to me and possibly might find it too scary. Considering this, I was unintentionally thrilled at times together with them and I think that was an advantage, as I was able to see it as if I was a member of the target audience. Furthermore, as it's known from a Spielberg production, it also had a family conflict elaborated in it, a story of loss, grieving and letting go and the final scene with the necklace was heartwarming, least to say. All in all, this flick is more of a supernatural drama than a horror film and definitely plays a significant role as a coming of age film for young adults to learn from. While it has a nice concept, it could have focused more on the flair of it's time, but still manages to entertain decently. It's a promising formula that's already shown there that, if it was perfectly executed, might be iconic and, in my opinion, eventually hit the screen as the famous Netflix show ""Stranger Things"". It's a fun watch, go in it without expecting too much."

"nogodnomasters","7","0","4","3 March 2019"," GREAT MOVIE FOR KIDS EXCEPT FOR THE F BOMB
","Four somewhat geeky jr. high kids opt to make a zombie movie. Joe (Joel Courtney) is one of them. His mother has recently died and his dad (Kyle Chandler) is a deputy who is semi-understanding. Charles (Riley Griffiths) is the brains behind the film. Alice (Elle Fanning) agrees to help them with the movie. After midnight, she drives the foursome to the scene. She doesn't have a license and is worried because the deputy's son is with them. Joe promises not to tell. One boy, Cary, has a love for fire and fireworks. Alice's father (Ron Eldard) gets in trouble with the law. Her relationship with Joe is not welcomed by him. This develops into a background Romeo and Juliet scenario, something for the young teen girl appeal.<br/><br/>As they are rehearsing a scene at the station, a train is coming down the tracks. Charles scrambles to get a film clip of the train while shooting the scene. Then it happens: a white pick-up truck speeds by the train. There is a wreak. The kids panic and run for their lives as RR cars explode all around them. When the smoke clears they take a quick headcount. There are things which look like a white Rubik's cubes all around them.<br/><br/>Charles recognizes the driver of said white truck; it is his fourth period biology teacher, Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman, a black man with a PhD. in biology teaching middle school in white suburban Lillian, Ohio). In his near dying breath the teacher instructs the kids not to say anything or else they and their families will be hunted down and killed! As GI Joe shows up at the scene, the kids grab their equipment and speed out of there...and they take one of the cubes.<br/><br/>The Air Force has taken charge of the clean up. The town's people are kept away and in the dark. Then weird things start to happen...Sheriff goes missing, dogs go missing, car engines go missing, microwaves go missing. There is clearly a ""monster"" thing on the loose, but the camera doesn't let us see it, very similar to many of the Jurassic Park/ Predator scenes. I wish I had seen this on IMAX. There are a number of scenes where things suddenly ""jump out at you."" This always makes it fun for a bunch of kids at the theater.<br/><br/>Spielberg/ Adams bring out the best in the child actors making them very convincing and realistic. The humor is pointed at kids. When Alice asks how to be a zombie, Joe tells her to act like their English teacher. The movie contains numerous anachronisms: Rubik's cube and Walkman came out in 1980 while the movie takes place in 1979. Elle Fanning is asked to play a number of different parts in this film, and she does them all well. I felt like I was watching her audition tape.<br/><br/>At some point in time, the hippie (store clerk who tries to sell Charles pot) lets out a WTF. Here we have a film clearly aimed at kids and they drop the F-bomb in it. There was absolutely no need for it. They made the rating unwatchable for the target audience which is also financially irresponsible."

","Abrams and Spielberg fused (kinda) their styles to give us the film that might bring us back to the 80's, also known as definitely not super expensive CGI effects time!... By using super expensive CGI effects.<br/><br/>Lets start with the horrible this time, because the good outweights it: The story is definitely not for kids unlike E.T. (Where the film borrows a lot by the way: including the alien wants to go home), and it has crude violence that has nothing to do with anything. The effects are extremely distracting most of the time because they collide with the 80's themed scenario (specially the lens flares. Seriously, stop it. It looks horrible and even hurts), including the collision of a train that basicly transforms the movie into a Michael Bay erection helper for about 5 minutes, that adds nothing, could have been completely left out or shortened in the worst case. Later we got another explotion fest that lasts for 10 minutes, was even more unnecesary and went into pointlessness quickly. It was just artificial drama for the sake of it. Nothing was compelled, or added. Pointless.<br/><br/>The plot was amazing. Spielberg took the horrible ET 2 script (this exists. Basicly ET tortures children and later becomes litteral god) and got it reviewed. The biology teacher plot point was handfisted but it works marvels. The ending was heartwarming, but absolutely dumb how everyone (including soldiers that, lets remember, want the alien captured) just look at the alien leaving as if it was ET... again.<br/><br/>The scenography is so good, so incredibly good. I have actually not a complaint: It looks perfect. The photography was marvelous too. <br/><br/>The dialog was pretty credible. It had terrible moments, but they are so sparce they do not affect the movie. The audio was amazing. The music was great.<br/><br/>Lots of love were into this film... too bad the bad was annoying enough to affect the overall experience. Watch this. And watch the credit scene. It is gold."

"SophieKitty7","7","0","2","4 June 2018"," Fun movie but
","The story was interesting, kids finding something out by mistake, being the only ones who knew other sides of the story, yea fine<br/><br/>Problem was that usually movies give the point of the movie before half the movie is through, they usually know what they are fighting or what they are supposed to find<br/><br/>but in this?
I was waiting for the kids to get superpowers throughout most of the movie (mainly because of the movie name......)<br/><br/>While those kids looked like they achieved this and that, in reality NONE of what they did, impact the ending even a little bit, it would have ended the exact same way if they were gone!
That alien was building the machine throughout the movie without anyone noticing, in the end the kids were just close enough to witness the machine being turned on, within a minute the spaceship got built through that machine, and it flew off, the kids had nothing to do with the outcome of the movie, it really bugs me<br/><br/>Superpowers i thought a bit too because a little car was able to stop and derail a huge heavy military train, and the driver of that car didnt even die from all those train-wagons exploding and flying around (and of course the most obvious, the impact with the train), because of that i thought that he had superpowers and couldnt die so fast... hoped for whatever was in the trainwreck, to come out, infect the kids with superpowers and THAT would be interesting xD<br/><br/>BUT
all in all, the movie was still fun to watch, a little scarier/darker than some other action movies, but not enough to be a horror movie (even though there is 2-3 jumpscares and some scary silence at times making you expect a jumpscare)
Monster scariness comparable to... the fish from The Host, cant think of another example for now.<br/><br/>If you dont mind a movie where the main characters only work as ""Watchers"" and ""Explainers"" of what happens, then go on watch the movie, its good"

","BOTTOM LINE FIRST: I liked it!
THE GOOD: 
Spielberg doesn't disappoint in production values. 
Abrams keeps his trademark POV action sequences. 
You may cry during the schmaltzy reunion scene. 
The logical advance of plot is mainly intact, though holes will naturally occur on a storyline this broad. 
The cast is pleasant, bringing to life distinct characters that will keep you caring (a VERY important point for me).
1979 setting is realistic enough, including haircuts, vehicles, and so forth, also ""breaking the fourth wall"" for some Back To The Future memories (and yes, Noah Emmerich will remind you of Biff Tannen).
Some very good comedy relief.<br/><br/>THE SORTA-BAD:
The monster is mostly typical, with the requisite heart of gold misshapen by his human military captors. On the plus side, the monster's situation reflects that of the main adolescent characters.
The action scenes, while thrilling, do jump the shark in terms of escape.
Quite a few unresolved or scantily-sketched subplots.<br/><br/>It's a popcorn movie for sure, with a few deeper moments, but it's very well-done, so it gets a 9. You really can't go wrong."
"areatw","5","0","1","15 January 2018"," Distinctly average sci-fi thriller
","'Super 8' starts off promisingly enough, but after the initial scenario is set (in spectacular fashion), the film's lack of ideas are quickly exposed and it nose-dives fast. Technically it's very impressive - well produced and the CGI/special effects are excellent and realistic, but visuals only get you so far. When you dig beyond the surface, there's nothing impressive about 'Super 8' at all. It's no different to 90% of other sci-fi films that have come before it.<br/><br/>It's a distinctly average sci-fi thriller that borrows virtually all of its ideas from elsewhere. Despite all the action sequences, explosions and other special effects, the generic, shallow plot and uninteresting characters make it a completely forgettable film. The glowing reception it received on release is baffling, especially from the critics. 'Super 8' gets an average 5 from me."
"christopherdarveaux","10","0","4","14 August 2017"," A Heartfelt and Effective Combination of Spielberg Magic and Abrams Flair
","The amazing thing about JJ Abrams is that his tastes are always right on. He knows what to say and how to say it. Super 8 is very much it's own story despite the fact that it pays homage to a Spielberg classic: ET - the Extra Terrestrial.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the haters who say JJ can't come up with original ideas. The truth is he can and he does. I felt great sympathy for the main character from the beginning, a very different kind of connection than the audience has with Elliot in ET. Joe Lamb is a 14 year old boy coping with his mother's tragic death caused by the incompetence of a drunk. He copes with it by spending time with his friends as they make a super 8 movie they wish to enter into a local film festival. Charles and the other kids witness a train crash while filming at a station, and afterwards we are in for a hell of a ride.<br/><br/>The story ends up being very poignant when the creature looks into Joe's mind and sees that children do not hold prejudice of adults, and this aspect is why I give this movie a 10 out of 10. Bright, solid, and massive. It reminds us that we as adults should strive for this more, and the two fathers of the main characters end up making amends with one another. Thank you JJ for yet another memorable cinematic experience. <br/><br/>Rating: 10"

"lbishopkyo","2","0","1","15 March 2016"," What happened, J.J.?
","I love Cloverfield (2008) and I think it is one of the best films of all time in my opinion. When I found out that J.J. Abrams was working on another giant-monster flick (and using the same tactic in which you find out it's a monster when you actually see it), I was more than excited. I missed it when it was in theaters, but now that I've finally seen the movie, I can safely say that I am glad I didn't see this in the theaters; this movie is horrible. If I could underline words in this review, ""horrible,"" would be underlined, but that's not important now.<br/><br/>This movie is really stupid. First of all, what kind of parents don't check on their kids and find out that they were out at night during a train wreck? Second, the monster itself (which I call ""Cooper,"" since that's what they called it during filming) is a total disgrace. Cooper himself isn't a bad monster; he's actually very scary, and no, he isn't the Cloverfield monster, and isn't related in any way.<br/><br/>The monster turns out to be friendly. Now, it's one thing to have a friendly monster in a giant-monster movie (Gamera, Godzilla, etc.), but here, it just doesn't work. I will give the film credit though, for telling us where the monster came from this time, but that doesn't help. Turns out, all the monster wanted was to go home like E.T. So what does this 1970s town do? Help it. They sacrifice all the metal they have to rebuild a spaceship for Cooper (the monster) and even the main character gets rid of his necklace with his dead mom on it, which mattered to him more than anything. That, my friend, is not a good ending. The monster tried to kill everyone, and you decide to help it?! Ergh, my brain hurts.<br/><br/>I love Cloverfield, but I don't love Super 8. Please, stay away."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","7 February 2016"," Love letter to the early Spielberg films
","What if E.T. had been caught by government agents and was then experimented upon for years before managing to escape? Okay, sure, that's not the exact story here, but it tells you the style and mood the film is going for. Or would have gone for, had Spielberg decided to make his legendary film with such a story back in the 80s. In many ways this film feels and acts like a retelling of that movie, even having Spielberg working on it as its producer.<br/><br/>And for the most part, it works. The story this time around is that a bunch of kids are looking to shoot a movie of their own for a film competition. One of them, Charles (Riley Griffiths), is a budding director, mad about stories and cameras, while the main character of the film, Joe (Joel Courtney), works as his special effects and makeup guy. They even manage to convince a cute girl from school, Alice (Elle Fanning), to act in their film. Then things take a turn for the weirder when they witness a train crash while shooting a train station scene. And before they know it, their small town is swarming with military and odd things start happening all around.<br/><br/>Very classic Spielberg, with bits and pieces of Stephen King thrown in for added flavour. But I mean that in a good way. It feels nostalgic, like something we haven't seen in decades, but which still feels instantly familiar and comforting. Sure its depiction of American small town life is very idyllic and romanticized, but it still deals with darker themes as well, with Alice coming from a rougher part of town and with Joe's problems with his dad, who's both absent and over-protective at the same time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, while the film has the style and mood down pat, I'm not a huge fan of the story. A truly great film often works because you can identify with all the characters, no matter how strange or twisted they are. E.T. was very sympathetic and identifiable, but you could understand the point of view of the government agents as well. Not so much here. The antagonists are very unlikable, or aren't given any screen time for us to understand them. They're simply there because the film needs a villain, a monster for the kids to overcome. Sure, there are attempts by the script to make the villains more justified in their actions, but it's once again a case of telling, not showing, which makes it way less effective.<br/><br/>Still, I do like all the kid characters and most of the townsfolk are enjoyable as well. The film honestly looks amazing, has a good soundtrack and even story is by no means bad. It just doesn't quite live up to the films it's paying homage to."
"byson5186","4","0","2","9 September 2015"," Watch Earth To Echo Instead
","I saw the movie Earth To Echo yesterday, and then this movie came to my mind. A lot of people compare Earth To Echo to E.T., but I feel like lots of movies with aliens can be compared to E.T. whether they come in peace, or whether they terrorize Earth. The alien we seem to remember the most is E.T. and we remember the Amblin Entertainment Logo. I feel like this movie, Super 8 can be compared to E.T. as it is also a Stephen Spielberg film, it also is supposed to take place around the same time E.T. is supposed to take place, as this movie took place in the late '70s, E.T. took place in the early '80s. The character Joe Lamb at times seems to resemble Elliot. <br/><br/>There are even other movies that deal with people and friendly Extra Terrestrials. There's The Last Mimzy. That movie is a good movie, but isn't talked about too often. I didn't really understand it when I saw it. There's also a Disney movie called Race To Witch Mountain. A movie with one of the more famous actors: The Rock, Dwayne Johnson. It also has Alexander Ludwig and Anna Sophie Robb, both blonde actors who seem to be well known for other movies. In Race To Witch Mountain, the aliens are human, and that's a fun action packed movie with good special effects.<br/><br/>But, a lot of those movies this movie included it might be entertaining but it doesn't seem like something out of the ordinary. I have to say the same about Super 8, while it was a little entertaining it didn't seem too much like it was something out of the ordinary. This movie also made a lot of money, and I wish Earth To Echo did as well as this movie, as I feel like Earth To Echo is very underrated. For one, I feel like Super 8, wouldn't have done as well if it took place in the present day, so they have it take place in the '70s, specifically 1979. A lot of us wish we could go back to the past. We want to know more what the past was like in these eras in recent history, but before our lifetimes. I felt like a lot of this movie was long, a little slow at times, and again nothing we haven't seen. I'd like to talk about similarities to this and Earth To Echo:<br/><br/>1. Both Deal With A Group Of Friends Middle School Aged, Mostly Boys<br/><br/>2. There Is One Girl As Part Of The Group In Both Movies, A Natural Blonde, And A Crush On The Boys, In This Movie It's Alice. In Earth To Echo, It's Emma.<br/><br/>3. Both Movies Are Adventurous. Earth To Echo Seems To Have More Adventure Like Traveling 20 Miles To The Desert. This Movie Seems To Have More The Action, If You Like Action Packed Movies.<br/><br/>4. Both Movies Deals With Kids And An Alien Encounter, Only They And The Government Seem To Be Aware Of.<br/><br/>5. The Government Works On Getting People Out Of Town In Both Movies, Keeping Their Secrets To The Public When It's Really Because Of The Alien.<br/><br/>6. Both Movies Involve A Group Of Friends That Make Lots Of Videos Together.<br/><br/>7. The Kids Drive Cars In Both Movies, And Seem To Be Good At It, As If You Haven't Driven You'll Need Practice In Places Like Parking Lots Before Driving Long Distances On Public Roads. It Doesn't Really Come Naturally.<br/><br/>8. The Main Character In Both Movies, Joe In This Movie And Alex In Earth To Echo Seem Portrayed Somewhat The Same. I Guess Charles Could Be Portrayed A Little Like Munch Too.<br/><br/>9. The Way The Alien Pulls Metal Things, Especially With The Spaceship In Both Movies Pulling Them Off The Ground Is Very Similar.<br/><br/>You guys might even be able to think of other similarities I haven't mentioned. I mentioned on IMDb, similarities to another movie Specifically Home Alone and Blank Check. I'm sure anybody who watches those movies could notice the similarities, But, I prefer Blank Check which I feel is also underrated and a better movie. I feel like it's less dark, and more fun.<br/><br/>While my review might not be helpful, and a lot of you seem to prefer Super 8 over Earth To Echo when I posted an IMDb message board about this earlier. If you're like me watch Earth To Echo, because I feel again that Super 8 isn't nothing that seems too out of the ordinary, like it's predictable. I also feel like this movie is a little slow at times, and nothing too memorable plot wise. I also feel like while it's a movie that will entertain you, it won't leave you like crying at the end and very happy as Earth To Echo can leave you feeling that way. I also feel like Earth To Echo is more fun with the adventure as since it's from a camera point of view, it almost feels like you're with the characters on an adventure.<br/><br/>So, while this review might mostly be a comparison and more so advertising Earth To Echo. I'll say, the most entertaining thing about Super 8 was how it took place in the '70s. For some entertainment, I give it a 4/10."

","We'd heard good things about this film so finally decided to buy it. With names like JJ Abrams and S.Spielberg in the credits, it had to be worth a look. The story concerns a group of school-friends from rather difficult family backgrounds who are making a small 8mm film about zombies. During the filming of one scene, a train de-rails and crashes spectacularly right around them (this sequence is incredibly powerful)and they barely get away with their lives. Then strange things begin to happen.... It's all good so far, and we had great fun spotting the references to Close encounters, ET and of course the mentions of 'Romero'. (SPOILERS FROM HERE) But the end of the film, when the alien creature finally completes its spaceship and leaves is glossed over very quickly and I failed to see just how the kids were in any way involved. Yes, the experience was unifying for the kids and their parents and as a kind of coming-of-age saga it works well, but the alien thread really was excess baggage. And (I may have blinked) what were the cubes for? I so wanted this to be a great film that I could watch over again, but somehow I think it'll sit on the shelf, and that's a shame."

They find out that the alien has taken Jen, so they track it down to its lair and rescue her.<br/><br/>(spoiler) It turns out the alien was trying to use alien technology to construct a space ship to take it home. It succeeds. <br/><br/>In particular, I loved the dialogue and acting of the teenage boys here. Character development and capturing small-town Ohio in 1979 is a big part of the movie. It's very watchable, with plenty of thrills and touching moments.<br/><br/>Joel Courtney pulls it off as the young expressive lead. Riley Griffiths (now an enormous college football player) is great as the overweight young moviemaker. AJ Michalka plays Jen really well. The director succeeds in eliciting great performances here. Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard (two of my favourites) are great as the dads.<br/><br/>A few false tones... The military is evil here -- once again. Also, why the magical moment as the alien takes off. We are supposed to conveniently forget the many it has killed. I guess the idea is that the alien just needed to survive. <br/><br/>Worth about 7.5, but I'm going to round it up. I've enjoyed it the three times I've seen it."
"Rocketeer_Raccoon","8","0","1","31 July 2015"," It's a Super 8 out of 10 from me.
","Wow, I'm really impressed with this movie, Super 8 was made as a throwback to the type of movies that were originally made by Steven Spielberg such as E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind which by the way Spielberg himself was in fact one of the producers for this movie. The only thing I'm still rather confused about is what actually happened to Joe's mother when she died at the start, some kind of work related accident and they never really explain what she worked as and how it happened, I don't know.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the rest of the movie is amazing, it has lots of edge of your seat trills and some really cool action scenes. It's well worth the watch."
"twixx-56554","10","0","1","21 July 2015"," Another classic Spielberg/Abrams film
","In a mix of nostalgia, humor, and emotion, Super 8 hits the mark with another classic from J.J. Abrams. Larry Fong, director of photography, does excellent work channeling a nostalgic film style (including classic film flares) and the whole film feels like it is straight out of the 80s. The film is set in 1979, with a group of teenage boys with a ""Goonies"" feel. Joel Courtney, debuting his acting career as a lead character, is definitely inexperienced with acting but manages to channel his awkwardness into a fantastic pre-teenage character. Coming from a small town in Idaho, Courtney seems comfortable with the setting (which looks and feels a lot like his own hometown). Super 8 is a science fiction film with all the nostalgia of a Spielberg film, and is appealing for all ages."

","Okay so the first thing you are probably thinking is why a 9/10? Well first of, the story was great, it was inspiring and had touching moments.I felt connected with the characters and i simply just wanted to find out what was going on just as much as the kids did. Which brings me to my negative point of view. Kids. The main characters in this movie were in fact kids. It's like Harry Potter meets War of the Worlds except without all the magic wands. However all the main characters are kids, in my opinion this was not what I would call a kids film. There is a lot of deaths and violence in this film but if you are mature enough you wouldn't have a problem with it. However it puzzles me as to why J.J Abrams chose a bunch of 13 year olds to be the main stars. This instantly put me off the film for quite a few years.<br/><br/>But then I saw how wrong I was. <br/><br/>The acting was done perfect by both the 2 main characters. The sad story of the main characters mother was touching and some points really got to me. In fact at some points i started to love this film. But then some of the other children's acting skills started to lag and got quite unbelievable. <br/><br/>But then the ending came and when the main hero made contact with the alien/monster it made up for the bad acting. It is very rare that the story line makes up for the acting. The whole end of the movie was really emotional. Not sad. Just emotional. <br/><br/>All in all i fell in love with the storyline, it had non stop action, mystery, even abit of love and most of all it had meaning. <br/><br/>I recommend this film to any sci-fi action viewer. Or simply I recommend this film to anyone looking for a touching but eventful movie."

","Super 8 is a for sure 10 stars!! It is a heartwarming story about a kid named Joe who loses his mom so escapes that feeling by hanging out with his wannabe movie director friend, Charles. While they are filming one of their home movies, a car drives on the train track which leads to an eye candy of a scene of the kids running from the destruction of the train. And they find out quickly that something extra terrestrial was on that train. This leads to an adventure that Joe must take when his wannabe girlfriend, Alice gets kidnapped by the alien. He runs to get to the alien through the air force tanks and explosions and so forth. This helps him save his now girlfriend and more importantly giving him a relationship with his father. This movie has so much heart to it and its very interesting. I was hooked from the first scene! A great film for everyone and for all ages. A MUST WATCH"
"dusterbomb","6","0","2","2 June 2015"," Passable
","Super 8 is a pretty average film. On a technical level, it's fantastic. The set design was fantastic throughout the film; the caves underneath the town in particular looked really great. They were dingy, wet, and dark. The train station also stuck out to me as very well designed and it was clear early on the guy in charge of set design knew what he was doing. The lighting was great but there were a few scenes where it felt wrong. The lighting in the cave scene as a whole looked good but the lighting on the characters was not that great. It seemed pretty obvious that there was an artificial light source pointed at their faces constantly, seeing as how their faces managed to never leave the light at all. The cinematography, as far as I was concerned, was about as good as it could get. Some of the shots that stuck out included the scene where the kids were talking on the phone and Abrams used these really creatively framed shots from the floor that allowed the camera to capture everything in the scene on both ends without the camera moving at all, which I thought was pretty great. There was also a panning shot during a driving scene where the camera followed the car from the sidewalk, giving the viewer the feeling that they're standing there on the sidewalk themselves watching it drive by. That was really cool. All in all, well made on the technical level. <br/><br/>As far as characters and acting, again this movie shines. The actors are great for the most part (Elle Fanning was flat and seemed like she was bored throughout the entire movie). When characters needed to be emotional (except for Elle's) the acting and writing always supported the scene. The children's dialogue was actually incredibly well written. I didn't really expect them all to be written too well, but the dialogue was consistently great with a few rough spots here and there. They all felt like real kids and their chemistry together works well enough for me to safely say the actors were very well directed and aside from Elle Fanning, every actor did pretty well. They weren't perfect, but no movie is anyways, of course.<br/><br/>I also have to comment before I get to the story that the tone and setting are established incredibly well. There's only one scene in the entire movie that had tone whiplash, and that was mostly due to a necessary transition for the plot. The time of the movie was actually established without the movie telling me anything. As I watched it, I observed the music playing and all the timely posters and set pieces to guess the time period the movie was set in. I guessed late 70s-early 80s. And sure enough, the movie took place in 1979. The fact that I could guess so accurately without it being told to me is a testament to how well Abrams conveyed the time period and the universe. Again, it isn't absolutely perfect. For most of the first act it felt like Abrams was beating me over the head with it, but overall I liked it.<br/><br/>Now to talk about the story. I'll be blunt: it wasn't very good. Character motivations were sometimes unclear or forced due to the movie skimming over some of the plot lines in the movie, and there are some really obvious errors in conversations transferring from scene to scene that are so jarring I'm stunned Abrams didn't notice or think about them. The movie brushes over a few really overused clichés such as the overworked cop who is told by his superior to take a break (which has been done a million times by the way), and there are frequent lines that make absolutely no sense in context with what was just said. It almost seems like characters forget things that happened 2 seconds ago due to the uneven screenplay at times. I say at times because these moments aren't that frequent, but they did still bother me. What weighed heavily on the film and dragged it down more than anything though were the plethora of plot holes and errors in logic that pile up quickly. I'm not going to list them because I want this to be spoiler free, but let's just say my notes were littered with these script writing errors and leave it at that. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Super 8 is a great movie on a technical level. The acting is pretty good, and the dialogue is excellent. Unfortunately, the story is rather poor and is in my opinion the weakest aspect of the film. Even though I'm giving it a 6 I want to emphasize that this is a good film. It just has a lot of flaws in its narrative weighing it down."

"andrew-huggett","6","0","1","19 May 2015"," Story starts well but ultimately becomes predictable ...
","Not too bad – keeps you guessing and I'd forgotten about the weird cubes and just how nasty the Airforce were in this film – some exciting and tense scenes and the 5.1 surround is very good indeed (the rear effect speakers were given a good work-out!) The creature in this film just simply wants to go home (but it's somewhat more ruthless about it than ET ever was). There is a suggestion of some form of telepathic communication and link between the creature, the teacher and later on the boy. The creature (when we eventually see it) looks like a giant spider with elements of the queen from the Alien films bolted on. I'm not really sure who this film is aimed at – it's a little too gruesome and scary in some cases – for kids below 14 – but in some ways it seems to be a children's film in the same manner as 'The Goonies'. The cinematography is excellent and there are lots of deliberate uses of lens flare effects. There is also a touch of the 'found-footage' genre about this film. The train crash is spectacularly well done."
"ericrnolan","8","0","2","28 April 2015"," ""Super 8"" (2011) was, as everyone told me, a good movie
","I'd give it an 8 out of 10. It had a smart, funny script that made for likable adolescent protagonists, some nice tension in setting up a sci-fi mystery, and some great special effects (including an impressive train crash that reminded me of the very different ""Final Destination"" movies). I had fun with this.<br/><br/>I can only enjoy ""family films"" so much, though. It isn't that I need violence or sex to be entertained. It's that these movies are ""safe"" and therefore predictable. When I realized early on that this was intended for general audiences, it gave me a pretty good idea of what would and would not happen throughout the film. (This film is a mystery that is a little hard to discuss without spoilers.)<br/><br/>The movie was made even more predictable when you realize that director JJ Abrams was consciously imitating a certain other famous filmmaker. Let's look as what we've got: 1) an earnest, vulnerable, yet ultimately heroic adolescent boy; 2) quirky, flawed, yet lovable supporting characters that aid him in his quest; 3) a sci-fi mystery; 4) several family conflicts involving absent parents; and 5) ruthless government and/or military authorities.<br/><br/>Hmmmm. Remind you of anything, anyone? Hint: see this film's producer.<br/><br/>There was a little too much heavy handed imagery and plotting. Accidentally turning on a film projector and seeing a dead parent? A flying locket with a picture of said parent? And the locket is let go at the story's climax? I felt that Abrams would next reach right out of the movie screen and write the movie's message in black Sharpie marker across my forehead. Just in case I didn't get it.<br/><br/>Still, this was good. Those kids were so damned cool it made me think it might be fun to be a parent. That heavy kid would actually be really cool to hang out with. If I were his Dad, I'd buy him all sorts of stuff for his hobby of making zombie movies, and I'd let him skip his chores just to give him the space he needs.<br/><br/>This movie also did something pretty creative that I don't remember seeing done outside of ""The X-Files."" We're shown a government or military conspiracy, but this time the local police department does NOT cooperate or become complicit in it. So you see local cops actively working against their federal or military counterparts. I found that to be different and interesting, and it seems like the sort of thing that might occur in real life.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a good movie. It seems like a pretty decent flick with which to introduce a kid to science fiction.<br/><br/>https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/"

","I said it in the title.<br/><br/>Looking around on the reviews I've found both too pleasing and too negative reviews. Still I think it's more good than bad.<br/><br/>One thing to underline is the teens's behaviour. Many people say that's annoying, stupid, and unreal, but having been at that age not too time ago I can see that's exactly how teen kids behave. So that argument is invalid.<br/><br/>Then we have hates towards the 'too over dramatized' train crash, saying how impossible that scene is. My answer is: you came to watch a science fiction thriller about an alien on earth, and you expect realism? Must say that J.J. Abrams did a great job on this, and showed that he's able to direct a movie in Spielberg's style, so much that a friend of mine thought it's directed by Spielberg. I wasn't very okay with the ending, but overall this movie is enough good."
"Fluke_Skywalker","10","0","2","25 April 2015"," Super 8 is a perfect 10
","JJ Abrams' 'Super 8' is an unabashed homage to the 70s, Spielberg and the kind of cinema he helped to create. But it's not merely a fan film or a copycat. It stands very much on its own two feet. It's clear that Abrams--a child of the 70s--has an affinity for the era, and that love saturates every frame.<br/><br/>I was born in 1974, grew up in Ohio not far from the film's fictional Lillian, and I too was into model kits, sci-fi and all the rest, so naturally 'Super 8' was in my wheelhouse. But watching it in the years since its release, with my own Mother having passed in the interim, it has taken on a whole new meaning. <br/><br/>Great performances and humor and heart to spare. This really is the type of film Hollywood doesn't or can't make anymore."
"bowmanblue","6","0","2","14 April 2015"," One for the kids
","J.J. Abrams pays homage to all of Spielberg's early movies with this mix of the Goonies and, er, an alien invasion movie.<br/><br/>One of the most nasty aliens possible lands in a small American town - nasty largely because of its intense desire to grab people from behind at night time. First we see its back, moving quickly amongst the darkness then we see the odd arm, wrapping itself around a hapless victim's neck. Every now and again you see a leg - possibly - it's normally too dark to see.<br/><br/>Anyway, the grabby-grabbity alien is running amok in a small town grabbing people like they were the last Nike trainer on the shelf, but, luckily, the U.S. Army is there to save everyone. Only they don't. Their masses of tanks and guns are pretty useless against something big that likes to grab people. However, humanity is saved by six (ish) plucky, nerdy kids who have a knack for not being grabbed (and if they are they can be rescued later) and a love of using cheap fireworks as weapons.<br/><br/>I grew up with the Goonies and I still watch it, largely for nostalgia values. If it was released today I probably wouldn't bother with it.<br/><br/>Super 8 didn't do much for me. It was too dark and it was only on the 1 hour 32 minutes mark did you find the alien has a face (while its grabbing someone). However, judging by the rest of the reviews, I'm clearly in the minority here. Most people seem to love it. I can only assume they're twelve year old boys. This film is rated 12A and never before has the rating been so applicable. If you want a better opinion of the film, ask a twelve year old boy as that's clearly who this film is aimed for. Give me Sigourney Weaver in a power-loader suit any day."

","Loved it! Honestly surprised by all the haters. The movie was a little over-the-top at times, but totally fits the style I think Abrams intended. The movie is set in the late 70s and it's very reminiscent of that era. Good, classic fun. I wish more movies were this simple. Great acting! Great soundtrack! Great plot! The people giving it a ""1"" are losers. I'm in my late twenties and this movie reminds me of the films I grew up as a kid watching. Made me feel young again! I will say that the ""creature"" and its intentions were a little fuzzy, but by no means did that spoil the movie. I think Abrams wanted a lot of that to be mysterious and vague. The dialogue between the main character and the alien creature near the end was a bit strange, but it was a short moment amidst all the good. What I enjoyed the most was the conversation between all the boys who were recording the film throughout the movie— had me laughing quite a bit! Great sentiment between the father & son as he is juggling his job and being a good, single father. The last scene of the boy ""letting go"" was touching. Deep, but simple. BUT.. My favorite part of the whole movie was the end credits. HILARIOUS. I'd probably say 8, but 9 stars to balance out the overly negative raters. Get over yourselves."
"williambonadurer","8","0","1","8 March 2015"," very good but crappy ending
","This movie was great up until the ending. It was very interesting and had an original storyline. Where the movie went wrong was vilifying the alien and then trying to get the audience to like it at the end. It doesn't help by showing that the alien is eating innocent humans at the end. The ending was also pointless, I don't understand why the alien couldn't leave right away, and why it needed the kids help. What the movie should have done was not have it eat innocent people. Cows and army men that were hunting the monster would have been OK. Also they should have had the kids help the monster to build its ship so the kids would have been necessary for the alien. Sorry for my rambling thoughts and poor grammar."
"ramonproducoes2011","8","0","1","3 March 2015"," A beautiful and nostalgic movie!
","J.J Abrams and Steven Spielberg together – the director and the producer on the same project. What kind of film can be made with this join? Just one of the most beautiful and nostalgic movies of 2011. To be honest, the year of 2011 was the time when directors and producers looked back, to your career and have decided to make a movie about the past, about the childhood or about the magic of theater (Martin Scorsese for example). J.J. Abrams followed the same thought with his ""Super 8"", at start with the title of the movie. A typical camera of 1970's and early of 1980's, the super 8 camera have a very recognized sound that characterize it. With this sound, the movie begins and goes on, with the sound as a guide for what is coming. I really liked ""Super 8"", especially for the theme of 1980's. It's a movie about the decade that made us. It's not a thriller film, it's not an action film it's a new kind of ""E.T."" more mature and surrounded by a darkness feeling, but just with the desire to go home. It's summer on the small town of Lillian, on schools it's the time to recess and kids are very excited. But for the friends Joe, Martin, Cary and Charles, the summer is for other thing. They are recording a movie for the Festival of Super 8 Movies of Lillian, a typical movie about zombies. With them is Alice (or Allie) the girl that every boy wants to walk hand in hand. During the record, a violent train accident interrupts the ""emotional scene"". The accident releases a ""thing"" on the small town and suddenly, persons begin to disappear when others strange things begin to happen. The story turn around this ""thing"" and the problems it brings. We, bit by bit, know the creature released by the train. This is one of the most interesting things on this film, a recognized style of J.J. Abrams – he shows small parts of the ""thing"", creating a thriller around it. But other thing very interesting and important is the connection created between the characters and the public. I said many times the importance about this: this connection is the way of director recognizes his public. In ""Super 8"", the characters created by J.J. Abrams have story of life, they are not just stereotyped persons of the final 1970's. No, even the smallest thing has a link on the story, especially the main character Joe that lost his mother and now he have to live with this pain. The difference between ""Super 8"" for the other movies of the genre is the center of the story. The ""thing"" (at the end we know what it is) is just one part of this role, the screenplay have others priorities like develop the characters: the friendship between Joe and his boys, the hard relation of Joe and his father, and especially the love that, bit by bit begins to rise between Joe and Allie. Then, almost at the end, the screenplay centers on the creature and all mystery is solved. A movie with a very simple story, it's true, and at the first view, we make a mistake to think that is a thriller film. Nostalgia, it's what better describes this movie: a wonderful view about the 1980's, with characters that, even with stereotyped features, have their own world and their own story to show. Right, we can see ""The Fat"", ""The Nerd"", and ""The Popular"", but this is not the most important thing, it's just the starting line. The final is one of the most wonderful things on this film and others points stand out in ""Super 8"". The way that was recorded is a difference point. Lights on the camera focus on the face a movie about the 1980, with techniques of that time, but produced with a high technology. I love it!"

This is something Spielberg is known for. This movie has been described as a ""love letter to Spielberg,"" but it is enough of its own movie to stand alone. The main character Joe is a perfect unlikely hero, and his friends are loyal and never come across as simple sidekicks. Joel Courtney is impressive in this movie.

","This very much reminded me of those early Stephen Spielberg films or Stephen King books/movies from the 80's. Its basically an homage to those (Goonies, E.T, Stand By Me) even going so far as to take place in 1979.<br/><br/>We follow a group of friends (including the obligatory fat kid) in small town Ohio as they attempt to film an amateur movie for a school project. While filming they witness a train derailment (big special effects here and pretty cool) and then an otherworldly force begins to stalk their town. Of course it's only the kids that know what's really going on as the army descends and adults scramble.<br/><br/>I'd be curious to see what the young adult crowd thought of this?

"TheBlueHairedLawyer","8","0","3","12 September 2014"," While not the most original plot, Super 8 offers a lot!
","I'd give anything to have grown up in the Seventies! The 21st century is the lazy generation, where cell phone junkies, couch potatoes and internet-addicted soccer moms thrive, where traditional film is being replaced with digital just because it's cheaper and kids can swear constantly in class and have teachers turn a blind eye. I'm not saying the seventies sounds perfect, but from where I'm standing, it had better music, better people, and there wasn't a cellular phone in sight. So, when I heard of Super 8, I couldn't wait to see it. Granted I've never really been a fan of Elle Fanning (I think she's extremely overused in movies), but all the same I was excited to see it.<br/><br/>Well, Super 8 is lacking a little on the originality side, that is to say, there are very many other movies and books that follow quite a similar plot. But I've gotta say, it's great to see a movie for kids (adults, teens?) that brings back the nostalgia of the times and shows kids that life is better when you make your own fun and adventures instead of just going online and playing video games 24/7. There were many references to past movies and it was cool to count 'em all, the soundtrack included popular (and better) music from the year the movie took place, and the cast was excellent. Like I said, I've never been a fan of Elle Fanning but she was amazing in this movie, and some of my favorite actors as well were Ryan Lee as Cary, Zach Mills as Preston and Ron Eldard as Louis Dainard.<br/><br/>Super 8 is one of those movies that, like The Ice Storm (1997), The Lovely Bones (2009) and Silkwood (1983), ends up being so much more than a blast from the past. Super 8 has everything from aliens to industrial small towns to a pyromaniac to a harsh reality in life - sometimes things just have to end, and sometimes we just have to move on with our own lives - but it's also a movie about friends sticking together in hard times and trying to have fun in a place where nothing seems to happen, until one day everything begins."

","Do you remember your childhood? Carefree days spent with your friends, sleepovers, using inappropriate language when you really should know better and, in the case of Super 8, fending off an alien invasion with your mates.<br/><br/>Super 8 is J.J Abrams' first attempt at a non-franchise movie. After cutting his teeth with the excellent Mission Impossible 3 and introducing Star Trek to the younger generation, Abrams was given the chance to make a film that was much more personal to him, and it shines through. <br/><br/>The plot deals with a group of young friends who are trying to finish their movie during the summer holidays. Whilst shooting a pivotal scene, the boys (and girl) are witness to one of the most spectacular train crashes ever committed to film, with the remainder of the movie dealing with the mysterious cargo aboard. It would be an unfair spoiler to divulge the rest of the story, suffice it to say that Abrams manages to weave a compelling, but not entirely flawless, monster movie.<br/><br/>At the time of its release, Abrams made no secret of his admiration for Steven Spielberg, even going so far as to bring him on board as producer, and so it comes as no surprise that Super 8 often feels like an homage to classics like E.T and Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. There are a number of Spielbergian traits such as the absent father, the story told from a kid's perspective and the tantalising glimpses of the train's cargo, all contributing to a stellar first half.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the wheels come off a little once the cargo is revealed. Abrams sacrifices character development for blockbuster thrills and, on more than one occasion, potential pitfalls are sidestepped just a little too easily. In the end, it feels like a hybrid of two very different movies. On the one hand, we have a nostalgic coming of age tale and on the other, an old fashioned monster movie. It doesn't quite manage to merge the two genres into a unique whole, but it does offer some truly outstanding visuals (the train crash being a particular highlight), one or two tear jerking moments and, in the case of the kids, the most enjoyable gang of adolescents since Stand By Me."

","Super 8 is one of those Spielberg films that he didn't direct, but yet you can easily see his imprint on it. J.J Abrams did a great job directing this mystery thriller with an unbelievably young cast. I was quite surprised at the talent of the core 5 actors who are filming a Super 8 movie and end up coming across an Alien like attack. Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning give believable performances but at times the romance did feel a little too cliché. Overall it's a thrilling experience that makes you remember some of the great Sci-Fi flicks of the past.<br/><br/>With Abrams and Spielberg at the helm I would have thought there would be more star power at the core of this film. But I guess if you think about Close Encounters of the Third Kind, that had virtually all unknown actors at the time. I would have liked to see a little bit more of the actual monster/alien in the 2 hour running time. I did feel like the ending resolution to the Alien was a tad out of place. But I did like the story of Joe losing his mom and basically trying to get over her throughout the film. But at the same time I think in order for us all to feel the emotional impact they wanted us to feel.<br/><br/>It was refreshing to see a blockbuster movie led by basically an all under 15 year old cast. You just don't get to see that in Hollywood these days. Even with some of its gory moments, I think this is a movie that can be enjoyed by an entire family. Now can Abrams get Spielberg to help him direct one of the new Star Wars films? PLEASE!!!!??<br/><br/>+Pleasantly surprised with the well rounded young cast<br/><br/>+Cool Visuals<br/><br/>+Callbacks to classic Sci-Fi<br/><br/>-Not much emotional impact<br/><br/>-Not enough Alien/monster time<br/><br/>7.8/10"

"nevio_m","10","0","3","16 February 2014"," Brilliant family movie
","I absolutely loved Super 8. The movie strongly (and purposely) evokes reminiscences of classic teenage adventures like The Goonies, ET and Explorers. I've read a lot of criticism about Super 8, and i think it comes basically from two problems people have with it. First, they expected something different. Probably something more akin to Cloverfield, which this movie isn't. It's a teenage adventure story, suitable for all family, much like the aforementioned classic teen flicks, so don't expect anything different or otherwise you will be disappointed. Second, this is a movie directed in the style of the 80s teenage adventures, so it obviously requires a lot of suspension of disbelief. It's easy to point at the fact that some parts of the plot aren't realistic, like a train derailing because of of a pickup, but that's the style of the kind of movies Super 8 is homaging and is inspired to. Those movies come from an era of ingenuity the audience seem to have lost by growing up. It's not a fault of the movie if you weren't able to grow up keeping that ingenuity and became, well, cynical and disillusioned. So, i recommend STRONGLY this movie to everyone who like adventure movies full of ingenuity and magic, aimed at a younger audience. Conversely, stay away from it if you are looking for something realistic, dark and original, because those are 3 things this movie doesn't even want to be. And it's not a fault, despite many people don't get it. The director and producer very clearly wanted it to be like it is. A movie from another time when cinema had less angst and not everything needed to be gritty and overly complex."

","Set in the 70's. A group of kids are making a Super 8 movie for a film competition and while doing so they witness a train wreck, from which an alien creature escapes and begins to wreak havoc on the small town.<br/><br/>Very much a modern-day Goonies meets E.T. film, with elements of Cloverfield in respect of the alien creature.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first hour or so, but the alien elements didn't engage me and I don't think they were even developed very well, considering this is the main plot of the film. In fact, the more the alien featured in it, with his whole psychic connection, desire to go home, then disappearing off in a gigantic spaceship, the less I liked it. Because of this, it did sometimes feel rushed and a bit like lazy writing.<br/><br/>The attempt to make an 80's-style kids film is not as good as the actual films from the 80's that is seems to be based on."

An adult viewer looking for a satisfying movie rather than a few thrills and special effects should look elsewhere.<br/><br/>I am disappointed to find that IMDb won't accept this review without 10 lines.

"ConnorFarley","8","0","2","17 December 2013"," A well made alien invasion movie with a touch of gold from the duo of Abrams and Spielberg...
","J. J. Abrams has touched this film with a finger made of gold. It's a solid storyline about five children ultimately making a movie before the events on their 'own movie', if you will, begins. At the same time its a fairly basic plot with little to no complexity in it, which makes for easy viewing. The actors playing the five children, for actors who only appeared in minor TV/ film roles prior to the making of this movie, brought their best guns early and produced a inspired performance. For a blockbuster production team headed by none other than Steven Spielberg himself alongside the immense directorial skills of Abrams himself, this really makes for a blockbuster movie, that has been underrated since its release. Finally, the film also has an aspect of heartbreak within its roots, and that comes in the form of the alien's goal, to return to its own planet. It makes you despise the army and the scientists who have held the alien hostage for testing since it crash landed in its spaceship. At the end when the alien's intentions are revealed, it makes you look back and smile at how valiantly the alien fought back to get what he desired, no matter the cost of life and destruction it may have caused.<br/><br/>A brilliant story about a misunderstood alien invader. Abrams produces again."

There are clear references for that generation in which I include myself (the events in the movie took place in the exactly year and month I was born).

"Dfschohr-532-549658","9","0","1","24 October 2013"," Super 8 Review
","First off let me just say that I don't believe this film is a prequel to ""Cloverfield."" ""Super 8"" stands on its own level as a monster adventure film. The creature design is very similar to the one of ""Cloverfield"" but the size, movement, and eyes are completely different. Some could say that this is an early stage of this creatures evolution, but I believe that J.J. Abrams made this film without the intention of tying it into the story of ""Cloverfield.""<br/><br/>Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), and his three friends are making a zombie movie. They ask for help from Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning), whose dad has a feud with Joe's dad, who is the local sheriff of the town. One night after stealing her dads car, Alice drives the boys out to the train depot, where they are to film the next scene. While filming, a train passes by, but only to be met by a man driving a truck with a suicide mission. Inside the train lies a secret that the government has been hiding from us. <br/><br/>The cast of kids were great, even though there are a few moments when the character of Charles played by Riley Griffiths becomes extremely annoying. Joel Courtney was remarkable, and truly a breath of fresh air when it comes to child actors. Too have a child actor make you believe his sadness, or better yet, his fascination with all the crazy stuff that is going on around him, is a great cinematic treat.<br/><br/>From her great small parts in ""The Nines"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", to her break out role as Cleo in Sofia Coppola's ""Somewhere"". Elle Fanning has proved to me that she is a better actress then her sister. Im not trying to hate on Dakota Fanning but Elle Fanning is truly relaxed and it seems that everything comes natural for her, as with Dakota everything feels forced, and rushed. Im excited to see more of Elle Fanning, I think her acting will get better with age. <br/><br/>I am a huge fan J.J. Abrams, every since I saw the pilot episode of ""Lost"". Then when ""Star Trek"" came out I was excited that he was trying to bring in a new audience. Now I still don't care that much for ""Star Trek"" but I will admit that the film was entertaining. But I think Abrams has the made the film he has wanted to make ever since he was kid watching ""Close Encounters of a Third Kind"" and ""E.T."", and he pulled off almost everything with perfection. I just wish the film wasn't so predicable. This is still one hell of an entertaining film that had me in ""AW"" for the first half. I give Super 8 a 9 out of 10."
"verndougall","7","0","2","11 October 2013"," Interesting, to say the least.
","After a while of movies, witnessing Aliens, Predators, E.T, and a well made assortment of creature ideas to be brought along, I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this. A movie granted, that it may terrify ones child, but it can also inspire them, but the movie appeals to all ages. A crafty execution, for a movie worth seeing is how one could put this into a category. Feeling up for adventure, mystery, and trying to solve out what just might be there lurking in the dark, view this movie. It gives a different perspective on how one will put themselves into an Alien's situation, and find the time to get to know these relatable characters. All in all, even the acting met par, and what could be expected, the children were outstanding."
"tapio_hietamaki","7","0","2","2 October 2013"," A mix of 1970's kid drama and 2010's sci-fi
","At first you couldn't tell if Super 8 was made in 2011 or 1981. The first part of the film is very much like early Spielberg, an obvious tribute to great films like E.T. or Close Encounters of the Third Kind (or non-Spielberg Stand By Me). Super 8 is about a group of kids who want to make a short movie (filming it on super 8 mm film), and we get to know each one of them, their joys and problems. The story is set in the late 70s.<br/><br/>Then the film gradually morphs into a J.J. Abrams film. You get sci-fi jargon, modern CG effects, and alien spaceships. Not unlike in District 9. Suffice to say this film tries to do a lot of stuff at the same time. It sure is interesting to see what 21st century special effects would have looked like in a 70's film - out of place, unsurprisingly.<br/><br/>The kid actors are great, very believable and genuine. The story has its moments but by the end of the film you're just left with the question, ""why did they have to go that far?"" Subtlety is obviously not Abrams' strong suite."

It's beautifully filmed, has no actual on-screen gore/violence (tho some nasty stuff is implied), some brilliant action sequences, excellent direction, nice occasional bits of humour, reasonable acting - awesome in one instance - and a cool soundtrack!!

","During the summer of 1979, a group of friends witness a train crash and investigate subsequent unexplained events in their small town.<br/><br/>I do love the inclusion of the Walkman, the Soviets and other period things, especially the music. While I did not live in 1979, I appreciate period pieces of the 70s and 80s (Ti West's Satanic Panic film nailed this.) I also like that at times, the film has the sensibility of ""Goonies"". I wish the whole film did, because these were the stronger scenes. The monster part was less interesting, actually ,than the childhood adventures.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert summed it nicely when he wrote, ""Super 8 is a wonderful film, nostalgia not for a time but for a style of film-making, when shell-shocked young audiences were told a story and not pounded over the head with aggressive action.

","So much of this movie is thrilling and the acting is great. However, the ending, much like Abrams other works (ex: Lost), leaves so much to be desired. My main gripe is a big one: One of the main plot points is abandoned halfway through the film. This point is the only connection to the actual title of the film. And yet, there is no resolution for it. Also, the mystery he creates as to what the creature looks like is quite unnecessary, and annoying. The drama at the end is classic Hollywood, and very unrealistic. The movie had so much potential to be a great film, and then it just plummeted to the finale so miserably. If you want to get caught up in a thrill ride, only to be supremely disappointed, watch this."
"ElectricWarlock","10","0","2","19 July 2013"," A perfect film
","It seems like almost every movie from the past decade or so is either a pointless sequel, unwanted remake, or a special effects bonanza with no effort put into it, only money. So when a film like this comes along, it is a very special experience. To start off, this films biggest advantage would have to be it's characters. Every character is well rounded and given their own unique personality which makes them feel like real human beings rather than cardboard cutouts of people. The character of Joe Lamb is particularly likable and reminds me a lot of myself in ways. Joel Courtney did a perfect job of portraying him and I couldn't believe this was his first acting role because he came across as truly professional. Cary, who is obsessed with pyrotechnics, is also one of the most interesting characters and Ryan Lee did a good job at making him seem humorous and comedic. As a matter of fact, I don't think there was one weak performance in the entire film. Every person did a wonderful job at portraying their respective characters and deserves recognition for doing so.<br/><br/>I enjoy that this film took place in the 1970s. I don't think a story like this would've worked as well if it were to take place in our present decade so I think that was a wise choice and helped make the film more effective. While this film does have an extremely strong, character driven story it also has explosions and neat looking alien monster. But what sets it apart from other films with heavy special effects is that it has plenty of heart to go with them. This film can satisfy both fans of character driven films with a strong story and fans of special effects spectacles. It uses special effects to enhance the story, not to replace the story like many other films. This film also has an emotional side. Joe's mother was killed in a factory accident so now he has to live alone with his father who is the local sheriff so he spends more time working than helping his son cope with the loss of his mother. He feels like his father doesn't love him as much as he used to. Joe keeps a locket his mother gave him while she was still alive, and at the end of the movie, he lets the alien take the locket to build his ship in a moment that brings a tear to my eye every time I watch the film. He held on to the memory of his mother the entire film because he felt she was the only thing he had and the only parent who ever cared about him. But in the end after he gave his father a hug, he also gave up the locket which was symbolic of him accepting his mother's passing. He finally realized his father truly does care about him and that he does have a parent he can rely on to be there when he needs him. <br/><br/>Alice Dainard, brilliantly portrayed by Elle Fanning, also makes up with her father who is an alcoholic that blames himself for the factory disaster which kills Joe Lamb's mother. He worked in the same factory and skipped work that day due to a hangover so Mrs. Lamb had to take his shift. Alice forgives her father as well and begins to accept him as a parent and as a person which is also a touching moment. Overall, this is perhaps my favorite non-horror film of all time. In a world where many films are devoid of passion, this one is truly a labor of love. You can tell this film wasn't made solely to make a billion dollars. Effort and care was clearly put into the film by everyone involved and because of that it is one of the best films in years."

","Super 8 is about a group of kids in the late 70s who love horror films and are attempting to make their own zombie film. I really got into the kid characters and loved the adventure and imagination they all shared in making their own small movie. While I was very young when movies like The Goonies and The Sandlot came out, I do remember them. I see a lot of people comparing this to those movies and saying how it does not do Spielberg justice after they grew up with those kid adventure/coming of age movies. I remember those movies but was too young for them to have any big significance in my life so maybe that is why I love that aspect of Super 8. The ending is also another complaint of many and while it is nothing special it was just fine to me. There were a few problems I had with it, such as the teacher surviving the head-on collision with the train and maybe the wreck being worse than it might be if that happened in real life. Overall, I had an enjoyable time watching this film, feeling like I was there with those kids and on that great adventure. 8/10."
"robinski34","10","0","3","22 June 2013"," 10 out of 8
","A superlative film from J.J. Abrams, clearly channelling the work of producer the fabulous Mr. Spielberg, Super 8 takes the joyfully freewheeling sensibility of ET and brings a darker more adult tone to a story that borrows several themes from Earth-bound Science Fiction, but Abrams takes these and makes them his own. Hinging the story around the youngsters shooting a movie is a clever and affecting touch, evoking memories of childhood dreams in the audience, and the young stars have a great chemistry that makes the whole premise engrossing. But it would not work so well if the adult performances did not anchor events in the 'real' world of grown-up cares and concerns, and good turns from Kyle Chandler and Ron Elard do just that, especially in the opening scenes where the film's emotional level is established. The youngsters are not upstaged however and the leading lights of the cast-within-a-cast, Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning and Riley Griffiths are entirely believable, but it is Fanning who steals the show in the key train wreck scene, which is fraught with tension and excitement even before the train arrives and, like a certain scene in David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' featuring Naomi Watts, is a highly effective illustration of what proper acting looks like. Super 8 is essential viewing for fans of Abrams, Spielberg or just plain wonderful movies."

","The Short: Extremely engaging, a solve the mystery as it happens style story, brilliant action scenes, massive production value, and just an overall excellent story.<br/><br/>The bad: One actor is just there for comedic effect, despite being a somewhat major character, and certain minor elements are a stretch. <br/><br/>The Full Review:<br/><br/>Abrams is the new king of Sci-Fi. I felt this way after I saw Star Trek, but now it is official. I connected with my inner 12 year old after Super 8. <br/><br/>Super 8 is unlike anything in recent memory because of the fact that it succeeds in being original. It just doesn't start out with ambitions of being great, like most summer films. It develops so well and is told in such a masterful way that it truly succeeds in being one of the most engaging films ever. <br/><br/>The cast is fantastic. It is filled with a colorful characters, all of whom are very likable and have great moments (except the shop salesman). Abrams utilizes a great cast of kid actors that truly stand out from other films. The relationships between these characters grow more and more, and there are some truly some surprising performances from the actors. <br/><br/>What makes Super 8 so entertaining is the way Abrams blends different film techniques that truly connect with audience. Abrams uses a perfect combination of dialogue and story, which connects so well with the audience, and huge, explosive (did I mention huge?) action moments to blow your face off. The sound is big, and the action is bigger, and there are some excellent scares to be had. <br/><br/>Some elements aren't explained enough and they lose their effect (specifically the dogs) but other than a forced performance and the dogs, Super 8 concludes in an excellent way, and everything connects perfectly. If you pass up Super 8, for whatever reason, you are missing an excellent film. Whether you like Sci-Fi or not, Super 8 is original Science Fiction at its best. The storytelling follows in the footsteps of the legendary Steven Spielberg (who actually co- produced Super 8) and the action is Abrams-branded and kicked into high gear. It is absolutely entertaining and is thought provoking at the same time. Which is a Super reason to love Super 8.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Super 8, which have been kept secretly under wraps until it's release date, shows why J.J Abrams is a master director with talent. He knows how to tell an effective story in blockbuster format and has a good use for special effects. In this particular story, I loved how he used tension and how he kept the audience guessing on what kind of monster we will be seeing. This reminded me of 2008's Cloverfield which was set up almost the same way.<br/><br/>This film is about a group of kids who are filming a movie on location near railroad tracks. They happen to witness a disastrous train wreck which leads to the involvement of the Army. Now this Ohio town and residents will begin to see strange things happening. What could this be? <br/><br/>The cast is not well-known but they all do a great job. Elle Fanning, the younger sister of Dakota, really brought herself to the eyes of the public. Kyle Chandler is also good as the town's cop who wants answers.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a well-made throwback or homage to the early Spielberg classics. I got a sense of E.T, Close Encounters, and the Goonies while watching this film. This film has some good action, a very realistic train crash scene, and surprisingly some comedy. Despite all that, I was slightly let down. I was expecting this film to be a 10/10 film based on what everyone has been telling me. I don't think it's that good but it's just a good summer blockbuster. I rate this film 8/10."

Joe and Charles, the director of the film that brought them to the train station in first place, examine their footage and see something escaping the train. <br/><br/>Written and directed by J. J. Abrams of Lost fame and with Steven Spielberg co-producing, Super 8 is easily a step above efforts like Cloverfield and Artificial Intelligence while falling just short of films like E.T., Super 8 is a welcomed addition to the sci-fi genre and a great time to be had at the movies."
"pfahlewr","8","0","1","22 November 2012"," Great acting, OK story, overall entertaining
","I thought the acting was excellent, especially from all of the kids. I agree with many of the other reviews that it wasn't the most original story. For someone just trying to get back into watching a lot of film this was a good place to start. The plot kept me interested throughout the movie, there was the right amount of action and suspense, and it reminded me about all of the components that make a good movie. While this one doesn't compare to movies whose ideas were far more original, this film stands true to developing those pieces that kept me interested and entertained. There were definitely some pieces that had me frustrated. The idea that the guy driving a truck into a speeding train can live was outrageous, as was the idea that a truck could derail a military grade train. Despite many other logical issues the film kept me interested and entertained. I would definitely recommend watching."
"jafar-iqbal","7","0","1","1 November 2012"," A solid, though flawed, homage
","Set in the 1980s, a group of friends are witness to a horrific train crash while filming a movie on their Super 8 camera. That sets into motion a chain of events involving the military, strange disappearances, and something very supernatural. It is left up to the kids to save the day.<br/><br/>That, in short, is what 'Super 8' is about. It sounds like your typical PG science fiction movie aimed at teenagers and parents looking for a decent movie to watch. Thankfully, this JJ Abrams-directed movie is so much more than that. Foremost than anything else, 'Super 8' is an homage to the Spielberg classics of the eighties, and Abrams has deliberately copy-and-pasted that formula here.<br/><br/>Of that formula, what Abrams has emulated the best is directing young actors. What made Spielberg films like 'ET' and 'The Goonies' so enjoyable was the chemistry between the young cast; it's the same here. The kids are the best thing about the movie – you're immediately drawn to them and root for them throughout. Joel Courtney (Joe), Elle Fanning (Alice) and Riley Griffiths (Charles) are the standouts, the performances seem to come so easily and naturally to them. Look in particular at Fanning's first 'acting' scene. It's brilliant.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bit of a letdown. Not because its rubbish, necessarily, but because nothing else in the film matches up to the joy of watching those kids act. The scenes with Kyle Chandler (as Joe's dad), the military, and other scenes with adults, they're quite dull and uninteresting. Similarly, the supernatural aspect of the film feels really rushed and unconvincing. I moved through the film just waiting for the kids to come back on screen. The actual story seems to get in the way, and that shouldn't be the case. There are some spectacular special effects though, especially the train crash at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>To expect anybody – even someone as good as JJ Abrams – to come up with a movie that matches those eighties' Spielberg classics would be unfair. And, in all fairness, Abrams makes a good crack of it. While it could be better, I think 'Super 8' should be appreciated as a love letter. A love letter to the joy of filmmaking; a love letter to nostalgia; and mainly, a love letter to Steven Spielberg and what he brought to cinema."
"RainDogJr","10","0","2","22 October 2012"," Make your own damn -super 8- movie!
","I just finished reading a couple of terrific books about cinema: THE KILL BILL DIARY, by the late David Carradine, and MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE!, by the legendary father of the Toxic Avenger Lloyd Kaufman (one of my heroes). Reading them back-to-back was pretty interesting as I could have a nice look at the making of both a big-budget and a low-budget movie, the anti-Spielberg school of though (both Carradine and Kaufman are Spielberg detractors) and at the passion and compromise of a filmmaker; I mean, in those books you deal with Tarantino and Kaufman and both are truly hard-workers with an infinite love for cinema. <br/><br/>SUPER 8 is obviously about movies; it's about the essence of both a low-budget and a big- budget picture. That's why I recalled those books, and how Tarantino and Kaufman work, while watching J.J. Abrams' movie. Here we have, just like in this year's FRANKENWEENIE, the clear indication that the director had a love towards movies since he was a little kid and began expressing that by making crappy, wonderful super 8 films. Trey Parker writes in the foreword to MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE! that after watching THE TOXIC AVENGER as a 13-year-old boy, he was inspired to shot (in super 8, I suppose) his own damn crap – Parker is only 3 years younger than J.J. Abrams, so you know what I mean. <br/><br/>Abrams is doing here a wonderful tribute to the early days of any filmmaker of his generation, and to the stuff they all loved too (super 8 films, STAR WARS and vintage Spielberg). And to do that he is basically dividing SUPER 8 into two films: one with the essence of guerrilla filmmaking and the other with everything a big-budget Hollywood movie offers, like I said. <br/><br/>SUPER 8 is about a group of kids in the late seventies; with the inspiration of such low-budget horror classics as John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN and George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD, they are shooting their own damn super 8 zombie movie. The director of that little movie is not our main character but his best friend Charles (Riley Griffiths); this chubby director is pure f****** guerrilla filmmaking! The cool thing is that I could see both Tarantino and Kaufman in the boy. In THE KILL BILL DIARY, Carradine says that Quentin is always writing new lines and stuff during production; and in Kaufman's book we learn that he, well, does everything the guerrilla way: changes the script all the time and is always looking for ""production value"" like some fire trucks, for instance. The chubby kid does the exact same things while shooting his zombie flick. <br/><br/>The production value that Charles wants for his movie is actually part of the production value that Abrams is showing off: a huge train. SUPER 8 is (in part, like I mentioned) basically Abrams showing off his 50 million dollars budget. If you're like me and don't really have a big admiration for the big Hollywood disaster pictures (which always involve the US army and stuff), well, guess what? SUPER 8 is probably as noisy, if not nosier, than most. There are explosions everywhere and noise and a train crashing in the most unbelievable, exaggerated, pure Hollywood way. But you know what? SUPER 8 is really clever and, by far, my favorite big- disaster-Hollywood movie in recent memory. <br/><br/>Let's all forget CLOVERFIELD (not that I think in it constantly) and enjoy this fun and emotive one (think in the 2009 masterpiece DISTRICT 9 and in any great coming-of-age film for the emotional aspect) that, just like those books I read, gives some nice lessons about cinema (hell, it even shows you how to make the audience care for your characters!). Lloyd Kaufman says that there's nothing wrong with going mainstream if you do some good out of it (like Trey Parker or SUPER director James Gunn, he adds). For my money, Abrams is doing exactly that, if not with every single one of his projects, at least with SUPER 8. <br/><br/>PS: you must, hell, you will stay for the closing credits for some damn fun and a couple of great songs, including the classic ""My Sharona""! <br/><br/>*Watched it on 06 and 17 October, 2012"
"robert-temple-1","7","0","1","21 October 2012"," What the camera and the spider 8
","This is an interesting sci fi drama written and directed by J. J. Abrams, who also co-produced through his company Bad Robot. Abrams is Executive Producer of the Bad Robot TV series FRINGE (2008-2013, see my review), which is a highly superior sci fi series. This film is aimed at the family market, which is hardly surprising, as it is produced by Stephen Spielberg. The main characters are kids, and they are mostly highly amusing. The lead girl is Elle Fanning, younger sister of Dakota Fanning. She is an excellent actress, extremely attractive, and has the advantage of speaking clearly and not mumbling like her sister does. The lead boy is Joel Courtney, a highly likable young fellow with big sensitive eyes, who should go a long way. He plays Tom Sawyer in TOM SAWYER & HUCKLEBERRY FINN, which has just completed shooting, so we look forward to seeing him in that when it is released in 2013. I would say he is perfect for Tom Sawyer, and will be as good as or better than Jackie Coogan was in the 1930 production of TOM SAWYER (see my review). This film features an alien who is an intelligent arachnoid, a giant creature like a spider, with six legs and an ugly face, who wants to go home, but the US Air Force have kept him captive since his spaceship crashed in 1958, and they won't let him go. (Spielberg certainly does like the marooned ET motif.) The film features the most spectacular train crash I have ever seen on screen, and if you like train crashes, I believe nobody ever spent more money on one. The film has superior special effects throughout. The story is based on a group of kids in a California town who want to make a school film about zombies on 'super 8', the film used in home movie celluloid cameras. (This film is set in a time apparently meant to be the 1970s, before video cameras existed.) While shooting a scene at a small deserted train station one night, the kids get more than they bargained for, because a train roars by which then crashes and explodes, letting loose the alien creature, who then stalks the land. However, this is a film intended for family entertainment, so the shocks and horrors are restrained enough for kids to take. One surprise treat is that we see the kids' zombie film over the final credits, and it is funnier than the main film itself."

","JJ Abrams holds school on how to properly ""rip off"" a genre. You just feel the electricity of E.T. running through the kids, the neighborhoods, and right on through to yourself.<br/><br/>Aside from a few seemingly needless plot holes, this movie works. Everything works, from the core plot (small shift-shaping cubes that that can form into anything) to the seamless effects, to the nothing-short-of-brilliant acting by the child actors.<br/><br/>Fasten your seat belts with regard to the sprouting acting career of 14 year old Elle Fanning. This young lady was born to the profession. Her moving, and at the same time disturbing performance in 'Phoebe in Wonderland' at age 8 blew my mind. One of my favorite scenes in this film is when Elle turns from a human being into a ghoul in one single shot. At the top of the shot she is simply wearing face paint in a closeup. When prompted, she turns her head down, her eyes up... and without even changing expressions transforms into a scary monster. Chilling. You go Elle!"
"marcuserenberger","7","0","2","28 August 2012"," Not Original, but satisfying!
","J.J. Abrams' ""Super 8"" is a film that revolves around a group of children who enjoy filming home-made movies. During one of their scenes, a train crashes in the background and the children are thrown into a mystery that comes crashing along with the freighter. The central themes in this story are friendship and letting go.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the cast of this film (Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths, Zach Mills, Gabriel Basso, Ryan Lee, and Elle Fanning) couldn't have done a better job. A buzz word that keeps coming to mind when I think of this little gang is chemistry. The chemistry the children have on screen makes the entire plot, no matter how implausible, feel believable. I really had an enjoyable time watching the group interact with each other and there was never a dull moment among the friends. You see the typical bickering and name calling we all were apart of as children, but beyond that you see a lot of great emotion from these characters that feels completely authentic. <br/><br/>Now, the number one knock on this film that I've heard so far is that it is too much like Spielberg's old films. This is a true statement and you probably will get a ""Goonies"" style vibe, but don't let that take away from this movie at all. If this movie would have came out years ago, we'd be calling it an instant classic, and not because of its effects. I feel like this film gets harshly critiqued because it's not completely original. In my opinion, that was the whole point of the entire process of making ""Super 8"". Abrams wanted to pay homage to one of his all-time favorite directors, and I can't personally pan this movie because of that fact. Because of the lack of originality we can't rank it above the old greats it's paying tribute to, but is that what makes a film enjoyable? Just because it's not original doesn't mean we should disregard it entirely. This is a great movie for children, if you don't mind a few curse words here and there, and adults alike. For children, I think this movie is a great way to bring some of the old film style of Spielberg to their eyes, without having to revert back to movies like ""ET"", that can be considered outdated visually. <br/><br/>All in all this is a fun, exciting film that had me interested and on the edge of my seat the entire ride. If originality is a huge factor for you, I wouldn't recommend this film but if you're just out to see a good flick that stars some pretty talented kids, this is for you. If I had to pick one knock on this film, it's that it could have held its own without the need for the sci-fi element but that doesn't take very much away from it at all."

Anyone who saw the trailer for this film were drawn by the mysterious tone of it, giving off the appearance of the next E.T. What a coincidence, guess who produced it? Speaking of which, that's probably the best way to describe it; a combination of ""The Goonies"" and ""E.T."", with hints of that other movie Abrams was behind""Cloverfield"".

"joker-4","9","0","1","21 June 2012"," Super.
","Writer/director J.J. Abrams knows, if anything, to keep the pace up, sometimes even hitting 11. His monumental STAR TREK reboot played testament to this as characters, settings, intrigue, cosmic play and even the death of Winona Ryder came flying at warp factor 9 when, at times, it can be argued, a slower pace would be welcome to provide more character development. So too happens here with Abrams' latest, SUPER 8, but instead of playing with Gene Roddenberry's creations, an even higher-power is being paid homage to as this film feels as it could be set in Producer Steven Spielberg's backyard.<br/><br/>The film itself pays homage to the days of super-8 mm recordings and times when young boys made movies before becoming the next generation of Hollywood. So too here, a group of teenage friends plan to make a monster movie and instead end up as stars of the film itself. However, unlike in the aforementioned STAR TREK, where the characters, if anything their names, are already known, Abrams' fast pace prevents the viewer from getting any deeper into the lives and characters of these kids who are already deep into their long-term existing friendships. Outside of Joel Courtney's Joe and Elle Fanning's Alice, the other friends all kind of blend into the Goonies, Elliott's bicycle gang and Biff Tannen's nameless thugs. <br/><br/>Abrams does get a huge piece of the puzzle correct, and that is the everyday boy getting involved in the spectacular extraordinary all wrapped in a coming of age tale – the perfect Spielbergian formula. Courtney and Fanning are believable – enjoyable – teens and their fathers – Kyle Chandler for Joe, Ron Eldard for Alice – are both dramatic and fantastic. As the tale rockets by a little too quickly, their characters make for a great focal point of the story, even if Joe's bedroom, perhaps a little unbelievably, houses every bit of late 70s and early 80s toy collector nostalgia possible.<br/><br/>SUPER 8, like Joe's bedroom, is a wonderful vision of nostalgia. A bit derivative at times, a little glossed over at others. However, it would be hard to come by a finer example of a modern-day look at a time of fun films."

","If you combine the creative mind of J.J. Abrams with the great Steven Spielberg, you'll get a pretty unique, entertaining alien film that can be quite enjoyable to all. I completely lost interest in alien films, but this film really brought back that interest that I lost, and grabbed my attention by bringing an exciting and entertaining film. The film is not childish in any sort of way and focused very well on these children. You follow these children as they go through this crisis while filming their movie, and being involved with these crazy events that occur. You get enough character depth to care about these characters and somehow relate to any of these kids. The movie has this ""Goonies"" vibe to it, as you can't hate the characters and you know that this film will present an awesome adventure. Everything was just well paced and didn't lose track of anything; the film had heart and it worked out pretty well. <br/><br/>Personally, I find it hard to not even get thrilled while watching some of these scenes. J.J. knows how to keep the audience excited and that is what he does in this film. You will definitely be up for a fun ride as what you see is quite enjoyable to watch and does bring in the thrill that made this film significant. When hell breaks loose, that's when the excitement kicks in; explosions everywhere, carnage from left to right, and thrills that made this a fun ride. My jaws dropped during these scenes, especially during the train crash as I was just blown away with that event. There are plenty of special effects and CGI used, but this really helped bring in the excitement factor that this film perfectly portrayed. <br/><br/>Director J.J. Abrams somehow does a good job of keeping the audience in suspense as he will not reveal something important until the end; that is how you will feel in this film. If you have watched ""Cloverfield,"" or J.J.'s famous TV series ""Lost,"" then you know that you are up for a few surprises as the film tends to keep the appearance and information about the monster a secret. Strange occurrences are occurring in this small town and everything gets out of control; you will simply be sucked into the story, wondering what is going on and why these things are occurring at the same time. You will only get a few glimpse of the monster and will not be able to see the monster as a whole until the end of the film. People maybe frustrated by this, but I thought it boosted the interest as you will keep wondering to yourself about this creature. I really liked the creativity that J.J. does with his work and the monster looked pretty awesome; as a fan of monster films, I really liked how this monster looked. <br/><br/>Personally, when I see kids cuss on screen, it feels like it was used to surprise and make the audience laugh, seeing that a young 5 year old child is cussing. However, when it comes to this film, I really didn't mind about these kids cursing like crazy. The dialogue works really well in this film and I actually liked the conversations that these kids have. The kids are all different, having different characteristics, likable, and relatable. Thinking real hard, I am possibly the fat kid because of how he acts and actually picturing myself acting that way during a crisis like that. My good friends are filmmakers and watching these kids reminds me of the good old times of us filming our own film. The acting is pretty good in this, especially coming from the kids. I was never annoyed by their existence in the film and actually liked their performances. All of the kids were great, but I have to say that the best is possibly Joel Courtney as the cops son and Elle Fanning. Both were just fantastic in this film and really liked, both of their acting and the characters they portrayed. All of the other cast members were actually pretty good and really liked the performances from everyone. <br/><br/>Two great minds helped made an alien movie that delivers a great fun ride, likable characters, a very good storyline, and a mystery behind this monster that will slowly reveal itself, keeping you wondering about this being."

This movie, however, is a cut above most of the others of its ilk because I really did begin to care about the characters. Also, having been a middle-school teacher for forty years, I found the goofiness and charm of the kids to be pretty believable. Granted, the deck is stacked because they all have issues. Not every quartet of young people automatically includes four levels of dysfunction. Still, the actors are out of the ET mode, in that they seem to act in a somewhat real way, considering the circumstances. I agree, however, that the military is up to no good and that is old hat. Also, why are the aliens so typically reptilian. I wish the creators could come up with something new. Finally, the first two-thirds are really captivating but the final third can't maintain it. It's still worth the time."

","A very well made film with likable characters, some neat CGI and some very clever effects. As I've already said, I can see what J.J. Abrams was aiming at, and that is the Spielberg films of the late 70's to the early 80's. Films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and even the Spielberg-produced, The Goonies (1985). Unfortunately this doesn't have the warmth or the magic of those films, but it is still a worthy effort. Going back to the middle third of the film, I referred to it at the beginning; J.J.Abrams uses this section to give the film a lot of emotional depth. This is something I hadn't noticed on my initial viewing, but I can now see just what he was trying to do. Unfortunately it doesn't quite come off here but even so, by the end I could see its place and it made for a really quite enjoyable film. Some great music, both the original soundtrack by Michael Giacchino and the songs of the period that were chosen. As far as the cinematography goes, I've read a lot of comment about ""flaring""; this didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I like that they show the film the kids were making while the end credits are rolling It's pretty neat.

"Tweekums","9","0","1","6 April 2012"," A nostalgic monster movie for (almost) all the family
","Having heard positive reviews of this film I was keen to see it and wasn't disappointed; its 1979 setting and young cast brought to mind films like 'Stand By Me' and 'ET: The Extraterrestrial'. The protagonists are a group of school children who are making a movie for an upcoming competition and one of their locations is a nearby railway station. When a train approaches they start filming thinking that having a real train in their movie will make it look more professional; what they did not expect was for that train to crash. There is something odd about the crash though; the area is littered with small grey objects and was caused by one of their teachers parking his pick-up on the tracks; miraculously he survived and warned then that they must never speak of what they saw or their lives will be in danger. It soon becomes apparent that something dangerous was on the train and the Air Force is determined to keep that quiet. Since this is the '70s they can't look at what they filmed immediately but have to wait three days for the film to be developed so don't find out just what was on the train for some time! In the days that follow the crash they must determine just hat they are up against and find out why the military want it covered up.<br/><br/>While this film was written and directed by J. J. Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg there were no well known people among the cast; that isn't to say they did a poor job though; in fact the opposite is true; I often find an unknown actor more convincing as I just see them as the character they are portraying rather than as an actor I know from various other performances. That said I'm sure they won't remain unknown; in particular Elle Fanning who was great as Alice. As one would expect from a twelve certificate film it isn't too scary but there are a few frights; I suspect most parents will be more concerned by the swearing than by the scariness. The actual violence is fairly minimal with the camera cutting away before we see anything too bad. The special effects look good; especially the spectacular train crash, which is even more dramatic than a real crash would have been! I watched it with several family members including my ten year old nephew and he thought it was great!"

","It's rare that a film comes along about kids and has a science fiction touch yet communicates the joys and the frustrations of growing up than Super 8.<br/><br/>Super 8 was apparently billed as a disaster film with aliens, etc. In truth, it's not about the alien at all. It's about kids growing up in a rural town, trying to do something special with themselves.<br/><br/>My Impressions: The film starts out with a funeral. A child loses his mother early on. A man comes over and is immediately thrown out of the house! Right here you wonder what the heck is going on! We find out soon enough. I think I found the story within the story of what Abrams was trying to do. It's semi-autobiographical. Spielberg and Abrams were both into making films as kids and it stuck.<br/><br/>The actual filmmaking was fun to see: they set up with funky scripts, a zombie who just would not stay dead, and a kid who wanted ""production value"" in all his shots! However, a train wreck, a fallen camera and an Area 51 scientist who also happened to be their science teacher changed all that.<br/><br/>The train wreck special effects were amazing and horrific. The look on the love-struck kid when he thought Alice was dead was heart-touching.<br/><br/>Favorite Scenes: Father's Faith: Without giving too much away, our hero discovers a film that was made with his mother when he was growing up. Alice sits with him in his room as the power comes on. The scenes project and Alice begins to cry, realizing that if her father took that shift at the steel mill that day, the tragic accident that took his mother ""should have"" taken her father.<br/><br/>The theme of dysfunctional parents that actually do love their children and overcoming that dysfunctional was great to see.<br/><br/>Amateur Horror Film: During the credits we actually get to see the full film that the kids were making, right down to the pipe and the armchair, the zombie and the chemical plant, etc. Fun to watch! I actually did something like this myself when I was 17 or so.<br/><br/>Music! The memories of the late 70s came back to me. The music and the excitement are really great.<br/><br/>Hackneyed Themes: Yes there were some ""I've seen this before"" themes of government abuse, secrets, abducting the alien (!), it escapes, the misunderstood scientist, the innocent children that make it right while the adults are clueless.<br/><br/>But it's HOW Abrams and Spielberg put these themes together, with a few twists (the fathers' involvement) and the success these filmmakers did in recreating the time period, the attitudes, the 1950s horror alien invasion Grade B style, that makes this film so charming.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: There are some scenes where the kids swear like truck drivers; it's not a lot but parents should know. Highly recommend this film, especially for those who grew up in the 70s, enjoyed Journey and Blondie, and loved the film E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. The trailers make believe this film is a typical invasion story. That's done on purpose. It's a coming of age story that is charming in its execution. Highly recommended."

","I have always been a huge fan of the summer movie season, often watching and re-watching trailers for the sure fire hits in order to get myself more and more excited for their releases. However, with Super 8, I absolutely refused to learn or know of the story or characters. For the first time that I can remember, I walked into the theater with zero knowledge of what to expect and I can honestly say that I walked away wholly surprised and completely satisfied. <br/><br/>J.J. Abrams has never been one to disappoint for me (Lost, Cloverfield, Star Trek)but there was no way to anticipate the power behind this film. Taking several cues from some of cinema's most famous science-fiction titles but yet still managing to make the entire experience seem new, Abrams has crafted a universe with an emotional story that doesn't let go even after the credits roll."

","It is the summer of 1979 and a group of friends are filming an amateur movie for the contest. During one of the scenes they witness a train crash which put the start to the chain of events that are going to change the lives of all people in their small town.<br/><br/>I was not intending to watch this movie based on what I saw in the trailer. I am not a great fan of horrors or anything like that, and given the fact that 2011 was rich in good movies, my conscience did not object much. Anyway, as the flow of movies came to a stall, I got back to the Super 8.<br/><br/>Well, J.J. Abrams, writer and director of the movie, fooled me. It is beyond the understanding come the trailer to the movie is so detached and different from the movie itself, as if the trailer was a completely independent unit of cinematography. In a way this is good as it does not give away all the catches of the movie, but the fact remains that based on the trailer you would expect something completely different.<br/><br/>And J.J. Abrams continues to fool the audience throughout the film. This movie is a mystery itself, like the cubes featured in the film. It takes all possible forms and shapes: it starts off as simple rom-com, quickly grows into drama, in a split second becomes first-class action, transforms into classical sci-fi and then back into action. This is the movie-chameleon, movie-enigma, movie-transformer, movie-Rubik's Cube. It quotes directly almost all famous movies in the genres it mimics, starting from the Alien and ending with Saving Private Ryan. J.J. Abrams plays with the movie as if he was not sure himself what he wanted to write about. However, despite the constant transformations, the movie is still coherent, without any logical gaps or inconsistencies. It manages to keep a pretty fast pace, even though it dips sometimes when switched to a more slow-paced genre.<br/><br/>This transformational nature of the movie imprints on the characters created. The film incorporates children who act as adults, and adults who act as children, and children who act as children. In the end you start to wonder whether the roles were assigned correctly, or whether the age groups have been messed up; but stay calm – this is just a part of the movie which tries to understand what and whom it is about. And the actors are perfectly up to the task, with super-serious Elle Fanning (as Alice Dainard) playing like an adult and child-like emotional Ron Eldard as Louis Dainard.<br/><br/>In the end, it becomes clear that the Super 8 just continues the trend of 2011: it is one more movie about the movies. But this one is different from the Artist or Hugo in a sense that it does not hail any particular time period in the history of the cinematography (even though it could be argued it concentrates on the movies of 70s-early 80s), but it explores all the different genres a movie can be, and tries the mask of every single one of them. It is the anthem to the variety on the movie market, as well as the keen amateurs from 70s-80s who used Super 8 to film their view of the world, whatever those views were.<br/><br/>m-picturegoer.blogspot.com"
"TheUnknown837-1","7","0","1","2 March 2012"," I hate to sound mixed about a film I did enjoy, but I do feel there are two stories, meant to be separated, going on here
","I must confess that despite my affection for some of J.J. Abrams' other films, I was not all that eager and looking forward to ""Super 8."" Chiefly, because I had intensely disliked his last monster-on-the-loose picture, ""Cloverfield."" My hopes were heightened when I learned of Steven Spielberg's involvement in this new picture, and when I learned of the premise, and most of all, when I learned that it was going to be filmed in traditional movie-making format, not the ""found footage"" mockumentary techniques in which Mr. Abrams' first monster movie was made. But uneven as it is, and although it contains an action scene more idiotic than almost anything in Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" movies, ""Super 8"" is a perfectly enjoyable movie, although I do feel that the credit for that goes more to its producer than its director.<br/><br/>Like 1982's ""Poltergeist,"" another Spielberg film directed by somebody else, ""Super 8"" has the fingerprints of its producer stamped all over it. Clearly, it has J.J. Abrams' directing style, but the soul and spirit of this movie is that of vintage Steven Spielberg movies such as ""E.T."" and, more particularly, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" It's almost surprising that Mr. Spielberg didn't make this movie in the 1970s, since it really is a tribute to two things that he embellished in as a kid: science-fiction spectacles and making movies on Super 8 film.<br/><br/>For those who do no remember, Super 8 film was the precursor to the home-video camera. Footage was shot on actual film, which had to be taken to a developer and processed, and then run through a projector in order to be seen. Here's the premise. It is the 1970s and some junior high kids are putting together a home-made movie for a film contest. In it we've got the ambitious young director who wants to be the next George A. Romero, the do-goodie best friend, the pyromaniac (who provides their special effects), and the pretty upperclasswoman whom two of the boys are vying over. Following a train wreck - which I will discuss in great detail later - a series of mysterious killings are taking place around their home town as they make their movie. The government steps in, family drama escalates into mayhem, and to add on top of that, there is a giant animal running loose in the countryside.<br/><br/>In ""Jaws,"" we didn't see even so much as the shark's dorsal fin until the first hour was up; I didn't clock it, but it seemed that three-quarters of ""Super 8"" was gone by before we catch a glimpse of this new critter, whose identity I will keep secret. The technique, though a little overdone with a few too many attack sequences that essentially just replay one another, is efficiently-done and builds up the suspense quite nicely. But I have to be honest, the creature subplot is the least-interesting element of the movie.<br/><br/>What really commanded my attention was the drama, particularly because of these fleshed-out characters. The children are amazingly well-played by fresh young talents such as Elle Fanning, Joel Courtney, and Riley Griffith. The movie captures the spirit of youth, particularly the preteen first-feelings of affection that all of us can too plainly remember, even if we don't want to admit to them. Subplots dealing with the parents, and their back stories, are also well-handled. So as I was watching ""Super 8,"" I kept wondering to myself 'Why couldn't the story be more about these people than that thing smashing in the hoods of cars?' They are so interesting, recalling the warm feelings of Mr. Spielberg's ""E.T."" The creature is an interesting creation in and of itself, but I do wish that it could have been saved for another movie. As someone who delved into making movies as a child (I would always throw fits whenever my VHS camcorder ran out of tape), the scenes with the kids making their movie were extremely captivating. It's something any aspiring or accomplished filmmaker can relate to.<br/><br/>The film, uneven as it is, is worth seeing. The only really dreadful thing in it is the train wreck that I mentioned above. It is early on, and had me fretting that I was in for a Michael Bay movie. A train is driving along, when a pickup truck crosses the tracks. The two collide and the train, which must have been made of nitro-glycerin, goes up in flames. Entire cars start raining from the sky without end, so much that the entire set must have contained at least fifty cars and the explosion got to each and every one of them. On and on it goes, with cars pummeling into the ground without end, and yet the children, who are standing right next to the tracks at the moment of impact, are not harmed, and the driver of the pickup is only a little worse off.<br/><br/>Enough on that, though. ""Super 8"" is a most charming movie that uses nostalgia to its hilt. But again, comparing and contrasting my interest in the characters versus my interest in the creature running amok between scenes, I kept on wondering what sort of film this really wanted to be. Was Mr. Abrams more interested in making a monster movie? Or was Mr. Spielberg more interested in making another inner-child film? Or was it vice versa? Who wanted to do what? I hate to sound mixed about a film that I did enjoy, but I do feel there are two separate stories going on here. And one is more interesting than the other."

","On watching the trailer, I thought the film resembled the weak movie ""Salvage"" with a higher budget and highly acclaimed producer and director. <br/><br/>Apparently, I was right. <br/><br/>The higher budget changed... well, essentially nothing. It's a ""monster movie"" that barely has a monster in it, dysfunctional families and military who range from unhelpful to being terrible people. Oh and strange occurrences happen and occasionally get brought up although not that much - that would distract the audience from the characters who aren't charismatic and don't give the audience much investment in their problems. <br/><br/>Actually, despite the similar focus on unlikable characters, ""Salvage"" was probably more watchable - its shorter, if nothing else."

","From producer Steven Spielberg, and writer/director and creator of Lost, J.J. Abrams (Mission: Impossibe III), I saw the trailer for this film in the cinema, it got a lot of hype, but I wasn't sure whether I would want to see it or not, but I did watch eventually. Basically, set in summer 1979, Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), Charles Kaznyk (Riley Griffiths), Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning), Preston (Zach Mills), Martin (Gabriel Basso) and Cary (Ryan Lee) are six young friends making a zombie movie with a camera that uses Super 8 mm film. Alice is the daughter Louis Dainard (Ron Eldard), who Joe's father Deputy Jack Lamb (Kyle Chandler) blames for the death of his wife who died in a factory accident, as he did not do his shift in the same factory and she took over. The youngsters are making this movie which Charles hopes to enter into a local film festival, and bringing in Alice as a leading character they continue filming at a train depot, and they are surprised by her talent. They film the scene they planned with a train passes, but Joe sees a pickup truck driving on the track, and it crashes causing a huge derailment and pileup, and all the kids are lucky to be alive. In the wreckage they find strange white cubes, and the truck that crashed has their biology teacher Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman) inside, he crashed on purpose, and at gunpoint he tells them not to talk about what happened to anyone. The next day the crash site is surrounded and being secured by the U.S. Airforce, led by Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich), who comes across one of the Super 8 film reels and realises someone filmed the accident, but weirder things happen with dogs, kitchen appliances, car engines, power lines and even people vanishing. While Jack is arrested trying to get inside information into what is really going on, and the Air Force start preparations to evacuate the town, Joe and Charles look at the footage back, and not only plan to continue filming, but in the footage they spot an alien monster creature crawling from the wreckage. It is found out that Alice is missing as well, so Joe, Charles, Cary, and Martin start their own mission to find and get her back, and ultimately find out what is going on in the town. They find out, from looking in the secret files in Woodward's stash that there are aliens, and they have only come to Earth to rebuild their ship and go home again, and the white cubes shape shift to help them, and Woodward had a telepathic connection with the escaped alien, he crashed the truck into the train to release it. Jack manages to escape his captivity, but he is forced to take Dainard with him when he finds out that the youngsters have gone back into the cordoned off town looking for Alice, and while travelling together Jack and Dainard resolve their differences. When Colonel Nelec catches the children, the alien shows up attacking and the military are firing, creating a big war zone situation, with the children caught in the battle. While an injured Martin and Charles looking after him stay behind, Joe and Cary go to look for Alice, and they find the alien's lair near the cemetery Joe's mother was buried, and it is there they find her, many other missing people, and all the missing appliances and stuff, all put in supposedly for food. The alien is about to do something to Joe, but he speaks to it and it understands his words telling him to let go of its bad feelings, and it lets the children and everyone else all go. Moments later the people are all reunited with their loves ones, and all the white cubes soar into the sky, drawn by huge magnetic force, to build up an alien spaceship which the creature enters, and it takes off after Joe lets go of his locket containing a photo of his mother. In the closing credits we see the completed zombie movie that the children made with the Super 8 film. Also starring Kyle Chandler as Jackson Lamb, Jessica Tuck as Mrs. Kaznyk and The Simpsons' Dan Castellaneta as Izzy. All the young actors do fantastic in the situations they are put in, especially standing out are Courtney and Fanning who of course have a sweet relationship in the story as well, I can agree with the critics that the special effects moments are fantastic to watch, but at the same time the regular scenes with the children and other characters interacting is fantastic as well, but overall it adds up to a great science fiction adventure. Very good!"

","Super 8 (2011) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>A cross between THE GOONIES and a 50s sci-fi movie, SUPER 8 tells the story of a group of kids in 1979 who are making their own zombie movie via a super 8 camera. Everything is going fine until one night they capture a train derailment and soon the military moves into their town and starts to take things over. No one can get any answers but it appears one of the school teachers knows a secret that the government wants to keep from everyone. With a director like J.J. Abrams and a producer like Steven Spielberg you know there would be something good and that's exactly what we're given, although I think the film falls well short of being a great picture. I'm shocked to say this but I think the movie works best as a character development more than a monster or action movie. I think the best thing going for the film is the relationship between our main hero Joe (Joel Courtney) and Alice (Elle Fanning). The two of them are connected through a tragedy and the way this place out was quite touching and the minor romance between the two was a lot better than some of the big-budget romantic comedies that get released each year. The way both characters and their fathers develop made for a very interesting movie and it's not something you typical see in a film like this. It also doesn't hurt that the performances are so strong. The kid actors all do a very good job in their parts as does Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard as the parents. Another strong thing is that they capture the 1970s very well and I'd almost say this film feels exactly like a movie from that period and especially some of the made-for-TV movies that were scaring kids at the time. There are a few problems with the film and one of them is that there's really no suspense or drama. The film plays everything very safe and I'd say it plays things way too safe because you never feel as if any of our main characters are in trouble. Another problem is that the film runs about ten-minutes too long and when you consider how the movie ends you can't help but think some of the stuff leading up to it could have been cut. Finally, the monster in the movie really doesn't work and when the big reveal happens I must say that I was letdown. With that said, SUPER 8 is still worth viewing for fans of the genre but I think what really makes the film work are the characters."

","This was the perfect summer action flick to me. It was a heart-pounding popcorn flick that had a lot of heart and likable characters. Did you guys expect LOST level complexity? Some sort of Sci-Fi revelation? I read a lot of hate for 'Super 8', but I have never heard one bad review of the 1980s classic movie 'Stand By Me'. If Abrams deserves one criticism, it is for (essentially) referencing that movie a ton. This movie is about the characters, and the magic of child hood more than anything else. I think a lot of adults go into a movie like this wanting more depth or better this or better that, but this was supposed to be a family summer blockbuster, and considering the nature of the movie and the intended audience, I find it a very smart, entertaining film. It doesn't have a whole lot of instant re-watch-ability, but then again most movies don't.<br/><br/>In an era where 'filmmakers' buy scripts from others, I have a massive amount of respect for Abrams doing both the directing and the writing. Despite similarities to some other films and occasional (I would argue intentional) movie clichés throughout, this is a unique film, not a sequel or remake. Considering he made this, and is only now getting to his second Star Trek film, I think it is apparent how much he wanted this film made, and that kind of passion really shows in the finished product, especially when you are looking for it."

","It's 1979, E.L.O. and The Knack are on the transistor radio and the Walkman, Three Mile Island is on the TV, but five young teenagers escape from school at the start of the summer vacation with nothing on their mind except finishing their zombie home movie, shot on a Super 8 movie camera. Well, not quite: one of them fancies the pretty blonde daughter of the local bad boy, and – having added the character of a wife for the zombie-hunting detective – asks one of the others to persuade her to join the crew. <br/><br/>They assemble at the local train station at midnight to shoot the tearful wife begging her detective husband not to leave her. A real-life train thunders its way toward the station, and the team, eager to embrace the concept of 'production values', spring into action for a take. But a truck suddenly appears on the track, driving straight for the train.<br/><br/>What follows sees the town experiencing mysterious vanishings of machines then people, the military taking a close interest in the train wreck and something very nasty in the woods, before an ending that well, more on that later.<br/><br/>Produced by Steve Spielberg but written and directed by JJ Abrams, Super 8 is essentially a tribute to that far-off golden summer, when Abrams would have been thirteen himself. It's a tribute, too, to the small-town American values that Spielberg, of course, championed, to old-school movie making before digital age, and to friendship, and love (old and new), loss and letting go. <br/><br/>Perhaps something more original could reasonably have been expected from Abrams, creator of Alias, Lost and Cloverfield; certainly much of the film's plot will be familiar to fans of Poltergeist, The Goonies, Explorers and all of those kids' adventure films of the mid-eighties. There are many inconsistencies, and many very very lucky co-incidences that keep things moving along. The adult performances are only adequate and the ending will be not at all unfamiliar to anyone who saw a certain Big Film of 1982.<br/><br/>But it would be churlish to complain, and here's why. <br/><br/>There are some neat nods to film-making techniques and tropes, such as the scientists' documentary footage that screams of fifties B-movies. In an echo of both Cloverfield and Spielberg's War of the Worlds, there are some inevitable 9/11 references and there is some blood and guts. Just as Spielberg portrayed this milieu and these emotions straight and without cynicism, so to does Abrams; there is nothing ironic or spiteful about the relationships depicted and the teenagers are each carefully drawn. Importantly, though, and to recognise that things do change in a generation, these teenagers are smart, snappy and modern, without being unpleasant or super-saccharine.<br/><br/>Critically, the acting of every one of the six friends is, quite simply, superb. Joel Courtney is the quiet Joe, grieving for his mother but too confined by his father's reaction to the loss; Riley Griffiths is ballsy Charles, putative film mogul whose love for the girl nearly spoils things; Gabriel Basso is Martin, whose reactions as events spiral into an abyss shows real, genuine fear and pain; Ryan Lee is talkative firestarter Cary; and Zach Mills is world-weary Preston, with whom things are always safe. Improvisation shows in some of the sequences, and everyone gets their moment. <br/><br/>It's Elle Fanning, however, as that Girl – Alice – who really shines. <br/><br/>She delivers an exceptional performance throughout the film, but in two scenes in particular is absolutely heartbreaking. Both are enhanced by the sensitivity and skills of Abrams' direction. Early on, when the friends rehearse the film-within-the-film's station farewell scene, Abrams conjures a magical moment of young love emergent as, at the end of the take, all five of the boys are surprised to find lumps in their throats and the need for excuses to look away, the better to wipe their eyes. In contrast, when Alice later confesses her personal link to Joe's mother's death, it is made all the more powerful by the simplicity of its staging, Alice facing only the flickering screen showing Joe's father's home movies whilst Joe sits silently a little apart from her. I challenge anyone not to shed a tear at either scene, played to the hilt by an actress who was just twelve when the film was made.<br/><br/>As if that wasn't enough to recommend it, don't miss the end credits. You don't get any outtakes or sneak peaks or dance numbers; but what you do get is The Case, the complete film-within-the-film that the characters started making at the beginning, with all the wise innocence you'd expect. It's wonderful.<br/><br/>For all its flaws, this film's heart is absolutely in the right place, and if the direction and writing are a little lacking from their incendiary best at times, I think we can allow that."

","Super 8 is an action mystery that takes place during the summer of 1979 in the small town of Lillian, Ohio. It's been four months since the accidental death of Joe Lamb's (Joel Courtney) mother. He and a group of friends are making a movie, ""The Case"", to submit to a local film contest. Charles (Riley Griffiths) is the director; Joe handles the makeup; Cary (Ryan Lee) plays the zombie; Martin (Gabriel Basso) is the lead actor; Alice (Elle Fanning) is the lead actress; and Preston (Zach Mills) is a supporting actor. One evening the group sneaks out to film a pivotal scene at a nearby train station. While there, Joe spots a speeding truck and watches as it turns on the railroad tracks and collides head on into the passing locomotive. The ensuing accident is horrific, and chaos ensues all around our young filmmakers. As the unknown contents of the train are released, the group narrowly escapes being caught when the Air-Force arrives to contain the crash site. Soon, strange occurrences begin happening in and around town. The Sheriff vanishes, and then Jackson begins questioning Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich) about the contents of the train. As the teens discover what was on the train one of their group goes missing; while separately Jackson pieces together parts of the puzzle. It's a race against the clock. For the teens to save their friend and Jackson to save his town, they're going to have to find what's out there and stop both it and Nelec from destroying everything important to them.<br/><br/>When viewing a movie, escaping into what you see is likely. It could be the storyline, the performance, or just the vision on the screen. We sit in our seat watching the previews, anxiously waiting for the movie to begin, and once the movie starts, the viewer is transported into the filmmaker's vision. Super 8 is J.J. Abrams' (Star Trek, Mission Impossible III) homage to Steven Spielberg, also a producer on the film. Super 8 stands alongside Spielberg's greats, E.T., The Goonies, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, as a superbly made beautiful picture. One of the keys to separating a good movie from being either bad or borderline great is in the casting. J.J. Abrams' casting of mostly unknowns as the young teens was perfect. How a movie is marketed is equally important. There is nothing worse than seeing a movie only to find that all the best scenes were in the trailers or previews. Abrams artfully creates interest without ruining the plot or the mystery, and the audience is never cheated. In this cleverly crafted production, we experience suspense and receive entertainment. As much as I enjoyed Star Trek and Mission Impossible, along with TV shows Alias and Lost, I look forward to Abrams making more films that go against the grain.<br/><br/>I tried not to spoil much, but I must say.the train accident is one of the most intense scenes I've ever viewed on the big screen. It was on par with the airplane crash in Castaway, and better than the train crash in The Fugitive. Also, be sure to stay for the creditsyou won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Summer Movie Grade: A<br/><br/>visit our site at www.twodudereview.com"

","Beginning with the good aspects of this film, I have to say I was surprised by the cast. The kids do a good job and, even if I wasn't expecting anything good from Elle Fanning (don't know why), she did proved me wrong and did a brilliant job.<br/><br/>Having said that, it's hard to defend this film. The narrative is full of holes and it's very predictable, even annoying. Bits like the one where a lighter doesn't work until the very last moment are simply stupid at this point in time because we've all seen it in a lot of movies and we know what's going to happen. And that's just one example in many others. It's like they think we're stupid. The story is a bit dated and adds nothing to the genre and, worst of all, it's very badly worked. As for the rest, it's competent as any decent Hollywood film, but it doesn't stand out in any way, making it banal.<br/><br/>If you seen Cloverfield, and I loved that movie, don't bother with this one. It'll just make you angry.<br/><br/>6/10 (and I'm being nice)"

","I didn't know much about this movie prior to renting it, but remembered it was a Steven Spielberg film. I absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>The kids' acting was great. I especially liked the small kid with the braces, very funny. They were all great actually, especially the main character.<br/><br/>The movie really got my attention with the train accident. WOW!!! I've read some of the other reviews where people say there's nothing really new here, which is true, but it's a fun, exciting, and emotional movie nonetheless.<br/><br/>Rent it, buy it, watch it over and over. I wouldn't recommend this movie to kids under 12 though. There are some implied gory scenes, just implied though.<br/><br/>To be honest, after finishing watching it, I couldn't wait to watch it again. It's fairly complicated and you could miss something the first time you see it.<br/><br/>As for how you watch, make sure it's on BluRay and on a large screen! If you have surround sound too then you're all set.<br/><br/>Make some popcorn, have some friends over, and enjoy. The special effects are great; the explosions, the alien, and pretty much everything in between.<br/><br/>This movie isn't going to rock your world, but it will surely be a great movie night. You'll be glad you watched it. I know I am."

","I don't quite understand why there are so many people who didn't like this film. I'll admit it had it's unnecessary and cliché moments, but I don't think that it's enough to be getting upset over. I thought this was a wonderful film.<br/><br/>The best part, by far, were the performances of the kids. Elle Fanning, Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths, Ryan Lee, Zach Mills, and Gabriel Basso all did a fantastic job. Their dialogue was believable and realistic, and just the way they communicated was quite amusing. Several great and funny quotes in this film from the kids. Well done to all of them!<br/><br/>The special effects really were special. The train crash was exaggerated, but a thrilling scene to watch. Listening to how the kids react while watching them escape was very exciting. Not to mention the scenes near the end that take place in the town. Overall, this was a thrilling film.<br/><br/>The ending was a bit strange, and I didn't fully understand why it ended that way until I re-visited the film. Eventually, I understood how and why it ended the way it did. It could've been better, but it was alright.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this film. Especially if you love sci-fi mystery/thrillers. 7/10 stars."
"TxMike","Null","0","1","27 December 2011"," Set in 1979, two movies in one.
","The subject of this movie is dear to my own heart, making Super 8 home movies. I had my own Super 8 camera in the 1970s and did a bit of filming. However most of our real movies, with acting and dialog, were made in the early 1980s with an early portable camera and VHS recorder.<br/><br/>JJ Abrams wrote and directed, and much of the inspiration came from his own youth. The core story are a bunch of ""little rascals"", 12-ish boys and girl making a movie, complete with costumes and makeup, filmed with a Super 8 camera and sound recorded to later splice in.<br/><br/>One night while filming at a train station they happen to witness a train crash, a horrific mess with cars thrown everywhere. They observe hundreds of silver knobby cubes strewn about. One of the boys brings one home with him. They manage to leave right as the military are responding to the situation.<br/><br/>Several days later when they got their movie film developed, they found an inadvertent recording of a very strange creature escaping from one of the cars. That represents the other movie within the movie.<br/><br/>The critic Ebert has a good complete review. Much like he did, I found myself much more taken with the story of the kids making the movie than I did with the strange creature and its affect on the community. Not all of the happenings, especially in the second half, came together to make a coherent story. Still, we enjoyed it.<br/><br/>As the end credits roll in the right half of the screen, the home-made movie that the kids shot is rolling in the left half. That was actually the most fun to watch.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Back in the 1950s or 1960s some sort of fast, ugly, and powerful alien was captured and the strange silver knobby cubes somehow fit together to form its space ship. The US government had been keeping it captive while studying the cubes, and that night of the train wreck it escaped from one of the cars. That was what the kids captured on their Super 8 film. It was now trying to assimilate something to ""go home"" and in the end it does."
"compi24","10","0","1","23 December 2011"," Review Of ""Super 8""
","""Super 8"" is a 2011 film directed by J.J. Abrams and starring Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning. The film follows the story of a group of kids who witness a train crash in the summer of 1979 and investigate the paranormal events of the that it has on this town. Well to be blatantly and frankly honest - I observed almost no problems in this movie whatsoever. The problems that I did observe are so trivial and insignificant that I'm not even going to waste my energy going over them. When I saw previews for this film, I saw that the prominent characters in it were mostly middle schoolers. Now, movies like this can go either one of two ways for me. One - the kids in this movie are so obnoxious as crap I don't even want to watch anymore. Two - the kids in this movie are portrayed in an enjoyable and original manner, that I can find myself relating to wholeheartedly. As you may have guessed the kids in ""Super 8"" are portrayed in the latter form. I found every child in this movie to be either hilarious or almost hauntingly familiar. In doing this, Abrams excels at portraying all of the interesting feelings and thoughts that go along with being a kid. The set pieces in this film are unbelievably breathtaking. I mean, the train crash in this movie is so astonishing, words can't even do it justice. I mean instead of saying ""train crash"" I could say ""TRAIN CRASH :D"" and that doesn't even depict the amount of intensity involved with this scene. . .yeah. The soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is incredibly diverse in emotions - it's scary, breathtaking, and thrilling all at once. The film in and of itself is a roller-coaster of emotions too. There were parts in this film where I couldn't stop laughing. Then there were parts where tension drew out like a blade. There were scenes that pulled at my heartstrings. I honestly can't say that for many of the films that have come out this year. All in all, I felt that ""Super 8"" was an almost relentlessly entertaining thrill ride. I can now see why Steven Spielberg wanted to be attached to this superbly thought out project."
"gradyharp","7","0","1","18 December 2011"," A Powerhouse Movie That Doesn't Avoid Tenderness
","Though this film rings of Spielberg in action - fantasy mixed with the magic of kids' imagination and camaraderie - SUPER 8 is a very entertaining film. It is a movie within a movie - a nice twist on reality versus illusion - and the writer/director JJ Abrams has the keen idea of show the intended movie made by the kids at the end of the film during the credits. it works very well.<br/><br/>The story involves Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and a group of youngsters getting together to make a super 8 film of their own writing and acting and production and films: Riley Griffiths (as writer/director Charles), Ryan Lee as the zombie obsessed Cary, Gabriel Basso as Martin, Zach Mills as Preston, and Elle Fanning as Alice Dainerd. As the youngsters struggle with their film we learn of town troubles - such as Joe's dad, policeman Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) and his concern with the town troublemaker Louis Dainerd (Ron Eldard) who is Alice's Dad - until everything changes as while on location at the train stop the youngster's film a bizarre train crash with a truck driven by a wise but somewhat scary science teacher. It becomes evident that there is more to the incident than meets the eye and as the youngsters realize that there is present among them a creature form space the speed of events wallops to a wild climax. In the end the Youngsters are the ones who relate to the possibilities of fantasy being real and the story ends with an uplifting sense of understanding.<br/><br/>Placed in the year 1979 in Ohio the film manages to capture the flavor of the times and the fears of the people (could all this be a Soviet attack?!) to a tee. Joel Courtney is outstanding in his role and the supporting cast is excellent. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","6","0","1","13 December 2011"," Super 8 (2011)
","J.J. Abrams makes an old skool Spielberg movie. With lens flares. Spielberg did it all bigger and better. Considering all the secrecy around the trailers, I was surprised to see how generic this was. here were no twists or turns, and the monster was very familiar. Build up is essential to great tension, so I don't know why this film lacked any suspense. Abrams humorously keeps his monster in the dark in Austin Powers nudity mode. The kids are a gang of usual stereotypes, fat kid, dumb kid, weird kid etc. We've got your usual family tragedy to try and add some gravitas. Every time a scene happened it wasn't until it had finished that I realised it was meant to have suspense. Missing dogs posters, rumbling boxes, why was all this so boring? When it kicks off, it's entertaining enough, but it was just a constant homage to the 70s/80s. Watch Close Encounters, Goonies, and E.T. for an incredible triple bill instead of this mediocre tribute."
"knowyourmovie","6","0","1","4 December 2011"," Hollow and superficial manipulation with a very few redeeming qualities
","It took me some time to identify one quality that made ""Super 8"" so disappointing and irritating for me. I think it all comes to deceptiveness of this film. There are well-made movies and poorly made movies, but deceptiveness is a unique characteristic that runs across these lines. <br/><br/>A deceptive movie is a hollow, empty movie that pretends to have a depth and a substance that in fact it does not possess. A deceptive movie (just like a deceptive person) gives empty promises, false hopes and expectations to the unsuspecting viewers. By the end of a deceptive movie, its poor victims find the promises unfulfilled, the expectations crushed, and the hopes lost in vain. <br/><br/>""Super 8"" promised a big, exciting, and enjoyable Mystery. Not only the promised mystery turns out to be somewhat predictable and not very impressive, but it also comes forth as underdeveloped and superficial. <br/><br/>The movie fails to find the right balance between the two very different stories: a sci-fi mystery story and a story of the middle school students shooting a Super 8 film for a festival in Cleveland. Ideally, these two stories are supposed to nicely complement each other and to be smoothly and intricately intertwined. In the sad reality of ""Super 8"", they do not blend and keep fighting with each other for the screen time throughout the movie. <br/><br/>The constant switches between the two main stories quickly become disrupting for the movie flow. First, the movie would immerse us in a tricky and nostalgic world of the teenage relationships and even hint for some depth and character development, and then it would almost abruptly switch gears and go into a hard-core sci-fi action/mystery mode. It would almost succeed in making us excited about the sci-fi part only to quickly switch back to the twists and turns of the teenage relationships saga.<br/><br/>As a result, both plot lines lack depth and remain superficial and underdeveloped.<br/><br/>""Super 8"" makes a significant effort to re-create a look and feel of a small American town in the late 1970s. It makes us believe that the time setting of the movie has a purpose, significance, and that it will play a role in the movie by somehow anchoring the events. This impression, however, turns out to be false. The plot can be easily moved ten, twenty, thirty years forward in time with some minor modifications. The only ones who would suffer from that would be a small group of nostalgic fans of the ""Super 8"" motion picture film format. <br/><br/>Moreover, while the movie does a remarkably good job at recreating all the minor details of the time, it fails to breathe life into its perfect, but soulless, artificial creation.<br/><br/>Almost everything in the movie is an over-used cliché: a group of teenagers with the predictable characters and relationships, a sheriff of a small town and his heroic deputy, a quirky town folk, a rogue, but noble scientist that fights a caricature military villain. Last, but not the least is the disappointing, underdeveloped so-called ""mystery"" that looks like it has been compiled from some past movies featuring similar ""mysteries"".<br/><br/>Overall, there is a lot of technical professionalism, thoroughness, and attention to detail in ""Super 8"", but not so much heart or depth. <br/><br/>In some movies, a good acting redeems the lack of depth or the deficiencies of the plot. Unfortunately, that is not the case for ""Super 8"" with its mostly mediocre acting. The only bright spot in the cast are some of the teenage actors, and especially Elle Fanning! Her sincere, deep, and versatile performance easily wins the audience. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie does not do justice for J.J. Abrams who as we very well know is quite capable of creating such gems as ""Star Trek"" (2009). In ""Super 8"", however, there seems to be much more of Steven Spielberg, who produced it, than of J.J. Abrams who wrote it and directed it. In my opinion, this is a classic example when a too heavy influence of the producer not only does not benefit the movie, but also makes it quite shallower and quite less original than it potentially could have been. <br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"

","Saw Super 8 a couple of days ago and was really looking forward to it. But, I wasn't really happy with the end result. Although the setting of the movie, the late 1970s, is well captured and the tension build up until the train crash incident is pretty exciting...when the monster's on the loose, it gets kinda boring. The alien monster wasn't interesting at all. I thought it looked too weird to be such an intelligent lifeform. Furthermore, I hated that the monster was almost always present in a very dark setting. We didn't really get a good look at it. Why's that?! Mean...when Jurassic Park came out, most of the dinosaurs were CG-animated in a dark setting, but that was because CG technology wasn't as far as it is now (they did this by way of masking the CG flaws...although I didn't really see they were bad). I know they said in the movie Super 8 that the monster liked to live underground, but that's a bit of a weak excuse not to show the monster in broad daylight. But they did, probably also because it's more scary when a monster only appears in the dark. Well, that's more or less true, but there are also a lot of examples as to when a monster is also scary at broad daylight (see for instance Jaws). Anyways, my conclusion is that this movie could have been so much more!"

One night, while filming, they witness a horrific train derailment that involves their teacher. Before they know it, the military arrives and takes over their little town and the boys find themselves in danger.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie focuses on the boys' friendships and their movie-making and is fairly interesting, but I didn't particularly like any of the kids and they use too much profanity. When the sci-fi part kicks in, logic flies out the window and there are plot holes galore. It was hard to follow because this part is filmed in near-total darkness and very hard to see so it was dull for me. The whole thing tries to be similar in tone to ""ET,"" but seems like a cheap rip-off. The kids aren't charismatic, the military men are cartoonishly evil, and the monster is a let-down (when you can see it). The special effects are great but the story itself is weak."

But the story itself was very shallow and is the major letdown though I still think it is a great production. But in my account - the story itself count for more than 50% of greatness in movie, that is why I'm so disappointed.<br/><br/>The story become very cliché after a while and by the time you met the reason of all the mystery you will end up feeling disappointed especially if you have seen Cloverfield. But in Cloverfield it was new at that time. This is like a repetition but a kiddo version. Even though it was suppose to be like friends bonding and all; I don't really feel connected with the characters.<br/><br/>The casting and acting was in fact brilliant considering they are very young and new to the industry. Especially Elle Fanning, she was awesome. The rest of the cast also did the good job, but with the limited screen time they are the one we don't care.<br/><br/>The set look great and have this mystifying experience. The mood and tone is very well delivered and cleverly shot with absolutely great lighting.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is still very much entertaining but wasn't living up to the expectation. I still think this will be really enjoyed by kids of age 7-15, or grownup that already have kids.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Still - Yes, Have Low Expectation And You Might Enjoy It.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C+)"

","What happens when you take Spielberg movies, stick them in a blender, and then lay out the result? One gets Super 8. The train crashing for 15 minutes? Standard Spielberg staple of chain reactions. The monster? Standard Spielberg staple of whatevers meant to look nasty, weird, or be nasty and/or weird in Spielberg's movies. Hero coming out alive? ... Authorities covering up? .... The alien is missing one item in order to get his thing to work and leave? ... Ad nauseam. And then the predictability factor: the guy is using a film that needs developing, and one knows right away it will show something that had escaped the public's and the characters' eyes (in this case the monster). Imagine it had also escaped the super 8 camera, had it been focused in hundreds of other possible ways! Amidst this desolation, I liked the dogs fleeing the region.

However i gave this movie a 7 because of it's amazing cast.The kids truly made the movie a fun to watch.Amazing acting skills,good humour,good execution.The entire credit goes to the cast and the direction.(Especially Elle,definitely better than her elder sister).

We never learn anything about it other then it wants to go home, it's big and scary but has incredible intelligence which makes no sense. The sub plot of child/father relationship is boring, the over use of light flares and optical effects gets dull quick.<br/><br/>Frankly what is the point?

The clichéd, super overbearing bad father, the plain stupid military fudging along like no one else exists, even dumber townsfolk moaning about microwaves disappearing, and then ridiculous and unexplained powers of the alien visitor.<br/><br/>Overall entertaining, but definitely been done before, especially the weak ending. This film promised much, but ultimately failed to reach the goal not only because of the rehashed plot, but also for being a little insulting to the intelligence (even if you are a kid)"
"Rory-stewart25","8","0","1","10 October 2011"," Could've been VERY good... but wasn't.
","The majority of this movie was very good. The whole idea of the kids making the movie, the fat kid thinking he's a movie director, the blonde kid with the worrying number of explosives and everyone's obsession with ""production value"" was really clever. The majority of the movie rather focuses on the kids then the monster, and these bits are the best bits of the movie, especially Joe's relationship with Alice, and the majority of the let- downs of the movie are cause by the monster.<br/><br/>My thoughts of the movie started to go downhill when Joe's dad knocks out the military officer, steals his uniform and blows up the tanker, ""Mission Impossible"" style. It didn't really have the same feel as the rest of the movie and felt like it had just been thrown in to give the movie some action and explosions, and it just wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>The next bit that was ruined was when operation ""Walking Distance"" was in action and everyone was being evacuated. The military had set the grass on fire, but then that just dissolved into nothing as it was never brought up again, and you almost forgot why the evacuation was in place.<br/><br/>Then there was the characters. A lot of people had no feel or depth and felt like the had been thrown in for an easier story line. I felt that they shouldn't have been in the movie in the first place.<br/><br/>The main major downside of this movie was - as always - the ending. To be honest, they way the whole movie had been one big build up to when the kids meet the monster, made the ending really difficult to handle. But it was handled VERY badly. The group of kids shouldn't have split up. The monster shouldn't have been eating the people it was abducting. Everything about the bit when Joe, Alice and the blonde kid were cornered and the monster picks up Joe and he convinces the monster to stop was wrong. The last scene was very poor. Too many questions were left unanswered. I could go on and on and on, but I will say that it was a very difficult story to end, and how it should've ended is beyond me, just not as cheesy and predictable as it did.<br/><br/>One thing that made this movie good was the way the kids were - well, just kids and were wound up in the midst of everything, and the instant Joe convinces the monster to stop destroying everything, that whole theme was crushed and the corny ""kids save the world"" theme took over and ruined everything.<br/><br/>However, the development and relationships in the main characters, the suspense and build up in the first three-quarters of the movie were VERY good and are what made up for the bad ending, and what made ""Super 8"" an overall good film."
"pfgpowell-1","Null","0","1","21 September 2011"," Great film for kids but sadly pulls its punches a little too much for older folk
","For most of the way through Super 8 kept reminding myself to advise my 12-year-old son to watch it. Adults, too, will like it up to a point, and that point comes when the film's resolution is no resolution at all. When my children were younger, and sometimes still today, we watch Doctor Who together and the notably thing was that all-too-often I would get hopelessly lost and confused. Why? Because I was watching it through and adult's eyes. My two youngsters had no such problem. 'How come he was able simply to get up and walk out,' I would ask. 'Because,' they would reply, with all the scorn a child reserves for a dimwit adult, 'he used his sonic screwdriver!' This is that kind of film. Great story, but when it comes to getting an explanation for what turns out to be a truly fantastical tale, we are left begging. Super 8 involves a group of five young lads of about that age and a slightly older girl who are making a film on a super 8 camera, and its portrayal of those six is honest and truthful. While out filming, they witness a truly horrific train crash, and one of them realises that it was no accident. Cue heavy-handed air force serviceman, led by a particularly nasty type, to descend on the crash. They realise that someone has witnessed the crash and also start hunting whoever it was. Meanwhile, all kinds of weird goings on afflict the town nearby - all the dogs run off, the metal parts of everything goes missing, the electricity supply is continually disrupted, people are attacked by a 'thing' and finally the nasty air force men create a brushfire which threatens the town as a pretext for clearing the town in their hunt for the thing. So far, so good and so engrossing. But when it comes to these plot strands being resolved, I'm afraid writer/director/producer J J Abrams imagination seems to desert him. Worse, he pulls his punches badly: where we are led to believe that the 'thing' attacks people in order to kill them, they are, in fact, simply held captive in his lair (eventually to be rescued unharmed naturally - this is, after all, a certificate 13 film). But crucially no explanation is given whatsoever why the 'thing' should even bother to kidnap people as they neither threaten it and are of no use to it, either. Sadly, the attacks and the kidnaps are just a plot device. Oh, well. That's why this film - well-made, well-directed and well-acted by everyone, especially the youngsters - is more suited to uninquiring young minds who will not in the at all be disturbed by glaring holes in the plot. Given that the Steven Spielberg co-produces, the production values are high. I was especially gratified that the youngsters were not the nauseating cutey-sweet or all-knowing and cynical quasi-adults Hollywood likes to present us with, but ordinary straight-down-the-line 12 and 14-year-olds. That was one of the film's strengths. But all means go and take your youngsters to see a half-decent film, but for yourself be prepared for a little disappointment."

","Super 8 is one of those movies that you are going to see on TBS on some rainy Sunday and end up watching. It's a rainy Sunday nothing else to do kind of movie. Super 8 isn't a horrible movie but it's about as vanilla as they come.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a group of teenagers who are working on an amateur film. While shooting at night they inadvertently film a train wreck. The military shows up to clean up the mess and it soon becomes clear that the kids may have filmed something they should not have seen. Various pets and members of the town start to disappear while the military scrambles to cover up the accident. I don't want to give too much away to those who haven't seen the film so I will let you discover the rest on your own.<br/><br/>This movie is largely derivative. Most of this movie was taken from other much better films. While watching this I couldn't help but think of ET, Stand by Me, and even The Goonies. The parental conflicts are hackneyed at best and they are hurriedly and awkwardly resolved at the end of the film.<br/><br/>On the plus side there are some great special effects. The train wreck scene is definitely memorable. I was also impressed by some of the child actors. Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning were stand outs for me.<br/><br/>I don't really think that Super 8 is a bad movie. It is entertaining and will keep you watching to see what happens but it's just not really good either. It takes no risks and tries to stick to a pretty standard formula that has been done in a lot of other movies."

He loved everything else, thought he could swallow the cgi. I couldn't and didn't. The 70's feel was right on, it said early Spielberg like Close Encounters and Jaws. The cast worked the script.

Basically, this film was a more violent version of ET. What made this movie stick out was its blatant cry of 'Spielberg tribute here'. The Alien is really to violent to relate to, and this film, was, essentially, an exercise in nostalgia. The bikes, the group of kids triumphing against adversity against a 70's setting was all lovely but stand-out for the wrong reasons. Having said that, Elle Fanning had some excellent scenes, and there was some true pre-pubescent feeling in the acting, which made the film very enjoyable.

His attempt in the film to pair blockbuster action with heartfelt emotion is a noble one, but in the end, unsuccessful. The film takes place in 1979 Ohio, where young Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), reeling from his mother's death in a factory accident, is helping his best friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) make a super-8 zombie movie.

"jomousstar7","Null","0","2","30 August 2011"," seriously?
","Well i don't even know where to begin. What you must know is that i created an IMDb account only to be able to review this movie. i will do my best not to offend anyone who actually enjoyed this... It is by far one of the worst movies i have seen compared to their rating. i appreciate a bad movie with a accordingly bad rating more (like this i can at least watch it to see if it is really that bad and look for positive aspects), than a bad movie with a good rating.<br/><br/>PLOT the usual ""small talk"" before the monster appears. some kids making a movie (which was actually a lot better than the actual one). after the train crash (which i have to admit was the only impressive 3 minutes in the movie), one would expect (for an 7.5-rated movie)a mysterious conspiracy or at least something more than a bad transformers-copied homesick monster that wants to go home. having seen transformers, one has seen enough technology-constructions and for our times this here wasn't even that good. (it was mostly dark and moreover there was only one scene where you could actually see it). having seen E.T. one has seen an alien that wants to go home. having seen avatar, you have seen enough high tech film effects. there's really nothing worth watching.<br/><br/>CAST well, despite hating to be forced to complain about kids-acting, but after all, they get paid for this. Joe lamb too fake, too childish, too unprofessional. tears appear in his eyes from one shot to the other. Elle fanning was bad too, but in a different way. she reminded me of the RING-girl. she was creepy, she talked like a robot, without face expressions and there were several scenes that displayed her creepiness. (the zombie-scenes) which distracts the viewer from the actual plot and makes him think she has something to do with the train-story. at some point i prayed to god, at least she has something to do with it, or maybe she or her father killed Joe's mother. but no, she was only chosen because of her appearance, which i am in no position to judge.<br/><br/>THE HIGHLIGHT the highlight of the movie is the scene where Joe walks right in front of the monster, which grabs him and stares at him.(King Kong-copy). of course the kid couldn't say something like: ""we will help you go home"", as this way, the e.t. copy would be too obvious. so the kid says: ""we are not all bad. you can still live. you can still live"".<br/><br/>The monster does the cute doggy-stare and lets the boy back down, happy end... seriously? the sentence that cooled the monster down, that destroyed whole west Virginia, killed numerous innocent people and started immense wildfires, was ""you can still live, you can still live""?? it doesn't even make sense. it's stupid and makes me wanna punch this stupid kids face.<br/><br/>GENERAL MISTAKES/PROOFS THAT THE MOVIE SUCKS AS HELL 1) everything's too easy. which means: A. each time a kid looked for his father in this crazy mess of a town, where everything burns, he/she found him within a minute, they always stood coincidentally behind them.<br/><br/>B. the kids want to break into the school to look for information. the directors could at least make this more complicated, with key-searching or something like that. but no, the kids are within a minute in Dr. Woodward's office. <br/><br/>C. in the office (which of course was the first thought of the children, where the hidden information could be!)they find everything in front of their faces, as if waiting for them. and of course (!!!) a movie which explains the monster's whole story! the story is a secret, why the hell should a movie like this even exist?? ITS THE DAMN AIR FORSE!! wouldn't they in such a case destroy such a movie or not even allow its existence?? how stupid can a director believe us viewers to be?<br/><br/>D. how credible is the fact that such a monster, of such strength, which takes out car engines, without anyone even noticing it, can be kept in prisoned by humans? the monster destroyed the bus with only a footstep, how could it be kept in the train so easily?<br/><br/>E. the ending. the cubes (which break free from Air Force transport trucks) as well as loose metal from everywhere are attracted to the town's water tower. The cubes begin to align and a ship begins to take form around the tower, which the alien then enters. its so god dams stupid, i don't know how i can even criticize it properly. first of all, if the cubes are able to brake free from wherever they are and rebuild the ship, how come it broke in the first place?? how come it has not happened years before? and why all the other town-metals?? if there is a technology of this ship the viewer has to know in order to understand the plot the director has to provide us with at least some information. <br/><br/>MEANING/MESSAGES OR SOME KIND OF MORAL LESSONS WHATSOEVER nonexistent<br/><br/>OTHER no memorable conversation, no acting o scene worth remembering. no aspect worth recommending a movie means to me no good movie.<br/><br/>conclusion:<br/><br/>the plot is too ordinary, too easy, too little effort in details, too superficial and shallow, average cast,too much copied stuff (king Kong, e.t.,...) <br/><br/>I strongly believe that the only possible fans of this movie are people who watch movies just for fun, for some funny quotes like ""drugs are so bad"" and some average technology, without scrutinizing or questioning the plot in a deeper level. and what i hate most is this shallow system of seeing a name such as ""spielberg"" and immediately lose all sense objectivity, which i strongly believe is the main factor for such a rating."
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","0","1","30 August 2011"," Spielberg 2.0
","The more I think about ""Super 8,"" the more disappointed with the movie I get. By no means was it a terrible film but it did try to pass itself off as a homage to Spielberg classics we all grew up with and still enjoy. When you're setting the bar that high you better know you're going to reach it. Sadly, while the film may have been directed by J.J. Abrams, an obvious and laudable choice for the undertaking, Super 8 is a good film, not the experience I was hoping for.<br/><br/>The film follows the grief stricken Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), his Deputy Sheriff father (Kyle Chandler) and his small group of young troublemaking friends who are trying to make a cheap zombie flick with a super 8 camera. Joe and his hardworking father have become overwhelmed by the death of the family matriarch only a few short months ago and both are introduced as distant. Meanwhile Joe's best friend Charles (Riley Griffith) has become convinced that his film would have more resonance if a love interest was added (oh how cleverly they break the fourth wall). He then recruits Sally (Elle Fanning), the young and very cute daughter of the town drunk who also has friction with Deputy Lamb. They sneak off to the train station to shoot a pivotal scene and witness a terrific train derailment. Out of the wreckage a mysterious creature escapes into the nearby woods and shortly afterward, strange things start to happen around town. Metallic parts and then people start to disappear as the army descends on Anytown U.S.A.. The kids however are on the case.<br/><br/>Everything in this film is filled to the brim with top of the line special effects and old fashioned storytelling. But while the story is told coherently it does seem to run on a mechanical heart. Take for example the opening sequence. Most of the characters gather at Mrs. Lamb's wake where an altercation occurs between Joe and Sally's fathers. What is wrong with this scene? Nothing really, but the fact that you know and I know this scene was meant to coax us to emotionally invest in the main character just feels unnatural and heartless. Its almost like padding until we get to the good stuff. The same is true with most scenes meant to evoke anything other than suspense. In another pivotal scene Joe tells his father he hates him. We've seen it before, we know we've seen it before yet its there because it has to be. The filmmakers seem to be asking ""why bother making it interesting?"" I blame this partially on the writing which bares its mechanics like so much exposed wiring. The stereotypical patterns of exposition, set up, foreshadowing etc. all appear with the same obviousness and lack of enchantment. I just couldn't help but thinking, ""I should be scared here, I should be sad here, I should be laughing here"" instead of ""I am, sad, happy or on the edge of my seat."" The only time I genuinely lost myself was during the train crash which managed to send tingles down my spine despite having seen it on the trailer countless times.<br/><br/>Maybe one of the reasons, I couldn't get into it was the cinematography that J.J. Abrams constantly employs. While the light flairs and tracking shots worked to give ""Star Trek"" a glossy veneer, it was too distracting in ""Super 8"". Or maybe it was the fact that a lot of characters acted as plot devices rather than real people with motivations. Or maybe it was the unsubtle military bashing.<br/><br/>Either way, I still enjoyed myself. The characters are fun, the story is told well and it did capture the moment, if only for a few minutes. Comparing ""Super 8"" to, say ""Close Encounters"" is like comparing The Beatles to U2; both may be good and some may even enjoy the new over the old, but its just not the same. You lose some of the flair and raw originality with every new generation and when you get down to it, its more imitation than re-imagination.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"
"charlie_d_007","7","0","1","28 August 2011"," A good film, let down by a weak final act
","It would be wrong to call Super 8 a bad film; it is certainly not. However it is a film of inconsistently quality, perhaps the perfect example of a film of 'two halves'. While the first half (or more precisely, the first and second acts) is a fun, nostalgic character centred sci-fi drama with a slight hint of horror, the final act falls flat, removing most aspects that made the film's beginning so appealing.<br/><br/>The heart of Super 8, and the main focus of the first two acts, is the story of a group of young friends. Surprisingly, the child actors are convincing and make their characters enjoyable to watch; a rarity in films centred around children. Their friends are striving to created a low budget zombie film, and their attempts are entertaining to watch, and genuinely funny (again, usually hard to achieve with child actors). In fact, for the first two acts, the sci-fi element is very much played down; it is a character centred drama that just happens to contain an alien, and surprisingly it works excellently.<br/><br/>The success of the film's first two acts lies in its wonderful blending of genuinely funny comedy, interesting character development, occasional action sequences, and sparing moments of sci-fi. Indeed, if a viewer watched this film purely on the assumption that it was a straight up sci-fi film, they would most likely be disappointed by the films opening. What J.J. Abrams manages to do, is recapture some of Steven Spielberg magic, and it is a joy to watch; films are rarely made like this anymore.<br/><br/>It is also worth mentioning the fairly decent special effects. The train crash, a key part of the films marketing, is a dazzling spectacle, if a little far fetched. The alien itself is convincing, if a little bit underwhelming in its design.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, after an extremely promising initial half, the film slowly but surely goes down hill. Nearly everything that is excellent about the first half is completely removed from the final act; the kids split up, the alien is no longer used in a suspenseful way, and the plot becomes a lot less tight (seemingly just to include many actions scenes). It is most clearly seen in this final act, that J.J. Abrams cannot perfectly recreated a Spielberg film; Abrams simply goes to heavy on the action (relative to the beginning of the film), and the movie suffers greatly for it. The final act's shift away from the group of friends is a fatal mistake. The decision removes the film's heart and soul, and as a result the final act is dull compared to the first two.<br/><br/>Thus, as previously mentioned, the movie perfectly defines a film of two-halves; the first half being an interesting nostalgia trip, the second half being an average run-of the-mill sci-fi action flick. Consequently, the film ends up being an inconsistent, slightly above average film, where one truly feels as if they have watched two very different films instead of one cohesive production.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending seems weak. Certainly, it seems J.J. Abrams has not mastered the emotional ending as well as Spliberg, and thus the film ends on a slightly cheesy note, very much on par with Spielberg's uncharacteristically weak ending to his 'War of the Worlds' remake. A disappointing ending leaves the film on a low note, and thus damages the overall product.<br/><br/>But, overall, this film is an enjoyable piece of entertainment, if not a potential 'Best Picture' nominee. The film is a summer blockbuster with a real heart and an enjoyable set of characters; a rare occurrence. It is a slight let down, but nevertheless exactly what many more films should strive to be; fun.<br/><br/>7/10"

Oh, and that Spielberg and Abrams have their hands in it somehow.<br/><br/>For the first hour or so I was enjoying myself immensely. Sure, the movie was flailing around seemingly not knowing whether it wants to be E.T., Goonies, Predator, Jurassic Park or all of the above, but who cares, it was fun.

Dangling plot lines, forced resolutions, character arcs that turned out to be completely redundant and worst of all - out-of-place clichés that seem to come from nowhere and from some completely different movies.

","Teaser campaigns, viral marketing and the meeting of two great minds all meant that 'Super 8' had a lot to live up to and sadly it just couldn't. The trouble with J J Abrams meeting his hero in Spielberg and then trying to emulate his style from his peak period in the eighties (he has achieved it, 'borrowing' bits from so many of Spielberg's films that had he not been involved he probably would have sued) is that the film never really finds its own identity. What made films like E.T., Jaws, Goonies and Stand By Me great was they were so original and different and so amazingly iconic, classic movie moments that stood out and set them apart. Most modern films I see I can't remember what happened in them just hours after I've seen them but who can forget the boulder scene from Indiana Jones or the bike flight from E.T.. All the classic kids films that 'Super 8' wants so badly to be had one thing in common and that is a solid story, it doesn't matter how far-fetched it was, as long as you cared and it took you on a fantastic journey and provided an escape from the real world for an hour and a half. These films didn't have the technology or budgets of today's blockbusters but they did have charm and genuine moments that movie memories are made of, the wow factor. So what of 'Super 8' well it is basically The Goonies meets Cloverfield, a group of kids verses a monster/alien (that drastically changes size depending on the scene), its filmmaking by numbers as every box is ticked to create the most formulaic template imaginable, kid who lost his mum, fat kid who likes eating, kid who likes explosives, pretty girl with daddy issues etc. all bound together by the common goal of saving the town from the mysterious train cargo from outer space. You probably wouldn't mind so many unrealistic acts and plot holes if the story was strong enough to carry it through but at no point does the film surprise or shock, from the moment it starts you can tell exactly where it's going. What starts of quite promising quickly descends into clichés and cheesiness and finishes with an ending so flat it makes you wonder if they just gave up half way through. With the best bits of what's been before 'Super 8' could have been great but just like taking ingredients from a variety of other meals and mixing them together in the hope of creating a new exciting dish, sometimes you have to concede that it just doesn't work and the sum of the parts actually leaves a bitter taste in your mouth."

Thinking its Mr. Spielberg himself in the Character of ""Charles"".<br/><br/>Here are a few facts that made me think of it:<br/><br/>*The story was plotted in Ohio where Mr. Spielberg was born.<br/><br/>*His Wikipedia say he made a movie with a 8 m.m. Camera with a scene ""wrecks he staged with his Lionel train set""<br/><br/>*The second paragraph also stated that Mr. Spielberg noted in the Wikipedia page that, ""My dad's still-camera was broken, so I asked the scoutmaster if I could tell a story with my father's movie camera. He said yes, and I got an idea to do a Western. I made it and got my merit badge. That was how it all started."" It does sound familiar with the story, isn't it?<br/><br/>But of course I can be wrong! :)"

","I heard so many things from the media and friends that had already watched the film that this movie was a cross between the 'goonies' and E.T.<br/><br/>Well I can tell you now that this film is nothing like the Goonies. For me the kids didn't have that same chemistry from what we saw in the goonies (Even though at times you feel that the film tries to take aspects of the goonies) and I doubt a group of young actors who come together will ever have that again as Spielberg and Donner hit gold there. However there were still some good acting performances, notably from Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning. But when the group were a whole together it just didn't seem to click. At times it was just not funny even though there was intended humour directed through riley Griffiths (Charlie who in the end just became completely annoying through his constant blubbering, spitting and constant tantrums) and Ryan Lee (Cary who just wanted to blow stuff up, which became tiresome after nearly two hours of watching). However I must say that Joel Courtney did have a rather striking resemblance to a young Sean Astin (Mikey from the goonies) To say the film is like E.T. is rather unfair as on a whole this film is nothing like E.T. However without giving much away there are only three aspects that are similar to E.T. The bike chases, the ending and that the film is staged in the late 70's and early 80's. To have this film staged in this era does sometimes give it an E.T. feel to things but I quite like the idea of the film being set then as it gives the film a type of authenticity.<br/><br/>Whilst watching this film you do feel a Spielberg presence and you can see very clearly some of his film influences such as those mentioned but for me at times and more notably 'close encounters of the 3rd kind' as when the story unfolds the audience find that there is a huge army presence who attempt to cover the truth from the locals. Sound familiar? Okay, forget about the films obvious influences and take it for what it is. This film is a children's adventure with a sci fi twist. At times it can be a little slow and cheesy, however it has great special effects and is on a whole enjoyable. However the ending did slightly ruin it for me and if there would of been an alternative one this film may of had a 7 or 8.<br/><br/>I'll give it 6/10."
"jacco59","7","0","2","20 August 2011"," Good movie, bad ending
","I'm writing this about 1 hour after I got out of the theater.<br/><br/>I go to everything that Steven Spielberg had anything to do with, and I haven't yet been disappointed. And that didn't change with 'Super 8'. The story is set in the 1960's, five boys and a girl who are obsessed with making movies are going to shoot a scene at midnight at a train station. As they're shooting a car drives onto the tracks and collides with a passing train, causing a huge explosion. Having survived the crash they go over to the car that caused the crash and find their science teacher, severely injured, pointing a gun at them and telling them no to tell anyone, or THEY will kill them and their parents. This is where the movie takes off.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is really good given they're all just kids, and the grown-ups also do a good job. It's really noticeable that SS produced this movie, it's all perfectly made. That man has a great talent and I hope we'll be able to see much, much more of his work.<br/><br/>Later in the movie we find out the train was an airforce train, which was carrying parts of an alien spaceship, and that the science teacher stopped the train to help the monster that hides below ground escape. The monster was locked up underground and is very angry, so when he can finally go aboveground he starts abducting random people, including the girl I talked about earlier. The boys (3 of them; one chickened out, the other has a broken leg), of course, go into the alien's lair to save her, which they manage, but then they are chased into a dead end underground tunnel passage. Joe, the main character, then bravely steps forward and convinces the alien to stop what he's doing.<br/><br/>And then comes the bad part. There's just a huge gap of information. How was the alien suddenly able to build a ship when for 5 years he was unable to? That and the ending is incredibly cliché. If not for the ending the movie would have gotten an 8 from me. But don't blame SS, he's just the producer. It's the director's and the writer's fault.<br/><br/>7/10"
"FilmFanatic03","7","0","1","20 August 2011"," A Super Film!
","I think ""Super 8"" deserves the praise that it has been given for this film was refreshing from many films out there now. However, i'm not one of those cynical people who say ""finally, a good movie amongst sequels, reboots and comic book movies"" because I love all of those but I do agree that it is still refreshing and has more focus on character than many films. ""Super 8"" owes it's praise to the casting, especially of the children who have an amazing chemistry and keep you amused all the way through...even in the actiony moments. Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) was like the leading man of the group, he was the most normal, likable and has the most substance in back story. But then there is the goofy and humorous Cary (Ryan Lee) who always carries fireworks. Also there is the wuss of the pack Martin (Gabriel Basso), the bossy director Charles (Riley Griffis) and the list goes on. Point is, each character is unique and individual yet they manage to dwell really well together, allowing to conjure up many laughs even in the intense moments. That's what made this film special, because it was from the point of view of kids instead of from the military or grown ups and in the scary moments you could laugh because of the humour of the children. This was a good film, but maybe the ending was a bit weak. Not bad but a bit weak compared to the amazing suspense and steady pace of the film. It doesn't spoil the film though. Stay for the credits because they show the short film the kids are trying to make in the film and it is really funny. The language is an issue, as a Christian the blaspheming (about 5 times) was offencive and inappropriate especially coming mainly from Charles. But there were no sexual scenes which was good. Overall, a really good film with great characters and a great story. Enjoy!"
"xz48","Null","0","1","20 August 2011"," A plain bad movie that is half baked
","My wife and I went to see this movie because it was advertised as ""what movie going is about"" -- well they took my hard-earned moeny for granted for sure because this movie is plain bad. It is actually quite difficult to spoil this movie if one has already seen ET. To sum it up: this is ET with dumb acting, badly timed scary moments, better CGI, and a combined 20sec gruesome alien scene. The actors are all candybox cover kids that are stereotyped to the core: lead nerd kid has super coolness under gunpoint like superman; lead actress is a kid hottie from a trash home that is good at art, fair, we got a hippie. Sorry, no Asian or black kids involved. The plot is comprehensible because you can follow it, but it is just badly done and I still could not quite grasp how they manage to do it so badly after Neverending story and ET were made decades ago. The scary moments come out at illogical times, and instead of ""wow"" you get ""what happened just now? somebody fill me in"". CGI is done better than the ET dummy, but so they should -- we are decades past that now. There is some alien attacking people scene and some crash scene, which is thrown in the mix to redeem what we paid for the tickets. It's a cheesy movie making to the core. Kyle Chandler is the only good actor in this whole movie as he adds a certain goofy-ness to this otherwise horrible roller-coaster. In the end my wife and I both wished this movie ended halfway so we could pay less for the hourly parking."

"BA_Harrison","6","0","2","18 August 2011"," J.J. Abrams gives Spielberg a cinematic man-hug.
","Director J.J. Abrams, an obvious sci-fi nut, was born in 1966, meaning that, like myself, he would have grown up following the career of Steven Spielberg; Super 8 is his cinematic love-letter to all things Spielbergian, a big-budget tribute to the bearded-one's particular brand of suburban sci-fi.<br/><br/>Set in a small-town America in the late 1970s, the film follows a close-knit group of high school film-makers who stumble upon a military secret whilst shooting a scene for their 8mm zombie flick. With its small group of dysfunctional friends, sinister government officials, spectacular effects-laden set-pieces, and a suitably schmaltzy message, Super 8 gets the ingredients more or less spot-on, but still fails to be a wholly satisfying affair, Abrams playing his trump card way too early with an improbably fiery but utterly exhilarating train crash that he never manages to top, followed by a rather uneventful middle third, and a disappointing finale that only succeeds in matching Spielberg in terms of mawkish sentimentality.<br/><br/>An amusing end credits sequence that features the 8mm movie made by Super 8's budding Romeros proves to be one of the highlights of the whole film."
"stephenh82","3","0","1","18 August 2011"," over hyped film
","yet again. JJ abrams always have a way to hype up every film he does by showing a very small trailer to tease you. and the end result is that he does it so well when you go to the film you have such high expectations you are left really disappointed! The film wasn't terrible, but it was a let down. it took ages to get into it, and at the final 30 minutes when you think it's going to kick up to 100mph, it doesn't, more like 30 mph. It was like cloverfield and E.T! It's like mashing up P.S. i love you with Terminator, it just wouldn't work. and if it did somehow got made, it would just look silly, just like this move. Acting was great and all that, but the story line sucked, and the ending sucked even more! Worth going to but don't go in thinking its going to be good, you might enjoy it more!"
"blacklist-1","9","0","1","15 August 2011"," A super film all round.
","Spielburg and Abrams pay tribute by combining elements from other Spielburgian movies such as Jurassic Park, ET, War of the Worlds, Poltergeist and The Goonies amongst others to create Super 8. Revolving around a bunch of teenagers, 12 year old Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) who loves to make old movies and is doing one for a competition (he is the make up/special effects guy). His love of model-making brings him into conflict with his father who is the sheriff of the town Jackson (Kyle Chandler) who wants him to play baseball. Their relationship is already fractured due to the death of Joe's mother in an industrial accident who he was close to. The other two kids who are Joe's friends Charles who is the director (Riley Griffiths) and Cary (Ryan Lee). Charles invites young girl Alice (Elle Fanning) to act as a role in the film. Whilst filming a train crashes near them that was no accident as they find their science teacher in the crash who gives them a warning.<br/><br/>Soon the military turn up and try to keep everything hush hush as the town's dogs and household appliances like microwaves start to go missing. Joel and his friends are caught up in what's going on. Meanwhile a lovely sub-plot develops of a budding romance between Joe and Alice.<br/><br/>The plot itself is nothing new but the combined elements of Spielburg's other movies creates something fascinating and new (though I know not everyone would agree), the special effects of the alien when you see it is truly spectacular and terrifying in a way. Abrams teasingly keeps the alien hidden until right near the very end keeping you uneasy and in suspense. But what makes this film such a winner in my eyes is the fact that these characters are ones you come to care about and the acting is really great. They all in particular Elle Fanning (who acts tremendously in one scene with a performance in a performance blew me away) give performances of commendable charm. The screenplay is very smart in this respect as the friendship between the kids and Joe and his dad and Alice and her's feels very real and give the character's some depth (Alice's dad blames himself for Joe's mum's death as on the day of the accident she covered for his shift in work). It also lend the film some heart, particular in one touching scene where Joe is playing an old video in his room of the times he had with his mum and Alice feels sad as she blames herself in a way for her death. There is also plenty of suspense and tension throughout the film and some great action sequences that are terrifically choreographed.<br/><br/>This is just a super film all round in the end, that though it does contain some plot holes, it didn't detract from entertaining and thrilling me from start to finish. One for the whole family to enjoy and a film I will be adding to my DVD collection in future. I really love this movie."
"neil-476","Null","0","1","12 August 2011"," Enjoyable but unoriginal
","I came out of Super 8 rather puzzled. On one hand, I enjoyed it hugely. On the other, there wasn't a single moment which I hadn't already seen elsewhere. Much of it seems to have been cobbled together from Spielberg's back catalogue, but huge numbers of other movies have been cannibalised, too (I started listing the movies it derives material from, and stopped when I got to 15 without drawing breath). My mind insists on telling me that I shouldn't have enjoyed it quite so much, because it brings literally nothing new to the table. Nothing at all. And yet I did - a lot - and, in the end, that's all that really matters.<br/><br/>All the set pieces work well (especially the train crash) and the effects are flawless. The enjoyable script by director JJ Abrams stitches together all the requisite elements. and structures the emotional and action parts of the film so that they intertwine and develop in a satisfying way.<br/><br/>At the heart of the film are heartwarming performances from the young cast, particularly Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning as two youngsters, both of whom have troubled elements in their makeup. There is good chemistry between the cast, especially (and necessarily) between Courtney and Fanning. Elle Fanning appears to be as talented as sister Dakota, and has a definite edge over her in the looks department.<br/><br/>As a minor nitpick, I'm not sure the use by youngsters of the word ""totally"" was quite as ubiquitous at the time the film is set as it is made out to be here (in fact, I'm quite sure it totally wasn't).<br/><br/>And, as a major nitpick, there is one use of the F word. Quite frankly, I thought it was entirely unnecessary and served only to alienate."
"estebangonzalez10","9","0","1","11 August 2011"," A worthy homage to Spielberg, Ellen Fanning is stunning, The Goonies are back
","¨She used to look at me this way, like really look, and I just knew I was there, that I existed.¨ As a true fan of Lost (the best television series ever in my opinion) I was really excited about J. J. Abrams's latest film, Super 8, which as usual he not only directed but also wrote. Abrams is one of my favorite directors and I've really enjoyed all his films. Add Steven Spielberg, who was one of the producers of this film, to the mix and this was perhaps one of my most anticipated films of the year. Fortunately, it didn't disappoint and it even exceeded my expectations, although this didn't even come as a surprise for me considering how well he managed to reboot the Star Trek franchise a couple of years ago. I was also a big fan of Cloverfield, which some people disliked, but I thought was really well crafted. Super 8 might be compared to Cloverfield in some ways, but I think it is a much more complete film in the sense that there is more character development going on. The whole mysterious monster thing was only a side story and the true heart of the film relied on the relationship between the kids and their friendship. Super 8 is really a nostalgic film that seems to pay homage to some of Spielberg's early films like E.T., Close Encounter of the Third Kind, and The Goonies. That was the mood that Abrams kind of set with Super 8 and what makes it stand out from all the rest of the modern disaster/monster movies. Even the title suggests this nostalgic feeling considering that Super 8 mm film were one of the first formats used for home movies before the invention of video. The movie even has this dark and dirty visual style to it making you think you are actually watching an old classic (until you see some of the dazzling visual effects like in the train crash which remind us this is a modern movie).<br/><br/>The story takes place in a small town in Ohio during the summer of 1979. A group of young kids who are friends from school are making a super 8 movie about zombies. Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) is helping out with the make-up, Charles (Riley Griffiths) is directing, Cary (Ryan Lee) is helping out with the sound, Preston (Zach Mills) is filming, while Alice (Elle Fanning) and Martin (Gabriel Basso) play the main actors. One night the five kids are out by the tracks filming their movie when all of a sudden they witness a catastrophic train wreck. Several explosions take place and parts of the train fall everywhere, but miraculously the kids are unharmed. Joe tells his friends that this wasn't an accident; he witnessed how a truck drove straight at the train in order to provoke the crash. While the kids were shooting their movie the camera kept rolling so they decide to develop the film the very next day, but have to wait at least for three more days until they can actually see the footage. Meanwhile some mysterious things begin to take place after the accident: the dogs all of a sudden have disappeared, motors from vehicles are missing, and even some people have gone missing as well. Joe's dad, Jackson (Kyle Chandler), is the town sheriff so he begins to search for answers, but the US Air Force (to whom the train belonged to) seems to be concealing what was really inside the train. Jackson discovers that there was a lot more to the accident then what they are actually telling him.<br/><br/>The first hour really keeps the suspense and mystery building as we try to discover what was in the train. The relationship between the kids is actually the primary focus of the film and the mystery kind of works as a side story. Elle Fanning does a terrific job with this film and deserves an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress since she actually steals every scene she's in. She is the heart of the movie, and her relationship with Joel Courtney's character reminds us a lot of that first innocent love. The chemistry between both actors is actually very intense and far more believable than that of the lead characters from most of today's romantic comedies. Super 8 manages to mix well the action and suspense with the drama and character development, while at the same time remaining funny. It's all these mixed emotions that remind us of those 80's Spielberg blockbuster action movies. I couldn't help but think of Drew Barrymore in E.T. when I saw Elle Fanning in this film; watching the kids investigating the mysteries reminded me of The Goonies; it's just all these emotions that the movie evoked that gave me this sense of nostalgia while keeping me entertained at the same time. I really enjoyed this film and loved the performance from the kids, especially from Elle Fanning. I was so interested in these characters that I actually enjoyed the first half of the film over the second which focused more on the monster and the action. Super 8 is definitely worth watching, especially if you were a fan of some of these early Spielberg movies.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"soxlade","Null","0","1","11 August 2011"," Not bad ... but
","Super 8 is JJ Abrams' ode to those great kids films that we remember from the 80s. You know, films like Back to the Future, E.T., Stand By Me, Explorers, Gremlins, Poltergeist and the like. These were good solid adventure films well written, beautifully directed and told from a kid's perspective.<br/><br/>The houses were always huge, the kids had all sorts of cool gadgets (this was the UK in the 80s after all), there was always acres of space a short BMX ride away (hey, those cool kids had BMXs dagnabbit). These kids had so much freedom to get into adventures. As kids growing up in rainy Gloucester we were jealous. Okay so, as we've grown up we've picked up on the unhappy childhoods many of this kids actually had (E.T.'s Elliot was fatherless, Stand By Me's Geordie was rejected by his father after his brother's death) and the surprisingly emotive subplots that hid beneath the kid-friendly adventures.<br/><br/>Super 8 has been unashamedly been trading on this nostalgia, in particular mentioning E.T. and Stand By Me. It even has the maestro of much of that early 80's magic, Steven Spielberg, as executive producer. Abrams has also got great pedigree with the creation of fun, smart entertainment - Alias, Cloverfield and the re-boot of Star Trek (I know, and Lost which was great for 3.5 seasons ... then fell apart).<br/><br/>So, does Super 8 deliver on all it's promise? Well ... kinda.<br/><br/>I think my biggest problem with Super 8 is that it feels like two completely different films stuck together, and not that successfully either.<br/><br/>The weaker element of the story is the monster movie, which is a bit of a surprise considering the director's previous work. Abrams does craft some decent jump moments and is a member of the ""less is more"" school of monster film-making, which is always more enjoyable than the gory munch brigade. But the monster is merely a cipher, having no real back-story and demanding no real investment from the audience, it's just there as a hook. There is one scene at the end, where some hidden depth in the creature is revealed (literally). This one scene ties the two parts of the story together and is largely successful, as well as unexpected, it's just that everything that has gone before is just so ... clumsy.<br/><br/>There's a nasty air force leader, a collection of mysterious objects, some magnetism, but it all just happens; there's no build up, or tension, or mystery outside of ""what's that?"" Spielberg, at his best, would have woven a sense of wonder into the strange goings on, and would have also kept his focus closely on the kids - Abrams wanders, giving most of the investigative role to our hero's estranged father, which takes away one of the great joys of the kids' flick - Kids trying to persuade Adult Authority that they're telling the truth. Remember that scene in The Goonies? Or E.T. with Elliot's mom? There's nothing like that in Super 8, and it suffers because of it.<br/><br/>However the other side of the tale, the story of recuperation after a trauma and the story of friendship and having an adventure, is thankfully much stronger. In fact, I found myself wishing that Abrams had explored this side of things more and avoided much of the bombast that jars the film. It's actually terrific fun watching the kids run around and create their terrible zombie movie, deal with older siblings, younger siblings and parental relationships that make no sense to you when you're a kid. It's also touching to witness that first crush, and the rivalries that can afflict a group of boys when girls start becoming interesting. These moments should be the cornerstones of the story, the heartbeats that bring it alive and make it dramatic, but instead Super 8 chooses the bombast and spectacle of its monster story for its movie moments. And that's a shame.<br/><br/>Super 8 works better when its smaller, quieter story is in command, and it also allows its collection of excellent child actors the chance to stretch themselves a bit. Joel Courtney, as lead character Joe, holds the film together, selling emotion as well as the outlandish actions sequences equally well, though he does only get one real emotional scene. Elle Fanning as Alice is excellent in every scene and should follow younger sister Dakota along that tricky path form child star to adult actor. Of the other children in the group, only Riley Griffiths as Charles, the director is developed which is a shame. I would have liked to know more about the dynamic within the group. It should also be said that both Ron Eldard (an actor possessed of the saddest face I've ever seen) and Kyle Chandler as Alice and Joe's respective fathers, tied together through tragedy and hating every minute, are both superb.<br/><br/>Super 8 thinks it's E.T, with the monster movie front and centre and essential to the piece, but in fact it is the quieter, friends film that is better and should have been given more screen time. The massive train crash (spectacular, but way, way over the top - how fast was that train going?) and the hugely destructive finale all sit uncomfortably with many of the quieter scenes. Large chunks of the monster story don't seem to make sense, though there are some great ideas here, and what's not to love about having the man trying to set the alien free being played by the same actor who accidentally released the first Gremlin? Basically there was a really tremendously great movie hiding inside Super 8, but for various reasons it's missing. Which is a real shame. However comparing it to the standard of the current crop of blockbuster films this year, it's very nearly a masterpiece."

","As far as production value goes, this film has a certain appeal. Unfortunately for us, everything else is so bad that it doesn't really matter. It is watchable, but in all fairness it sucks pretty hard to actually sit it through.<br/><br/>A couple of examples: instead of making us care about the protagonist (who is a kid) through actual good writing, identification and character development, they throw in a back story about how his mother died in a supposedly tragic accident. It's just cheap.<br/><br/>The ending is I guess symbolic in a way, but so cliché I actually squirmed in my seat. It's just cheap melodrama. It's very obvious that the makers WANT us so badly to sit on the verge of tears and marvel at the wrapping of the story, like they can just snap their fingers and get us involved on cue--""OK, feel sad now, OK, laugh now.

What the hell was it all about. Bits of other films all jumbled up. It even had the next generation of kids from the first films, you know, the one where they fell down a hole and ET it was not. I have a suspicion it was conceived over a bottle of bubbly on a large directors boat in Monaco. I can hear the glasses clinking as i watched it. On the positive side i stayed awake. I feel that the film will be seen by most people and 25 percent will take it on the nose as a decent attempt to keep ET alive. Most i expect will forget it."
"tomgillespie2002","7","0","1","7 August 2011"," Enjoyable throwback to the Spielbergian films of the 70's and 80's
","Cor blimey! Spielberg's in box must be filling up incredibly with spunk stained love letters of late. This offering from J. J. Abrams (also produced by the bearded Jew of populist cinema), is a homage to the early, great movies such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind ( 1977), Jaws (1975), and particularly E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). Whilst I would usually go into a tirade about the references to Spielberg, I just am unable to do it with this often charming film. It displays the best elements of these earlier, very iconic offerings.<br/><br/>Super 8 focuses on a bunch of kids who are making their very own zombie film. The film is set in 1979 (proper Spielbergian suburban environment), hence the use of super 8 film instead of the later video. One late night the gang go out at midnight to film a scene. On this night a train is hit by a car and they capture this on film after the camera is knocked down in the action of fleeing. What they later discover, is that the film captured something non-human climbing from the wreckage. The Air Force come into town after this occurrence, and so begins a series of strange events: People and dogs disappearing; electrical and motorised goods also disappearing. I am going to point out one thing that bugged me (and it happened at the start it kinda stayed with me). At the crash site, one of the kids, Joe (Joel Courtney), picks up an unidentified object, that Charles (Riley Griffiths) comments on as resembling a Rubik's cube. Pedantic alert!!! Whilst the Rubik's cube was invented in 1974, it was not patented in the US of A until 1980!<br/><br/>The child performances are actually rather good too. Particularly Elle Fanning, who plays Alice, and brings the film a much needed emotional edge. She is second to Joe, who before the film begins lost his mother in a milling accident.

","Half of the reviewers will consider that the many similarities between what goes on in Super 8 and the content of Spielberg and Abrams' previous works is but a homage, while the other half of the viewers, such as myself, will consider it the result of an empty barrel of ideas.<br/><br/>You are introduced to a stereotypical group of kids, who all seem to represent the child self of a movie making team: the annoying/cheap director, the miniature model builder and of course the guy who likes to blow up stuff. At first he chemistry between this crew is fun and believable. But the soon overstep that boundary after the train scene. The little kid who loves explosions does way, way too many commentaries about how cool are the multiple things exploding in the movies, the archetypical fat director talks way too many times about ""production values"", and the little protagonist gets way too many close up emotional ET like shots to his overly expressive face. <br/><br/>In the second half of the movie there are so many plot holes about the whole ""monster"" situation that there's no way you'll ever be able to successfully explain why or how the story develops the way it does, except it's to follow the old, well used Spielberg clichés. <br/><br/>Extraordinarily overrated, this movie wasted my hard earned money and a Saturday evening with my wife."

The characters also lack depht., everything is too superficial, the performance of the kids in general are OK, but Kyle Chadler sucks, he is a bitter man, far from being a tormented sheriff, that in the worst time of his life has to deal with catastrophe. Even when he finally he regain his son, he seems bitter,from the beginning to the end its the same performance.

"Otoboke","Null","0","1","5 August 2011"," Induces awe as well as humbles the heart.
","So I'm sitting in the theatre, about thirty minutes into J.J. Abrams latest sci-fi blockbuster when I suddenly think to myself; I haven't seen a movie quite like this in a while. In fact, it's a style which owes very much to the film-maker that Abrams too often gets himself compared to, and to whom produced his latest here; the somewhat misleadingly titled Super 8. Set in the eighties and very much influenced by eighties film-making such as The Goonies and E.T., Super 8 is like taking a day-trip back in time whilst carrying a camera phone to capture it all with a different voice. Filtered through the modern capabilities of Abrams, the movie is big, loud and certainly no stranger to broad strokes of action and suspense, but filtered through well- developed characters and drama, Super 8 feels (if you'll excuse the pun) down to Earth in ways that Spielberg made his name in doing; it's human fantasy, and rather than feeling like a cheap throwback to simpler times, allows itself enough room to breathe in the modern arena to feel both refreshing and vibrant on our big fancy digital, modern displays.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away (which is considerable when you take into account that the biggest plot point of the movie comes into focus only half-way in), Super 8 which is Abrams' first venture in writing a blockbuster entirely on his lonesome, is half monster and half family drama, coming of age, buddy movie. Opting to spend the majority of the feature's opening act on the latter rather than the former, one could easily be convinced that the monster might never rear its tentacles as the breadth and depth that Abrams spends developing and focusing on his characters is considerable. But the movie is far better off because of it, and in turn that latter focus on the monster works to a greater extent as a result. Indeed, parallelling what is perhaps his own experiences with making features and working in TV, the central group of friends here who are budding film-makers of their own, understand the basic principle of drama—to create people and relationships that the audience can latch onto and care about. Without that, well, it's just some guy in a costume dancing with some other guy.<br/><br/>Thankfully however, Abrams gets this and allows his audience not just the thrill of this spectacle of events that transpires on the screen, but the thrill of being along for the ride with the people whom this is happening to. Sure enough, the drama never reaches the point of anything morose or academy award winning, but it doesn't have to in order to get its point across. There's comedy, there's fear, there's love, loss and regret—all of which come across the vast boundaries of the screen without stumbling or being too involved in themselves to even bother. Instead Abrams delivers a story which induces awe as well as humbles the heart through both sufficient narrative and his usual near-flawless grasp of the beats of movie action. In scenes which are as loud as Michael Bay's typical output but with the crash bang wallop timed perfectly to the point where each one makes you flinch, the action in Super 8 is loud, abrasive and certainly doesn't hold any punches—except of course when it comes to revealing the monster.<br/><br/>It's perhaps the movie's only real flaw which resides within a form of movie-making that usually works for the better. Allowing the audience to fill in the gaps that he leaves out of his shots for the majority of the film, Abram implies more than he shows, and while this works for the earlier segments of the film it can at times come off as overly contrived to the point of tedium. When the curtain is lifted however, we kind of see why—the monster isn't what we're interested in so much as what he's doing, why he's doing it and how this affects our human characters. In the end we find that there are no obtuse ""parts"" or genres to the movie at all; that's it's not a monster movie insomuch as it's a story about being understood in a cruel environment which we can't always control. Set against the wistful imaginations and ambitions of a group of kids soon to enter the world of adulthood, this makes the perfect backdrop for such themes. It's the kind of thing Spielberg did so well when bicycles and the Walkman were all the rage, and you could argue hasn't been done with as such spirit since—Well, at least until now."

","This film prompted me to write my first IMDb review because it was so disappointing. I went into it expecting a Spielberg-esque kids/family versus monster movie like War of the Worlds, Indiana Jones, or g-d knows how many other such films considering that was the hype played out in the news media touting JJ Abrams as the next Spielberg. Boy was I wrong. I watched the first 23 minutes and stopped because it really didn't strike me as a good film. The kids don't act like kids. They act like boomer-generation nostalgic adults speaking through the bodies of kids. The film seems obviously marketed to a combination of children and those nostalgic boomers. Also the physics of the train crash was ridiculous over-the-top Hollywood action where everything is filled with gasoline and explodes in a fireball. At 23 minutes in I was not hooked; I was not wondering what lies ahead. No, instead I was bored and everything felt tedious and plodding. So I came to IMDb, read the critical reviews and decided to stop watching. If you enjoy kids movies and coming-of-age films maybe this could be an enjoyable film. But if your outlook on life is more mature, more cynical, and more gritty then skip it. Spielberg movie-making it ain't."

What I encountered is a movie seemingly tailored for the 11 year old audience. The main characters were an annoying group of children. The adult characters were not particularly well developed (character wise). The special effects were cheesy and over the top and the story line was painfully long to unfold. I frankly expected more from a Spielberg film but maybe I shouldn't have. In addition to being annoying, the children were often foul mouthed (a Spielberg pattern I remember from ET).

","My husband and I went to see this after one of our kids said they enjoyed it. We sure wanted to like it. After viewing the film however, enjoy is not exactly a word we could really use of our experience, but we certainly thought there was some fine acting by several of the young people in the movie, especially the lead boy and the girl, the film-maker boy and the fire cracker kid. There was a lot of exciting but confusing action in the story and not enough emphasis on filling us in (as far as we could see) as to what the ""alien"" had been through in captivity on Earth - so to us the very valid point of view of the alien and his sympathetic scientist-friend seemed lost in the shuffle for the most part. We had a lot of questions such as what exactly was the alien doing with those humans he captured? And why did the space ship fall apart into cubes? And what is the relationship between the magnetic issues and the water tower? This made the end a bit puzzling, although it tried hard to be poignant. The plot sort of reminded me of a ""Star Trek"" episode where mining operations were interrupted on a planet because a ""monster"" was killing the miners, until Spock did a ""mind-meld"" with the ""beast"" and found out it was a desperate mother trying to protect her children in their eggs. She would stop killing and help the miners get the ore they wanted from the shells, if they'd stop killing her babies."

","I have mixed emotions about this film, it was very J.J. Abramsy, very Losty. Like Lost, it had a really intriguing mystery, but kills it with a really bland/generic conclusion - a monster whose product of havoc and destruction is all you see until the very end, only turns out to be exactly what you expect. Just like the end of Lost.<br/><br/>Acting and characters are awesome. The group of young teenagers is the classic group of '80s kids as portrayed in '90s teen movies; the fat one, the dorky one, the tall insecure one with glasses, the crazy one with bucked teeth, and the normal intelligent protagonist. It's interesting that this consistent theme from teen movies is used in a predominately adult movie. It's really cool to see the development of their friendships and the strain on their relationships the whole situation causes. <br/><br/>In this movie, events are so unbelievably over the top. The train crash (a train crashes) is super intense. at first it is awesome. it's done so well, you feel like you are there. Literally. You are part of the group of kids standing at the abandoned station. You feel fear and the reality of the situation. (This may spoil it for you) At first, the train hit's a car a bit of a way from where the kids are standing, next thing you know carriages are derailing, then things start exploding, things start flying everywhere - all around the kids. This goes on for 1 minute and 30 seconds from impact to last flying exploding carriage. On the one hand it destroyed the reality of it all and just blew it out of proportion (all of the kids were absolutely fine, obviously), but on the other, it made it comical, I was laughing pretty hard. It seems, rather than to remove it from reality and what is possible, to move it beyond reality. Like a dream. It depicts wild imagination like The Bridge to Terabithia, but in a subtle way. It feels like a really vivid dream, with lots of emotions and stuff; you think it's real but then this super crazy thing happens and your like woah dude. This one scene basically represents the whole movie in that sense. <br/><br/>Tere are a lot of clichés, like in Lost, but J.J Abrams makes it cool. He perfects the clichés. He makes you appreciate clichés. It doesn't really matter whether or not something is possible because who cares? J.J. Abrams certainly doesn't. <br/><br/>It's weird.

If not for anything else, it was good to watch a film about a bunch of kids hanging out and making a movie together, and about how they dealt with their personal problems as well as a much more serious situation. I especially loved the performance of Joel Courtney, who played the protagonist. Elle Fanning and Riley Griffiths did a splendid job too. The other kids weren't as important, but I loved watching even them.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the way the story unfolded. The mystery element was done very well, because I had no idea what was going on, and I really wanted to find out. There were moments when I was gripping my seat and covering my eyes. I enjoyed how the other worldly elements slowly blended into everyday life.<br/><br/>All of that being said, once the mystery unfolded my reaction was ""Seriously?"" And my final thoughts about the movie sum up to ""Meh"". The fist half was worth it perhaps, but I felt let down when we found out what was really going on, and also the ending made no sense at all.<br/><br/>To those who are thinking of going to watch this - I'm sure kids will like this (given the PG 13 rating, I suppose I mean older kids), and it also depends on what type of movie you like. I'm not much into Mystery/Sci-fi/Thrillers, so maybe I was let down because of having no experience with this genre.

In a nutshell. And I promise this to be true. This movie is a documenting truth that the ""trailer"", the previews, and the opening weekend box office totals are all that really matters to these ""awesome"" producers. I guarantee that Spielberg, Abrams, and all others involved watched a screening of this film and said ""holy crap - now what are we supposed to do?"" ""Well we can't shelf it now...so let's just sell it as a complex feel-good hi-tech masterpiece containing distracting sub-stories and hope nobody notices that we suck"". IMHO, here's what they did: They bill it with a fairly genius idea. A bunch of adorable kids in 1979, with a knack for mischief (SEE ""Stand by me"") accidentally film a mysterious event looped into a highly detailed yet improbable train crash (SEE ""The Fugitive"") where an entire train with many cars derails, flips, turns, explodes...all because it hits a pickup truck at a rail crossing. The world's strongest pickup truck, btw. It and it's driver are amazingly intact...and the driver is able to have a conversation with the kids after the disaster. The accidental Super 8 footage is all but never seen or involved in the film, because it's obvious by the end of the film that the director removed the ""alien monster"" as much as possible from the movie because it is laughably silly (SEE: the same monster used in Spielberg's ""Falling Skies"" effort) and is instead replaced with suspenseful sounds and Hitchcock-esque scenes of victims simply gazing upward and screaming. A few scenes are allowed where the creature is seen jumping across the screen, or shown at a distance. During the closing scenes, the creature is revealed - it stores humans in a cocoon type situation (in a secret lair) and snacks on them like Doritos. But it's okay, because 2 minutes later, the 14 year old star talks to it and tells it ""everything's okay"" (this is where the audience in the AMC theater laughed aloud) and suddenly the creature turns into E.T., blinks it's loving eyes and decides to leave everyone alone, hop into a spaceship and leave. There's a lot of loose ends left loose (characters suddenly disinterested in the whole situation after the creature departs, missing dogs, a little plastic box that jumps up & down, the Super 8 film) but by the end of the movie, you could care less. But I must say, there are some cool spot-on 1979 props and references that made me giggle. My advice - spend your $40 on another theater movie. Wait for ""Super 8"" to come out on cable TV - then come back here and say ""thanks Shark3136!""."

","It's a true shame this film presented nothing new or exciting to its viewers if only because it seemed to me to be the perfect platform for getting younger viewers back into classic science fiction. <br/><br/>Though there is nothing terrible about this film, I watched it 2 days ago and can already barely recall a captivating moment. When it wasn't ripping off the story line from the animated film Iron Giant, it was only just keeping my attention with explosions and so-called ""plot twists"" which didn't actually change the essence of the story at all. The characters were quite basic though cute and the special effects were nice but only for a big screen environment. <br/><br/>I'm not sure why it's getting such high scores from users so far but I think my assessment of 5 out of 10 is more than generous for a film that is not offensive to people who paid to see it yet hardly value for money. Rent Iron Giant instead - it's a cute film."

","Is a rampaging monster the only idea that J.J. Abrams has in his head? ""Cloverfield"", ""Lost"" and now ""Super 8"" features one. ""Attention: the big secret in my new movie is the same one I've used over and over again in my other movies!"" I didn't think the movie successfully tied together the different threads but my biggest complaint was the monster. If he had never made ""Cloverfield"", I would have thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I just couldn't get past the thought that I've seen this all before.<br/><br/>I DID think the performances by the kids were really good though. Elle Fanning was just fantastic and I liked her relationship with the boy. I thought Charles got a little annoying saying ""Mint"" all of the time (it was a little overuse of the slang of the times).

"TheHrunting","6","0","1","29 June 2011"," Small town kids, the military and a train with puzzling cargo
","""Super 8"" is a popcorn blockbuster that acts as a light drama, mystery and thriller, though one that's all about shameless homage to past films and late '70s pop culture in which it takes place. It's a something's-on-the-loose film with the ""something"" hiding in the background and adolescent nostalgia out to play in the foreground. It racks up blatant nods, such as '50s giant monster films, George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and even Spielberg classics like ""The Goonies"" and ""Jurassic Park."" It's done purposely to bring out fun references for sentimental history buffs, as well as keeps cinemaphiles busy with trivia, who might otherwise be ready to call foul at the first retread.<br/><br/>A motley crew of early teen filmmakers have various talents that range from bossy director, special make-up effects wizard, lead actor, pretty actress to the over-charged demolitions expert. Apart from the recent accidental death of Joe's, the make-up effects kid, mother, they live in a normally quiet town and keep themselves busy filming make-believe zombies. While on location for their super 8 movie in the dead of night, they solely witness a massive train wreck involving a truck with a person they know. The hurt man gives them a grave warning to stay away. Shaken up, they keep to themselves but as soon as the Air Force troops show to clean up, some bizarre things occur and it's up to the temp Sheriff, after the current went missing, and our little friends to find out the truth and take matters into their own hands.<br/><br/>Due to items and people disappearing out of the blue, the town feels under siege and holds a meeting but things aren't making sense apart from thinking it's the Russkies. The stand-in Sheriff sees a conspiracy closer to home as our own military refuses to say exactly what's in the cargo of the trains. It took too long to actually unveil the big mystery and eventually begins to lose some of its grasp when it initially began with thrills due to blocking your view point to show abrupt disappearing acts of civilians and property during wee night hours. The constant question is: What does it all mean? Not to mention that it better be a heck of a hot item when it's fully unsheathed: one that awes and glimmers and is saved last for hopefully good reason.<br/><br/>Pushing aside the mayhem and conspiratorial overtones, Joe and Alice, the actress from their movie, form a forbidden love due to their dads having beef, as well as some light drama with regret over the mother's death and growing pains with adapting were injected to make it more personal and dramatic than continually pulse-pounding. To lighten the load even more, there are some relatable jokes and good times shown with being an adolescent during the summer. The young actors portraying the roles have chemistry and managed to be candid and entertaining without being naturally annoying. It hearkens back to that good ol' period when you didn't always see the big picture of adulthood enough not to worry about the future instead of the now--which at present is both just so scary and astonishing. <br/><br/>""Super 8"" has thrilling orchestras mixed with contemporary tunes of the era. This has jarring sounds, finely-tuned CGI to show over-the-top action and big explosions to knock your hat off, except they're more spread out than in the previews. It hinted how much power and leeway Big Brother has over its citizens and visitors to the point of black-and-white, closed-minded villainy. They attempted a quick wrap up by throwing out some forced sympathy for the now revealed mysterious entity despite massive property damage and trauma, as the justification for what's happening isn't entirely its fault. Though it would be like only watching the endings of ""King Kong"" and ""Frankenstein,"" which did a similar ""made bad by society"" mock up, where the rest of the film showed evolution and gradually built up to genuine sparks of feeling. ""Super 8"" tried to jam-pack the experience with it all--some concentrated on, some not--and it felt like important answers were swept under the rug, as the tone shifts back again to the town people being just so relieved that it's all finally over and that the event brought them closer together.

","What is it? And I don't mean the monster. There's heavy lens flare usage in the beginning like ""Star Trek"", there's a mysterious rarely seen by the audience creature like ""Cloverfield"", and there's a touching, misunderstood alien like....well pick one of Spielberg's movies. And then there's the corny, misplaced ending as the alien slowly sails away into the sky. <br/><br/>But in all this mess director JJ Abrams can't seem to decide what he wants this film to be. And so it stumbles from one plot point to another as even the characters try to discern what should happen next. The Air Force evacuates the town, suddenly the monster has unearthly powers and causes tanks and missiles and gun fire to spin around destroying homes at random, suddenly the creature is back underground building....something he never uses in the end..??<br/><br/>All is not lost, however, as the acting of the two young leads Joel Courtney (Joe) and most notably Elle Fanning (Alice) steal the screen away from their counterparts in each and every scene. Hopefully we'll get to see much more of these two in the near future. <br/><br/>Entertaining enough I suppose, but certainly a let down after the majesty that was Abrams' ""Star Trek"" reboot.

","Super 8 is a decent movie which is surprising for a J.J. Abrams film. The movie starts out as a homage to Spielberg's Stand By Me. The children are very good in the movie and they are the best part of the entire production. The interaction is well done and the acting is good. While Abrams tries, in the beginning, to be a ""real"" director, it works and the movie is a nice change of pace. When Abrams starts to become J.J. Abrams again, the movie fails. Once Abrams gets his hand on the action/sci-fi part of the movie, he makes another blow-up everything, Transformers-wanna-be. The last ten minutes blow-up the nice work that the beginning of the film had. It is ashame that Abrams has to revert back to being Abrams at the end of the picture."

","Now we have here bunch of good reviews, so I will not repeat the obvious as many perceived about this movie, nor will analyze the facts or anything else about it, only to express general feeling about it.<br/><br/>Well what is so obvious it is that we have the same plot concept as it is with great titles like it is ET, Goonies, 1941., Stand by Me, and also IT which marked 80ies with its unique concept of friendship, and battle for moral and positive virtues, from perspective of kids.<br/><br/>I like this movie from that side, as it perfectly fits in it, and it seems to me it is some kind of nostalgia from director. The influence of Spielberg is obvious here.<br/><br/>Now, I am someone that lived in that era, and was the same age as it is our characters in this movie, so all that put me in state of nostalgia. I admit, the movie is great made as an clone of movies from that era.<br/><br/>But what I don't like is that we don't have nothing new or fresh, just that repeated nostalgic concept from different perspective.<br/><br/>I don't have a kid so I can't gave any conclusions how the young generations perceive it, but in time we live where everything is so fast and violent I think this movie might be responded as very slow from the audience.<br/><br/>So it is OK movie, brings back fine memories, but still not that good as titles mentioned earlier, and nothing so special, even we all expected something maybe better.

Unfortunately this movie is one of those flicks where the trailer is much better than the actual movie itself. I could tell what it was trying to do, but the execution just wasn't really engaging and the build up wasn't even interesting or intriguing for the most part. In fact the build up was so very slow paced and boring to the point I don't see how any kid can stick with this movie. Maybe the target audiences are older people that will get a sense of nostalgia from watching this, since it has a bit of 80's vibe to it with normal kids put to a extraordinary task.

"j528491","Null","0","1","23 June 2011"," Great original movie with classic elements
","Watching Super 8 was like watching a classic Spielberg film with better CGI. It felt like The Goonies mixed and Close Encounters. The time setting really added to the story. It was set in 1979. A group of young kids trying to make a movie for a local film festival witness a train wreck and discover a mystery that is taking over the whole town. We also get some back stories for the kids, their parents and the alien (yes, there's an alien), but that's the basic premise of it. <br/><br/>A few young actors are going to get very famous from this movie. Elle Fanning (Alice) gives her best performance yet. The characters were really fun to see. The variety reminded me of that of The Goonies. None of the characters seemed cliché either. Each one took on their own, unique person and did a great job. <br/><br/>The movie had a great compelling story for about the first 45 minutes. The train wreck scene was among the best I've seen. After that, the movie seemed to drag a little. There was a lot that could have been left out. The only thing that I really had to look forward to was seeing the alien at the end. <br/><br/>The fact that you don't see the alien until the end was a smart move on Abrams' part. When you do see it, it becomes a really emotional character that has the same needs as a human. You actually get an emotional connection to this creature and that is something that this move needed. The downside to this is that it makes the movie less scary. I went into it expecting a good scare and for the most part, it just gave loud startlers. <br/><br/>Super 8 had a few funny and emotional moments. J.J. Abrams said from the start that this wasn't supposed to be a huge Summer blockbuster, just a fun, original movie. That's exactly what he gave us. It was a lot of fun to watch, even in its slow parts. Besides from a few moments of bad 3D cinematography, it wasn't difficult to watch. I would say Super 8 is worth the money and a great original movie."
"devcybiko","7","0","1","22 June 2011"," It's E.T. on steroids
","ONE LINE REVIEW: It's ""E.T."" on steroids.<br/><br/>RATING: See it in theaters<br/><br/>(Rating: ""See it in theaters,"" ""Wait for the Instant Download,"" ""Don't waste your time"")<br/><br/>DANGER : SPOILERS WITHIN<br/><br/>I didn't quite know what to expect from ""Super 8."" The running joke is that it's a movie about a low-cost motel. But in fact, it's a coming of age movie about teens who make zombie movies in the late 70s (or is it early 80s - the sound track was a bit confusing). Think ""E.T."" meets ""Stand By Me"".<br/><br/>JJ Abrams is the writer/director. He's the guy who brought us ""Alias"" and ""Lost"" not to mention the new ""Star Trek"" reboot. (In that last movie he shows off his love for unassociated glare - which he has tamed in this movie). <br/><br/>I once saw a TED video where Abrams lectures about the secret to his success: The Magic Box. When he was a kid, he loved to go to the magic store and buy magic tricks. The one thing he really wanted was the magic box - a box filled with unknown magic tricks. Abrams later learned that the owner would take old, non-selling objects off the shelves and put them in the box and sell them at cost. So, there could be anything in there.<br/><br/>Abrams bought one of these boxes and never opened it. He brought it on- stage to show to the audience. He said that he learned the secret of suspense from the magic box. To keep someone interested in whatever it is that you're doing, just create a secret, put it in the box, and then not open the box until the last minute.<br/><br/>If you watched ""Lost"" you can see that play out. There were a lot of secrets in that show right up to the end. And he certainly made us wait. This is also why it can be unclear what this film is about from the ads. Abrams didn't want anyone to spoil the experience in the trailers.<br/><br/>In Super 8 you can see that philosophy play out again. The whole movie revolves around this secret that is on the train. The boys in the film discover the secret because they were filming near the train and accidentally captured it on Super-8 film. The rest of the movie is all about them trying to convince their deputy-sheriff dad that something is amiss.<br/><br/>Well, it isn't ALL about the secret. There's a girl and two buddies who both like her (I mean, like-like, you know). And there is romantic tension. This is the coming-of-age part of the story. If you were a fan of ""Lost"" you'll see some familiar themes. There's a lot of unspecified magnetism. And a lot of stuff being thrown in the air by unseen monsters. And people inexplicably going missing. And dogs running away.<br/><br/>And if you're a fan of any science fiction movie from about any era, you'll see the evil government agents doing unspecified unspeakable things to apparently innocent monsters.<br/><br/>The plot resolves unevenly. People reconcile their differences with little more than a sentence to bind them. The monster doesn't or does eat people and if it does then it is unclear why it hangs on to them. There's a lot of confusion around the ending. But if you don't think too much it won't bother you much.<br/><br/>I gave this a ""See it in theaters"" because Abrams does a good job of entertaining us along the way, and the special effects are good popcorn theater. You'll want to see it on the big screen to get the most of it.<br/><br/>Generally I like Abrams' work and I liked this film as Summer entertainment. But he's not quite a Spielberg yet (who was the producer). He borrowed a lot from Spielberg's bag of tricks (slowly zooming on on three kids while the wind blows the hair about their faces, for one). As a writer I think the tries to accomplish too much in one film. The film ran about 2hours 20 minutes and he left a few things dangling and resolved too much too quickly. I think he could have left out a couple subplots and told a more endearing story."

","Abrams keeps getting better each time. He really recaptures some of the old Hollywood magic in this film. And by Hollywood magic, I don't mean fancypants fx and glamorous arrogant actors. I mean the storytelling style that Spielberg made famous, that truly imparts a sense of thrills, excitement, and a sense of wonder to the audience. Where he surpasses Spielberg is in the sentimental relationship development of his characters and their ties to the storyline and the action, and Spielberg's no slouch in that department. Where he falls slightly short, is in a conclusive thrilling ending that ties in well to the rest of the story and to the characters. Still the ride was a fantastic, emotive experience and should be a lesson to other contemporary filmmakers (unfortunately the majority) who go for cheap, lazy, and simple gimmicks rather than an innovative or genuine investment in the story and characters."
"jonnyhavey","Null","0","1","18 June 2011"," Sci-Fi Magic: Through A Child's Eyes
","Producer Steven Spielberg received exactly what he wanted from J.J. Abrams (""Star Trek"") with his direction of ""Super 8."" Back to the old school feel of sci-fi cinema, Abrams directs a cast of average and unknown stars allowing the audience to focus their attention on the movie as a whole instead of individual cast members. The film creates a refreshing kick back to film before the term ""tween"" was incepted as the young cast takes control of the screen leaving out drama found in abundance in contemporary cinema. Instead this is replaced with a believable love story and logical dramatic situations. The filmatic magic opens in the summer of 1979 after Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney's debut role) loses his mother. Joe's best friend Charles (Riley Griffiths's debut role) is an aspiring young director that continually preaches about ""production value"" as the two friends film Charles's zombie movie with friends Cary (Ryan Lee, ""Shorts""), Preston (Zach Mills, ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"")and Martin (Gabriel Basson, ""Alabama Moon""). After realizing the film needs a love story they seek out the talents of the girl of their dreams, Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning, ""Somewhere"") sparking some unfinished business. During a night of shooting at the local train station they witness a pickup truck run into a train sending it off the tracks and releasing an unknown mysterious being. While trying to finish their movie they investigate the phenomenon. Meanwhile, Joe's father Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler, ""King Kong"") is coping with the loss of his wife while receiving more and more responsibility becoming the face of hope in the town with everything spinning out of control.<br/><br/>Abrams exploits his patented lens flare filming style abundant in ""Star Trek"" giving the film an overall mystical, science fiction tone. This adds to the art direction of the film and brings to life a superlative script written by Abrams filled with comic relief attributed from the cheesiness of the lingo of the 1980s. This strong backbone allows the young inexperienced cast to flourish shooting the film through their eyes causing the audience to experience the film as kids. It is refreshing to see the most successful moments of the film coming from the performances of the kids; something hard to find in modern cinema.<br/><br/>The film is very good and it may even be labeled as great, but it will always fall in the shadows of ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" This is because while being a sci-fi film, ""Super 8"" is a more logical film than the two aforementioned and therefore some sequences seem to be a little bit of a reach within Abrams's script writing. These tiny details have held the movie back from reaching its full potential, even though it is still a memorable flashback to a great time period in cinema making it one of the year's best.<br/><br/>The film is a mixture of classic films like ""The Goonies"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" with a modern feel. And if you let the magic take hold, you may even feel the awe of a carefree kid seeing a science fiction movie for the first time."
"dfranzen70","7","0","3","16 June 2011"," Too much JJ, not enough Steven
","Super 8 is partly about growing up and partly about aliens. J.J. Abrams directed it, and Steven Spielberg produced. I expected a sentimental but exciting coming of age tale, derived somewhat from E.T. and from movies like Stand by Me. Then I remembered that J.J. Abrams was involved.<br/><br/>The year is 1979. A group of kids, making their own movie using a Super 8 camera, are present when a freight train crashes in their town. But the train's carrying some odd-behaving cargo, and soon the kids are swept up in an alphabet soup of conspiracy, mystery, death, unhealed emotional wounds, and love. You can see Spielberg's fingerprints on the sweet stuff, but the heavy lifting falls, unfortunately, to Abrams, who here gives us an unofficial follow-up to his last over-hyped ball of fire, Cloverfield.<br/><br/>You see, Super 8 is really two movies. One is sort of your standard something-is-amiss-in-a-small-town-and-the-military-is-hushing-it-up plot. The other is a more subtle, gentle look at growing and departing relationships, of loves past and present. And that's sort of where the problem lies for me; although the two genres can mesh well, here one part works very well and the other is a pile of predictability.<br/><br/>The protagonist is young Joe (Joel Courtney), best friends with Charles (Riley Griffiths). Joe's mom was killed in an accident at the local plant, an event that has had quite the effect on Joe and his relationship with his dad, the town's deputy. As you might guess, Joe's dad has grown distant with the loss of his wife, which he blames on the town drunk, leaving poor Joe sort of rudderless. That's one of the reasons he pals around with Charles and the rest of his friends, to escape.<br/><br/>The boys are making a movie with Charles as the director, and they ask one of their classmates, Alice (Elle Fanning) to play the female lead. Charles secretly likes Alice, but it becomes clear she has an eye for modest, unassuming Joe, who does makeup and lighting. At any rate, while they are filming near an old train station, a speeding train passes them by, then derails. After the kids emerge from the wreckage relatively unscathed, they recover their film.<br/><br/>Of course, the train wasn't carrying ordinary cargo, as the film soon proves. But what is it? This is where the influence of Cloverfield kicks in. Abrams tries hard not to show us the creature in its entirety until near the end of the movie, but that didn't make it any scarier. The shots of the alien were amateurish, sometimes ridiculously staged as if straight out of a particularly poor B movie from 1953. I know the innocence of youth was a recurring theme, but I expected to be jumping a lot more than I was. In fact, here's an example of just shoddy filmmaking: there would be this intense, suspense-inducing music playing while the camera focused on one character, then sudden silence. And then, wouldn't you know it, an attack out of nowhere. No sir, didn't see that coming! So the exciting action scenes lacked a lot, like panache, creativity, chills, and even logic. Here's another example. During the trainwreck scene, the kids flee as debris rains all around them. Not just pieces of wood but rather entire cars, huge chunks of metal, and so on. They're never hit. All this stuff flying around, and they may as well have been in the perpetual center of a giant tornado. Sure, you have to suspend your disbelief, but there were a few howler scenes in this movie that really sort of forced you to metaphorically unhinge your jaw in order to properly suspend said disbelief.<br/><br/>The real upside to the movie, though, is the group of kids: they're a terrific, convincing lot. Luckily, we don't get stereotypical kids, like The Fat One or The Brain or The Slob, etc. Each isn't terribly defined, but they're not meant to be, and they're still memorable in their own way. They exist less as window dressing and more as a running color commentary on their various relationships.<br/><br/>Fanning is terrific as Alice. I almost didn't recognize her; at this age, she looks like a young Martha Plimpton, and if Ms. Fanning ever reads this, I mean that as praise. In a few scenes, she's playing a girl playing an actress, and she nails it. I have to believe it's not easy pretending to be something you're not anyway, so pretending to pretend just doubles the difficulty.<br/><br/>Spielberg's touch is evident in the way the kids relate to each other and to adults; there are no cardboard caricatures, just honest characters. We see the wonderment and guileless glee that most of us had in grade school. We see kids being kids, in awe and curious but not terrified of the world around them.<br/><br/>Spielberg's contribution works; Abrams' doesn't. If you liked Cloverfield and its poorly edited action scenes, this will be your bag. The bad guys are obvious, the impetus for the creature's existence is clear, and it's all telegraphed well ahead of time. They must have spent a fortune in CGI, mucking up what might have been a tender growing-up story set against an alien-invasion backdrop."

","I really wanted to like Super 8, I really did. I wasn't following it's production avidly, however, I have been impressed by J.J. Abrams previous works and seeing that he has proved himself to be able to do a monster movie very well (Cloverfield) I felt he would conquer this ""unknown creature"" tale as well.<br/><br/>During the first half of the movie I was kept interested. There is a definite nostalgic feel to the film with its setting and its young gang of characters - highly reminiscent of ""The Goonies"" as many people have already pointed out. Albeit the over the top CGI fest of an accident scene that you are more likely to laugh at than suspend your disbelief over, the first half was suspenseful and you really felt like the foundations of something epic were being laid. <br/><br/>Yes this is a cliché ridden movie, however, Abrams technique of keeping the creature hidden but uncomfortably close that he did so well in ""Cloverfield"" builds great suspense.<br/><br/>During the second half of the film everything changes. The cliché hill is now a mountain, the plot holes are now caverns, the suspense is hard to find. It almost feels like it was too rushed and culminated in an unsatisfying unoriginal ending. <br/><br/>I think the main problem with Super 8 is that it tried to do far too many things and thus could not do a single one of them greatly. If you are a fan of monster movies or alien movies - then this movie is not for you, do not waste your money. The unknown creatures origin is still unknown, many details glossed over and the creature design uninspired. Many claim that this movie wasn't about the monster, but for many of us it certainly was marketed in that way.<br/><br/>The coming of age story presented to us has been done before. I understand Abrams was making a homage to Spielberg but it was too much, there was nothing that you cannot see coming and the only child actor that is believable is Elle Fanning. <br/><br/>Thus Super 8 fails on both accounts of trying to be a creature feature or a coming of age story. This isn't a bad movie, it is just not a good one. The calibre of people behind this project hinted at something greater but it ended up being an ordinary movie. I wouldn't suggest watching this in the cinema, save your money and watch it on TV when it's available."

","It could have been...should have been...but was not anything else than another Teenage flick. The story is so shallow that one can, with a bit of imagination, see the end after 10minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>And then of course Fanning, who does not have enough of Dakota gets here the overdose. She looks and acts like her sister and that's that. I watched it because the previews were actually pretty good and I expected maybe a bit too much, but was nevertheless very disappointed to end up in a Teenage Alien Movie with all possible clichés in it! It reminded me in some occasions on Stand by me, but that was probably just me.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you want your up to 14year old kids have a good time, this is the movie to watch. IF you are a bit older, get a DVD and save your money!"
"christianbartelt","3","0","2","15 June 2011"," Its a generation thing
","It surely is the goonies meets the monster/alien. Every aspect of this movie is familiar, nothing original. Did they play it safe? Maybe every generation has or needs a movie like that. I am just the wrong generation and have to accept that. But it wont stop me to tear this movie apart. We witness a kind of genre-movie card game. You have the tragedy of losing a family member, the son of the cop, the depth of a girl that is mistreated by her father and of course the ""creature"" that hunts breathless from glimpse to glimpse. But are these genre clichés enough to manipulate your senses into believing that we are witnessing a timeless piece of entertainment? No, of course not. They also transport the plot into the 70s, into the neighborhood of classics like Jaws or Alien. And now kicks the ""uncanny valley"" in. The bait looks delicious but i am not willing to eat it, cause i know i will be pulled in and end unsatisfied on the floor of the boat. Maybe they try to hard, that we don't smell the big movie industry behind it. Sometimes less CGI is more and would create an intense homogeneous experience. But thats just my opinion."
"davidlenallen","7","0","3","13 June 2011"," ""Super 8"" is just ""8"", or in this case 7
","Not since ""Where the Wild Things Are"" have I left a movie scratching my head saying, ""What's wrong with me?"". I have read what ""Super 8"" was supposed to be and the description and hype didn't quite match up with what was ultimately brought to the screen. Other comments have included anachronisms of bicycles, backpacks, automobiles, etc. Hey, one nice touch I did recognize was the retro logo/sign of Seven-Eleven. The turning point/payoff between the protagonist and the antagonist came really late in the film and came rather out of the blue without much preparation in the plot development. And the ending - voilà! - and it's done in a literal manner of seconds. I think the film relied heavily on Stand By Me and Alien, products of the 70's, neither of which, if I'm not mistaken, were Spielberg films. It did, however, include large doses of 1941 and War of the Worlds - neither of which were Spielberg classics. Did I miss something, or is this another case of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" and no one wants to be the first to say it out loud?"
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","0","5","11 June 2011"," '8' is super
","""Super 8"" is one of those great sci-fi adventure films that comes along once in a blue moon. It is made by the kinds of professional filmmakers who love movies and who know how to make a grand entertainment that involves us rather than simply provide a mindless weekend entertainment. Fortunately for us, those professionals just happen to be producer Steven Spielberg and writer-director J.J. Abrams. It is on the level of Spielberg's great early work like ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters"" and ""Jaws"". It's that good.<br/><br/>Like all great sci-fi movies, ""Super 8"" builds its supernatural story out of organic people and places. It establishes characters that we care about and then puts them into a whirlwind of action, terror and special effects that really mean something. In that, Super 8 is really two movies. First is a wonderful portrait of a group of kids trying to make a movie with a ""Super 8"" camera, and second are the events that take place after an accident turns their world to chaos.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in 1979 in a small town in Ohio, where 12 year-old Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) nurses a wounded heart. His mother died in an accident four months ago and he and his father haven't even begun to put the pieces back together. Presently, Joe is attempting to help his over-bearing best friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) make a homemade zombie picture that he hopes to enter into a local amateur film competition. Charles is the kind of wannabe director who doesn't simply want special effects, but also wants his picture to have the added level of a love story. For that, they get a local girl Alice Denard (wonderfully played by Elle Fanning) to be their love interest.<br/><br/>One night, while filming on a train platform, Charles is overjoyed when he gets the added effect of having his actors perform while a train is roaring by. That's when Joe notices a pickup truck turning onto the tracks right into the path of the train. The scene goes on for several breathtaking minutes as the kids duck and cover and run for their lives as pieces of the train crash and explode around them. In their haste to escape, they fail to notice that something strange has been released from the train. It takes some time for them to realize that whatever has escaped has been recorded by Charles' camera.<br/><br/>The train belongs to the Air Force and whatever it was carrying is now loose on the town. Odd things begin happening: people disappear, dogs leave town, appliances and cars disappear. It is Russians? Electro-magnetic disturbances? Biblical end-times? Thor? No one is sure.<br/><br/>I will say no more, except to say that if you've seen the trailer, it really doesn't give much away in terms of the plot. What happens in this film is too rich and too well-detailed to spoil in a 2 minute trailer. I expected the science fiction plot. I expected the special effects. I expected scenes of the town in ruins, with the military shooting at God-knows-what, but I didn't expect was the extra layer of having well-drawn characters right in the middle of an action plot.<br/><br/>Joe occupies the home of his widowed father (Kyle Chandler), who is bitter and angry over the death of his wife Elizabeth (Caitriona Balfe). He is so bitter that he even forbids Joe from associating with Alice, the daughter of Louis Dainard (Ron Eldard), the man responsible for Elizabeth's death. That story has an interesting twist of its own.<br/><br/>The film is focused on the kids who exist in the years between childhood wonderment and teenage cynicism. They haven't shed the former and they are slowly inching toward the latter. They have reached the age when they have settled comfortably into curse words but haven't quite settled on exactly how to use them. When they ride their bikes you can see that puberty has lengthened their bodies to a point where they are getting too big for them. We can see that, for these kids, sex hasn't become a preoccupation so much as simply getting a pretty girl to notice them.<br/><br/>These are kids, not short adults. They do and say things that kids might. That's especially true for Charles, who seems to have seen Dawn of the Dead enough to want to duplicate it. He's the kind of tall, chubby kid who's loud voice makes him the dominating mouthpiece over his friends. There's also Cary (Ryan Lee), the short kid with a face-full of braces who carries a bag full of fireworks and has a preoccupation with blowing things up. There's Martin (Gabriel Basso), a kid with big glasses who always nauseous. There's Preston (Zack Mills), a gawky kid who is easily intimidated. Everybody grew up with kids just like this.<br/><br/>I realize that I have made the film sound like a coming-of-age picture which, in part, it is. These characters are so interesting that you can imagine them at the center of almost any plot. It is a testament to the screen writing that they give this ridiculous story depth and weight. I have purposely avoided giving away much of the sci-fi plot. What becomes of that story is not your standard battle-action nonsense. There is gunfire but the action scenes also have presence, so that we always know what is at stake, rather than be overloaded with bucket of hyper-active editing.<br/><br/>Some may think that I am over-praising ""Super 8"", but I think it is refreshing to finally have a summer movie that understands what entertainment is all about. This is the kind of film that started Spielberg's career and is making J.J. Abrams one of the most talented creative minds of his generation. This is a film made by people who love movies and know what a summer movie is supposed to look like.<br/><br/>**** (of four)"
"wafom","6","0","8","11 June 2011"," Like ET + Close Encounters + Alien all in one
","It's worth seeing on the big screen, but I have to admit I expected a bit more from JJ and Stevie Boy. Nice period touches that give you the look and feel of 1979. Couple that with the teenage cast and you have something that will attract older and younger audiences (that is, making more money for JJ and Stevie). The plot would have been just as effective in any other time period; I just saw the temporal placement as a worn-out way to maximize the age range of the audience.<br/><br/>I just had one little ""nit-pick"" that only a ham radio operator would notice. In the movie was shown an old (circa 1960) Heathkit Seneca that was being used to intercept the shortwave transmissions from the ""gub-mint"" guys. The problem is that the Seneca was a transmitter only, not a receiver. A similar mistake was made in the movie ""Frequency"" where the main character was using a Heath SB-301 to talk across time to his father. Guess what? The SB-301 is a receiver, not a transmitter. I know; I have one in my basement.<br/><br/>At least ham radio got a favorable moment in the movie when the older man stepped forward at the town meeting. <br/><br/>The movie overall is well worth seeing, but don't expect to be blown away by the plot. My favorite character was the kid with the braces (I can't remember his name) who loved to blow up stuff. He added a touch of comedy to an otherwise extremely serious story."
