"arniecage","8","182","204","2 July 2018"," James McAvoy Carries This Film
","A fantastic performance by the film's star, James McAvoy is reason alone to watch this film. Every personality on display is distinct to the other, and he is so interesting to watch. Anya who was breath-taking in The Witch does a fine job here too. This is a film where M. Night Shyamalan reasserts himself as a serious director following a string of poor films. I absolutely cannot wait for the sequel and the conclusion of the Unbreakable series arriving in January. 8.5/10."
"zlifb","10","156","188","13 August 2018"," Great story telling
","What a remarkable film! The premise of the film seems quite superficial at first but as the layers are peeled back there's so much more beneath.<br/><br/>It's a horror film without special effects gore, an action flick without any car chases. A high-tension psychological thriller for viewers with active imaginations, who don't need to be spoon-fed every explanation.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch, the script sympathetic, the cinematography and set fantastic, and the music/sound subtle enough not to be noticed, consciously, while building the tension inexorably. It's gripping, un-turn-away-able.<br/><br/>Seriously impressive. I don't give 10's lightly."
"sherryismyrealtor","8","200","247","2 July 2017"," Great movie! James McAvoy is awesome.
","This movie will keep you watching waiting for the next character coming out of James McAvoy. He should have won some awards for his performance of a man with many different personalities. James was very convincing in every part he played. The end is great but I don't want to give anything away so I won't comment on that at all. Well written and the actors were perfect. Watch it today, just don't make the mistake of downloading a different movie called Split about bowling. I did that and that is one of the worst movies I ever saw!"
"crberme","8","120","156","22 October 2017"," It maybe gets a bit too fantastical, but it's still an awesome thriller
","I was surprised to see that this movie was released last year (as I'm writing this) and I didn't heard about it, taking in consideration how promising the plot is.<br/><br/>Split is about three girls get kidnapped by a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID) that has 23 personalities. I have to say that this movie does not represent what DID really is and how people who struggle with it are, mainly because this movie gets a bit too fantastical sometimes. It doesn't try to be strictly realistic though, so it's an awesome thriller anyway.<br/><br/>The movie gives you chills since the very start with an awesome acting by James McAvoy and some seriously good still scenes. The overall scenes make you have a weird feeling, something it succeeds to transfer to the viewer that you probably won't be able to describe. That makes this thriller stand out in a good way.<br/><br/>Maybe Split makes a unrealistic representation of dissociative identity disorder, and that can be a big turnoff, but this is a great movie nonetheless."
"roniksharma","9","599","927","1 October 2016"," Shyamalan Is Back!
","Shyamalan had his debut with the critically acclaimed 'The Sixth Sense' followed by positively reviewed movies 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs'. After that, he went through a series of duds with 'Lady In The Water' , 'The Village' , 'The Happening' , 'After Earth' and was termed one of the worst directors of all time with 'The Last Airbender'. But, he made a decent comeback with 2015's 'The Visit' which received generally positive reviews and he's back at his game with 'Split'.<br/><br/>After a birthday party, three girls, led by Casey, are kidnapped by the troubled Kevin, who has a very rare case of 23 split personalities inside him. What follows is how the three girls try to escape from Kevin who himself is lowly having a mental breakdown. Sorry, I can't tell a lot about this movie as a small factor would spoil it.<br/><br/>This movie couldn't have worked without James McAvoy. He has given his best performance in his whole career and stands out as one of the reasons to watch this movie. The cliché points in the movie are watchable just because of his phenomenal performance. His transition from a 'Norman Bates' type woman Patrica to a 9 year old boy Hedwig to other personalities are amazing<br/><br/>Last but not the least, is the traditional ""Shyamalan Twist"". Trust me, this time your minds will be blown when you come to the conclusion. This twist doesn't match up to the ""The Sixth Sense"" one but it's a thrilling one. It's not some stupid twist like in ""Signs"". I won't forget that moment when someone behind me shouted out ""WHAAAAT?!"".<br/><br/>""Split"" isn't scary, it's tense. This movie shouldn't have been given a ""horror"" tag. A ""psychological thriller"" sounds better. Nevertheless, this movie is worth a watch. I'm giving a 8/10 with one extra star just for James McAvoy<br/><br/>Welcome back, M.Night Shyamalan"
"BremenDruid","8","168","262","13 May 2017"," I don't understand the hate for this film
","Let me start off by saying that I haven't really like Shyamalan's work since ""Unbreakable"", but I have to admit that this movie made me believe in his vision again. I gave him another chance after hearing so many people raving about this movie, and I'm glad I did. This is an excellently acted, directed and thought out movie. It's intense, funny at some parts, and it is incredibly well thought out. Don't listen to haters just because they don't like Shyamalan's movies. Check it out for yourself and make your own decision."
"Foolish","8","67","99","18 May 2018"," Don't believe the One Star reviews...
","After watching this movie, I have to say, I don't understand all the one and two star reviews. This is a return to form for the director of the excellent SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE. I haven't enjoyed most of his output since those first two films, but only titles like his misguided LAST AIRBENDER and the truly terrible THE HAPPENING are deserving of such low marks. I've seen a few real one star movies, and SPLIT isn't one of them. It's definitely worthy of higher marks. I can only assume those who didn't like it are trying to lower the average rather than rank it realistically somewhere closer to 4 or 5 stars (although I'd rank it higher).<br/><br/>It's a lot of fun. James MacAvoy is great in a subgenre that is normally pretty insipid (ie dissociative identity disorder movies). He deliveres a great performance that really helps to carry this film, and Betty Buckley also gives a notably outstanding performance in her supporting role.<br/><br/>Is it as good as THE SIXTH SENSE? No. Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. I'd happily see it again.<br/><br/>As for those reviewers who are upset that movies like this distort the public perceptions about mental illness, I can only assume they are too close to that subject to be truly objective."
"catalinapoliczer","8","41","59","25 July 2018"," Love that he's back!
","M.Night Shyamalan is one of those filmmakers that you either love or hate, and I definitely love his work. However, I stopped watching him after the Happening, (which was really quite a terrible movie. No comment on The Last Airbender). <br/><br/>This is such a wonderful comeback. His ability to totally freak you out without being terrifying; to keep you fascinated, yet completely confused, it's all just so much fun! Not sure how his films can be so slow yet so gripping and FUN! <br/><br/>This one is bang on. The cinematography is wonderful, the story is intense and gripping. Not to mention that James Macavoy is bang on (what a great performance, love Joaquin Phoenix, but not sure he would have been quite so awesomely intense as Macavoy was). <br/><br/>I highly recommend this film to any thriller lovers and a must for any M.Night lovers (but I don't need to say that at this point now, do I). I agree it's not a horror film but it does very get under your skin. (If you found The Ring too much, don't watch this!) <br/><br/>However, if you loved The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, this is a must see!! <br/><br/>Can't wait to see Glass."
"ediesedgwick-46930","10","141","227","14 June 2017"," they didn't get it
","firstly, i have to compare this movie to La La Land, because this is what is considered Oscar material and Oscar performances in 2017. If La La Land was an Oscar movie, this is effin' citizen kane. Loved the bruce willis cameo and that there is a cinematic universe somewhere between all those uneven films. This film delivers. It has an amazing performance and realistic characters in a surreal nearly sci-fi but engaging plot. There is no twist end. Not really. There is a bitter end this time. One that stays with you for a while after the movie ends. There is a desperation where there was once a ray of light in the ending. The film is occasionally funny and aware of it and is not easily categorized. It is a subtle commentary on many many things, violence, abuse, human nature, relationships, sexism, modern society, the potential of a human being, racism, the idiocy of the average people, our traumas, madness, the virtue of patience, existential angst etc It is true that it is a horror movie about a sick person, which may not be politically correct but is a very old and common trope in horror flicks. It is also true that this film turns the trope on its back, presenting us a charming psychopath. He does unspeakable things, but he is not evil, he is beyond morality and he has an ambivalent point of view. The movie doesn't take sides. Murder is not a taboo in this narration, it may be an act of God or some creature close to him. The characters that surround the protagonist are also flawed in many ways and not very likable (with a couple of exceptions). There are obvious (and delightful) references to Psycho and the Rocky Horror Picture Show. One thing is certain. This movie is not for people who always had it easy..."
"austinfromdahood","10","49","74","28 July 2018"," The movie that got me interested into film!
","Wow, this is my first review on IMDB. Let's start off with the movie that got me interested into film, and that movie is Split. I remember being 13 years old, sitting on my couch a few nights before halloween. I wanted to watch a horror film, so I browsed on the ""Free Movies"" section on Xfinity Demand. I scrolled down the page, and my eyes everted to Split. I read the plot synopsis, and I really liked the concept and watching the film for the first time was one of the best movie watching experiences I've ever had. I was glued to my seat the whole time watching the film and it genuinely scared me. I noticed how the movie builds suspense and I also paid attention to the interesting camera angles the cinematographer chose to shot. After watching the film, I was excited to watch more M. Night Shyamalan films, and that eventually built my love for film. James Mcavoy in this film has an oscar worthy performance, playing 23 different personalities. Anya Taylor Joy also had a very good performance in this film and she played a very interesting character. The techniques for building and showing suspense was masterful in this movie, and the cinematography in this film was golden. The story in this film was also very investing, and its twist and turns are very fun. At first I didn't understand the twist ending, but after browsing the internet, I found out it involved a character from Unbreakable, and watching that movie was also a treat. I'm 14 years old right now, and my passion for film will live on! Split is one of my favorite films of all time and it is a film I will always love."
"kirbylee70-599-526179","9","28","40","11 June 2017"," Multiple Scares
","There are some director's whose name alone brings forth images of the films they have made. If you hear Hitchcock you know a slow paced thriller is on the way. Spielberg? Normally a family styled big budget adventure. And when you hear M. Night Shyamalan you expect something different. Not always the same but unlike most movies you will see. That holds true with his latest release SPLIT.<br/><br/>As the film opens three young girls are kidnapped with no clue who is behind it or where they've been taken. Rather than a simple hostage movie we're seeing something different. The girls find their kidnapper to be stern and unwilling to give into their pleas for help. But then they see him again. Except that it's not quite him.<br/><br/>This is when we learn that the kidnapper, Kevin (James McAvoy) is suffering from dissociative identity disorder or what most people would call multiple personalities. When he shows up to the rooms they're being held in wearing a dress and telling them his name is Patricia the girls have no idea what to think. Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), the outsider of the trio, insists that they bide their time to figure a way out. The other two girls are more impulsive and act without thinking things through.<br/><br/>When they meet ""Hedwig"" Casey thinks she may have found someone who can help her. She spends time gaining his trust and learning more about what is going on. He tells her about ""The Beast"" and warns that he is coming. When she later asks the ""others"" about ""The Beast"" she is rebuffed but learns just a little more with each conversation.<br/><br/>Do the girls escape as the film moves forward? I'd rather not say and allow the story to surprise and unravel for each of you. But the movie does move on with more information gathered in various ways. One of those is the discussions between Kevin and his psychiatrist Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). Fletcher has been treating Kevin for some time now and is becoming slightly alarmed via various signs that something has changed.<br/><br/>Fletcher doesn't just spend time with Kevin though. While he insist that he is in control she convinces him to allow some of the ""others"" to talk to her. At different visits the multiple people within Kevin's mind are allowed to talk to her and discuss things with her. Each of them provides her with a greater sense of dread that something is happening.<br/><br/>Back at the house where the girls are being kept, Casey continues to work her way into the good graces of Hedwig. As the bond between the two of them builds the slightest glimpse of hope appears that perhaps the girls will make it out after all. With no demands made to their parents just why they were kidnapped to begin with comes into question. And when the answer presents itself the level of tension and fear reaches fever pitch. Is there really a ""Beast"" or is that just something in the mind of Kevin.<br/><br/>For me Shyamalan has been a hit and miss director. While I've never hated any of his films there have been a few that I felt had fallen a little short of the potential he showed in others. With SPLIT he returns to my good graces with a movie that draws you in, takes it's time to unfold and tells a story unlike any other. In a world of remakes that earns points with me. He definitely gives us something new here.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing to watch here. While the entire cast does a fantastic job it is McAvoy who takes center stage and steals the show. It's one thing for an actor to portray a character in a movie. But to create several and have them all well thought out and well done characters? That's something worth paying attention to. The only problem would be trying to figure out which character would be the one receiving an Oscar nomination if it came to that.<br/><br/>I noted remakes but what about sequels you might ask. SPOILER ALERT. This film is indeed a sequel but not so much that you would recognize it as such. We've never been exposed to these characters, never seen this world as far as we know and have no inkling that it ties into anything else. That is until the film is just about to hit the credits. At that time we see people talking in a diner and the camera pans down to reveal Bruce Willis sitting there listening to a conversation where someone is trying to recall the name of a terrorist who was in a wheelchair. He tells them the name was Mr. Glass. The name and his presence is a reference to Shyamalan's film UNBREAKABLE. And yes, this film ties into that. As will his next film, one he announced will complete a trilogy bringing all three films together. As a fan of that film I can't wait.<br/><br/>Until then I'll be content to watch this movie. And probably more than once. It's one of those films that once you know the end you want to watch again to see what else you can pick up as the story unwinds. That makes it a movie worth not just watching but adding to the collection."
"max1174","9","385","668","18 November 2016"," A great suspense story, with a standout performance by Mr McEvoy
","A welcome return to form for the director and James McEvoy gives one of his finest performances. I am not sure how many actors could achieve what he has executed so well here and one wonders if the film could have worked at the highest level without him. In between some of his bigger studio choices he has chosen challenging or interesting roles no matter how the films turn out and his range and talent always keep surprising but he takes it to another level here. <br/><br/>I won't reveal too much about the film as others will do that, except to say it was a great film to watch in the theater, full of suspense and in some ways quite touching and meaningful, even if you do or don't like the final twists you'll be drawn in to this story and on the edge of your seat in more of a suspense mode. <br/><br/>I wasn't sure if the film would go beyond a typical kidnapping film in the first five minutes but I can assure you its completely different to any expectations you'll have despite the director putting some of his more traditional touches on the film towards the end of it which really work in this case. I've always liked his earlier films as they often look at human conditions or flaws with imagination and some of his films have fallen short but he sounds like he's become more open minded and enjoying his work returning to form so well here and all I can say is well done, he has great attention to detail and gives his all. <br/><br/>This is a great film if you want an original suspense/thriller go and see it. I was sorry to see a review that put this film down, those reviews are off the mark this time round in my opinion I hope there is more to come from the M Night daring to be different again, his lower budget work is outstanding and easily brings out his best storytelling. <br/><br/>James McEvoy you've smashed it here and given you're all it was worth the risk, keep taking them! Having attended the Q&A he comes across a decent humble man which I would think gives his performances such resonance and skill. Also a great performance from Anya Taylor Joy she's a talent as well. Go see the see the film, especially in the threatre on a big screen it will have you on the edge of your seat."
"evanston_dad","7","19","27","7 August 2017"," Movie Overall Could Have Been So Much Better, But McAvoy is Astounding
","James McAvoy gives what could have potentially been an award-worthy performance if it had appeared in a different film.<br/><br/>He plays a man with multiple personalities who kidnaps three young girls as a part of a plot two of the personalities have hatched to unleash a powerful and unstoppable identity. Betty Buckley, in a better performance than the role necessarily needed, plays a therapist working with him and who begins to unravel the alarming plot. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, who hasn't made a movie I've wanted to see since ""Signs,"" crafts a nifty and effective thriller with three fourths of his film, and then sort of if not completely ruins it by taking his idea too far and pushing the supernatural elements to the point where we realize we're not even watching the same kind of movie we were at the beginning. This particular story, and especially McAvoy's performance, would have been compelling enough without Shyamalan's characteristic inability to understand when he's ruining his own premise.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

His ability to switch from one persona to another, to be dark, sinister, camp, soft, cute etc. is incredible, people sat around me watching the movie were stunned at how good he was.

","The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy the amazing performance by James McAvoy, who is able to effectively and very convincingly portray wildly different characters almost effortlessly with minimal change in physical appearance and entirely through superb acting. One scene in particular has him cycling through three completely different personalities of his character at the drop of a hat, which is quite remarkable. <br/><br/>The twist at the end is so disappointing that it is almost non-existent, those who have not watched the movie Unbreakable won't even understand the twist. At least this movie will keep you entertained and is not as atrociously paced as most of M. Night Shymalan's movies."
"LloydBayer","8","174","325","6 February 2017"," Split not only has Shyamalan back on the saddle but also rewards fans for their patience in his return to form.
","What a terrific comeback for Shyamalan! Many have been vocal that horror writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has been on a downward spiral after having peaked with Unbreakable, his very own superhero origins film. Split sees the continuation of Shyamalan's tryst with the supernatural but also a long awaited rhetoric that this filmmaker was merely waiting for the right moment to resurface. While his last film - The Visit - was predictable but entertaining, Split underscores his storytelling prowess with the high level of creativity that made him a household name in contemporary horror.<br/><br/>Yet fans will concur that Split isn't just a comeback either, rather a tactical setup of Shyamalan's very own cinematic universe. Put literally, the film is about a person with multiple personalities where each personality speaks collectively in full awareness of the rest. Although main character Kevin is said to exhibit 23 personalities, we see just a handful during most of the film. There's Barry, a New York fashionista, Hedwig, a goofy 9-year-old, and darker personalities Patricia and Dennis. Calling themselves The Horde, the latter two have influenced the abduction of three high school girls as a ritualistic sacrifice for the 24th personality often referred to as ""The Beast"". The girls have limited time before The Beast is unleashed and although paralysed by fear, their escape depends on protagonist Casey's (Anya Taylor-Joy) proactive deconstruct of the good and evil personalities that reside in Kevin. To her advantage and through revelatory flashbacks, we learn that this wouldn't be the first time Casey would confront a monster.<br/><br/>If Edward Norton's dual personalities was chilling in his debut film Primal Fear, wait till you get a load of James McAvoy in what is simply an outstanding performance of versatility (or should I say two dozen performances in one film?). More than just a demanding role to pull off, McAvoy's broad range in this film has also elevated what could have been a familiar antagonist into a nerve wrecking supervillain. Which is why Shyamalan's so called signature twist ending is almost astounding. To be honest there isn't an actual twist in the story, but the ending is an unexpected but seamless integration into a sort of trilogy that will have most viewers gob smacked. It's an inside joke and almost as if Shyamalan is asking if we have you been watching closely, but also an extremely rewarding Easter egg for every true fan of the man. Welcome back Mr. Shyamalan!"
"freshclean-66-318608","7","58","102","6 July 2017"," And I Thought M. Night Shyamalan Was Loosing His Touch.

Night all the way from the twists and the unpredictable story-line to the scares and the edge of your seat thrills. This is just a great horror/thriller played out as a far fetched psychological thriller. It's well written and the plot is laid out perfectly to the end and If you like older M.

"msbreviews","9","27","44","6 August 2017"," Rating: A
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>James McAvoy plays Kevin, a man with a genetic disease which allows him to have multiple personalities. His trusted psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), knows 23 of them, but there's one hidden from everyone who desires to dominate over all the others. Compelled by one of his personalities, Kevin abducts three girls, where Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy) becomes their leader to try and escape the ""crazy"" man.<br/><br/>Is this the return to form by M. Night Shyamalan, who has been struggling for more than a decade to release a major success? Is Split the movie that brings him back to the spotlight?<br/><br/>Once again, Shyamalan's storytelling is very original, unconventional and ultimately mind-blowing. Instead of establishing everything the audience needs to know about the characters right at the beginning, he gradually develops them, giving them haunting backstories and spreading parts of it throughout the runtime. That said, this film isn't for everyone. The audience needs to trust Shyamalan and be patient. Really patient. Don't start taking notes about something that you think it's negative because once you reach the third act, everything changes and suddenly it all makes sense. The screenplay is not as twisty as Unbreakable, for example, but it demands absolute attention in order to catch up on all the things that matter (and the ones that don't, as well).<br/><br/>The production and editing team have to be congratulated due to their seamless work. From the camera work to the extended one-take sequences, as well as the environment surrounding the characters, everything feels real and looks amazing. The soundtrack ... Let me just say that this element is so, but so much relevant to the conclusion of this movie. I can't really say anything else without spoiling the ending, so I'll leave a note after my rating at the end of the review with a MAJOR SPOILER.<br/><br/>As for the cast, I'll start with the man that I honestly think should have received an Oscar nomination: James McAvoy. You know, there's a big difference in portraying a non-fiction character instead of a fiction one: concerning the former, you can't really escape the true nature of the person you are playing, but with the latter, as an actor/actress, you have to deliver yourself 100% to the role for it to be believable ... And God, does McAvoy deliver! He gives 200% in what could be his best performance to date. Do you think Andy Serkis had problems portraying both Gollum and Sméagol at the same time? Well, imagine 7 ... or 8 characters. I lost the count. All in all, James McAvoy, sir, congratulations! You are superb!<br/><br/>Anya Taylor-Joy is also incredible as Casey! Her character has the most intriguing story of the three girls, and she's the one who assumes the leadership of the group once the kidnap occurs. Her initially unknown past helps her through the traumatic situation, but it's really her rather captivating backstory that grabbed my attention. It's fundamental to the understanding of the ending and Anya does a terrific job. I also want to give a small praise to Betty Buckley for a beautiful and necessary interpretation of Dr. Fletcher, a character that offers the audience some knowledge of Kevin's disease.<br/><br/>As for the other two kidnapped girls, well ... They're my main issue with the film since they don't have a good reason to be there. Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) aren't the main characters, and they don't have that much screen time, but their dialogue still feels extremely forced and filled with a lot of nonsense. The ending of the story might not be as twisty as in other Shyamalan's installments, but I hope that people don't give up to false expectations. The classic Shyamalan's twisty ending isn't a necessary attribute of his movies, but the truth is that the twist is not the one you think it is. Once again, the note at the end of my review will clarify this.<br/><br/>In the end, Split is Shyamalan's return to his old early 2000's self. Brilliantly unconventional storytelling, a lot of suspense, some very captivating subplots and a fantastic editing and production team behind him. The soundtrack plays a huge role in this film, as well as James McAvoy, who delivers his career-best performance. Anya Taylor-Joy is also pretty extraordinary, something that can't be said about her fellow friends who portrayed two bland characters. The ending brings the classic twist that makes everything more understandable, and I gotta say ... I love this film, and it is one of 2017's best!<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILER BELOW<br/><br/>As I said above, the soundtrack plays a huge role in the ending twist. That's because the soundtrack that plays right before the title of the movie appears on the screen, is the same one as in the third act of Unbreakable.<br/><br/>This is one of the many clues throughout the film that hint at the idea that Split belongs to Unbreakable's universe. Naturally, after the title shows up, there's a scene with David Dunn (Bruce Willis) that confirms this theory, but these are little details that make Shyamalan into a great director and screenwriter. Also, it's a pity that I've only watched these movies after Shyamalan stating that they were part of an eventual trilogy. Not that I was not surprised at the end of Split, but it did remove that first impact of pure shock in knowing that two films separated by 17 years (in real life) are part of the same universe.<br/><br/>Both movies end up falling into the ""superhero"" genre. Unbreakable is the story of our ""hero"" who spent his whole life sad because he wasn't doing ""what he was supposed to do"", and Split is an origin story of our ""villain"".

","Ahhhhhh I am so disappointed with this! I really wanted to love it, it ticks all the right boxes for a decent thriller. Yet somehow Shyamalan missed the mark. It's not bad, in fact it's crafted intricately...just not great. A man with 23 different personalities abducts three young girls as he prepares to unleash the 24th personality that dominates the others. This is extremely difficult to review. For every positive outcome there is a negative to counteract it. For example: Kevin's internal survival against the other personalities was an intriguing and compelling concept. However, the enthralling psychological analysis was negated by the stupidity of this whole 24th personality that is able to physically change Kevin. A thought provoking theme is decimated by an unrealistic concept in an attempt to be dramatic. It didn't need to be! The first act was going so well with interesting ideas that Shyamalan clearly has an interest in. His focus on this multiple personality disorder shows in the film. Patient and psychologist conversations take place that explains Kevin's fractured mind. Then it constantly shifts to the thriller aspect where these three young girls are trying to escape from a sinister location. It's not exciting. At all. These girls aren't put in any real danger or hardly attempt to flee so what's the point? They just exist for the finale which as a result makes the film absurdly boring. These girls are lifeless. Except Taylor-Joy's character who actually has some decent backstory, told through flashbacks. Split is a tool for James McAvoy to showcase multiple fantastic performances. Genuinely creepy and unnerving. His ability to automatically switch characters was faultless and found him to be highly enjoyable. Also like the final scene which harks back to a certain film which I shall not name. I look forward to future prospects. But in the end, Split was a failed attempt at a thriller but an intriguing psychological drama. It's unfortunate the two just didn't blend for me."
"baileycrawly","7","3","3","15 March 2020"," James McAvoy!!
","Every now and then, a Hollywood actor comes out and does the seemingly impossible.
In Split, James McAvoy brilliantly portrays a man with multiple personalities, providing a distinct portrayal for each and every character. They truly are their own entities existing within his body, and it's fantastic.
The premise of this movie is simple. A troubled man with multiple personalities kidnaps three young women and holds them hostage as they try to escape, warming up to the character's friendlier personalities and trying to trick the less cooperative.
It was fun and creepy without heavy reliance on jump scares, which is refreshing for the horror genre. There are also a few moments that are genuinely quite humorous.
M. Night Shyamalan was always a hit-or-miss director for me, but this was an amazing movie."

"sossevarvo","8","62","120","12 January 2017"," A twisty, tense thriller that doubles as a superb showcase for McAvoy's talents
","Shyamalan's inconsistencies as a director are decidedly ignominious. He  spellbound us with The Sixth Sense, but soon after befuddled with lady  in the Water, provoked derisive jeers with The Happening, and merely  bored us with The Last Airbender and After Earth. The pared back horror  of The Visit signalled a renaissance for the auteur, with its genuinely  frightening aesthetic, and even a decent Shyamalan twist!   But, armed with what seems to be a more significant budget, and far  more loopy creative ambition, Split is Shyamalan's true calling card to  what hopefully is a far more fortuitous run of features. Using the  disorder of DID, and a true story (!), to create its bonkers premise,  McAvoy plays Kevin, a man who possesses 23 distinct personalities, some  of which are male and some of which are female, some of which are  young, and some of which are old, some of which are homosexual and some  of which are heterosexual, some of which have OCD or require insulin  for diabetes, and some of which are really rather volatile and  dangerous. The catch? The 24th is about to arrive, with all hell set to  break loose.   If this sounds like an actor's dream job, you're right. With the  opportunity to flex his acting muscles to the nth degree,  all-accent-changing, mannerism-altering McAvoy rises to the challenge  with a performance of breathtaking versatility. The film around him is  never quite as reliable as this towering performance, however. The plot  functions between an incredibly tense kidnapping/hostage situation and  a doctor who purports to be an expert of DID. While eventually serving  a narrative purpose, in the early scenes, Shyamalan's switching to this  doctor's narrative grinds the movie to something of a halt, leaving you  longing for the far more interesting story to develop and ultimately  resolve. That being said, the movie never bores for a second, thanks to  Shyamalan's distinctive style and an ominous score, as well as Anya  Taylor Joy, so impressive in The Witch, who proves she isn't a one  trick pony. In addition, like THe Visit, Split is, unexpectedly, quite  funny, in a way that never sacrifices tension, but rather serves to  enhance it by catching you off guard with scares when you're recovering  from a bizarre joke - it's a terrific tactic that serves the film well.  Most worthy of recommendation is the film's third act, which evolves  into something genuinely terrifying and ferociously tense, as twist  upon twist piles up to create a thrilling sense of chaos and dread.  Less convincing are Shyamalan's repeated attempts at motifs of beasts  and animals, which feel shoehorned in and unnecessary. Despite al this,  Split is a worthy work from Shyamalan that will deliver a jolt of high  octane thrills to your nerves, one which will certainly be needed in  the doldrums of the January dumping ground of films."

","12 years back at Sreekumar theatre Trivandrum , I was going berserk over Chiyaan Vikram's multiple personality magnum opus Anniyan - and all of a sudden James McAvoy has outweighed that very specific standard of enactment with his once in a life time role in Split. Manoj Nelliate Shyamalan, that Indian prodigy who made sixth sense and sunk into oblivion with a chain of duds subsequently has made a magnificent riposte! Split sees the prolongation of Shyamalan's assignation with the supernatural but also a long anticipated rhetoric that this filmmaker was merely waiting for the right moment to rematerialize. The film deals majorly with a person sustaining 23 different personalities within himself of which a 24th one is about to surface. Resting heavily on the lead actor who has done a magnificent job, the screenplay sways between his distinctive dispositions, transitioning from an OCD patient to a psycho woman and to a 9 year old boy, amongst 18 other manifestations. 3 girls are abducted by one of these personas and made to wait for the appearance of the last one before they should try and escape him. Living up to his expectations, Shyamalan has created a proficiently hewed psychological thriller which is darkly amusing. Very much commended for an exhilarating watch.."
"evetodew","10","13","21","22 October 2017"," I really loved this movie
","I usually don't watch trailers for movies, because I want to be surprised by what I will actually see. And I am glad I didn't read anything about the movie, or watched trailers or read reviews. So, my opinion is purely mine.<br/><br/>I have to say that the movie totally got me by surprise. I was expecting something shallow and interesting, but instead, the story is much more complicated and deep, and could be seen again (which I plan to do with my husband). I think what touched me the most was the ending, when the Beast spoke to the girl in the prison cell, before he left her untouched.<br/><br/>That moment really touched me because of my own difficult past, and I can relate to both characters. At times, when you think you are too broken, you need a bit of comfort that you are not a complete castaway from society, because certain things happened in your past, which were not in your control.<br/><br/>I believe there will be people to relate to the characters just like I did, and will understand what I mean.<br/><br/>A really powerful movie, at least for me! I am glad I watched it!"

","A very god stab at herculean complexity. I liked the movie, only cause i did not take it to heart, bought into my feelings, questioned humanity and mental illness. Its just like reading a fictional book with a new twist and turn, which ends with good win over bad. What the movie shows is not a individual's mental illness, but what human mind is or can be capable of. The power hidden as explained in the iceberg theory, the not wandered territory of human potential, in turn manifesting into good and bad. Great actors and great delivery. Shyamalan movies are never disappointing, and this one definitely meets the next level of entertainment. Watch it... if you are a thriller fan and have appetite to believe that universe works in mysterious ways."
"AndreVeasey","7","21","38","15 February 2018"," Not Perfect But Good
","I will start off by saying this film was in no way perfect. There were some instances where I wondered what will this all lead to. Many people I hear who dislike the film is because of the personalities being violent. To be honest, the only personalities that are shown to be somewhat violent is Dennis and The Beast. Dennis doesn't do anything violent either. As seen in this film the personalities were actually funny, kind, and artistic however there were events that lead to some personalities believing it what's known as The Beast. The acting by James McAvoy was excellent. The plot was probably the only thing that was a little confusing. This is a great thriller film with some flaws but its entertaining in which I believe the director did good. I'm not anticipating his next film as I am others but I'm interested in seeing his next film."
"kluseba","9","40","81","3 February 2017"," The best psychological thriller of the past five years
","Just like ""The Visit"" a year earlier, Shyamalan's new movie ""Split"" offers a great mixture of psychological suspense, horror elements and an emotional drama with a lot of depth. The great story line, the tense atmosphere and the stunning acting pardon for the lack of a real twist as we usually get from Shyamalan.<br/><br/>The story is quickly told. A man diagnosed with twenty-three different personalities kidnaps three teenage girls and keeps them in an abandoned basement. The girls quickly realize that they can manipulate some of the split personalities while others are very hostile to them. It becomes obvious that the twenty-three personalities prepare for the emergence of a twenty-fourth personality called the beast that plans to feast on the teenagers' impure bodies. The three girls must find a strategy to escape before their lives will be in danger. At the same time, the psychologist of the man with the numerous personalities realizes that something seems to be wrong with her patient during their therapy sessions. Will the girls manage to escape and the psychologist find out the truth before it's too late?<br/><br/>The movie develops a quite diversified pace right from the start. The teenagers get kidnapped within the first five minutes of the movie and have to face one of the more aggressive personalities right from the start. The movie then slows down and presents us seven of the twenty-three different personalities. The film also gives us background information thanks to therapy sessions with the perpetrator and his psychologist as well as flashbacks of one of the girls that will become more and more important throughout the movie. The last quarter of the film quickens up the pace and leads to a furious showdown and an interesting reference. If compared to Shyamalan's last movie, some questions are though left unanswered and indicate a potential sequel to this movie. The restricted space in the basement, the calm and precise camera work, the gloomy light effects and the sinister soundtrack progressively increase the uneasy atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>James McAvoy has the challenging task to portray eight different personalities all at once and his acting performance alone elevates this movie to a very high level. He is credible in all of his roles and convinces as unpredictable patient that is both perpetrator and victim at the same time. This unprecedented acting performance should be honoured with a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role next year. The main actress incarnated by the talented Anya Taylor-Joy is almost as perfect as her character develops a fascinating chemistry with the perpetrator. Initially, she seems to be a shy outcast but turns out to be a clever and empathic young moment who will fight relentlessly for her survival. She's the tragic heroine of this movie and empathic viewers will definitely care about her fate. She would also deserve a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role next year. Among the secondary characters, Betty Buckley convinces in her role as open-minded psychologist who is walking a thin line between tolerance and insistence to uncover her patient's gloomy secret. I think she would deserve a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress next year. Overall, the cast is really convincing and easily the best in the psychological horror genre since Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"".<br/><br/>The only reason why this movie didn't get all ten points are a few minor lengths in the story telling during the first half of the film and the fact that the movie didn't come around with a stunning twist in the key of many of Shyamalan's previous works. <br/><br/>Still, ""Split"" is an extraordinary psychological thriller with an intense plot, an uneasy atmosphere and absolutely outstanding acting. Genre fans might even have their best movie of the year right here. Even those who like to criticize Shyamalan should admit that ""Split"" is a success and one of the best movies in his career. This film should definitely be rewarded with awards and is one of the few Hollywood movies that actually deserves all the attention it gets."

","Splits first 45 minutes are the best part of this movie with an intriguing look into the split personalities of Kevin, played by the excellent James McAvoy. It's within the small details of characterisation that astounds to still prove McAvoy as one of the best actors of this generation. His talent in being able to intertwine characters together is magnificent. Kevin and his 23 personalities respond well to Dr. Fletcher (Casey Cooke) who provides a great supporting role. <br/><br/>This can not be stated about the Girls, they almost feel like a gimmick at times to keep your heart pounding. The movies aim in scaring is also unsatisfactory, hardly ever making the audience jump out of their skin. The overall story arc also slows terribly down in the last 30 minutes with some fundamental errors in storytelling almost dragging on too long. The dialogue in scenes, partially with the girls also seems a little trashy, I don't feel like Shyamalan captured these roles as well as Kevin and Dr. Fletcher. <br/><br/>The score throughout the film keeps tensions a high but costume design feels a little rough around the edges. With constant swapping of personalities comes new costumes but at times characters don't adhere to what they are wearing which can occasionally become messy. Set design is also OK especially compared with the other recent Sci-fi, underground basement movie, 10 Cloverfield Lane. <br/><br/>Overall, it is one of Shymalans finest films but still has many underlining problems especially with pacing and dialogue. <br/><br/>6/10"
"moviewizguy","8","41","84","18 January 2017"," 24 things you need to know about SPLIT
","1. Obviously, the first thing that should be mentioned is James McAvoy's amazing performance. He is genuinely good and convincing as he weaves in and out of vastly different personalities, sometimes in the same scene.<br/><br/>2. Anya Taylor-Joy is a joy to watch as well. Her character has quite a bit of depth than the trailer suggests.<br/><br/>3. Rejoice for Betty Buckley! Those who thought she was awful in THE HAPPENING will find her lovely in this film.<br/><br/>4. As for the other two girls in the film - Haley Lu Richardson (who was wonderful in THE EDGE OF SEVENTEEN) and Jessica Sula - are serviceable but not entirely memorable.<br/><br/>5. Special shoutout to Izzie Coffey. Shyamalan always has a knack for finding talented young actors.<br/><br/>6. My favorite personality? Hedwig. He is a delight every time he's on screen. Etcetera.<br/><br/>7. Barry comes a close second. Seeing McAvoy play a homosexual character is as wonderful as it sounds.<br/><br/>8. I would have liked to see more of Kevin himself.<br/><br/>9. And in that line of thought, I would have liked to see more of the other personalities as well.<br/><br/>10. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Not a surprise since Mike Gioulakis shot IT FOLLOWS.<br/><br/>11. So is the score. This is Shyamalan's first parting from his go-to collaborator, James Newton Howard (unless you count Paul Cantelon's small contribution in THE VISIT). While a shame, West Dylan Thordson more than makes up for Newton Howard's absence, providing an atmospheric and surprisingly empathetic score in certain scenes.<br/><br/>12. Most inventive opening/closing credits ever? I think so.<br/><br/>**13. Don't let anyone spoil this movie for you. Just don't.**<br/><br/>14. I've already seen the film twice within 5 days of each other. I liked it more the second time.<br/><br/>15. But I still prefer THE VISIT. Some reasons:<br/><br/>16. The climax is really underwhelming. It works thematically/symbolically, but the payoff falls short.<br/><br/>17. On top of that, the third act itself could have been crazier.<br/><br/>18. The structure gets repetitive.<br/><br/>19. The runtime is a bit long as well.<br/><br/>20. As a matter of fact, the film has many problems.<br/><br/>21. But there are risks taken here, and SPLIT is admirable for that.<br/><br/>22. In fact, the film goes to some truly dark territory, especially for its PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>23. Overall thoughts? SPLIT is a really good January movie.<br/><br/>24. But I don't doubt that audiences will be split on the film."

"zardoz-13","7","211","505","6 February 2017"," Predictable, But Entertaining, With Another O'Henry Ending
","If tour-de-force performances alone constituted great cinema, then ""Sixth Sense"" writer & director M. Night Shyamalan's ""Split"" would rate as one of the best. Instead, Shyamalan's twelfth movie boils down to a straightforward, low-budget, abduction thriller, with a cannibalistic serial killer. The difference is this serial killer is a colorful basket case, a character teeming with more identities than you can count on all fingers and toes. As the traumatized casualty of an abusive mom, woebegone protagonist Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy of ""Victor Frankenstein"") has forged a 'horde' of personalities to serve as a bulwark against the atrocity of real-life. Predictable, derivative, and sometimes preposterous, ""Split"" benefits largely from McAvoy's nuanced performance as well as Shyamalan's usual last-minute surprises. ""Split"" feels like an 'origins' film. Not only is the protagonist a villain, but he also remains at large. The heroine is one of his hostages. Naturally, McAvoy has a field day chewing the scenery as a wacko with 23 personalities who is gestating number twenty-four. Basically, this charming but deranged ding-a-ling abducts three pretty little things from a Philadelphia shopping mall and confines them for his own culinary delight in an underground facility from which escape is virtually impossible. Compared with other movies about split-personality psychos, ""Split"" features a wackadoodle serial killer who isn't presented as a maniac out of a Rob Zombie splatter film. McAvoy's chameleon-like capacity to shift from one identity to another in the wink of an eye is as fluid as if he were genuinely conflicted himself. Suffice to say, McAvoy is nothing short of brilliant as Kevin Wendell Crumb. Were it not for one of the three captives, ""Split"" would have probably focused entirely on Kevin and not been as dramatic. Casey Cook is one of the kidnapped girls, but she is nothing like the other girls. Unfortunately, we see only eight of the twenty-three fruitcakes that McAvoy portrays, but none is either demonic or original. Meanwhile, two of those four other characters lack sympathy because they brought this tragedy on themselves by ridiculing this psycho. What ""Split"" does better than anything else is create a strong, memorable villain, and McAvoy fleshes it out in a bravura performance. Shyamalan conjures up a modicum of suspense toward the end when the girls try desperately to escape. Sometimes, this above-average suspense proves aggravating because you realize how futile it is for these doomed characters to survive.<br/><br/>Like Kevin, Casey Cook (Anya Taylor-Joy of ""The Witch"") has been forged in the crucible of child abuse, too. A heart attack killed her father (Sebastian Arcelus of ""Ted 2"") while she was attending elementary school. Sadly, her father's brother, Uncle John (Brad William Henke of ""Fury""), became Casey's guardian. Without divulging too much information, Casey and her stepfather have had an abusive relationship. Now, in high school, Casey prefers to keep to herself. Two of her snobbish classmates, Claire (Haley Lu Richardson of ""The Edge of Seventeen"") and Claire's African-American friend Marcia (Jessica of ""Honeytrap""), invite her to their birthday party more out of pressure rather than friendship. Indeed, they harbor cynical attitudes about Casey, but they fear the social media repercussions about what they might have faced had they not invited Casey. When her ride doesn't materialize, Casey agrees to accompany Claire and Marcia and listen to Claire's father (Brian Gildea) who loves to tell terrible jokes. As the saying goes, Hell is a road paved with good intentions, and Claire and Marcia have provided the asphalt that puts Casey in harm's way. Before they can pull out of the parking lot, a total stranger, Kevin Wendell Crumb, dispenses with Claire's dad and then carjacks them. Slipping on a face mask, he sprays something in their eyes that plunges them into oblivion. Of course, had they not been paralyzed with fear, these girls could have fled before Kevin incapacitated them. When they awaken, the girls find themselves locked up in a room with the same tight-lipped stranger staring at them. Eventually, they discover something is seriously amiss with their captor. Every time Crumb appears, he masquerades as an entirely different individual, sometimes even as a woman. What the three girls don't realize is that Kevin is a patient of a world-renowned psychotherapist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley of ""Frantic""), who has terribly misjudged the threat that he poses to society. Repeatedly, Kevin warns her about 'the beast' and how this Messianic personality will shield all twenty-three personalities from scorn and ridicule. When 'the beast' shows up, ""Split"" turns into a warped Marvel Comics movie because this side of Kevin possesses supernatural characteristics.<br/><br/>Basically, ""Split"" is a standard-issue serial killer saga. Neither the police nor the FBI interfere in ""Split,"" which differentiates it from movies like ""Manhunter."" Shyamalan confines the action primarily to several underground rooms and one in a luxurious apartment. Shyamalan fashions some mildly suspenseful scenes, especially when the girls try to break out in the end. When the time comes for him to depict death, Shyamalan doesn't indulge himself as Eli Roth of ""Hostel"" infamy might. Nevertheless, the action amounts to a predictable series of episodic encounters between McAvoy's various personalities and his victims. Aside from Kevin Wendell Crumb, Casey qualifies as the only other genuinely interesting character. The two snobbish girls might as well have been mannequins. They are expendable, and they behave like whiny victims in a movie where whiny victims die. Most of Shyamalan's surprises occur exactly when you expect them, though two deserve back-to-back ""WOWS!"" because they come both as a relief and surprise! The outcome of Casey's hostile clash with 'the Beast' salvages this otherwise predictable potboiler. Bruce Willis's cameo in the final scene as security guard David Dunn brings ""Split"" into the ""Unbreakable"" timeline. Moreover, two characters at a diner compare Crumb to Glass! Ultimately, Shyamalan wants moviegoers to see James McAvoy's conflicted serial killer in ""Split"" in the same light as Alfred Hitchcock's classic chiller ""Psycho"" with Anthony Perkins as the protagonist."

","Dissociative Identity Disorder (known as DID, and previously called Multiple Personality Disorder) is a psychological disorder in which a single person displays multiple distinct personalities, often as a defense mechanism to help the original personality deal with some sort of emotional trauma, like that suffered as a result of child abuse. These personalities each have a distinct name and distinct personality traits. As you can imagine, this condition is shrouded in mystery, is especially difficult to diagnose and treat and can be very dangerous for the sufferer – and for those around him/her/them. Fascination with DID has been fodder for a number of movies over the years, most notably in 1976 when Sally Field played (and won an Emmy for) a made-for-TV version of the true story of a woman who had 16 different personalities. (""Sybil"" was remade, again for TV, in 2007, then starring Tammy Blanchard and Jessica Lange.) 2017 offers a fictional DID story in the form of the horror-thriller ""Split"" (PG-13, 1:57), written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan who also co-produces for the second time with Jason Blum and Marc Bienstock of Blumhouse Productions, which gave us horror franchises like ""Paranormal Activity"".<br/><br/>James McAvoy is Kevin Wendell Crumb, a man with 23 different personalities inside his head, but who is still able to function in society. He lives on his own, has held a good job for ten years, and regularly sees his psychologist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). She finds it difficult to treat Kevin, but she cares a great deal about his mental health and she makes herself available to him 24/7. She also finds it difficult to gain professional acceptance for the things she is learning about DID by working with Kevin. And it can be especially difficult for Dr. Fletcher to know which of Kevin's personalities with whom she is speaking. For a while now, she's been dealing primarily with Kevin's artistic personality, known as Barry, but something has changed in her recent sessions with Kevin. She senses it, but isn't sure what it means.<br/><br/>However, three young women are experiencing firsthand what has changed in Kevin. High school friends Claire and Marcia (Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula) are giving a ride to strange loner Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) when Kevin suddenly gets into their car, incapacitates the three of them and takes them to some sort of underground facility in which he lives and has built a room to hold the girls. Actually, it was Dennis, Kevin's most forceful personality, who abducted the three, but they don't understand what is going on, why they've been taken or what they should do about it. Disagreements over how to work together to escape and the emergence of Dennis' fellow ""alters"" keep them off balance, but when they do take action, their attempts to resist just make matters worse for them. With the obvious exception of their captive state, the girls are unharmed, but it becomes clear that something bad is about to happen.<br/><br/>""Split"" is an outstanding return to form for Shyamalan and one of the best horror-thrillers in years. Looking at audience and critics' ratings reveals that there was a slow, but steady decline in the popularity of his films after he burst into the public consciousness with his Best Picture Oscar-nominated 1999 drama-mystery-thriller ""The Sixth Sense"". That decline bottomed out with 2010's ""The Last Airbender"", but rebounded slightly with 2013's ""After Earth"". The reception for his films improved further with his 2015 horror-thriller ""The Visit"", his first film with Blumhouse Productions, who gave Shyamalan more artistic freedom than he had enjoyed in many years. Although ""Split"" doesn't feature one of his trademark mind-bending twists, it's his best film in 10-15 years.<br/><br/>Here, he has made a movie with an original concept, a compelling narrative and genuine tension which gradually builds. It helps that this is an especially well-acted horror film. McAvoy transforms himself (physically, emotionally and regarding audience perceptions of him), Buckley turns in her most powerful performance since the original ""Carrie"" in 1976 and Taylor-Joy follows up her under-appreciated work in 2016's ""The Witch"" and ""Morgan"" showing that she's one of the most talented young actresses of the mid-late 2010s. And, almost as much as this film showing that Shyamalan is very much back as a director, his fans will appreciate seeing two actors from his earlier films in the cast and one killer reference to one of those films in the closing credits. ""Split"" is not to be missed. ""A"""
"spaceashwin","8","13","23","10 October 2017"," The Beast, the Manifestion
","I think Split is one of the best Psychological thriller movies in the past few years. I'm not sure if it has comparisons with other thrillers but would rather say that the idea is indeed very interesting. Look at Mrs. Fletcher who tries to convince the audience at the conference that the human mind has evolved to a different stage. Shyamalan pushes this concept even further saying that if there are a set of personalities to explore then the final outcome reachable would be something supernatural which in this case is the Beast. The creation of the personalities, if is a result of the childhood trauma then the idea of a super powered being is something which contradicts the concept of the capability of the human mind. Since the devil lives on after being hit by two bullets( and in this case Shyamalan is not trying to show that there are only two bullets for Casey but the magnitude of destruction that can be caused by the bullets) there is direct reference to something beyond being human. Even if this is one of the finest interpretations out there for Splitm the Director fails to explain indirectly why there is a difference in approach the 23 personalities have towards humans and the approach of the Beast.Are the personalities functionalities for the beast? The use of the spray versus the kill?. Why does the devil need Humans? Is it some kind of vengeance that would actually improve lives of people like Kevin or the beast? I say this because Dennis and Patricia are trying to protect Kevin. Kevin seems to have gone through a childhood trauma so whatever is trying to protect him is not doing so against the devil. All this holds true if the 23 personalities manifest to the beast or like how I said reaches out and becomes the beast. What is the beast trying to accomplish? Will the next sequel 'the Glass' have answers to this? If it had to leave out people like Casey who had been tortured at a young age there is definitely something the beast is trying to prove by killing the impure. Why does it kill Mrs. Fletcher? Is the devil a manifestation of only that kind of emotion related to child abuse? Is that some kind of ideal the beast is trying to put forth? If Barry, Dennis and the others are the outcome of the child abuse and the beast is its final form ,is killing a cure to the angst and anger within Kevin? These are questions that need to be explained! One thing is sure that not all the personalities are aware of the beast. Do the killings by the beast and the protection of Kevin have any kind of relation? In the end I feel the beast lives on the mind of people like Kevin (not all the personalities ) who strangely/accidentally accept the devil with a different set of ideas(Dennis and Patricia take control of Kevin's life-""we are in control"") which in turn helps the beast to live and spread itself farther. <br/><br/>Thank you"

"animupizza","1","170","411","28 January 2017"," Mentally ill people are not a horror movie plot
","Tired old trope of using a person with a mental illness as a plot for a scary movie. Unoriginal, and ableist.<br/><br/>Mental illness, especially misunderstood illnesses like dissociative identity disorder, are incredibly stigmatized in our society. They're often seen as scary, and the people suffering from them are often labeled as dangerous, making it difficult for them to receive help and support. Movies like ""Split"" further this stigma. <br/><br/>There is very little media representation for people with DID, many people don't know much of anything about the illness, so when movies present it as something that makes people dangerous, others have no reason not to take this as a fact. <br/><br/>In reality, people with DID are not abusers, but people who themselves have been abused. DID is an illness that develops after long term exposure to trauma occurring before the person turned nine years old. It develops because the trauma is too much for the young person's brain to handle, so their personality ""splits"" off into different parts, so that they don't have to. Movies show these alters as violent, but really, people with DID are usually only a danger to themselves. Showcasing them as the kind of people who would kidnap and abuse teenage girls is a gross inaccuracy, that again, wouldn't matter so much if it wasn't basically the only media representation of this illness.<br/><br/>Because of the belief that these people are violent and dangerous, not only is it difficult for them to find support, but societal biases are often internalized. <br/><br/>Mentally ill people are not violent abusers. But the stigma furthered by these movies contributes to the belief that they are. Mentally ill people need support, they need to be normalized, they do not need any more horror movies that use them as the scary abuser. I hope that in the future we can move past movies like this, and towards acceptance. Mentally ill people deserve better."
"trublu215","6","64","144","12 January 2017"," Had the potential to be a great film but it all crashes down on a borderline idiotic twist.
","M. Night Shyamalan's Split pits a ground of teenage girls against their captor (James McAvoy) and his plethora of multiple personalities with each personality ranging from harmless to deadly. First off, I want to say, I did enjoy the first hour or so of this film. It was creepy, tense, tasteless but fun. Then the final hour comes steam rolling everything in its wake including all the thought and caring that we've grown to have over the course of the previous hour. It is not one thing or another, it's a willingness to halt the film's growth as it's own and by the final minute of the film, everyone will know what I am talking about. As for spoilers, I'm not going to spoiling anything which makes my thoughts that much harder to gather. <br/><br/>While I'm not a complete film snob, I do expect certain things going into an M. Night Shyamalan film. If you were talking to me before The Village, I'd say that I would expect a creepy atmospheric film. If you're asking me post-Village, I'd simply say ""Dear God, I hope it's good."" The Visit was somewhat back on track for him so I was excited to see this but instead I'm leaving this film actually giving up hope. The twist is so lazy and so out-of-left- field that it diminishes any sort of weight. It is merely a gimmick rather than a clever little twist, especially for a Shyamalan film. Honestly, it single handily ruined the film for me. It is a singular moment that completely drains Split of any real merit as a standalone film.<br/><br/>Like I said, James McAvoy gives a chilling performance that sometimes goes over-the-top but still maintains a level of creepiness without it ever being overbearing. Anya Taylor-Joy gives a very good performance as well as Casey, who gives a better performance here than in last year's terrifying yet overrated The Witch. The rest of the cast plays out the typical female horror characters to a fault and actually fails to breathe new life in a very tiring role.<br/><br/>Overall, Split is a film that could have cut out it's so-called ""twist"" and been a fun midnight movie, a solid 7/10. But instead M. Night Shyamalan delivers his laziest twist to date in hopes of continuing the trend that is a M. Night Shyamalan film. A term that used to mean something, now is played out to a gimmicky effect and we all know Shyamalan is so much better than that. And while I'm sure the ""twist"" will wet some hardcore fans' appetite, it made the film that much more trivialized."

","A man kidnaps three teenage girls and holds them prisoner in a basement. He has multiple personality disorder, and is the prize patient of Dr Karen Fletcher, who is using him as case study in the condition. Several of his 23 personalities make their appearance to the girls. While none of them seem particularly harmful, there are indications that there lurks inside of him an ultra-strong and violent personality, The Beast.<br/><br/>Written and directed by M Night Shyamalan, I was hoping this would be a return to something like the form of his earlier films. Yes, it would be difficult to match the brilliance of The Sixth Sense but something approaching great would be a good start. Unfortunately his trajectory over the last 11 years or so has been decidedly downwards with some monumentally bad movies - The Happening, Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender (plus, probably, After Earth - I haven't seen it but apparently it is incredibly bad).<br/><br/>So I was quite disappointed when I actually watched this, especially in the first half of the movie. Script, by Shyamalan, is weak, and padded. There was heaps of potential in the concept and themes but this is not used effectively.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is that the initial plot is contrived and implausible. It hinges on you believing that the three girls would allow themselves to be held captive. They have plenty of opportunities to overwhelm the captor, but don't, and even when they actually figure on doing that we have a very weak and contrived reason for them not doing it.<br/><br/>Plus there is a lot of padding to the movie. While the captor's visits to Dr Fletcher do add some depth to his character(s) and to her side of the story, much of it is unnecessary.<br/><br/>So for the first half (even more) I was mostly sitting there thinking ""This is so unrealistic, just escape already!"" and getting bored at some of the discussions.<br/><br/>It gets more intriguing and exciting in the second half, and starts to make more effective use of the multiple personality device, but that doesn't make up for the poor start.<br/><br/>Can't fault the performances though. James McAvoy is great as the captor, having to essentially play about nine roles, and have to switch between them in a heartbeat. Anya Taylor-Joy is solid as Casey, with good support from Betty Buckley, as Dr Fletcher, and Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula as the other two kidnapped girls.<br/><br/>On the whole, not great, and certainly not in the same league as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable or even The Village, but better than most of the stuff M Night Shyamalan has dished up over the last 11 years. A step in the right direction, at least."

","Two smartphone distracted girls and their 'weird' friend are kidnapped by an unknown assailant who carries out the action without any emotion whatsoever.<br/><br/>'Barry' is a model employee. He's been ill, but is better now. Doctor Fletcher (Betty Buckley) says this. We learn of 'Barry's' disorder because Fletcher is trying to widen awareness for his condition. The information about what is known as 'DID' is staggered throughout, at length, and her scenes are interspersed with 'Barry' and his other personalities presenting themselves to his three prisoners. One of these is an upper-class woman called 'Patricia', another is an irritant called 'Hedwig', another is a nuisance called 'Dennis' (who likes to watch girls dance naked). In reality, his name is Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), and he has 23 personalities.<br/><br/>Despite claims that, for example, if one personality is a weight-lifter he possesses the strength of a weight-lifter whilst other shared personalities do not, McAvey doesn't have the physical presence to portray anyone that couldn't just be over-powered by the three girls – or even just one of them (with a more sustained battering than just hitting him once and then turning their back on him, something that happens more than once). Despite the theatrical rolling eyes, the lisp, the change of clothes, he simply isn't frightening. His endless talking about himself makes it clear that his characters are a lot more interesting to him than to the audience – or at least, this member of it. I can appreciate a committed performance, but sadly he leaves me cold.<br/><br/>Perhaps to balance out Kevin's multiple characteristics, the three girls have only one personality between them. Being the allegedly 'weird' one of the trio, it is Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy, who had been so good in 2015's 'The Witch') to whom 'Dennis' is attracted, because of course weirdness is an elite exclusive club that joins every outsider together, provided you're pretty enough ('the broken are the more evolved,' apparently). Luckily for flesh fans, one of Kevin's personalities suffers from OCD, necessitating the young captives to remove much of their 'dirty' clothing. Another box ticked.<br/><br/>There have been accusations that 'Split' is offensive to sufferers of mental health disorders. In an age where being offended is a competitive sport, presumably any piece of fiction involving death, for instance, is offensive to anyone who has ever suffered bereavement and therefore 'shouldn't be allowed'. This is a point of view that stifles creativity, fiction, drama and/or many levels of art. That is not the problem with 'Split' in my view. It is an idea that is ripe with potential but simply stretched out very thinly over almost two hours with very little incident. In fact, the kidnapping of three girls is the only incident. Endless scenes of talking about 'Barry's' condition isn't entertaining, frightening or effecting. It very quickly becomes dull and stays that way.<br/><br/>Director M. Night Shyamalan had a great success with 'The Sixth Sense' in 1999, especially its twist ending. Subsequently, all his films have ended with a similar surprise, each one less effective than the last. If you make it to the end of this, there is a revelation that (SPOILERS) Kevin's affliction appears to be supernatural. 'The Beast' is physically bulkier than his other personalities, can hop from wall to wall and is impervious to bullets. This ends with a reference to Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable' via a Bruce Willis cameo which pre-supposes you are on familiar terms with that film, which is presumptuous, as this is not billed as a sequel."

'Split' is definitely not a horror movie (I actually thought it will be a LOT more creepy than it was); it's an amazingly dramatic thriller which made me both laugh my ass off and be on the verge of crying (so... a perfect combo of emotions expressed). Long story short, 'Split' is very different from any movie I watched and that is why I truly hope the story will not end here. Cannot wait for 'Split 2'!"

Notice I use 'Knight'as I soon expect the Queen of England to be knighting this fellow with some accolades for his contribution film and motion picture innovation.<br/><br/>The opening credits are compelling enough to make one think that there is some hope for film's success; as a lot of work was put into the credits, perhaps more so than the body of the film itself.

I'm surprised that IMDb number is at 7.4 of 10. Wow... Stunning revelation to the capacity of integrity of movie enthusiasts.<br/><br/>Yep, they had to bring in Bruce Willis in at the end for some box office draw like some insurance in case the movie severely bombed, which surprisingly it didn't as the box office business indicates $137 million netted from an estimated $9 million production budget. It just means that we'll see some future crap from this guy.<br/><br/>I understand that devout fans of M.

"vze2363v","1","130","323","8 April 2017"," WARNING: SPOILERS For Split
","I'm going to leave a couple of blank lines just in case you didn't see the SPOILER warning...but apparently it doesn't work. First, I'm going to say I don't particularly like horror movies, so if you're a big horror fan, you MAY love this movie. I hate any movie where women act stupid, helpless, slow...you get the idea. Poverty makes a woman intolerant and if you are a strong woman, this movie is going to seem like someone is slowly scratching their nails across a chalkboard. By the end of the movie I was hoping the beast would kill the victim!<br/><br/>The story line is simple. Stupid girl doesn't pay any attention to her surroundings, stupid girl let's guy drug her and her two friends with aerosol, guy shoves 3 stupid girls in a locked room and keeps them there while he goes through his alternate personalities. There are plenty of chances for girls to escape, run away, but then they get all ""oooo, I'm a girl, I can't use my brain, I have to be helpless"" and they get locked in different rooms. <br/><br/>In the end, multi-personality guy changes into a mutant and kills his shrink and two of the girls. When he gets to the last girl we painfully watch as she just acts idiotic, drops shotgun shells all over, has a chance to kill the beast by shooting him multiple times at his C1 vertebrae, but does she do it? NOOOOO, she just lets him get away. Now there's a mutant killer running around free. <br/><br/>At that point I was hoping a large piece of the ceiling would kill her and put US out of our misery. Instead she continues to act stupid, mousy, like she owes the guy because he didn't kill her. In the end, there's a special cameo that tie's into another M. Night Shyamalan movie. I will never go to another horror movie again.<br/><br/>I know people will say, but it was all about a mental health issue and it was supposed to be complex, etc. My friend wanted to share the joy of the X-Men movies with me as I'd never seen them, so I'd watched all of them in chronological order (including Logan). I also watch Legion on TV, so I'm over the whole multi-personality thing. <br/><br/>Again, if you like horror, maybe you'll like this. If you HATE watching women acting stupid and helpless, stay away from this film. You'll be doing yourself a favor. Buyer beware!"

","It looks like India backs its Indian American director hero and has stuffed the ballot boxes here with high votes.<br/><br/>What's sad is that M. Night's scripts are getting worse, if that is possible. I'll sum up this stinker in a nutshell. Crazy person with multiple personality disorders kidnaps 3 women for reasons that are unclear other than his being crazy. Then over the course of time you're told about how there really can be multiple people inhabiting the same body. And tales of the supernatural. And really, really, really bad and stupid dialogue. Victims acting stupidly as is needed for these films to work. And then of course the story of ""the beast"" within. Is it a really bad personality? Is it something else? Stay tuned while the pretty young ladies begin to slowly take off their clothing, which is par for the course for these films. There is very little reason to like any of the characters, which you don't get to know anyway. And some of the ""explanations"" are completely inconsistent with any type of logic or reason in the way people act.<br/><br/>The only way I can understand Macavoy doing this film is someone stroking his ego about the tour de force performance it would require. And he does his usual excellent, intense job in trying to bring this stinker of a film to life as he plays about 2 different personalities that come off as prepared monologues that appear in random parts of the film.

","I have to admit the concept behind this film hooked me but everything went downhill once it started playing in the cinema. From the horrendous, laughable acting by the three female victims (I often found it hard to believe the three of them were supposed to be terrified prisoners with their perfect makeup and unrealistic screaming scenes) to the obligatory 'plot twist' at the end, I felt like walking out of the theater multiple times during the movie. The only scenes which redeemed the movie were the interesting exchanges between 'Kevin' and the psychologist (props to the both of them for their decent performances) and I couldn't help cringing each time one of the girls made an appearance. It was sad the three of them had as much screen time as they had.<br/><br/>Also, DID is a serious issue and yet, Kevin's dialogue was often cringe-worthy, prompting hysterical laughter from people in the cinema. It made it hard for me to think of this movie seriously. Even when Kevin finally transformed into the Beast and began crawling on walls, I was so numb from all the cringe-worthy dialogue and weak plot that I was no longer shocked at this entirely unrealistic 'plot twist'. <br/><br/>Perhpas, James McAvoy should have just stuck to playing Charles Xavier if he wanted to be a superhero that badly."

","With time being our most precious commodity, I try to carefully select the movies I do watch, as I don't have a ton of time to watch them. But the hype around this movie, and of course the (mind boggling) 7.4 IMDb rating tempted me enough to give it a chance. I sat down excited with my favorite snacks - hoping to be in for what some called 'one of the best horror movies this year so far'.<br/><br/>Wow.... really? Horror? This is NOT horror. It's a suspense thriller / drama at best. This movie couldn't even scare a 12 year old. And THIS is supposed to be the ""return of M Night Shyamalan""? What? <br/><br/>I absolutely loved Signs, and The Sixth Sense is amazing too. But his movies since have gone down hill. The Visit was very lackluster and pretty disappointing too. But not as disappointing as this stinker. At least with The Visit - there was no claims or hype saying this was his 'return to form' so I didn't expect a lot. But Split? This is more like a terribly executed amateur film students idea of a ""thriller"". <br/><br/>The first 20-30 minutes, the movie has your interest a little bit as you wonder about the kinds of twists and surprises you are about to treated to. Maybe the guy is a ghost? Maybe there are actually more than one main protagonist? Maybe the girls are in an alternate reality? Maybe there is an actual, physical, hairy (as they describe him) monster that we will soon get to see? Oh man...that would be cool.. <br/><br/>These are things I was eagerly thinking as I was watching, hoping I would be right, and that if so - these plot twists could turn this how I would have written if it I was behind it.<br/><br/>But nope. As time goes on, you realize, there is NOTHING exciting happening. Just some incredibly boring dialogues, a character study of multiple personality disorder, some dumb girls trying to escape, and several conversations between a shrink and her patient. *Yawn* The ending? I was half asleep at that point but it was extremely underwhelming and disappointing. So the 'beast' just looks like the dude, just with some veins popping out, and he can climb walls? Wow, amazing. Not.<br/><br/>Save your time and do not listen to the positive reviewers. I think they were paid by Universal Studios to bring up the overall score here."

I liked Unbreakable, but Signs was garbage and nearly everything else he has done has been rubbish (the Village has some merit).<br/><br/>Now this was interesting, no question. James M was stunning in his performance (similar to Filth, a brilliant film).<br/><br/>However, I was waiting for the pay off at the end of the movie. I assumed that the girl was either all 3 girls or the girl was just one of the personalities, that might have been a clever ending, but in the end, nothing; it just ended. Huh? What was the point of the uncle story? It added nothing. I thought it actually might have something to do with the whole story, but no, totally meaningless.<br/><br/>I gave it a 1, as it lead nowhere and was a waste of time.

He was a great actor, I knew he could do so better than this movie.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, it was very typical and predictable.

Except for the real personality, Kevin Wendell Crumb, didn't realize that he had a dissociative identity disorder (i thought he knew after his therapist told him?). Kevin only knew he had a passed out period time, when his other personalities took over. Unfortunately, Dennis, the vicious personality who kidnapped the girl knew that all could happen as your brain made it to be. So he created the 24th personality, called the Beast, and he could call out the Beast whenever he wanted. <br/><br/>All i can say is, great idea is poorly executed. So just don't waste your time.

"imdb-45","1","66","158","31 March 2017"," Not surprised the studio reviews come up first
","So the first reviews here were which rated the film are obviously those connected with the film. The torrent of bad reviews that follows are the honest ones. From the start I had a bad feeling about this movie because the intro was so awkward and the dialogue was so cheesy with poor acting.<br/><br/>James Macavoy is a very talented and versatile actor. How he was suckered into doing the latest Shyalaman stinker can only be explained by his needing to pay back a favor or someone having a terrible video of James with a farm animal. This film is that bad. The only moments that are somewhat tolerable are when Macavoy is on the screen. He's got by far the most presence and talent and the rest of the cast looks even worse contrasting his performance with theirs.<br/><br/>In short, Macavoy plays a mentally ill person with multiple personalities. He kidnaps 2 girls with the assistance of a third who is terrified to act against his wishes, even when she has the ability to just walk away in a public airport. I mentioned this because that is how the film opens. You must buy into the premise in order for the film to even start to work.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, it becomes evident early on that Macavoy suffers from this multiple personality disorder and will act out each part. And Shyalaman throws in his usual bit of supernatural rubbish, how such afflictions are also gifts, the savant mentality. OK, great, got it. Begin an hour of torture porn and hints of what bad things might happen. Warning that things will get worse. Heighten tension. Disclose things that don't really add up. Heighten tension. Add more awkward, obviously orchestrated dialogue and directing.<br/><br/>Will the girls escape the potentially horrible ending they fear might happen? When will the James Macavoy acting clinic open? Will his accent change? Take Macavoy out of the film and this is a direct to video stinker that no one will remember. Sets a whole new bar of low."
"brehnk","2","73","177","27 March 2017"," An Overrated Mess
","Mr. Night Shyamalan is either a visitor from another planet or a Terminator-esque cybernetic organism. For two decades his movies have attempted to impersonate the films of true humans, but they are oddly written imperfect interpretations because his brain chemistry is radically different from our own.<br/><br/>Not a single spoken line in ""Split"" is something that a human being would ever actually say. The screenplay is a hair-tearing mind-boggling mess. Confusion gives way to anger and then utter madness as characters spew increasingly bonkers dialog and behave impossibly stupid. And then the film continues for another 100 minutes.<br/><br/>The direction, editing, and cinematography are all nearly as insane. When the film isn't lingering 12 seconds too long on panning camera shot after panning camera shot it's frenetically jumping back and forth between characters and story lines, halting all momentum and throwing pacing and tension out the window every time. <br/><br/>Split was sold on the performance of Mr. James McAvoy as 24 different roles and judging by the box office and the high ratings the hype seems to have worked. He is indeed the high point of the film and the reason for the second star in this rating but compared to the hype he's slightly underwhelming - McAvoy spends the majority of the running time as just 3 or 4 characters, effectively making the whole 24 personalities thing purely a marketing tactic.<br/><br/>The acting by the remainder of the cast is awful across the board. Anya Taylor-Joy manages to come out the least scathed by simply staring blankly into the middle distance for the entirety of the film, but her two fellow kidnappees are laughably horrendous. Betty Buckley flounders helplessly through her lines and while she's universally terrible it's difficult to know whether to blame her or the batsh*t directing and writing as she's expected to deliver some of the worst dialog ever put on screen.<br/><br/>By the end the whole affair devolves into a hilarious dumpster fire the likes of which we've seen in ""The Happening"" but by then it's far too late to find any sort of enjoyment in the spectacle. I can't recommend this to anyone.<br/><br/>Mr. Night, please return to your home planet. We're all very tired."

"KrabbyPatties","3","53","125","28 January 2017"," Should've known better than to trust shamalamadingdong again
","Have never wrote a review before on IMDb but logged in just to comment on how inexplicably bad this is. First of all, how is this crap film getting 9/10s and 8/10s? I am genuinely asking because I cannot comprehend how anyone who has seen this film would rate it in that manner. I got duped by all the favorable reviews praising M.Night's new thriller and walked into the cinema with great hopes, shining, bountiful hopes, despite the utter tragedies of the films he had directed before. It seemed like a great concept, DID + James McAvoy? I was so ready for this. <br/><br/>Now a big portion of why this didn't work out was because of the script. It had all the hallmarks of amateurish writing. Gaping plot holes, corny and cheesy dialogue, scenes that made you want to scream at the characters for making extremely poor decisions etc. One of my biggest gripes were that the 3 main personalities they crafted for James McAvoy seemed to be very stereotypical. You had the uptight, OCD, neat-freak Dennis, the tranquil Patricia, constantly wearing a shawl to convince us of her innate zen-ness and finally, Hedwig, a 9 year-old with a crippling case of the lisp, yadda yadda ya, he has his precocious moments as most children do, nothing very interesting. Hedwig was also oft used as a plot device to inject humour into the film, I did not think they meshed well with the overall tone of the movie, scenes where he popped up were enjoyable but at the same time felt more like a tick off the checklist, the attempts to introduce levity throughout the film did not flow well and felt contrived. I would say McAvoy did a great job with the material he was given but bad writing is after all, bad writing. The stilted dialogue didn't help things at all. The 3 teenaged girls did not fare well on the acting front as well. I have watched Anya Taylor-Joy in The Witch and she did pretty good there so it was somewhat puzzling to see her performance in this movie, granted it was better than the other 2 but it was still rather lacking. I would've thought being captured by a deranged madman would have been much more frightening than how it was portrayed in the film.<br/><br/>Going into the third act of the film, the psychiatrist made some extraordinarily bad decisions, including investing too much into a patient, visiting a patient with 23 personalities, some rather dubious in character, in the middle of the night. By herself. Without informing anyone else. Really? Fast forward into the film and she's been drugged by Dennis. The first thing she does upon awakening is to write down the full name of Kevin, which we know is the one thing that is capable of pulling him into the light and giving him the power of his own body. She, however does not utter the name when the Beast is attacking her, does not even bother to say it as she tries to stab him unsuccessfully over a long drawn out moment. Yes, the Beast was squeezing her torso/mid body but she could still have said something (the way he constricted her body did not make it seem that she was unable to speak), knowing this was the only fail-proof way to get Kevin to return. <br/><br/>Another gripe was the supernatural element of the film. The way they introduced the Beast felt so terribly banal and cliché. Veins bulging out of his body, ripping his shirt off, fleeing across urban landscapes in the dark, climbing and scaling buildings. It was like a watered down hulk? Hulk-lite? It wouldn't have felt out of place in a cheesy superhero flick at all. Except that it attempted to be a serious psychological thriller which makes me want to scream why, over and over again at the screen.<br/><br/>And don't even get me started on the ending. (from the point that they discovered the girl) It went from a 5/10 to a 3/10. Some people enjoyed the Unbreakable reference, I found it exceedingly stupid, a cheap easter egg gimmick they threw in at the end of the film to give fans something to salivate over. Overall, I thought it had an interesting premise and extremely bad execution. Stop giving M.Night future projects. Stop indulging him in the same kind of shitshow he's been making for years. And for Christ's sake, if he's going to be making movies, please hire an actual capable writer to write the damn script and dialogue.<br/><br/>TL; DR: Pros- McAvoy's performance, cinematography Cons- Everything else"

It's the same stunt he pulled with ""Sixth Sense"", this type of ""oh wow"" would of worked 25 years ago, but not now, society is just too smart for this type of silliness. This director is very cocky in my opinion, he's had a few good movies, but mostly duds, while riding on the coat tails of his so called inspiration Alfred Hitchcock. Copying director style is one thing, but making films with Hitchcock step for step direction is another, that's why Shyamalan to me is a sell out, he's doing it for the money, we all fell for that rhetoric with SIxth Sense and Signs, but those day's are over, and there is more younger director talent out there, and it isn't Shyamalan."

The reason 10 Cloverfield works (the final 10-15 minutes aside) is that you always feel John Goodman's character could lose it at any moment. And from time-to-time, he does. That movie really had me on edge and the tension was almost unbearable at times. Unfortunately, 'Split' did not do this well. The runtime and pacing is probably one of the biggest issues, because a movie like this set over 117 minutes really needs to be handled by a master. I don't know much about this director, but he's no Kubrick. And although Kubrick could be self-indulgent (Eyes Wide Shut was a catastrophe), a film like The Shining runs for well over 2 hours, but the suspense and atmosphere carries it all the way. With Split, the film lulls and drags you really don't believe you're going to see this 'beast' they talk about till the very end, which is a big problem, because you're not on the edge of your seat. Perhaps sharper editing would help and personally I would've cut it down substantially, but that still wouldn't have made it a great movie.<br/><br/>McAvoy gives a decent performance, but I'm not about to overstate it. I saw a film called 'The Love Butcher' the other day and the almost unknown actor in that film also played many characters quite successfully. Lots of actors are capable of this and I'm sure many will cite McAvoy's performance as being a key element of the film, but for me it doesn't save the movie. If you want campy fun of this sort, check out John Lithgow in Brian De Palma's Raising Cain! Other acting in the film is absolutely fine, although you don't get to see two of the girls all that much. This again is another problem, because this sort of film really works best when you can put yourself in the place of the victim(s). It doesn't really dare you to do that, as it moves from place to place, but doesn't focus on their plight.<br/><br/>There's a huge plot hole something which one of the characters should have said near the end of the movie, but I won't elaborate, as I don't want to spoilt it. It's a glaring plot hole though! To conclude, it really does drag so much and I couldn't wait for it to end. It gets to the point where you know everything there is to know, but it won't stop. We're just treated to more 'performance' from McAvoy, but by this point, you won't care. I could recommend at least a dozen similar films without a second thought which are far better than this, so I honestly wouldn't waste your time. There were a few laughs along the way, but by the end of the film, you certainly won't be laughing. Overall, for me it's a 4/10."

","I guess the fact that I actually wanted to watch an M. Night Shyamalan movie (haven't done that since THE HAPPENING (2008)) and actually sat through the entire movie (losing interest while watching it) is an achievement by itself. Still, it was everything I expected from a Shyamalan movie and from watching the trailer. James McAvoy is too talented for this silly movie, which had a big potential in terms of plot, but it was reduced to the regular Shyamalan garbage. It starts well, but gets worse and worse until it reaches the awful silly ending.<br/><br/>BTW, although Anya Taylor-Joy is a main character, I think she has less lines of dialog than Arnie in the first TERMINATOR.<br/><br/>As always, Shyamalan has to give himself a silly cameo. And the last scene... oh, god, the cringe.<br/><br/>This film is only worth watching for James McAvoy."

","SPOILERS...<br/><br/>I found this movie to be shallow, unfocused and obviously uncomfortable as is its intention. M. Night Shyamalan's alleged return to glory isn't very glorious at all. It certainly is creepy but not in an entertaining way. When the last 30 seconds is the best part of the movie and it's only that way because it references a far better Shyamalan movie than the movie you just endured is a failure. Setting up a future shared Shyamalan universe is intriguing but it relegates this movie to nothing but an extended DVD extra setting up a supervillain for a better movie to come. Massive bonus points for McAvoy's performance. The split personality characters he embodies really are the only reason to endure this movie. It's acting class on a Masters level. <br/><br/>Everything else is sadistic, cruel and as entertaining as watching animals suffer."

She wasn't the target.<br/><br/>They just continue giving the movie away so blatantly, that it's almost maddening as a viewer. There are four different instances before the beast appears where the personalities literally say ""you are pure, nothing bad has ever happened in your life, I have a special night planned for you"", while they are unraveling Casey's rape story.<br/><br/>I mean, 30 minutes into the movie after the first clip with the Uncle, I was screaming at the screen saying ""Casey! Just tell McAvoy that you were raped and he will let you go!"".<br/><br/>And then all the way to the very freaking end even after he is screaming about his hatred for ""pure"" people who have never had a tough life, she STILL can't grasp that all she has to do is reveal her rape.

Well, not much apparently when you work your way through the obviously fake reviews with some being so brazen as to repeat the exact same review a previous fake profile had already submitted. The site is rampant with them! The same must be the case with the Metacritic scores where certain reviewers are obviously being paid off. How sad, really. The director also produced the film and I see it has grossed millions already. It's a great money making tactic.. you have money so you can put it into making a bad film, then invest more money in buying Metacritic scores and fake IMDb profiles to boost its ratings and create a hype around the film, ensuring enough people will see your film in order for you to turn a hefty profit. This experience has soured IMDb for me. It's a great source for creating your own lists and exploring films, but take the IMDb ratings, reviews and even the Metacritic scores with a grain of salt."
"Sober-Friend","1","51","123","25 April 2017"," M. Night Shyamalan Is still a one trick pony
","M. Night Shyamalan hit the big time with ""The Sixth Sense"" in 1999. His follow up films have been not just been huge disappoints but truly some of the worse films I had to sit through. ""Unbreakable"" was just stupid and so was ""Signs"" and ""The Village"". I did not even bother to watch ""The Lady in the Water"" and other celluloid manure he created. <br/><br/>So last night against my better judgment I saw ""Split"" which was just an exercise in patience. M. Night Shyamalan proves he likes to not only bore his audience but he also loves steel money from studios that still will back his films.<br/><br/>In this film M. Night Shyamalan had an interesting gem of an idea about a crazy man who kidnaps 3 girls. The Three teenagers, Claire, Marcia, and outsider Casey, are kidnapped and held captive by ""Dennis"", one of 23 personalities present in the mind of Kevin Wendell Crumb, a victim of childhood abuse diagnosed with identity disorder. <br/><br/>The film however fails to engage the audience. A few scenes work but they are out numbered by the scenes that don't. <br/><br/>The film of course has a ""Minor"" twist at the end but its more like a winks to the audience for fans of one of the directors other films. <br/><br/>A much better film that dealt with split personalities is ""Raising Cain"" and ""Sisters"". It least those films were done by craftsmen that knew how to engage an audience. <br/><br/>He still has lots of fan who will hate this review.

","I wasted two hours of my life on this movie. I was bored after the first hour, not to mention disappointed by the stigma mental illness received once again. Spoiler Alert: I thought it was irresponsible of the director/writer to have the main character make a statement about ""broken people are more pure"" after he notices cutting marks on one of his captives. With an epidemic of cutting by teenagers in our society, this remark was to say the least, troubling. As a therapist, I was appalled by Betty Buckley's character visiting her client at his home and then making the statement that ""her patients were her family"". If you're going to portray a therapist in a movie, that profession's code of conduct needs to be represented correctly. Parts of this movie were so unrealistic that I was unable to focus on the rest of the film. Another disappointment by M. Night Shyamalan."

"taylorhammons","3","44","106","28 January 2017"," M. Night has officially lost it.
","I don't know why I continue to expect greatness from this director. The Sixth Sense was phenomenal. Unbreakable and Signs were good. But after that, Shyamalan has let us down time and time again. The Visit was at least marginally better than anything we'd seen from him in years, so I came into Split expecting a comparable level of decency- something to further cement my theory that Shyamalan was making a comeback. Instead, I was met with a disjointed story that tried to draw unnecessary parallels between its heroes and villains. The two other girls seem important but turn out to be useless and dispensable. While McAvoy portrayed a convincing crazy person, his performance could not make up for the bad screen writing, nonsensical plot, and awful character development. To top it off, the ending made no sense and seemed it was supposed to be reminiscent of The Village. And, while the ending of The Village was stupid, the buildup was well timed and it was possible to see it coming. Split seemed to have failed in the one and only area where the Village succeeded- well timed plot twist. By the time Split got around to revealing the plot twist, we had stopped caring. It wasn't scary. It wasn't entertaining. It just didn't make sense."

","James Mcavoy does a great job at acting his part (the only saving grace here) but the plot of this was just wasn't strong enough to stand on it's own. It kind of felt like a Freshman in a high school drama class wrote this movie and it was it first attempt at a movie. There wasn't any great twist or surprise that you find yourself waiting on the entire movie. Everything was as it appeared and that made for a lot of disappointment. <br/><br/>The last 20 seconds of the movie did give me hope that if there's a sequel, it will be much better.

"serpent_coil","3","31","72","3 February 2017"," Could have been decent
","So Split is the latest movie from M. Night Shyamalan. Not having seen any of his movies since The Village nor being that familiar with the actors I didn't really have any expectations about this movie. <br/><br/>Anyway, Split is a classic kidnapping-thriller. Three girls are kidnapped by an unknown assailant with multiple personalities and spends the movie trying to escape. Along the way they uncover disturbing truths about their kidnapper. In a parallel story the kidnappers psychiatrist suspects something and starts investigating on her own. Hardly groundbreaking stuff, then again there are plenty of fantastic movies with unoriginal structures. <br/><br/>I was quite drawn in by the first half of the movie. The gradual reveal of the plot works fairly well. Sure, the dialogue was fairly wooden and there was little to no background on the main characters. The flashbacks that was supposed to breathe some life into the main character didn't really add much to the story or give much nuance to the character so much as being a pretty cheap plot device to tie the cheap ending together. For all it's flaws the first two thirds of the movie worked for me. The gradual reveal of the main antagonists personalities and motivation along with some decent acting from James McAvoy makes for just enough suspense to keep the viewer hooked. <br/><br/>Like so many other movies the end is where it all falls apart. There is a special place in hell for writers who incorporate supernatural elements where there is absolutely no need for them. This movie would probably have worked much better as a semi-realistic thriller. The foreshadowing of supernatural elements are vigorously shoved in the viewers face during the whole film but I didn't really suspect they would be so over the top. Subtlety doesn't so much get thrown out the window as shot in the chest with a shotgun. Not to mention the protagonists escape that is heavy handedly tied to the forced flashbacks that plague the film and makes the end both over the top and anti-climactic at the same time. Honorable mention goes to the cheap tie in to Unbreakable in the movies dying seconds that seems lifted from a superhero movie rather than a sort of serious thriller. <br/><br/>A seriously bad ending destroys what could have been a decent film."

"najafisaghar","3","32","75","8 February 2017"," Could have been good!
","What if at the end of the movie, when camera was closing in on Casey holding a gun in a cage, all torn out and looking horrified, we found out that the whole movie was nothing but a figment of her imagination, a trip to her psyche, to make for and come to terms with her childhood abuse? I was holding my breath and wishing for this ending, when I found out that the movie was actually for real. The loopholes in the plot and in theories of consciousness and identity startled me so much that I couldn't stop asking thinking Shyamalan, the director, did not ask for professional advice on such sensitive subjects. If the ending showed a twisted dark person as Casey was, then the movie could have been PERFECT, literally perfect. But it wasn't. it was an average movie trying to push its way to its desired ending through impossibilities and an imperfect logical reasoning. My question during the whole movie, was how such a plot could be based on ""what if there is something more to people with multi-dimensional personality that direct us to understanding what supernatural is"", what the psychologist, Ms. Dr. Fletcher told her colleague. Multi-dimensional personality is a possible psychological phenomenon but digesting the fact that 23 different people lived in one person, who was also conscious of this mental state which makes it more impossible to believe, was difficult personally. Another question was why did not the psychologist order the hospitalization of Kevin? Shouldn't such people be in mental hospitals taken care of? Other questions could be raised as to How could he live in a zoo without anyone noticing him commuting? Or Can a childhood issue, the one with Kevin and his mother, create such a 'beast'? or Can you be conscious of your multiple personality disorder and shift among characters once you decide? All these questions are left for the viewers to answer on their own. Instead, what Shyamalan could leave for the viewers to find out on the own could be a subtler, implied personality problems and mental fixations such as OCD; the latter one was so obvious in Kevin's behavior that the color yellow and his fixation on cleaning lost its sense. Another disappointing point was the director's desperate act for increasing the movie box office by showing ""unessential"" nudity and ""unjustified"" violence. On the contrary, James McAvoy, Kevin among 22 other names, performed greatly which causes you not to leave the movie hall in the middle of the movie. The supernatural aspect of movie can be interpreted as Freudian. McAvoy, I believe, has gone through three important Freudian phases; the supernatural part, as he turned into a beast was the 'id' part which I believed he has always been trying to go back to; his superego part was present in his meetings with Dr. Fletcher and due to his incompetency to keep with reality, his ego was represented into 23 different characters. This aspect can be further investigated by those interested in Freudian psychology; yet, I still hope that the beast at the end of the movie had been metaphorical."

"darkreignn","4","30","71","24 January 2017"," Not a bad film, but left me feeling cold
","""Split"" is a movie that will, no doubt, divide audiences. Advertised as a suspense thriller, what we get instead is a more nuanced and subtle film that touches on many uncomfortable topics in its first two acts, and then becomes clinically insane during its final third, but in the end left me unsatisfied. <br/><br/>First of all, how was my man James McAvoy? Really good. Each personality that he played felt distinct and completely different from the other. Some personalities were kind and sympathetic, while others were downright menacing and oozed filth. There were even scenes where (slight SPOILER) McAvoy was playing a personality pretending to be a different personality, and as a whole his performance was brilliant. I'll be buying this film on Blu-Ray for the sole purpose of watching his acting again, and also for Anya Taylor-Joy. Not only is she the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life (seriously Anya if you're reading this feel free to send me a private message because I am single) but she plays a character, Casey Cooke, that has a level of depth and characterization that is unheard in modern day thrillers. She isn't just a pretty face who makes the worst possible decisions known to man, as is the norm in horror movies. She is actually a fully fleshed out character who has a past that affects her present and the choices she makes. She makes decisions that only make sense when you go home and think about the things her character went through. Things she says or does may not make complete sense until you stop and think about her characterization, and I loved that about the film. In fact, even though I didn't enjoy this film very much, I really want to go and watch it again to pick up on all the little details about her character that I missed, and this just adds replay value to the film. Anyaoustly, sorry I mean honestly, she is truly mesmerizing and has a very hypnotic quality to her that adds to the surreal and fantasy-like tone of the film. <br/><br/>Also, the opening credits of this film were masterful. They teased a schizophrenic pace, maybe something akin to ""Inland Empire,"" and even thought that isn't exactly what we got, the opening credits were enthralling nevertheless. But with all these praises, what didn't I like about the film?<br/><br/>First off, it felt unnecessarily sexual at times. For example, (slight SPOILES in this here paragraph) one of McAvoy's personalities has extreme OCD and freaks out at the slightest hint of uncleanliness. So, when one of the girls that he kidnaps gets dust on her shirt, he makes her take it off and she spends the rest of the film in her bra. Similarly, another girl gets dust on her skirt, and if you can't guess what happens next, let me tell you: she is forced to strip off her skirt and for the majority of the movie she is seen in her underwear. Now I get it, I realize that this was meant to convey how much of a weirdo this personality is, but was it really necessary to have two females shown half naked in order to do this? The answer is no. It wasn't a necessity, and in my opinion it cheapened the experience. I didn't need to see two frightened girls forced to take their clothes off to know that this specific McAvoy personality was evil; I got that when he kidnapped the three girls in the beginning of the movie. It was just so uncomfortable (which was the goal, I know) and unnecessary, and it almost felt like, instead of wanting to contribute toward good characterization, M. Night just wanted an excuse to get these girls naked, and it overall took me out of the movie. <br/><br/>Another thing I didn't like about this film is that nothing feels resolved at the end, and as a whole the film feels unsatisfying and unhappy. Now, I don't need every film to have a happy ending, but when you have a likable and sympathetic character like Casey, a girl who goes through what is probably some of the most traumatic experiences anyone could ever go through, at least let her have a victory at the end. (SPOILERS) Instead, what we get is an ending where it is implied that Casey, after living in Hell since her early childhood, goes home to even more unspeakable atrocities. It's ""sad"", as in go home, curl into a ball, and cry for hours ""sad."" And maybe you'll like this ending, and that's fine, but for me, I didn't expect, or want, to feel suicidal walking home from the movie theatre. I'm not being funny either. I seriously felt dead on the inside for hours. And speaking of nothing being resolved at the end of this film, the ending (mild SPOILERS) of this movie is a blatant cliffhanger for a sequel that will tie up all the loose ends and complete the story. Look, I get it, sequels are popular, but if you're going to make a movie where the audience doesn't know there is going to be a sequel to, you better at least make it have a strong and satisfying conclusion, but in my opinion ""Split"" has neither. And this is irritating. A movie shouldn't have to rely on a sequel to be enjoyable, especially if the audience doesn't know it's going to be the first (or second) movie in a franchise. The story feels wide open at the end of the movie, which is so disappointing, as the trailer seemed to promise a tightly crafted story. <br/><br/>""Split"" is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. The acting, the directing, the production value, and the music are all great, and at times are truly masterful. However, the relentlessly bleak ending and unfinished feel of the film kept me from enjoying it."

","Sadly, the big weakness of this movie is James McAvoy. He's a good actor, but this movie tested -- and went beyond his skills. He looks like he's performing in ""Split"" -- even looking like he's in an acting class, projecting different personalities. It may be an odd comparison at first glance, but his many scenes can be compared to Brando in ""Apocalypse Now,"" with the focus directly on him and how he emotes. And McAvoy just comes up short. For me, he just didn't hold my interest.<br/><br/>And then there's the loose end of the one heroine. Very odd back story pertaining to her, that has no closure. Quite dissatisfying. Now, one may argue that her story is realistic, but that realism is incongruent with the main story. It's a side story that just doesn't fit.<br/><br/>Disappointed.<br/><br/>With all that being said, if you find McAvoy fun/intriguing to watch, you may love the movie. It relies almost completely on his performance.<br/><br/>!!BIG SPOILER!! As the story played out, and knowing that twists are Shyamalan are his signature move, I thought we'd see that the villain was a certain character's son from a previous Shyamalan film. But that was not the case."

"halseyad","5","21","48","21 January 2017"," The movie itself has a personality disorder...
","The movie is really two separate movies thrown together, with the first half being the traditional slasher film and the second being the riveting MNS thriller. <br/><br/>First 1/2- There are so many instances where you are screaming at the abducted girls to be more intelligent with their getaway. You will find yourself screaming.... A. ""Why have you not noticed the man sitting in the driver's seat of your family car is not apart of your family?"" B. ""Why do you react to slowly and calmly when you realize the previously stated even is taking place?"" C. ""Why does it take you almost a full minute to pick up your chair and hit the psycho in the head with it?"" D. ""Why do you hit him in the shoulder with the chair when common sense tells you to hit him square in the head?"" etc.<br/><br/>Also, there is this strange sexual nature that is mentioned about the killer that never gets fully discussed. The quasi rape scene at the beginning leads to the Dr. saying the killer has a thing for women dancing naked, but this is never really needed in the story. This psycho-sexual fantasy he has is never revealed to be his original traumatic event, his motive to his actions, or even mentioned after the first half of the movie. Other than being used to scare the pee out of younger women (immoral pun) who fear sexual assault in our overly-sexually western society, this aspect to the killers psyche is irrelevant to the plot of the story. <br/><br/>Second 1/2- This part of the film was great. Finding the uncomfortable line between reality and fantasy, MNS explores the possibility of superhuman capabilities that can be manifested through the mind when pushed to it's extreme limitations. Watching the movie, viewers find themselves wondering (alongside some of the characters) if there will be a supernatural manifestation. Very entertaining!<br/><br/>Final Thought: Skip the first half, and just know that three girls get abducted by a man with DID and the psychologist that sees the abductor is suspicious that the personality she is meeting with is not the identity being portrayed. Pay close attention to the second. It's good."
"Quinoa1984","6","22","51","27 January 2017"," The most entertaining BAD movie in years. It's certainly never boring, but...
","Split is a film that asks you to suspend your disbelief, and at first, even after the many films that this director has done where he goes way too far, I was with Split for about the first half of the way through, or maybe more. I knew logically this is not how DID works (Disassociative Identity Disorder), but hey, it's a movie, let's go with it. And to Shyamalan's credit, he casts the two major parts to the point where it's key and it works. And as a director, overall, and in large part thanks to the cinematographer behind It Follows, it's a film directed with real terror and suspense. It's low-budget, largely a 'bottle' film, and he uses his money with true style. It's paced well... where was I (now I feel like I got this disorder and will become two different critics here, gotta control...)<br/><br/>Oh, yeah, James McAvoy, he's fantastic. He may not be playing 23 personalities in total, but the ones that Shyamalan focuses on are developed enough - among them is Barry (a gay fashion designer that McAvoy sort of plays like a young Pacino or something, in the physicality), Dennis (the one who may seem to be in 'control' and is extremely OCD about any dirt) and Hedwig (who is nine years old, and you can tell) - give McAvoy enough room to explore these personalities. There's times of awkward laughter at first, but this gives way to seeing that McAvoy is so committed to these characters, and is pulling them all of with intensity and charm and disbelief and a madness that is kind of similar to them all, that he's impossible to dislike.<br/><br/>Another key player is Ana Taylor Joy, as she's the one of the three girls that we get to know the most (though with this we get into something of a, for me, forced motivation, but I'll get to that later), and she is on for all of these interactions with McAvoy. She's the one who can somehow speak to Hedwig sympathetically and connect with him, and when she is freaking out and trying to hold things inside, she does this perfectly. Between this and The VVitch she is really on a roll as a major actress for thrillers - she can play terrified, but being in control and being bad-ass works as well. And for a lot of the scenes the actress playing the psychiatrist, Betty Buckley, is believable, as far as she can take the lines to...<br/><br/>Okay, here's where we get into the DID here with this movie in reality, it's with its writer AND then also its director. I don't mean the same person, I mean they are separate entities. Shyamalan the director is on top of his game here, with a formal rigor that hasn't clicked this week in well over a decade (it may even connect to Unbreakable, which... oh, more on that at the end of this). Shyamalan the *writer* is something else. He's still someone who thinks he's oh, so, so clever, and you know what? For that first half or so, he kind of is. At least, again, when it comes to the suspension-of-disbelief factor. He does a more than competent job of giving us a believable enough set-up with these girls being held captive, Barry putting up his false front when emailing but then denying anything is wrong to the doctor, and then how the personalities have their splits with the girls and how they are trying (unsuccessfully to escape)... but then Shyamalan the writer gets greedy. Or insane. Or both.<br/><br/>The biggest problem here is that this man is CHEATING by the end of this, and in a way that is baffling. He can't have enough with having this somewhat preposterous thriller about a man juggling all these personalities that may lead up to ""The Beast"", the 24th personality. No, it needs to be deeper than that. It also needs to involve child molestation - not just with this man, but the Ana Taylor Joy character when she was younger - and that this, uh, maybe leads into having these super DID powers(!?) He's creating a whacked-out mythology where one needn't exist, and by the time the third act takes off, and you can mark it as soon as the Buckley character comes to Barry/Dennis/Hedwig/Patricia/Et-Al's basement dwelling, it fully goes into bananas territory.<br/><br/>I know, I know, it's a thriller, I know I should keep buying into what this is selling... but I just couldn't. Most of all (oh, hell, you got this far in this review) it's the gall to turn this around to make this as part of a, uh, Shyamalan Cinematic Universe with a Bruce Willis Unbreakable cameo that brings me into the 'you're cheating!' territory. Perhaps this is simply this man's M.O. as far as crafting his material, that he can see ahead and know that this is what he has to do, and that everything ties together... or he wrote himself into a corner, realized he was writing sheer insanity as far as where McAvoy goes in this final third, and had to cover up. Either way, it might work for you... or it may feel like him f***ing with all of us. At any rate, all of the material with The Beast has the sensation of Shyamalan as mad mainstream provocateur, like 'hey, how far can I actually take this stuff, you've come this far right, eh, right? RIGHT?!' <br/><br/>To his credit, this is a more enjoyable piece of madness than The Village, and its final third makes it something I want to revisit simply to show friends in a 'Look upon this wonder in awe' way like The Happening. I think among the Shyamalan *bad* movies, and this is bad make no mistake, it's directed like a pro and the actors are all on their game, and becomes the best of them."

The story is about a killer with multiple personalities and the best thing about it is James McAvoy who does a great job with a very difficult role. The rest of the cast aren't so impressive, and the script at times feels more than a little pretentious, but overall this is low key and impressive, building to some startling moments, and a definite step in the right direction for a one-time Hollywood great."

"ericrnolan","8","15","33","8 April 2017"," A short review of ""Split"" (2016)
","For much of its running length, I was considering writing a review for ""Split"" (2016) that rated it a perfect 10. (I am an unabashed fan of M. Night Shyamalan, no matter how reviled he is by other Internet commentators.) I love the way he frames his shots, I love his dialogue, I love his stories, and I love the strange way he can make a slowly paced film nevertheless absorbing.)<br/><br/>And ""Split"" looked nearly perfect. James McAvoy handed in a tour- de-force performance as Kevin, a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID). (Yes, I am aware of the clinical controversies connected with whether the disorder even exists — I was a psychology student many, many years ago. I think we should suspend whatever disbelief we have for the purposes of enjoying the movie.) McAvoy plays his role to perfection. His ""Dennis"" persona is particularly frightening, and ""Barry,"" one of the ""good personalities"" he portrays, is surprisingly endearing and sympathetic.<br/><br/>Playing off McAvoy wonderfully are Betty Buckley as his gentle psychiatrist and Anya Taylor-Joy as one of three teenaged girls kidnapped by his nastier personalities. The talented Taylor-Joy was also perfect in her role. (I last saw her 2015's ""The Witch"" and she was also in last year's ""Morgan;"" I'm gaining the impression that this promising young specializes in cerebral horror-thrillers.)<br/><br/>I would rate ""Split"" an 8 out of 10. It suffers a bit, I think, from two missteps toward the end. One, this taut psychological thriller takes an ill-advised turn into dark fantasy. I thought it was amazingly good as a thriller grounded only in the real world — it was far less so with the later jarring story elements. (I do realize why Shyamalan made this creative decision, and you will too, after watching it and then reading up on it.) But I still think that this would have been a perfect film if the majority of it focused on McAvoy's personalities either aiding or misleading his psychiatrist, with Taylor-Joy's fate hanging in the balance.<br/><br/>Two, this film seemed to suffer from the too-many-endings syndrome that people often associate with Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. We seem to have one denouement that works quite well, then a second that should have been re-shot and re-scripted. And then there's another plot strand finally addressed  but it is played so subtly that I'm not even sure I got it. And this isn't even counting the significance of the movie's final line, which works as a fantastic framing device.<br/><br/>About that line  if you're a Shyamalan fan, then you simply must watch the film until it's very end, as the camera pans through the coffee shop. You'll love it."

"collegedude-37028","5","21","50","27 January 2017"," Sadly Underwhelming and Disappointing
","Have you ever been captivated by a trailer and for months looked forward to the advertised film but then when you finally get to see it you are left underwhelmed and disappointed? Unfortunately, that's how I felt about Split, the newest ""thriller"" from director M. Night Shyamalan.I put the word thriller in quotes because I felt that it wasn't a thriller at all, but rather a drama with tense moments.<br/><br/>Split tells two stories rather than just one and I think that's what hurt the film the most. The first story we have is Kevin, played by the brilliant James McAvoy, who suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder. Kevin suffered a trauma in his past and his brain formed 23 different identities in order to protect itself and a new one is emerging on top of those. Out of the 24 total, we are only shown 8. The 8 that we do see are remarkably well-done and at times rather creepy. The other story we have is Casey, played by Anya Taylor-Joy, who is kidnapped along with her two friends Claire and Marcia and held in captivity by Kevin. We are shown plenty, if not too much, of Casey's past but very little of Kevin's. There's only one minor flashback that gives us a cryptic look at Kevin's childhood but we are given at least five flashbacks of Casey's life. Just to be clear, I'm glad we were shown what Casey's trauma was but I think it could have been approached better. We really didn't need scene after scene to show us that she was a victim. It would have been nice to see more of Kevin's backstory so that we could get a sense of why he is the way he is.<br/><br/>James McAvoy's performance was outstanding. It's hard enough to train yourself to embody one character for a role but to embody 8 is something not many can do. If there is a sequel, which I'm sure there will be, I look forward to seeing some of the other identities. Anya also gave an outstanding performance, perfectly displaying what it's like to carry a burden that you feel you can't share with anyone else, not even your closest friends.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I feel that the film could have been done better. It was decent, but it wasn't shocking or terrifying like the trailer claims. I will say that the ending is surprising; not a plot twist that so many have claimed it to be, but rather withheld information that has come to light in an intriguing way. I give Split 2 out of 4."
"GrahamCrawford2005","5","21","50","24 January 2017"," More evidence M Night Shyamalan has lost his way
","There seems to be an emerging narrative that he's back. Maybe because the budgets are smaller people now see M Night Shyamalan as some kind of underdog that we should be rooting for. And I do root for him because I think The Sixth Sense is a classic and Unbreakable, Signs and The Village had their moments. But a string of jaw-droppingly awful films - Lady in the Water, The Happening, The Last Airbender and After Earth – obliterated my confidence in him. Some reviewers hailed The Visit as a return to form, but despite a promising concept the idiotically implausible characterization of the boy, who literally can't move when he's afraid, killed it for me.<br/><br/>But that's Night. In nearly everything he does there is a critical plot point that is so contrived and ridiculous it takes me right out of the film and I can never get back in. It wouldn't be so bad if his tongue was in cheek and he had some fun with it. But it's always something banal presented in a profound, meaningful way as if it's some earth-shattering artistic insight. Add Split to the list.<br/><br/>The three central performances are strong. James McAvoy is wickedly convincing as the split-personality psychopath. Betty Buckley has quiet strength, dignity and great intelligence and compassion as his psychiatrist. Anya Taylor-Joy, so powerful in The Witch, pulls you in with her big soulful eyes and makes it impossible not to root for her. But I would argue that the only reason her two friends are taken hostage with her is as a pretext to film pretty girls in their underwear. They are completely superfluous, unless one buys the story's malarkey that the Beast personality needs to eat them to gain strength. (I didn't) Walling the girls off from each other early in the film is a waste. I was much more interested in how they might work together to outsmart their captor and escape.<br/><br/>Casey's (Taylor-Joy's) backstory told in flashbacks undercuts the suspense of the present-day storyline. (It's Night's overworked theme of everything, no matter how seemingly remote, eventually tying together.) It would have been far more interesting, and McAvoy's character much more sympathetic, if Casey had stumbled across him doing something incriminating and he had reluctantly taken her hostage and now doesn't know what to do. But of course that would have been a less sensational approach with less box office potential.<br/><br/>There are nods to The Village (sort of) and Unbreakable (big-time) at the end that are fun, but in the case of Unbreakable, make little sense when you think about it. Night longs for a fusion between the real, humdrum world and the supernatural that, while terrifying, forces us to confront our demons and gives life meaning and purpose. I'm down with that, but he pursues this artistic objective in such a repetitive, immature way it bores. He knows film school tricks and how to manipulate a camera (and sometimes an audience) but I'm always aware I'm watching a movie, I don't get lost in them. He tries too hard to impress and in so doing ties himself in narrative knots that he can only escape through clumsy magic-for-beginner tricks.<br/><br/>Split opened well at the box office on the strength of McAvoy's showy, ""Next Hannibal Lecter"" performance. And pretty girls in their underwear. But I would be willing to bet the next time Night is given a big budget he'll blow it. Because unlike truly great filmmakers, he just can't seem to think of anything original to say. But man, he keeps trying."

"jessica-f-10","4","13","29","11 May 2017"," They took this movie a step too far...
","I was excited when I heard that this movie was coming out. When watching the various trailers online, I started to piece together what was going to be portrayed in the film. I was very unhappy when I knew (had a cloudy picture of what was going to happen) how the movie was going to play out. To help support my view of this movie, I will tell those who read this a little bit about my future profession. I am currently a psychology graduate student. For many years now, I knew that I wanted to earn my PhD in psychology and I wanted to specialize in Dissociative Disorders. So with that being said, I have researched this disorder for many years now. I was really upset that this movie took such a great idea and/or story line and expanded it to what was produced. The idea that a person can turn themselves into a beast by simply switching alters... COME ON! In a real case of DID, the host (the individual who has the disorder) develops these alters as protective mechanisms. The main etiology of DID is childhood abuse. The movie got this one right. When an alter is in control (as per the movie: holds the light) the host loses time. That loss of time is a form of amnesia. This symptom of the disorder only came about in the last 25 minutes of the movie. Throughout the movie, I was easily picking out the flaws of how this disorder was being portrayed. This disorder already holds high controversy in both the scientific community and nonscientific community. And this movie portrayed the disorder incorrectly. Yes, I know this is just a movie but the idea/concept behind it is very real. If movies are to be based on real stories, illnesses, etc., the creators of the movie need to make sure their facts are straight. Also, I was hoping that the back story of Casey and her uncle would tie into the movie better. The only relation to the back story was that Casey was still ""pure"" therefore she was not 'food' for the beast. I was hoping that somehow, she would have figured out that like her, Kevin was abused and she would use her experience of abuse to relate to him so she could help/stop him. I gave the movie a 4 rating because I did like the acting itself. The two main characters did a great job in this movie (in my opinion)."

","Fairly early in the filmmaking career of M. Night Shyamalan, the Philadelphia-based writer and director suffered a terrible professional misfortune—three consecutive films he wrote, produced, and directed became enormous critical and commercial successes.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense in 1999, Unbreakable in 2000, and Signs in 2002—and to a lesser extent The Village in 2004—were mostly lauded by critics for their innovation and imagination, and were embraced an adopted by audiences, many of whom returned for repeat viewings. The Sixth Sense additionally spawned a catchphrase—""I see dead people""—still quoted as among the most familiar in motion picture history.<br/><br/>After those remarkable feats of box office legerdemain, critics began mentioning Shyamalan's name in the same exulted breath as Steven Spielberg—and worse, Alfred Hitchcock. Like Hitchcock, Shyamalan often included an unexpected, surprise twist in the plot at the end of his pictures, and also usually either played a small role or made a quick cameo appearance in his pictures. <br/><br/>Unfortunately for Shyamalan, after reaching such a rarefied cinematic stratosphere there was precisely one way to go. And from Lady in the Water in 2006 through the almost unwatchable After Earth in 2013, and 2015's The Visit, the filmmaker has been mostly descending into a maelstrom of pedestrian filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Shyamalan is trying to reverse his recent misfortunes: In his new picture, Split, released Friday by Universal Pictures, three teenage girls are kidnapped together by a man who reveals himself to be a disturbed individual indeed. The girls' abductor transports the girls to an undisclosed location and tosses them into what appears to be a damp medieval dungeon with cots and a spotless and well-appointed full bathroom.<br/><br/>Quickly revealed is that the kidnapper suffers from dissociative identity disorder, multiple personalities. And while each of the man's twenty-three separate personalities seem vaguely aware of each other, only one or two appear to be in charge. Those couple of personalities are prepared to give profane birth to an entirely new manifestation, one which promises unspeakably bad news for the three involuntary guests.<br/><br/>Split itself swiftly develops multiple personalities in the form of separate plots: It turns out the kidnapper, played by Scottish actor James McAvoy, has been in the psychiatric care of a renowned and well-heeled psychiatrist played by Betty Buckley, almost unrecognizable from her days as the mom on television's Eight is Enough.<br/><br/>The good doc has apparently been earning a pretty penny from papers and lectures about her star patient's multiple maladies. And while the patient has of late appeared fairly benign, the psychiatrist—unknowing of the kidnapping—senses something unsettling enough to begin sniffing around to learn what's cooking.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back in the dungeon, the three kidnapped girls continue to plot, mostly unsuccessfully, to escape their confinement. And eventually it's learned that one of the three girls—the quiet, unpopular high school outcast Casey—has been raised in the footsteps of her loving outdoors-man father, and knows a thing or two about hunting, stalking, and killing prey.<br/><br/>Mostly, Split is McAvoy's show, a real tour de force for the actor. It's sometimes forgotten that prior to the actor's recent steady gig as the young Professor Charles Xavier in the popular Marvel Comics X-Men series of pictures—three appearances and counting—as well as in plainly execrable garbage like 2015's Victor Frankenstein, McAvoy was once considered to be a talent of some promise, with performances in such acclaimed pictures as 2006's The Last King of Scotland in 2006 and Atonement in 2007.<br/><br/>Possibly the challenge of playing and individual with twenty-three distinct and different personalities was McAvoy's means of groping his way back to his original promise. Unfortunately, the actor seems to perform each individual manifestation with a knowing little smirk, an implied wink at the audience, which keeps the viewer constantly aware that this is a performance, a stunt, and is not believable or credible so much as it is mildly impressive as an acting school exercise.<br/><br/>The flip side of McAvoy's multiple characters is Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey, the kidnapped girl whose survivalist background—and whose own troubled childhood—might provide a key to escaping her confinement. Recently appearing in 2015's controversial and disturbing The Witch, Taylor-Joy contributes a performance which is competent but not particularly evocative—the audience is anxious for the character's situation more than for the character herself. Taylor-Joy with her wide-eyed, emotionless stare seems to be in a hypnotic trance most of the way through the picture's 117 minutes.<br/><br/>There's nothing really wrong with Split—the picture delivers enough suspense, chills, jumps, starts and surprises to justify the cost of admission, although it's also sometimes tough to comprehend how the picture escaped the MPAA's clutches with a PG-13 rating when the menace and the subject matter alone should've earned at least an R. One genuinely unsettling early scene in which the kidnapper terrorizes his hostages even strays briefly into NC-17 territory.<br/><br/>But thrills aside, the biggest casualty of Split is M. Night Shyamalan's reputation as an innovative filmmaker. Three plots running simultaneously is at least one plot too many. Subtract the survivalist plot and Split becomes a Classics Illustrated version of The Silence of the Lambs, a movie Split references endlessly anyway. Take away the psychiatrist's sleuthing and Split becomes last year's Don't Breathe, Ten Cloverfield Lane, or any of a number of the dozen or so other ubiquitous horror opuses which seem to open almost weekly Mostly, Split references Shyamalan's earlier successes—almost literally, thanks to a significant cameo and line of dialogue at the very end of the picture.<br/><br/>But Thomas Wolfe could've told Shyamalan—you can't go home again. Instead, Split suffers from the very mediocrity the director seems to want to emulate from lesser films but exceed in quality and surpass in effectiveness, a feat Hitchcock accomplished in 1960 with Psycho. Possibly Split would've been more successful in its ambition had it been guided by the steady hand of a Steven Spielberg <br/><br/>or an Alfred Hitchcock."
"emkay905","7","23","59","16 January 2017"," A return to form for Shyamalan
","It's been a rough few years, but M Night Shyamalan's latest film Split proved that this director still has it.<br/><br/>Firstly, James McAvoy's performance is the best part of this movie, his performance carried this film for me and kept me invested. McAvoy charms the audience with his brilliant (at times comedic) portray of the Hedwig personality, and does a good job making other personalities like Dennis, Ms Patricia and the beast frightening and creepy in their own ways. McAvoy does a good job separating the personalities from one another, making each seem like individual characters.<br/><br/>The other performances in this movie are also good, Anya Taylor-Joy played her character fairly well, especially during the more dramatic scenes, and i hope to see more dramatic work from her in the future. The other two girls did decent jobs but nothing really special about their performances. Betty Buckley's character was fairly well done as well.<br/><br/>Although this is a fairly well made film, i did have a few errors with pacing, the flashback scenes felt very shoehorned in and confusing at first. Shyamalan's camera-work and writing also seemed to be a bit messy at times, mainly during the first act of the movie, but was fine for the majority of the movie.<br/><br/>However, although this isn't a perfect film, it's definitely worth a watch, and it's a good sign for Mr Shyamalan's career. Fans of his earlier work will hopefully appreciate this film like i did, especially the obligatory plot twist. :)"

From then on, neither kidnapper or the victims invoke terror in us. <br/><br/>The girls were terrible actors. The villain is also almost comical. It's like watching impression comedy marathon.

","Movie fans has spent too many years now with Shyamalan bashing, why they are tired of it (and themselves). They found a glimpse of light in ""The Visit"", which indeed was a big step up compared to his recent movies, but it was still a mediocre and not very memorable thriller comedy. The reviews, however, often made it sound like a minor masterpiece.<br/><br/>This movie is also a step up, but not at all the fantastic comeback everybody hail it to be. ""Split"" would fare better without the twist, which appeal to fans of one of his first movies, but really is awkwardly inserted. Or, it would fare much better if the twist WAS inserted in a skilled and seamless way. Now it is a surprising bullshit ending -- everything leading up to it is muddled, too convoluted and hidden among details which have nothing to do with the twist. The plot you get in this movie is far away from the clear and distinct structure and storytelling in Shyamalan's first movies like ""Seventh Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"".

","M. Night Shyamalan is a director trying to find his way back into the consciousness of the movie-going audience.<br/><br/>Split which is written and directed by Shyamalan seems like a movie that is trying to win you over without doing very much.<br/><br/>The actors in this movie are great. Anya Taylor-Joy, Jessica Sula, and Haley Lu Richardson are all exceptional actors who delivered fine performances here.<br/><br/>James McAvoy is the star of this show and his performance is the make or break of this movie's soul. How can an actor handle and portray so many characters simultaneously? Every character that McAvoy portrays here is brilliant. I can say that McAvoy pretty much steals the entire show with his performances.<br/><br/>Split likes to play on situations. What would you do if someone attacked you? The movie illustrates that you have no idea what you would do if a life or death situation arose. I found myself yelling at the screen during certain moments because of the idiotic decisions I thought the three main characters were making. However, no matter how idiotic I thought their decisions were, I know that everybody's different, and nobody would handle every situation the exact same way.<br/><br/>Split plays out like a puzzle builder; You constantly get small pieces of the puzzle as the movie progresses, but you don't get a clear image as to what you're looking at yet. The movie feels obligatory once all of the pieces are in place.<br/><br/>The music and the directing here is great.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this movie for the most part, but it felt obligatory once everything was said and done. I know what this movie ties into and I won't spoil it, but the final scene truly establishes the rest of the movie. However, that little piece of information doesn't excuse this movie's obligatory nature. I'm stuck in the middle with M.

An interesting thing is that people with multiple personalities were able to change their body chemistry. Only one of the personalities needed to take shots, and the strength varied with each personality.<br/><br/>The three girls are captured and put in his dungeon like thing. They are constantly trying to think of ways to escape, while the guy is worried about keeping them there and going to his therapy sessions. His therapist is fascinated with how they can change their body chemistry and she wants to keep an eye on him.<br/><br/>It sounds so interesting! Then, where did it all go wrong?<br/><br/>The characters. The girls are dumb and make many mistakes. They should have teamed up to jump him, but they never think of that. They find a secret way out, only for him to capture the girl that got out and separate her and boarding up the exit. The black girl, or mixed, hit him with a chair and tried to escape only to be captured and separated. Now they are all split up and can't plan together because they didn't work together.<br/><br/>The main girl, Kasey/Casey/whatever, ended up tricking his 9 year old personality and called the front desk. She told the guy that she was kidnapped with her friends and the guy though it was a prank. Really? Who would prank someone like that? Also, shouldn't you check just in case it isn't a prank?The main Kasey girl finds a screw and gets out one room that way, but she's in another room that's locked. Kevin's (the main guy) therapist notices something is up and meets up with him. She meets up and excuses herself to use the restroom. She checks a room and sees a kidnapped girl there. Instead of calling the police, she stares in shock and it's enough for Keven to knock her out and put her on the couch. What a failure! <br/><br/>The blond one gets inspiration and looks around the room for something to get them out. Shouldn't y'all have done that before? Anyway, the black girl finds a hanger and tries to unlock it from the outside instead of picking the lock. Why? Anyway, Kasey is trying to contact the outside world with his computer, but the internet doesn't work. She watches videos of his different personalities for no reason what so ever. She eventually gets something heavy and starts trying to break the door down. Wouldn't it be better to look for keys or something to pick the lock? Kevin, the main guy, is on a train when he activates the 24th personality, the beast. The beast is super fast and super strong and spells trouble. <br/><br/>We go back to the girls and the black girl got the actual lock to the other side and she seems successful, but the beast is already back! The old lady gets back up, but her glasses are gone and she can't see. The best breaks her bones and goes to look for the other girls. Kasey gets the idea to remove the hat and we see the keys are there. Are you kidding me?! She unlocks the door and sees that the lady has been killed and her friends have been eaten. She says the guys full name, and he reverts back for a second, and she finds out that he has a shotgun. Her and the beast face off until the beast realizes that, like him, she has been abused as a child. He leaves her alone and the people rescue her. She gets picked up the the people and we see the guy she called, a black guy, make a face like, ""Oh crap! My bad!"" Yeah idiot, you got three people killed! I hope you're happy with yourself. The girl is to be picked up by her abusive uncle and it ends.<br/><br/>This was the most infuriating movie. The black guy could have sent help as soon as he got the call, but he didn't. Now three people died and all he could do was make a ""Oh crap! My bad!"" face. The therapist should have called the police as soon as she saw the girl, but she just stood there.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","11","25","27 April 2017"," Shyamalan is figuring out how to overcome his flaws and still do his thing
","Few filmmakers have faced the scrutiny M. Night Shyamalan has endured in the nearly 20 years since ""The Sixth Sense"" became a global phenomenon and launched his memorable name into the spotlight. With each progressive film, it seemed Shyamalan drew more and more ire for his twist-focused approach to horror and by the late 2000s, nearly all his projects were panned. With ""Split,"" he appears to be on the rebound.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's upswing actually began with a nice reception for 2015's ""The Visit,"" a return to horror after a foray into sci fi/fantasy (to no avail). ""Split"" builds on that momentum as a psychological thriller that walks a fine line between expert cinematic tension and unabashed lunacy. The film contains both that which has, at times, garnered Shyamalan much praise, and also that which has been the source of much derision. <br/><br/>Creating a horror thriller based on an actual psychological condition – Dissociative Identity Disorder – immediately positions ""Split"" in dicey territory. It could quickly come across as exploiting a serious issue for the sake of entertainment. Shyamalan works around this as best he can by naming DID and devoting exposition to it in the form of Betty Buckley's character Dr. Karen Fletcher, the foremost expert on DID and a therapist with a longstanding relationship with Kevin (James McAvoy), who has 23 distinct personalities. <br/><br/>Part of the mystery is that Fletcher senses something is off, that Kevin is hiding something. She is part of the story, not just a way for us to understand it. From a social responsibility perspective, this is a better approach than the 2003 film ""Identity,"" which was more exploitative of DID.<br/><br/>Of course Kevin is hiding something, as in the film's opening, he kidnaps three teenage girls: Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy). Casey, the outsider of the three girls, draws on memories from her troubled past to try and understand her unusual captor.<br/><br/>Everything hinges on believing McAvoy's performance and the script's ability to set him up to be believed. Both flirt with disaster, like at any moment we might laugh at the entire production, but we end up buying it. McAvoy really commits to Kevin's many personalities, which Shyamalan wisely limits to a handful. There's a logic and sense of purpose behind which ones show up at which times. McAvoy owns them to the point that we actually see them as different characters when they're on screen.<br/><br/>Yet it's the mystery of Kevin's intent and what he might be capable of that keeps things tense throughout most of the film, a tension that shifts from mystery-driven to horror-driven in the final act. At this point, ""Split"" becomes a much stranger movie and we're surprised at just where and how far Shyamalan will go. <br/><br/>In narrative and thematic respects, however, ""Split"" doesn't quite pay off for all that it builds up. Piece by piece we get to know a lot about Cassie, for example, and enter her psychology, but her role in the story doesn't contribute anything revelatory. She's merely a more traditional protagonist to root for, another troubled mind to understand. The biggest ""twist"" is actually tied to this weaker component, and it kind of flies in the face of everything else that's happening in the movie tonally. Not enough to derail it, but enough to remind you of Shyamalan's challenges as a writer.<br/><br/>Even worse for the film's tone, a post-credits revelation that Shyamalan throws into the movie has a souring effect on its ending. It seems entirely unnecessary and makes Shyamalan come off as self- aggrandizing – but that's about all that can be said spoiler-free. Ultimately, here's a filmmaker who is figuring out how to deliver the best version of the films he wants to make and he's getting closer.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","I went to see this movie with fairly high expectations (something I try not to do). But even then, I walked away very satisfied. Shyamalan's recent movies may not have been the biggest hits, but Split is his step back into the spotlight. And this is largely due to James McAvoy's performance(s). Preparing for one role is hard enough, but he manages to not only tackle multiple ones, but switch from one to the other in an instant. Anya Taylor-Joy also does a great job as the lead actress, and I admit my expectations for her were high after watching The Witch. But if none of that convinces you, at least watch it for the multiple twists that Shyamalan pulls throughout. I thought Split was a great movie and I definitely recommend it to anyone who may be interested in seeing it."
"ferbs54","7","5","9","5 June 2018"," A Dude With TOO Much Personality....
","Over the years, there have been any number of films that have dealt with lead characters who suffer with what the layman might term ""split personality."" Putting aside all the many iterations of the Jekyll & Hyde story, in 1957, audiences were given both ""Lizzie,"" in which Eleanor Parker played a woman with three distinct personalities, and, five months later, the more well-known ""The Three Faces of Eve,"" in which Joanne Woodward played a woman with the exact same predicament. In 1960, theatergoers were shocked out of their showers via their introduction to Tony Perkins' Norman Bates, a young man who was also his own mother, in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" The situation was played for laughs in 1963's ""The Nutty Professor,"" with Jerry Lewis portraying the hapless Prof. Julius Kelp AND his alter ego, the Dean Martin-like Buddy Love. But you would have to take all the preceding alter egos, and perhaps toss in later films such as 1992's ""Raising Cain"" (in which John Lithgow sported three personalities) and 2007's ""Sybil"" (in which the titular character, played by Tammy Blanchard, possessed no fewer than 16!), to exceed the number of disparate types to be found living inside one person, in M. Night Shyamalan's most recent offering, 2017's ""Split."" <br/><br/> The film introduces us to a most unusual character...or should I say, ""horde"" of characters (no wonder the news media later refers to this personage as ""The Horde""!). He is Kevin Wendell Crumb--brought to remarkable life by the Scottish actor James McAvoy--a Philadelphia native (as have been so many of the director/writer's previous lead characters) who suffers with the condition known as DID: dissociative identity disorder. As a matter of fact, his psychologist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), has identified no fewer than 23 (!) personalities residing inside his noggin, each waiting patiently in his or her ""chair"" for a chance to step forward ""into the light."" (And if this setup strikes some as being a bit improbable, I might add here that the real-life Eve evinced a full 22 personalities, and required a good 17 years of psychotherapy as a consequence!) Somehow, Crumb has managed to live a fairly low-key life in modern society, even managing to hold down a job as a dress designer, thanks to the talents of one of his many personae, Barry. But following a prank of a sexual nature perpetrated on him by a group of randy schoolgirls, Kevin snaps, and is soon seen kidnapping three young women in the parking lot of the King of Prussia Mall. Those three women--Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy)--are incarcerated in some kind of underground bunker, while their captor intimidates them as successive personalities of his step into the light. Thus, we get to see McAvoy essay a good half dozen of Kevin's 23 inner personae; for example, the 9-year-old Hedwig, the dressy Patricia, and the unflappably in-command Dennis. But Dr. Buckley grows increasingly concerned with her patient, when Dennis/Barry informs her that a 24th personality, which he terms ""The Beast,"" is soon to emerge. And since the good doctor knows that each of Kevin's personalities can effectively transform his body chemistry as it enters the light, there is every reason for concern...especially since this Beast is said to be extremely large, very fast, very powerful, able to climb walls (!) and, as it turns out, somewhat cannibalistic as regards dietary requirements....<br/><br/> ""Split"" was produced on a budget of a mere $9 million and proved to be a box office smash, bringing in around $280 million all told. And there was very good reason for this. The film is a remarkably suspenseful affair, and every attempt that our trio of young prisoners makes to escape from their cell is a nerve-racking one. The three young actresses on display here are all terrific, especially Taylor-Joy. Her Casey character is both beautiful and interesting, and the director shows us her history in flashbacks that allow us to see why she is so well suited to survive in this horrendous situation (her father had trained her in outdoor shooting and survival skills), and why she is the introverted young lady that she is today (a bit of sexual molestation on the part of a skeevy uncle would do that for anyone!). The film makes good use of its autumnal scenery--Philly and its surroundings have never looked more gorgeous--and Shyamalan's script is a clever one. But best of all is McAvoy, whose sextuple performance is practically Oscar worthy. Not since Alex Guinness in 1949's ""Kind Hearts and Coronets,"" in which the beloved British actor essayed no fewer than nine distinct roles, and perhaps Peter Sellers in 1964's ""Dr. Strangelove,"" in which the actor gave the world three entirely different and truly memorable characters, has a performer attempted such a feat, AND brought it off as successfully. And for those who are wondering if Shyamalan once again pulls the rug out from beneath his audience's expectations with one of his patented surprise endings, the answer is a decided ""yes""; an ending that sets the viewer up for a sequel that also ties into another of the director's previous films. I don't think I'm giving anything away here at this late date by saying that this sequel is to be entitled ""Glass,"" and that it will be coming out in January 2019. Personally, it is a film for which I cannot wait...."
"moonspinner55","5","18","46","27 January 2017"," ""The broken are the more evolved.""
","A return to the tried and true: M. Night Shyamalan's ""Split"", which he wrote and directed (both rather clinically), opens with a distinct ""Silence of the Lambs"" vibe before eventually evolving into a continuation of themes Shyamalan used for his ""Unbreakable"". Three teenage girls in Philadelphia are abducted from a parking lot by a man with dissociative identity disorder; he harbors dozens of personalities--male, female and child--but the final one to present itself is calling for an alliance of ""the horde"", and may represent something superhuman. While the opening scenes do have a familiar ring, they are well-executed by the filmmaker, who gives the audience what its probably hoping for; but Shyamalan, to his credit (although some genre buffs might not be so generous), is aiming for something loftier than imprisoned girls attempting to escape from a psychotic. The film offers a dissertation on DID via the captor's somewhat-unwitting psychiatrist, who--via Skype!--gives a clinical rundown of the mental disorder to her colleagues (including case studies). None of this information, however interesting, is utilized in the final stretch, as Shyamalan is out to baffle us with a plot-twist that is both confounding and amusing. While ""Split"" is creepy on occasion, it isn't effective as a scary thriller. Maybe Shyamalan feels he's above giving his audience a shock, a jolt, but sometimes a few good clichés are better than a round-table discussion. ** from ****"

Three young women are kidnapped and held captive by a man suffering with his agonizing 23 different personalities that may even hint toward a 24th.

The setting of the story is totally creepy and perfectly fit for the character and the tale that is told, the soundtrack is carefully chosen to masterfully accompany the gloomy, sick atmosphere, and what about the story itself? It has a few minor flaws, but it works more than fine, and reading other reviews I notice that many didn't get important details. <br/><br/>Casey's flashbacks, which many have deemed useless to the story, are instead a key element in the lunatic's final attitude towards her, and his seemingly unrealistic transformation (the most impressive one, I'm not going to say more in order not to spoil anything) is justified many times in the course of the movie by the description of how different personalities in one single person can have each their own physical peculiarities (such as illnesses etc.) which the others have not. Sure, the transformation itself a bit exaggerated, but the sense remains the same. And anyway, hey, it's a movie! You're expected to apply a certain amount of suspension of disbelief. Otherwise, just watch documentaries.<br/><br/>As in just any horror/thriller movie, there's a few ""I-have-to-act- stupid-in-order-to-keep-the-movie-going"" moments, but those are to be expected, and don't take anything away from the enjoyment anyway.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very good movie in my opinion.

We can relate- the situation would leave anyone in a panic.<br/><br/>Then it becomes a bit predictable when the girls try to escape several times. I mean, this is what we want right?<br/><br/>Betty Buckley's dialog becomes a bit tedious at times and I rolled my eyes at the psychobabble. We've all heard it. <br/><br/>Then we work through some suspense and finally make it to the ending and........THAT is where the big disappointment hits us. It's not only a letdown and completely unbelievable but then, there is an addition that just makes no sense whatsoever even after it has been explained to me.

","The review says that this film is a psychological horror - thriller film, however it's just a psychological thriller. On the plot the main character, a man with 23 different personalities, kidnapped three girls and kept them in an underground room for some time. I can't understand why he couldn't had kidnapped them at the end? Why did he kept them there for so long? I think, that the screenwriter wanted us to believe that it is horror, but he was wrong (It's horror just because we were worried about girls?) However, the plot of this film is very interesting. It keeps you in suspense all the time. But the most important thing is the acting. Actor James McAvoy surpassed all my expectations. He managed to play the role of Kevin, with 23 different personalities inside. Although all personalities weren't shown, we saw about six of them, in my opinion, it didn't affect the quality of the film. The transition from one person on another, James McAvoy made great! I really enjoyed this film."
"mariekeloverr","5","15","39","21 January 2017"," Freakshow from 'Split' will not surprise you.
","Even though I have no regrets watching this movie, I found it - to put it bluntly- well, 'meh.' That being said, I don't mean to discredit McAvoy for his role as Kevin and the few other personalities. It is absolutely worth mentioning that he delivered each character very well. Unfortunately, McAvoys outstanding deliverance is probably the best thing, this movie has to offer. The films misses at many points, that it left me wondering what it actually wanted from us.<br/><br/>Except from Kevin and the 7 out of 23 personalities you are REALLY about to see, the other characters faded to the background. Casey (Taylor-Joy) and Dr. Fletcher (Buckley), the two other main roles of the movie, left a bit... uninteresting? While Casey has a backstory, that added hardly anything to the main situation, Dr. Fletcher maintains a weird relationship with her patient to discover Kevins extraordinary abilities, which remain undiscovered at the end of the movie. I wish the writers focused more on the different personalities and how the girls interacted with those. How Casey, for example, is able to deal with them differently, because of the information in the backstory (her past remained in this case unnecessary, in my opinion). Instead, Kevins disorder is turned into the freak-factor of this movie. His illness is disturbing, but not really shocking. It could have been much more.<br/><br/>'Split' is an average horror-thriller movie, which does not belong to Shyamalans worst work, or his best. The plot is very predictable and won't leave you surprised. Still, it is not a bad movie and worth to watch, because of the great acting jobs of McAvoy, Taylor-Joy and Buckley."

","The movie wasn't bad, per se. If it was just a movie directed by Average Joe and if the bad guy wasn't superhuman it would probably have been a fine movie. This movie is highly regarded, and I know at least part of my less glowing viewpoint is my expectations.<br/><br/>1. M. Night Shyamalan. For some reason I keep expecting amazing things from him. Partially because of The Sixth Sense, and partially because I like the topics he writes about. The Sixth Sense was amazing. I enjoyed Unbreakable a lot more than I probably should have, because of its theme. I think it probably is not nearly as good as I believe it to be. Signs. A very popular film, which made no sense. I read an interview where Shyamalan belittles the reporter for not reading between the lines with Signs, and for taking it at face value. Well, ""M"", if you had written it better perhaps people wouldn't be confused about what was going on. I have not watched it again since reading the article, so it may improve my opinion of the movie -- it would almost have to. The Village. This movie was awful. dreadful. unwatchable. Please, do not watch this movie. <br/><br/>2. Twists. I expect twists from all his movies. This may not be fair, although apparently they all have twists, they are just often so obscure no one notices them. Apparently Signs had a twist. I will have to watch again to see if it really is. The Village had a twist, although I knew what it was after a mere 4 minutes, which made the rest of the movie hard to watch. I kept hoping I would be wrong and something interesting would be going on. But that was not the case. Split may have had two twists. 1. The main character is a ""cutter"". That's not much of a twist, and the word on the street is that wasn't the main twist. The main twist was the last scene setting up an Unbreakable/Split sequel. Twist. That's not actually a twist... that's just a thing that happened. <br/><br/>The movies was entertaining and suspenseful. The characters were interesting. But ""The Horde's"" metamorphosis is a little much to handle. And most everyone being killed was a little more sad than it needed to be. Perhaps I misunderstood what was going on, for which I expecting a condescending note from Shyamalan, but did they send the main character back to an abusive relationship with her uncle at the end? Did that really happen? Did she go from one monster to another? That is a hideous ending. Did I get that right? I hope not, but that what it seemed like."

First of all, I think that in order to get the idea, you need to know a little about dissociative identity disorder a.k.a multiple personality disorder. I don't really see why this is classified as a horror movie and maybe that led to all these shitty reviews. Split is a psychological drama with a little touch of sci-fi. A lot of people mentioned the fact that those girls could have easily escaped.. but really, dude? If that's the only thing that makes you think in this movie, you are just the wrong audience. Now I have to brought up McVoy. The way he shifts from one identity to another is the best thing I have seen these days. This movie would still be slaying the genre with just McVoy in it. To sum-up, if you are interested in criminal psychology, MPD and these kind of stuff, you will be loving this.

A victim of a terrific central premise, it demonstrates signs of delivering the potential and promise teased in the first act alone - but it eventually becomes too unfocused and complex for the sake of doing so. If we stuck with the idea of Casey attempting to talk to each of the identities, uncovering their flaws and exploiting their weaknesses, it would perhaps be a far superior horror-thriller, one fuelled by a smartness and sophistication; instead, it's rather run of the mill, ludicrous and frustrating popcorn flick that botches its climax with an uncomfortable development and shoehorned twist. It becomes a little laughable and that is the one place you never want to strand your horror film.

I've never written an IMDb review before but am doing so now mostly as a protest to those who are not giving this movie the credit it deserves. I'm a Psychotherapist, so I think I have a little credibility to speak to the psychological component of the plot. Yes, DID is controversial (I personally don't believe in it) but the movie's portrayal absolutely fits with some accounts of the disorder. The information shared is right in accordance with true-to-life *supposed* cases of it. Of course, this is entertainment and not a case study, so Shyamalan certainly took some liberties with how he chose to depict DID. I will not say anymore about the story because I think the less you know going into it, the better. But I will say my husband and I both loved it. It was intense and terrifying. The plot is interesting, the story is well executed, and the cinematography superb. The acting is what made the movie.

He turned 29 the day The Sixth Sense opened in 1999. ""It was weird, but I got to do the cycle of fame early: 'I'm great, I'm an idiot, I'm a success, I'm a failure...I got to experience all that and then say, 'Let's just concentrate on making movies.'""

The subplot of the girl captives trying to escape is nothing new, especially in an era of 10 Cloverfield Lane, Room, Green Room, Saw films etc. The therapy sections are extremely clichéd and dull, the old woman therapist badly underwritten. These scenes could have been so much more interesting. <br/><br/>By the end, Shyamalan's immaturity as a filmmaker once again rears its ugly head, both trying to shoe-horn in some heavy themes (sexual abuse, self-harming) without any sensitivity or real emotional awareness, and also swerving the film firmly into absurd comic book territory. By this point its clear he didn't have a firm idea of the story he wanted to tell or why, just another gimmick that made itself up as it went, meandering all over the place. <br/><br/>Basically, don't expect anything ""great"".

"the_other_kinsey_institute","6","3","5","25 November 2018"," Flawed, but great showing by McAvoy
","First off, McAvoy does an absolutely amazing job dealing with the multiple personalities. I mean, just fantastic work. Shame we are told there are 23, then only shown 8, but that's not his fault. Watch it just to bask in McAvoy's craft. Well, that and his hot body. (I am only human.)
The problem-one of them anyway-is that the plot seems less about telling a story and more about setting up some other story. I like to refer to this as ""Back to the Future 2"" syndrome. This movie seems to exist solely as a segue between Unbreakable and the upcoming Glass. Even before I saw the end of the movie with Willis's cameo, as the movie was obviously wrapping up, I was asking ""is that it?"" I certainly don't expect all the loose ends wrapped up in the end, but can we get any explanation? Any at all? The plot has set up these really intriguing characters then done relatively little with them. No sense of closure at all.
Problem two: the poster and tag line give away the big twist. He has 23 personalities and a 24th is coming. With Shyamalan's reputation for twist endings, the lack of a twist here seems... well... lazy? I don't know. Maybe I am being overly critical of Shyamalan, and he's trying to turn over a new leaf and stop us consumers from expecting it. Of course, if you don't have your gimmicky ""twist"" ending, what are you left with? Characterization but very little plot. Literally, you can sum up the plot in two sentences: teen girls kidnapped by man with multiple personalities; the girl with the messed-up past survives. I stand corrected. One sentence.
Problem three: believability. Every story and film requires a certain level of suspending disbelief, and this film really tested my limits. I mean, the doctor knows she can stop him-she even writes a letter to no one in particular explaining this-but then doesn't stop him as he's killing her? Also, I'm no expert on DID, but I am pretty sure it doesn't work that way. The whole point of dissociative identities is they... wait for it... dissociate. They do not share memories or talk to each other. That's why, among professionals who think it exists (there's a lot of debate), it is seen as a way to cope with trauma. It is supposed to be locking memories away in a different personality so the rest can go on living. I thought we were past this Hollywooded-up version of mental illness. I guess not."
"samuelding85","5","22","67","17 December 2016"," Split Personality, Confused Identity
","After exploring the lives of the boy who sees ghosts and the man who survived several man-made accidents, director M Night Shyamalan creates a thriller based on a person suffering from Disoriented Identity Disorder (DID). SPLIT was born under this idea, which aims to gives the audience a good understanding about DID, but ends up leaving the theater feeling confused. <br/><br/>Three teenage girls – Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), Claire (Haley Lu-Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) were abducted by Kevin (James McAvoy) at a car park. Locked in an unknown underground cellar, the three girls discovered that they were greeted by Kevin in different forms under different names: Kevin dressed up and acts like a straight man, a woman, a child and a gay guy. The girls soon discovers that Kevin is suffering from DID, which he lives with 23 personalities. Meanwhile, Dr Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley) is seeing Barry (one of the personalities under Kevin), a young artist who claims that he is suffering from some personality disorder. While Dr Fletcher is trying to prove that a person suffering from DID have the ability to change their physiology, the three girls are using his various personalities to rescue themselves, before Kevin's 24th personality comes after them. <br/><br/>As the title suggests, SPLIT was interpreted as someone with DID is living with split personalities. Though it was understood that McAvoy's Kevin was living with 23 personalities, only 8 personalities were seen in the entire film. With 8 personalities on display, this is not only challenging to McAvoy in terms of interpreting the respective personalities, it is also challenging for the audience to digest and understand the reason behind the distorted personalities. Audience were treated to McAvoy's interpretation on the different personalities he is living in, and how his respective personalities interact with his victims. However, this has starts to bore the audience, which some will find it time consuming and lack of interest, since everyone has more or less expected what will happens next. <br/><br/>The first five minutes of the movie gets straight to the point directly, showing how the girls were abducted without any reasons. While audience were expecting to see how the girls are finding their ways to escape from their abductors, Shyamalan works differently compared to other movies which talks about how victims find their way to escape from their abductors. Audience were given an exploration on the lives of Kevin through his counseling appointment with Dr Fletcher, which was intervene with Casey's childhood experiences. The only link that brought Casey's childhood into the movie was towards the last ten minutes, showing how is she escaping from Kevin's 24th personality. With the overall presentation not shown in sequence, it is easy to make the audience feeling confused and distorted. <br/><br/>McAvoy's portrayal of Kevin lives under different names through his different personalities. While it was mentioned in the synopsis that Kevin is suffering from DID and lives with 23 personalities, only 8 different types of personalities were showcased in the film. From playing a straight man, a lonely man, a woman, a child to a beast, McAvoy's performance was the only reason that kept the story from going on. Anya Taylor-Joy's performance of Casey is more of a compliment to the story. Her wit not only helps her to understand Kevin, but also serves as a way of saving herself in the times of danger. Somehow, the intervention of Casey's childhood trauma fails to compliment the story well, which overall it drags the duration of the film. <br/><br/>To sum up, SPLIT has a hard time to identify its identity, which the movie is rather confusing. While McAvoy's performance saves the day and Taylor-Joy gets more screen time, this is another movie which Shyamalan is having a hard time to connect with his audience and fans."

","When three girls are kidnapped by a man (James McAvoy) with 24 different personalities they have work out which of those personalities will help them escape and which of those personalities will will try to stop them. Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), a teen with a troubled past, seems to be the only one who might just actually be able to understand and communicate with the madman.<br/><br/>With a premise so wild and fascinating it is hard not to be hooked when you go into the theater. Coming out I can't help but call myself disappointed in a film that has as much potential as wasted one, thrown away in a structure that can't keep focus of what it's doing.<br/><br/>Even with that, there is still quite something to be appreciated here. Firstly, it is hard not to be wowed by Shyamalan's mastery in technique. He clearly demonstrates being comfortable in the medium and plays with the audience in several different ways. From the little touches in insert shots to the big, big set-piece shots he always adds something special and uncanny to them. Be it twenty three different toothbrushes or a single closing shot on a lock, his images have something to really sink in and love about them and he is a master in the use of focus to build tension or character conflict.<br/><br/>Then McAvoy as always is in solid acting territory and gives an intense performance, you can see the work he put into this oozing from the screen. The way he switches from a personality to the other is brilliant, you see a change in his face and posture and it makes it incredibly special. Moreover the work he puts in physically pays off, it reads on screen powerfully and makes the difference for the whole film. Surprising is how well Anya Taylor Joy manages to keep up with him delivering an equally functional performance.<br/><br/>Where the film really looses its charm for me is in its script. Unfortunately it is highly unfocused and does not know where to go or what to do with the compelling premise, indicative of this is the final twist which I barely managed to grasp.<br/><br/>There is no order in how the story evolves, we give the main character an extensive backstory in flashbacks and that leads nowhere, there is a mystery with the relationship between Kevin and his psychiatrist and that leads to nothing too, then there is the main conflict in the kidnapping story that leads us nowhere once again, with possibly the worst resolution of all of the above. And then, at the center of this, is the character of McAvoy, who is as fascinating on paper as he is chaotic on screen.<br/><br/>There is no silver lining with this character, there is no pay off, no purpose to his story, he is simply a gimmick. Consider too the fact that of the supposed 23 personalities we only see seven or eight on screen which makes for a hugely underwhelming experience. Moreover, when you consider the fact that of the ones we see there are only a couple that get any development you understand what a bloated journey the view is carried through.<br/><br/>Which is exactly the way I would define the film, a ride that doesn't really have any idea where it is going, but has its moments of inspiration during the trip."

","From prodigy to punchline, M. Night Shyamalan has had fascinating highs and lows as a filmmaker. The man once hailed as the heir to Hitchcock or Spielberg was soon compared to Ed Wood and Uwe Boll... I always found this a bit unfair, due to the tasteful notes sprinkled throughout even his most inept films. But he's finally crossed a line.<br/><br/>Celebrated as a return to form for the creator of the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, Split follows damaged teen Casey (Anja Taylor-Joy) and 2 cliché bitchy teenager friends, who get abducted by Kevin (James McAvoy). The catch being that his disturbed cranium houses 21 conflicting personalities, with the promise of a very sinister 22nd on the way. Intriguing concept. What might the twist be?<br/><br/>There are - contrary to what you might have heard - two twists in Split. The first is that it mostly does exactly what it tells you it's going to do. And boy is there a lot of telling rather than showing in this overdrawn yarn! The beats are telegraphed in advance and the jumps predictable. The second twist plays squarely in the current trend of exploiting viewer nostalgia: in what might be his most forgettable film, Shyamalan dares to shove in a horribly contrived parallel to his greatest work. If Split is meant as a parallel sequel to that other film, then it shares none of the stylistic identity, which makes the forced kinship feel unnatural. <br/><br/>Speaking of style, the filmmaker has also sadly broken with his earlier aesthetic in most of the ways you could imagine. The visual elegance and fluency of his first 3-4 films is gone - as, sadly, is longstanding collaborator James Newton Howard. After plumbing the depths of found footage in his previous film, Shyamalan delivers a film that is often bland and sometimes downright ugly to watch. <br/><br/>Any positive commentary on this film has to do with its cast, so let's give them their due: McAvoy has a ball with his various personalities. It's never subtle stuff, but he throws himself at it and hops effortlessly between all 21 personalities in Kevin's head. Taylor-Joy, a revelation in The Witch, is, once again, luminous, transcending a half-baked part and giving these dreary proceedings what little believability they have. Her partners in confinement barely register, and, hamstrung as she is with terrible expository dialogue, poor Betty Buckly as the caring psychiatrist manages to deliver the worst performance in a M. Night Shyamalan film - yes, even one that features the customary terrible director cameo!<br/><br/>By now the irony of this review's title - and of the situation itself - should be obvious. Shyamalan would have you believe he's come full circle, back to the glory days of his debut. The truth is much sadder: pushed to the limit and with nothing left in him, yesterday's wunderkind is left scraping the bottom of the barrel for echoes of past glories. In that sense, he is sadly representative of an entire industry with a crisis of creativity."

A teenage Horror movie that is done really bad. I liked how McAvoy could show us the variations of the 9 out of 23 personalities but that alone does not make a movie."

"CountJonnie","4","9","24","26 March 2017"," Shyamalan is back.......without improving. The biggest twist are the positive reviews.
","Shyamalan built his reputation on two, maybe three movies. His trademark is his originality and twists, and his many failed attempts to recreate them.<br/><br/>Split is about a man with various personalities. McAvoy succeeds into playing various interesting persons, but that is the only good part of this movie. The girls who get kidnapped, their acting is atrocious. Seeing them try, you can only blame it on the script and the directing. Same goes for the therapist, who makes certain decisions that will only make you cringe.<br/><br/>As the movie struggles to stand, it builds up to some semi- supernatural ending, which is so stretched out, that all credibility is lost and even McAvoy can't tie all lose strings anymore. Shyamalan does succeed into creating a nice atmosphere, but fails in the simple basics: an understandable plot, believable characters and coherent conversations. All three are missing.<br/><br/>The best thing you can say about this movie is that it isn't as bad as The Happening, or Lady in the Water. But it is far worse than the rest. The biggest twists are the reviews that pretend that this is a decent movie."

","Boring piece of crap. You'd think a film with a main character who has 23 personalities would be interesting...well it wasn't. Now I saw this film from Redbox for like a dollar so that's the best way to watch it.<br/><br/>Another disappointment from M Night. Why does Hollywood keep giving this dude money to make movies? I swear and the film made what 137million at the Box Office? OMG their idiots why didn't they wait until Redbox save a buck.<br/><br/>Anyway I thought this film was just lame and a waste of time. The acting wasn't very good. James McAvoy was okay I guess but if he should have developed the characters of the 23 personalities which we only saw 8 on screen a bit more instead of just changing his voice.<br/><br/>Oh the main actress what was the point of her flashbacks in the film? They didn't mean anything or bring anything to the story. Oh the girls were idiots. They had so many opportunities to escapes on so many occasions but didn't use em because their DUMB. Being a girl I didn't feel bad for the girls. Okay if you watched the trailer this isn't a spoiler you see the two girls in the back texting on their phone not paying attention and the main girl in the front seat looking like a zombie not paying attention and the dude gets in the cars and they don't notice him until he puts on his mask. Umm if a dude is in your car in a mask you might want to scream or do something but they just say ""Excuse me I think you have the wrong car."" Umm ya think? Oh and the girl in the front seat she watches him spray the other girls in the face. Umm you could have ran away while he was doing that...idiot.<br/><br/>Basically this film is junk. I'm always fooled by M Night's film The Visit, The Happening and The Visit just to name a few. Signs and Sixth Sense are ONLY best movie. I've stopped going to his films in theaters because I'm always disappointed except with Signs or Sixth Sense now those are great. And the whole Unbreakable thing who cares. I saw that film it was cool but to tie that film to this garbage was not needed.<br/><br/>Should you watch this film. I guess if you really want to. But trust me when I say it was boring and a piece of crap. It's only a dollar and some change at Redbox so if you really really really want to see it, rent it. But you've been warn that it's not good at all."

","He's interesting to watch, but calling him ""brilliant"" or ""I can't believe he didn't win an Oscar"" is a real stretch. Frankly his performance wasn't believable, but it's not entirely his fault, since the film in general seems to take itself too seriously with its long, lingering, closeup shots of peoples' faces as they struggle to figure out what's going on, and if that's not bad enough, scenes are stretched out so far that whatever suspense and drama they might have possessed evaporate with every passing moment. None of the actors are very good at what they do, which is ironic since it's their vocation. Three girls are kidnapped and they're calmly sitting on the bed? They should be scared out of their minds but they act more like being kidnapped is a minor inconvenience."

","Split is a thriller and horror film from a famous director, M Night Shyamalan. Before watching this film, I imagined a unique, surprising, and mysterious film like the earlier Shyamalan films. Then, what I imagine is true. That is what the audience wait from the film of M Night Shyamalan.
The most I like about this film is about the acting of McAvoy as the main actor. He can act for many varieties of different personality. During this film, McAvoy has must to act for 9 personalities from 23 + 1 personalities that he has in the story script. Who is the new personality? he is so mysterious. While his opposite is Anya Taylor, she can also act it well as a protagonist. The supporting figure as a psychology doctor acted by Betty Buckley. Her act as supporting actress very helpful to connect the personality and characters of McAvoy.
This film presents a clear path, but we need to concentration and understanding with the story. McAvoy can change into his other personality at any time. But that what makes make it interesting, that's what makes this film mysterious and very unexpected. I like this because of my curiosity to the new one personality of McAvoy."

"PStyles","7","2","3","20 February 2018"," A Solid Thriller That Derails at the End
","Overall I enjoyed this film, despite it's flaws. The concept is very intriguing in my opinion and has a lot to offer from a story telling perspective. For the majority of the film I was captivated and invested in the character's wellbeing...until the end. This movie is a shining example of how an ending can diminish what was an otherwise enjoyable experience. <br/><br/>I will start by saying that James McAvoy was brilliant in ""Split"". He has, over the years, proven his worth and this film is yet another notch in his belt. While the script is inconsistent at times, McAvoy carries the load with his protrayal of a young man suffering from split personality disorder (23 to be exact, and thus we are given the title ""Split""). The acting is definitely one of the bright spots of this film, and McAvoy does not disappoint; he delivers a truly memorable experience from start to finish. The rest of the cast does a fine job as well; I was especially impressed by the performance of Betty Buckley who plays the therapist of Mcavoy's character Kevin. <br/><br/>With an interesting premise and good-to-great acting, what could have possibly went wrong? Well, M. Knight Shyamalan is what went wrong. While i'll give him credit for rising above his recent disasters (and lets be honest, he hasn't made a halfway decent film since ""The Village""), he again attempts to be a bit too clever with this one. The ""twist"", as it's become known as in his works, is downright terrible and threatens to derail the entire movie. In fact, the first time I watched this I did not like it because of this ""twist"". It wasn't until my second viewing that I was able to appreciate this movie for what it does well. <br/><br/>While the climax of this film is pretty disappointing, the actual conclusion is somewhat interesting. For those who have seen Shyamalan's (good) films, you will know what I speak of when you reach the end. Many did not like this, but I found it to be a pretty cool conclusion. Watch for yourself to see what I mean.<br/><br/>I originally rated this film a 5 simply for the disappointing aformentioned climax, but after a second viewing I have decided that it deserves a better score than just ""average"". You must suspend disbelief if you wish to truly enjoy this film, but that isn't uncommon in the movie world. While the climax of the film leaves much to be desired (as well as some of the over-arching plot), overall this is a solid thriller worth watching in my opinion. Kudos to M. Knight for making another film actually worth watching (and one that doesn't make the list for potential worst movies ever)."

","I was expecting a psychological movie, and it was a psychological movie until the half of the movie. However, all of sudden its genre becomes horror and then we witness the emerging of a superhuman. Somewhere, director wants to justify how mind can give power. But for me, running like a jet, being immune to knife and bullet attacks, just by having a different identity is so so unbelievable. I love superhero movies, but this movie doesn't know where it is going. I love metaphors, but metaphors must help the narrative of a story and metaphors should be so smooth that they cannot be even felt. However, being raped in a jungle, being raised by the rapist, is so childishly analogous to being kept by the beast. Furthermore, I can't understand why should I have to see irrelevant flashbacks. For sure, last ten minutes of the movie, its so-called climax, is the most foolish thing I've ever watched. Why could he clime a flat wall, run like so fast, why does he bullet proof? Why I love Bruce Willis, but he made his biggest mistake to appear in such a weak movie. It seems that the director wanted to make another superhuman for split 2. Please don't, please!!"

"Coventry","6","1","1","10 January 2020"," Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right ... Here I am, stuck in the middle with the 23 of you
","I completely gave up on M. Night Shyamalan between 2005 and 2015. Talking in film titles, that means between ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Visit"". I always thought his supposedly greatest accomplishments ""Unbreakable"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" were vastly overrated (and even blatant rip-offs of obscure horror gems), but at least they were watchable. I severely disliked ""Signs"" and absolutely hated ""The Village"", so after that it was exit M. Night for me. From what I read on the internet, he only made rubbish and commercial flops in this 10-year-period anyway. ""Split"" seemed different. It has a more intriguing concept than all of Shyamalan's previous movies combined, and for the very first time, the plot genuinely appeals to fans of dark psycho-thrillers. Usually his stories are balancing on the verge of fantasy and melodrama, with a minor touch of morbidity.<br/><br/>The first half of ""Split"" is really good! The script luckily doesn't waste too much time and almost immediately begins with the powerful and intense kidnapping sequence of three teenage girls - in broad daylight on a busy parking lot - by a sinister young man with an evil grimace on his face. The girls, two typically shallow beauties and one introvert girl with a troubled past, are taken to an unknown location and locked up in a sort of basement. What follows next are a good 40-45 minutes of terrific cinema during which the three girls, simultaneously with the audience, gradually learn that their kidnapper isn't just an ordinary maniac but a deeply disturbed schizophrenic with no less than 23 different personalities. The quiet girl, Casey, realizes their only chance for escape is by manipulating the weaker personalities, but there's also a 24th and ultimately evil alter ego brooding within Kevin.<br/><br/>Lots of praise and respect for talented young actress Anya Taylor-Joy, and especially for James McAvoy as Barry, Kevin, Dennis, Hedwig, Patricia, etc. Okay, admittedly, it must be a dream come true for any actor to be offered the chance to play a character like this and demonstrate that you are capable of depicting a variety of roles, but still McAvoy puts a lot of passion and devotion in every single twisted personality! My personal favorite is definitely the posh, elderly lady with the dress and necklace. Best male-actor-playing-ugly-old-woman since Robin Williams in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", for sure! Sadly, M. Night's true personality also comes to the surface, and not even McAvoy can prevent ""Split"" from slowly turning into a dull and overly talkative B-thriller. Notably the conversations between whatever personality and his therapist are tedious and seem to last endlessly, but also Casey's cliched background story is quite redundant. Not sure what rating ""Split"" received, but the violence and murders all occur off screen, and that is a damn shame! I didn't like the ending (come to think of it, I never like the endings in Shyamalan's movies) but apparently it's the bridge towards a sequel/origin story ""Glass""."

","Impressive performances from James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy carry Split in a thrilling film about a psychopathic killer and childhood trauma.<br/><br/>Split revolves around two main characters, Kevin and Casey, who suffer from childhood trauma which the film explores. Kevin developed his multiple personalities to cope from abuse by his mother and loss of father. He abducts three young women which includes Marcia and Claire. The film gradually reveals that the multiple personalities are distinct and fight for each others turn on ""the light"". The narrative is further driven by a yet not shown 24th personality, named the Beast, who commanded the other personalities to abduct the women as his food. Casey being abducted is designed for her to grow from the trauma caused by the sexual abuse by her uncle which is revealed through flashback scenes. Another subplot is Dr. Fletcher's, played by Betty Buckley, attempt to heal Kevin.<br/><br/>The arc or Dr. Fletcher trying to heal Kevin bogged down the pacing which should have been strictly focused on Kevin and Casey. Scenes with an adult Casey and her uncle implying continued abuse should have been presented, not just on her childhood experiences. A clear resolution to both Kevin and Casey is not fully grasped because their trauma is different. Kevin is shown to be abused, but is not shown specifically how. For Casey, her ending should have been a proper breakup with her uncle signifying character growth. The camera work is impressive in some shots but not all. Angles are good but not the lighting which takes away some of the claustrophobic feel of the film.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, McAvoy and Taylor-Joy are spectacular and carry the film on acting alone. McAvoy's personality switching is fluid and shows his ability to be a chameleon. Taylor-Joy is able to portray a layered performance simultaneously dealing with sexual abuse and the possibility of reoccurring in another form.<br/><br/>7/10"

They must try to escape before the apparent emergence of the 24th - known as The Beast...<br/><br/>We now know that Split is the second instalment of a trilogy by Shyamalan that began with Unbreakable and is ending with Glass (released 2019). Always proving to be a most divisive director/writer/actor, Shyamalan has returned to the sort of noticeable form that had him earmarked in his early days as a director to follow - with the proviso that inevitably this is going to still infuriate some for its handling of the subjects at hand.<br/><br/>The plot trajectory is simple enough, girls kidnapped by a patient suffering from multiple personality disorder, as the girls in fear try to escape, a number of his personalities put in an appearance. Which builds up to the finale, which explodes after following on from the suspense and dread atmospherics so beloved by the director. In the mix joining the mental health issue with our main protagonist is a good meaning doctor (naturally), and the spectre of child abuse rears its ugly head. So not a movie to be cheered up by then! While if looking for a detailed and attentive look at the mental health issues to hand you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>However, there is a style to the picture in how it draws you into the predicament of the main players, boosted no end by McAvoy on irresistible form. Given licence to chew every scene, he delivers his various characters with great relish and no little amount of skill. Props to for Taylor-Joy, who as the lead kidnappee has deftly blended youthful innocence with resourceful strength (aided by Shyamalan's writing of course). Conversely, Shyamalan is guilty of just making a pic for entertainment purpose, which works as it's a very good creepy thriller with its black humour moments, but the mental health plot devices ensure his gimmicks will not be welcomed by all. 7/10"
"mitchell5954","7","1","1","27 January 2019"," Shyamalan's Big Comeback
","Split is deemed as M. Night Shyamalan's big comeback as a filmmaker, and I'm inclined to agree. To say Shyamalan has had a hit or miss career would be an understatement. His first three films, Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs, were all quality movies, but afterward the man entered into a fifteen long year slump starting with The Village up to The Visit. So, when Split came out we were all pleasantly surprised to find out it was actually good. Yes, Split is a good movie. Is it Shyamalan's best? In my opinion, no. Unbreakable is still his best work. Sixth Sense is also better, though I enjoyed this movie a bit more. However, this is still a solid movie; certainly the best the man has put out in over a decade and a half.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple. You have three girls leaving a party but get abducted by James McAvoy's character(s), The Horde, a man with twenty-three personalities occupying his mind. Now these three must try to survive and escape their tormentor. Meanwhile James McAvoy's doctor is notices that The Horde is acting peculiar, and is attempting to determine what's happening.<br/><br/>What carries split, and makes it as good as it is James McAvoy's character(s). Seeing this man playing all these different personalities so brilliantly is great to watch. His performance should have at least easily nominated him for an Oscar, which never happened. The film has an eerie look and atmosphere to it' something Shyamalan has always excelled at even in his bad movies. The score isn't one of Shyamalan's best, but it complements the film pretty well.<br/><br/>Once we get to the third act it becomes a thrilling survival horror film, which is when the film is at its best, in my opinion. Usually, the third act is when most Shyamalan movies fall apart, but here it's the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>I do have some issues with Split, however. It does feel slow in spots. Some of it does feel like padding. The film is just under two hours, when it could've been just an hour and a half. Also, while James McAvoy is a lot of fun, I didn't care much for the three main girls. The main heroine is okay, but the other two girls are nothing characters. The scenes between McAvoy and his doctor were far more interesting to watch, or when the doctor is trying to explain The Horde's condition to the other scientists.<br/><br/>Overall, Split is a good film, and was a good comeback for Shyamalan. I hope he can keep the momentum going, though Glass has been pretty divisive so things appear shaky once again for him."

The complex spattering of themes throughout and bigger-life-picture vibe was certainly there too. Killer script and writing which is refreshing at a time when too many movies are becoming mundane or lazy.<br/><br/>It also worked as good as any other thriller/horror out there.

","After emerging in the 1990s and early 2000s as one of the top horror directors thanks to films like 1999's 'The Sixth Sense' and 2000's 'Unbreakable', it's no secret that M. Night Shyamalan's career began to experience an unfortunate downward spiral starting with 2002's 'Signs' leading up to the truly irredeemable 2008's 'The Happening'. Even when he try to film, other genre like 2010's 'The Last Airbender' & 2013's 'After Earth', he continue to fail to connect with his audience. However, in 2015, it all change as he return to form with 'The Visit'. That movie became a surprise hit with critics and horror fans. It even show the first signs of a possible comeback. With that reconnected with his audience, Shyamalan released his newest stylish psychological thriller 'Split' about three girls: Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor Joy) being kidnapped by a mysterious man (James McAvoy) whom been diagnosed 23 distinct personalities; as they must try to escape before the man's deadly 24 persona takes hold. Like 'The Visit', a few years earlier, 'Split' mostly received generally positive reviews from both audiences and critics. For me, personally, I thought it was one of his very best written film yet, even if two of the three victims are thinly-thought of. At least, the third, Casey, is given a semblance of multidimensionality via a series of flashbacks that plays a big part in the climax of the film. Anya Taylor Joy does a great job, showing us, the quiet and raw emotion that not many other actresses her age are capable of. We wanted to see her, survive against the mental disturb man. The movie did portray a very good, Hitchcockism 'Psycho' mysterious-like vibe with the mysterious villain, ranging from the OCD neat freak, to an innocent child-like being to a creepy motherly figure. Mad props goes to James McAvoy for making a haunting man with 23 personalities seem somewhat real, even if we only see 7th of them. Still, I like how each one of them, has its own strengths, physical traits and flaws. I also like how each one has with its own unique ways of managing Kevin's fears and protecting him from the world around him. It also amazing to see some of the personas impersonates others, during the explosion dumps scenes, such as the ones, he has, with psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). Nearly every dialogue having some subtle mysterious purpose, foreshadowing to what is to come. While, some people still hate the movie for how it portrayed, dissociative identity disorder. In my opinion, the psychological aspects of dissociative identity disorder are presented accurately to how they appear in medical literature with diagnosis often being difficult, as there is considerable comorbidity with other mental disorders, and malingering often happens. While, it's true that most people suffering from 'DID', are more of a danger to themselves, than to other people. I do have to say, there are 'DID"" people like this, who trick and hide the pain from others. Even with cameo of Shyamalan, these scenes, along with Mike Gioulakis's cinematography with the sinister, windowless, underground lair, smoothly snaking with corridors, dingy doors and pipes, and harsh pools of light, adds to the suspense that already full of physical dangers to the girls, whom trying to escape through structural weaknesses or trying outsmart their deranged captor. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game of epic, psychological proportions, packed to the brim with a few surprises and more than a few unexpected twists and turns. One of them, like the supernatural powers might seem a little too out of this world, but it does come from real-world theories about the elastic limits of human possibility. While the supernatural subplot seem to come out of nowhere for the viewer that wasn't paying attention. There were some great subtle foreshadowing of that, within the movie. A good example is the scene where one of the persona has to take insulin shots. Who knows, if that was for the diabetes or to help with having extreme abilities like super strength like a shot of steroids!? Another, would be the sight of the mysterious man, mourning his father, disappearance at the train station. Could his father, be one of the victims of Eastrail 177 crash!? All of this, could be, possible, as the film concept for this flick was originally written for a different, previous movie of Shyamalan. So, don't be, too surprised of the twist, toward the end, at the diner. Overall: I will say that if you're a stickler for realism, you might want to save yourself the frustration. While not perfect, with the help of his actors and technical crew, Shyamalan has created a film that feels less like a standard horror kidnapping tale, and more like a legitimately moving story about self-discovery. This is a smart movie that will undoubtedly leave viewers thinking -- and discussing. If you have enjoyed any of M. Night's smart movie before, then there is a good chance you will enjoy this horror flick. Highly recommended."

","I just returned from a viewing of Split and I am a tad bit disappointed to say the least. As I am sure many other went into this movie, I myself was expecting the classic Shyamalan 'twist'. Instead, we got a 2 hour movie that fell short of the thrills, and realistically only built up to this ending everyone is so excited about. Let it be known that Split doesn't actually have a twist like you would normally expect. In The Sixth Sense we learned that Bruce Willis' character was actually dead the whole time. In The Visit, we learned that the grandparents weren't actually the real grandparents. In The Village, it was eventually revealed that this entire film was actually taking part in modern times. It was these twists in the film that really made me enjoy each and every single Shyamalan film (maybe except The Happening). So I was ecstatic going into Split after seeing the praise and great ratings this film was getting. I am not saying this film is HORRIBLE, I am saying it was extremely disappointing. I will say that James McAvoy really killed this role and was extremely enjoyable to watch throughout. The movie itself wasn't really thrilling to me by any means. The whole film built up to this ""Beast"" idea. We do actually get to see this beast! McAvoy literally transformed into this character that was untouchable, fast, and strong among many other things. The ""twist"", however, is by far the most disappointing thing. At the very end of the film after we see ""Split"" pop up on the screen, we are then panned to a scene at a diner. In this diner is where we discover that Bruce Willis reprises his role from Unbreakable (which is also a Shyamalan film). This is where I am annoyed immensely from this film. For someone like me, I have never had the chance of seeing Unbreakable, so what does this ending mean to me? I had to do some research to try and understand the meaning of Bruce Willis saying ""Mr. Glass"" before the end credits popped up. I am certain that the viewers who had the chance to see Unbreakable were very excited to see this scene. Though, to me, it meant absolutely nothing. The film wasn't horrible, it was disappointing."

It's not a horror but a psychotic thriller, I would say it's as much a comedy as its a horror... Also having a misleading tag line for the movie that really only unveils the last 15 minutes of the movie fooled me to think it would be something else. The side stories are very much half-assed only showing a little on the surface instead of going deep enough. When annoying stuff piles up like a mountain that aren't realistic, logical or accurate to reality it's more frustrating than enjoyable...

Director/writer M. Night Shyamalan has crafted an abduction thriller cum multiple personality disorder with his signature twisted ending, but overall not near the greatness of The Sixth Sense, Signs, or even the more recent The Visit.<br/><br/>Three teens are abducted by Kevin et al., whose promise that a ""Beast"" is coming to devour them does spook the bejesus out of them. The more canny of the three, Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy from the surprisingly effective The Witch), is the heroine destined to grapple with that Beast and the personalities that wander around this bunker-like world (Remember the locale of 10 Cloverfield Lane?) The director directs way too many close-ups of her for my taste, and the usual horror tropes like jump scares aren't sufficient to mask a fragmented plot that mirrors the split personality disorders. Outside forces like the kindly shrink, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), are actually peripheral to the power of Dennis and his army of identities.<br/><br/>Brian De Palma's Dressed to Kill used a split personality motif to explain bad behavior; Hitchcock, a big influence on De Palma and Shyamalan, used most of Split's bag of tricks, especially in Psycho, long before Shyamalan knew what personality was; United States of Tara showcased for TV the DID state to some notable success. Split will not meet the ""classic"" criteria they have achieved.<br/><br/>Because payoff for Shyamalan has always been the twist ending, he doesn't so much disappoint as confuse, with unfortunate explanations that sap the challenges a smart thriller should offer.<br/><br/>""I've never seen a case like this before.

"jeannefrancoise","7","8","23","12 March 2017"," The Beast and The Beast
","Okay so this movie is directed by Shyamalan, the director of some popular horror movies. He is specialized to make audience freaking out. Well in his new movie, Split, Shyamalan tries to combine the sci-fi horror and psychology issue. It is said that the main character here, Kevin, has 23 distinct personalities, from the kindest one, the woman, the sincere child, and so on. But there will be 24th personality about to produce. At first, audience already knew that Kevin is the main character because since beginning he leads the plot. What makes this movie good is that the effects and the places, so dark, so underground, and so ""horror"" with the fringe musics that you could imagine. For me, the plot is quite predictable, but the great acting of James McAvoy will keep your mouth shut up and you will close your eyes in some dramatic scenes that will give you a nightmare if the 24th personality is real in the real life. So that, I appreciate this movie as the new method to explain a psychopath, not just because he/she has bad childhood, but also to see the relation between human and their mind, how they make everything happen beyond logic and how they react it to other people. This horror is not just a horror, but a sci fi also. You watch it first and you will agree with me. Good job, McAvoy!!"
"dbryn","5","8","23","29 January 2017"," Everything was going great until...
","I think the movie started out great. I was captivated, intrigued, and was curious when the so called 'twist' was going to happen. The problem I have with this movie started in about the final 30minutes. SPOILER ALERT - The stage has been set, we're in a 'real world' with 'rules'. From out of nowhere, we have an insane person transforming and climbing on walls, bending bars, and brushing off two shots from a shotgun. For me, interest just went out the window. I was intrigued that this could happen to anyone, but a choice was made to bring in the supernatural. OK, fine... I figured this was all some artsy metaphors and perhaps all of the multiple personalities belonged to the girl which was intriguing. In the final moments it is revealed this is not the case at all, and we're in fact in the same movie world as ""Unbreakable"" from 17 years ago. Really? That was the big clever twist? Tying a movie with so much potential to a 17yr old film that no one really cared about to begin with? Confusing the hell out of likely 70% of the audience with this seemingly random tie-in? I think Shyamalan failed here miserably. Why would you put in the effort to bring this together with another 'average at best' movie from so long ago? Hugely disappointed. This was not even remotely close to his best work."
"starving_college_student","4","3","6","25 January 2019"," Great performance, bad movie
","The storytelling is cliche, the idea/view of multiple personalities is dated, there really is no progressing story, and the 'thrills' aren't really scary/thrilling. The script of Split feels like a first draft, missing a few basic elements. Like usually in this kind of serial-killer kind of thriller, it starts off with a grisly murder, which shows what the bad guy is capable of and what the protaganist wants to avoid. Here we have nothing, not knowing why Kevin even wants the girls. This fizzles a lot of tension/horror. From there no real plot develops (no one looking for the girls) and an unconnected sideplot with the therapist doesn't push things along (and the flashbacks of the lead girl really don't add anything to her character or story either). Split then tries to do the typical Shyamalan twist, but there was no story/red herring to make the twist surprising. Like in the Sixth Sense, the movie was setup as a story about helping a kid who sees ghosts, until the inevitable twist that showed what the movie was really about. Here, with out that element, all you have is a campy origin story for a super villain whose only purpose is to setup for another movie (the next Unbreakable). The only saving grace to this film, and only reason to see it, is McAvoy. His performances are rivetting. Each character is unique and very watchable. I'm not sure it's enough reason to watch this film, however."

"evanpatpen","9","7","20","29 January 2017"," You came here for scientific accuracy?
","Spoilers Ahead<br/><br/>Split is in my humble opinion, his best work since Signs. To start off with, the performances by the leads were excellent. James McAvoy blew it out of the park with probably one of the best performances of his career. The way he was able to get into every one of his 24 personalities was mind blowing. How he is Hedwig at one moment then Dennis another created some really tense moments. Anya Taylor-Joy was also brilliant, giving a really emotional performance. She sold the fact that she was afraid but yet knowledgeable on how to handle such instances. (Her messed up uncle made that so). The other two actresses were all right but had their moments of over-acting but that didn't get in the way of enjoying this movie. Shyamalan is back as a director creating some scenes with genuine terror and suspense. My personal favourite was missed by many. In his meetings with his Dr. Karen Fletcher, I was on the edge of my seat, as I was waiting for Dennis to snap when she pressed. The music, while not James Newton-Howard level, was still very good. <br/><br/>Now, as I have gone through some of the reviews for this film, I got disheartened by some of the reviewers. So, while I don't believe my arguments will change anyone's mind, I'll write them so you may understand my side better. The most frequented complaint I hear is that it did not represent DID well, and I'd agree, but I'll ask why did you go into this movie expecting credible science? There are half men/half beasts in this movie, true science isn't the goal. Instead, Shyamalan uses it as a starting point so that the audience isn't completely in the dark of Kevin's condition. This is done all the time in movies from Rain Man to Silver Linings Playbook, all done with varying degrees of authenticity. That's just how Hollywood works. <br/><br/>The next most popular critique is the ending. I reiterate, this is a spoiler filled review. So, according to the last scenes in the movie, this universe takes place in the same universe as Unbreakable. I've heard people describe it as a stupid gimmick and terrible twist, but I don't think it's that at all. Sure, if you've never seen the movie Unbreakable before, you'll be perplexed at the endings significance, and that is my biggest problem with the film. A stand alone film should not rely on another film in order to get it's full significance, but my next point somewhat excuses this, and that's why I still love this film. According to Shyamalan, he had plans to to do a trilogy with Unbreakable, and we see this in Unbreakable. When Mr. Glass speaks to David Dunn near the end of the film, he tells him there are two types of villains. The soldier villain and the brain. Mr. Glass was obviously the brain part, but we never got to see the soldier villain. I'm not mad at the ending because it was apart of Shymalan's plan all along. So this is in a way, a sequel. <br/><br/>There are more complaints that could be addressed, but I tried to keep this to the point. As I said before, I know I probably won't change anyone's mind, but I wanted you to see,and understand, why one fan loved the movie."
"jtindahouse","9","8","24","2 February 2017"," A masterful showing with a final scene that will make your jaw drop
","In a Hollywood completely lacking in originality and creativity, M. Night Shyamalan remains a shining light. Say what you like about some of his films, but the man continues to put out original, thoughtful and sometimes brilliant material. There's no questioning he's gone through something of a rough spell after the incredible start he had to his career. 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakble', 'Signs' and 'The Village' are all some of my favourite films to this day. Films like 'Lady in the Water', 'The Last Airbender' and 'After Earth' on the polar opposite end of the scale are completely unbearable to watch and deserve no praise at all. It has been a bizarre career to date containing the highest of highs, and the lowest of lows. 2015's 'The Visit' however was a hint that he may be righting himself again and now 'Split' has absolutely confirmed it. Shyamalan is back baby!<br/><br/>I was completely hooked by 'Split' from the moment I first saw the trailer. What a brilliant concept that lends itself to so many possibilities and so much potential. James McAvoy in the lead role must not have been able to believe his luck when he was offered the part. A character with 24 different personalities - an actor's dream. I thought he was quite brilliant in the role too. He completely sold me on every personality he performed and brought a tremendous level of intensity to the role. <br/><br/>The only problem with the film I could possible perceive is a slight lack in advancement of the story. Things can feel a little stationary at times with an almost two hour run time. Other than that though this is near perfect film making. All of Shyamalan's class as a film maker is on show. The opening scene is brilliant, the flashbacks are masterful and the final scene of the film will leave you shivering (if you're anything like me). The brilliance of that final scene is unlike anything I've seen in a very long time. Shyamalan is back and that is brilliant news for film lovers around the world."

Incredibly disappointing. <br/><br/>Then the last two lines delivered in the film just want to make you say F Off. <br/><br/>The guy has some talent but at the point his scripts get green lit is the time they should be going to a script doctor to be polished up. <br/><br/>Had the movie ended well I would have given is a much higher rating. <br/><br/>Acting is solid, if you are OK with a mediocre end and a poor twist even by Shyamalan's standards but great performances by McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy (even though her character never got the payoff that was implied but that was down to poor writing) and/or you are happy to enjoy the ride knowing there is nothing at the finish line then go and see it. <br/><br/>If you want a solid conclusion and something clever if there has to be a twist you may walk out of the theater feeling angry."

The premise for the movie seemed solid and clever enough to hold up a feature film, a man with 23 very distinct personalities at war with each other. In the movie the personalities have as much in common as 23 people have in the same hotel, nothing. They have different beliefs, characteristics, likes, dislikes, etc. this makes for a challenging acting performance for McAvoy but despite the difficulties of this part he does it extremely well and I was most impressed with how he did it. The film was definitely dark no doubt about that and the director chose the most disgusting and despicable of all backstories for our main character Casey, she had and at the end we find out still has a sexually abusive uncle who evidently molested her not only as her age now but as a child. This sets an even more dark and cringe worthy tone to the movie but that wasn't a bad thing at all it gave the movie the depth it deserved. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie especially the acting, I'd say the only thing that I think could have been done better was the tie in to ""Unbreakable"" (2000), Bruce's cameo was a little too cheesy for my taste. Otherwise yes M. Night fans can celebrate cause he is back!"

","""Split"" gives us quite a gift, an audacious and original film that will leave you wondering what you have seen, and it even has a theme: ""you can be whatever you wish..."" The question is whether you'll agree with that assessment. James McAvoy knew he couldn't pass on the opportunity to play a part (well, 23 parts within the same character). We get to meet Dennis and the rest of the gang when the stronger, but not necessarily best of the bunch have been plotting a take over. In order to fully succeed, we discover they need three sacrificial lambs.<br/><br/>With a tight grip on the camera and his screenplay, we begin our journey into several types of hell: Dennis' own, the three imprisoned victims', the psychologist's slow realization that something is now more unstable than before, which could only mean trouble, and to add a bit of misdirection? a backstory for one of the trapped girls which might be more relevant than some people will be able to understand. ""Split"" is a film that you probably need to see a couple of times to fully comprehend. It's sort of like having a great meal, and then enjoying some of the best leftovers from that same meal, and the centerpiece is McAvoy, in a dazzling turn than leaves most of the recent entries in the dust, with the possible exception of Denzel, who like Oliver, Scott, Day Lewis are basically untouchable. McAvoy has joined their ranks, and he has done it with a performance that seems a greatest hits of any actor's career. In fact, he wears very little make up, and one of his most intriguing personas is a woman, but he is fully convincing in a creepy way, wearing a sweater, a long skirt, and not a hint of make up on his face. He retains his male voice, and yet, we believe we are facing a feminine entity. He is fully able to bring out every single element which is the trademark of each personality. The rhythm in the little boy's innocence, hesitation, and fear. His Barry is truly a joy to watch and Dennis is chilling. He manipulates voices, intonations, subtle nuances which fully transition from one to another. In addition to that, we have his incredible command of his physicality. His walking changes, and then we have his eyes and his mouth, doing some of the most impressive I have seen in hundreds of films. Day Lewis was glorious in ""Lincoln"" fully channeling the spirit of the President. I'm not sure where the 23 personalities came from. It's like he brought with him his family, friends, and most of the community he grew up with, and then there's the beast.<br/><br/>The movie's preview seemed to have given us too much. We thought we knew how the whole story would unravel, pointing to a stock ending. Instead, we are traveling through a structure that shows much growth in the direction of the man behind ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", and ""The Happening"". The film is always suspenseful, suffocating at times with the tension originating from the various set ups. We expect bloodshed, mayhem, and what we get is worse because the fear of something worse is hanging over the girls' fate, and we are now caught in their hell, not knowing where the next twist is.<br/><br/>The conclusion might seem problematic to some because it brings together every little bit in the background. It fully explains the triggers for both of the main characters, and if we have been paying attention, we'll understand why Casey's fate turns out to be so unexpected. Is there room for more to come? Just like De Palma, we have that twist at the end because after all there's strength in unity, and we never know what we are fully capable of doing if we set our minds to it."

I don't understand. In their eyes Manoj can't do anything right anymore. So their judgment is already made based on the director. That does not make any sense. Manoj said in an interview that some people don't like his signature by being a small part of his own movies as an actor. That is what I do like about him. Why would the suit fit Stan Lee and not Manoj? Manoj makes me proud to be an Indian and writer of a thriller novel as well.<br/><br/>Split is a very thrilling movie. I was on the edge of my seat all the time. I did not want to miss a second of the movie. The end scene was amazing. The acting of McAvoy is phenomenal. The script is not predictable.

","Watching Split can be a frustrating experience if you wish too hard for the movie to go like it starts. With the abduction of three teenage girls by a genuinely creepy assailant Split gets off to a sinister start. Right away it becomes a James McAvoy acting class as we learn this isn't anything as one would expect. McAvoy has about two dozen personalities which his therapist believes she's getting both an education and a handle on. This is where some restraint might have kept a different thriller chugging along steadily building a more credible story. Of course this is M. Night Shamalayan so the paranormal has to be injected right along side the attempt at realism. It was brilliant in his Sixth Sense only seeming to weigh down what had so much potential here. It is not, however, a train wreck as it remains watchable slowly revealing the pathos of both the McAvoy character and Casey who is the odd-duck of the three girls. The hard-to-swallow part is how the McAvoy character continues to function being so out of control while manipulating his, we're led to believe, esteemed therapist, plus he's living below the NYC zoo in a secret madman's liar. A wall climbing scene totally jerks what little believably is left by the ending. Yes, with Shamalayan I know I should expect this, even though it comes off rather silly. Frustration is how good it started versus how it failed to use that start's potential fully. Plenty of folks are going to be ""split"" on this film."

","One needs to be a fan of James McAvoy to fully enjoy this film which I am not. I also rarely watch films so absorbed with one primary actor or ""character(s)"" but this one did win me over. First of all the film score matched up well with the scenes adding the right evocation or emotion. It got better and better as the tension increased. The acting of McAvoy is engrossing, there is no doubt about it. The first half can be at times very grating as drama because the characters keep making wrong decisions. This usually puts me off of a film but it got me back during the last 30 minutes. The story and symbolism is reminiscent of ""Manhunter"" by Michael Mann which was re-made as ""Red Dragon."" Only this one by Shyamalan added quite an interesting new element which is actually supported by much literature. Some will think it borders on the esoteric but the lines are fuzzy. As far as the naysayers who invalidate MPD or DID there is very convincing data that the physical changes are immediate and not faked having been observed in many young children. The transformations are as real as spontaneous remission.<br/><br/>My only criticism is the moral ambiguity. In the end losses come because of the superior and experienced, nuanced analysis of the sickness instead of immediate and hostile action.

","M. Night Shyamalan fizzed into movie consciousness in 1999 with ""The Sixth Sense"" which – having rewatched it again recently – still has the power to unnerve and impress even after knowing the famous 'twist'. Since that film and his next, ""Unbreakable"" in 2000, Shyamalan has 'done a bit of an Orson Welles' by never really living up to that early promise. Here with ""Split"" he returns to better form with a psychological thriller that is heavy on the psycho.<br/><br/>James McAvoy plays Kevin and Dennis, and Patricia, and Hedwig, and Barry, and Orwell, and Jade, and if the running time permitted another 17 characters. But this is no ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"": McAvoy plays all these varied personalities in the same body. For Kevin suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder, a rare condition where his different schisms not only affect his speech and attitude but also his whole physique. One personality for example is diabetic and needs insulin: all his others are fine.<br/><br/>Under the care of MPD specialist Dr Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley, ""Carrie""), Kevin seems to be making good progress. But all is not as it seems. Dennis, one of the more evil of Kevin's personalities, has kidnapped three teens – Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) – and is holding them captive in his home.<br/><br/>While Claire and Marcia are good friends, Casey is the wild-card in the pack: a moody and aloof teen that doesn't fit in with the crowd. We see the abduction unfold largely through her intelligent and analytical eyes, with her experiences causing flashbacks to hunting trips in the woods as a five-year-old child with her father and uncle.<br/><br/>This is McAvoy's film, with his different personalities being very well observed and the scenes where he switches from one to the other being particularly impressive as piece of acting. Of the youngsters, Anya Taylor-Joy is the most impressive, with the denouement of her particular sub-plot being my favourite part of the film.<br/><br/>Shyamalan, who also wrote the script, is treading a well worn cinematic path here (since often the MPD element is the surprise twist, to list any films here inevitably risks major spoilers). But this is a film that seems to have generated a lot of interest, particularly with a younger audience (I have seldom been quizzed more with the ""Ooh, have you seen this yet"" question). As a result this may be a modest sleeper hit.<br/><br/>Where I think the movie missteps is in its casting of the three cute and scantily dressed teens as the abductees. From the plot of the film that emerges this appears to be unnecessary and exploitative, especially since they are made to progressively dis-robe as the film progresses. The film would actually have been made more interesting if a family unit, or at least a mixed variety of individuals, had been taken.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Shyamalan also over-gilds the lily for the finale by going from medical improbability into outright science fiction: and dilutes what was up to that point a stylish thriller. As a result it's a decent popcorn film, and worth seeing for McAvoy's clever performance, but its not going to go down in my book as a classic.<br/><br/>Watch out by the way for a nice final cameo scene: a clever reference to past glories.<br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or search for One Mann's Movies on Facebook)."

","An underrated actor and a forgotten genius-on-the-rise shows us what they are capable of. This is the long-awaited return to shape from M. Night Shyamalan (MNS) fans have been expecting (including myself).<br/><br/>Our heroin is a classic lonelier with a troubled past. Flashbacks from our protagonist help us feel related to her and her quest to save her life (good narrative skills). A well-written character with enough depth for joining her in the 2-hour road to survival. Nice work from Anya Taylor Joy, applause. James McAvoy shows his true talents for this multi role. A challenge for whoever that take it, this performance steals the show.<br/><br/>MNS does a great camera-work with cinematography that adds the mystery and thrills typical of his movies. Shots from the top or bottom of the scene, close-ups, tracking shots and a creepy use of light help create the atmosphere for a heart popping flick. Shame that his signature twist ending isn't here, but the very end more than compensates for this omission.<br/><br/>At the end, the story might lack depth and may not leave an impression that will resound for weeks; and it takes a little light on the Dissociative Identity Disorder theme... But the movie proves to bring the thrills and chills to make it a success.<br/><br/>FINAL CONSENSUS: Split has the performances and thrilling direction fans from M. Night Shyamalan can expect. The result is a satisfying and chilling experience from the once promising director. Welcome back."

","I really don't get all the bad reviews for this excellent movie? This is in my opinion, one of the best performed thrillers for the last years. James McAvoy's performance is alone worth the time for this one.<br/><br/>I don't know what the people giving this film bad reviews were expecting, maybe a flawless documentary about multiple identity disorder? No it isn't about that, it is more of a classic thriller/horror/supernatural movie mix, with a few holes in the plot, but hey, who really knows how three female teenagers would act in real life, in a situation like this?"
"hawalee","9","6","18","20 February 2017"," Simple, yet great plot. Amazing acting from James McAvoy.
","Split has been a film I had been anticipating to watch for an extremely long time. The trailer was made fantastically, completely capturing it's viewers with it's filming and plot. After watching the film, I must say I was not disappointed in the least. Although I believe the ending could have been done better, James McAvoy's sensational acting was great enough to excuse it. He completely captured all the personalities wonderfully from playing a 9 year old child to a woman. I'd imagine it to be difficult for an actor to portray one character perfectly but McAvoy exceeded all expectations with his phenomenal performance in this film. The slight changes in body language, facial expressions, and voice all conveyed a different character and truly made me believe he was each of his characters while on screen. Definitely not a horror film which you need to look away during the scary scenes but one which captivates your attention with the thrilling suspense and psychological aspect of the film. Simply because of the ending I would give this movie an 8.5 but since you can't do that on IMDb, I believe McAvoy's acting definitely brings it up to a 9. Split was an overall amazing film. Would recommend."

","Split made me more interested in KNOWING the disorder and then searching YT and finding DissociaDID channel and her video on this film.
I can see how people who do not understand more complex or stigmatised mental health issues (in particular personality disorders and schizophrenia etc) can go straight to thinking that DID is exactly like Split. But it is so far from the truth. I hated watching Split & Glass with my partner as even though it is fictional and made up; the way the character with DID is portrayed can make stigma for this mental health issue worse. I cringed a lot during the movie. I like that it can be a way for people to become more aware of the mental illness but the character was just so far off I wish they had a disclaimer at the end saying that it was fictitious and maybe include a place for more CORRECT information on DID. I liked James' acting but not the script or the way DID was portrayed without a disclaimer."

","While I really found James M's really good in portraying his multi personalities, I just didn't overall enjoy the story. His beliefs about the monster and the killing of impure females didn't make much sense. There wasn't enough back story to really understand his character and how his past would've had a psychological effect on him. And the lead female while I sympathised for the abusive horrific past, I felt she kinda let down the other two girls. Honestly, I didn't want Kevin/Barry/Hedvig/Patricia to live!"
"JethrovanderWilk","1","3","7","14 January 2018"," A flop
","Great directors can make bad movies, and this is one of them. One of Shyamalan's latest, The Visit, is scary and mysterious. This one is boring and I did not care about the characters at all. The acting of main character(s) played by James Mcavoy is over the top (tries to be Gary Oldman or Christian Bale but fails). Anyway the storyline is terrible. Don't waste your time on this one."
"muomo","2","3","7","3 January 2018"," Even if it wasn't suspenseful, it could've still be interesting
","I don't know why this movie is being raved about. To be honest, I don't think movie knew what it was trying to portray. A man with DID? The effects of childhood abuse? It just seemed like a bunch ""heavy"" concepts were put together in an attempt to make a ""heavy"" movie. It wasn't scary, it wasn't suspenseful, it wasn't thrilling, it was just boring. <br/><br/>He takes three teenage girls hostage and does...nothing to them. Doesn't even tie them up. And he's not a big guy, so I feel like the three girls could've totally taken him down if the went full-out on him together, but of course, they don't even try that. <br/><br/>I also don't like how this man with DID takes on a 24th and final personality, which literally starts to transform him physically into a beast. Like, really? I guess that was just an excuse so he could survive two shotgun wounds to the chest and stomach at the end of the movie. Boo. I was expecting a screwed up thriller film and got...whatever the heck this boring thing was. Don't even get me started on the stupid therapist....She basically committed suicide.<br/><br/>The acting was good, but the writing was just so ridiculous. I watch too many thriller/horror movies as well as documentaries about murderers who have committed heinous crimes because of their mental illness to be even borderline amused by this movie. And I think it's in poor taste to portray someone with mental illness as a literal monster. His actions should've been able to do that well enough, but then again, he didn't DO anything the whole movie. Bleh."
"stonedraim","8","3","7","3 June 2017"," M. Night Shyamalan climbing up... should he make 25 movies, to complete the circle?
","**** May contain strong spoilers ****<br/><br/>This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....<br/><br/>This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.<br/><br/>Right into it; The way M. Night Shyamalan in a very clear way makes his way through the 23 different personalities into the showcase of the movie is more than great. All viewers should have a fair chance to take onto the contemplation of the ""different splits"". On his edge, Mr. Shyamalan is here. Enjoy!<br/><br/>It seems as Mr. Shyamalan has taken several movies and stories as inspiration and made this his own. I find traces of ""Room"" and ""Cloverfield Lane 10"" On top of this, the hide and seek motion and emotion from different horror games grasps hold of the screen as the audience just can follow through the games of the 23 patients. Watch the game ""Alien Isolation"", ""Dead Space"" and ""Outlast""...<br/><br/>As usual (speaking of let us say Signs, Unbreakable and The Village) the blend of a social oriented day to day basis along with a creeping disliking horror comes to surface as the time passes by within ""Split"". If you like a some what original movie with a tight script and story, then ""Split"" should be taken care of by you. Some of you will crumble into psychological elements now and then, just to be aware of yourself jumping high and.... scream?!<br/><br/>One of biggest fear of modern society may be the new and yet to explore sides and spaces of the human mind. All the psychological aspects, all the dysfunctional aspects, all the borderline discussions and the realism of philosophy; ""Split"" combines that with fear and throws a vast heap of question marks along the entertainment to both comply and investigate. I am very impressed how this is handled. Look about 35 minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>----- 41:30...hey.....it is M. Night Shyamalan himself behind the computer! ""I've got red socks... I've got blue socks too... etcetera..."" Is this review a little different and goes here and there...? Yes, it is. Can there be a 25th........? ""We are what we believe we are."" -----<br/><br/>This movie evolves around very interesting and deep matters. Can a human mind through extreme ""measures"" or ""pure power"" change a human being physically? Can it be that a human that has traumatic and tragic episodes processed have a more vast conscious and become/be more of an evolved person? Is schizophrenia a psycho-social matter, or is it in some way ""a true distorted view"" formed by the mind and brain, physically? What if adrenaline by the form of the story behind Bruce Banner becoming an extremely strong human being (The Hulk) combined with schizophrenia can create ""something""/someone abnormal, as the beast in here.....? Can a person develop strong skills and behaviours from animal and form itself from there on into something else...?<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan himself were ""bad mouthed"" from fans and media about being a some what of schizophrenic.... and here he answers all that with a whole movie. (Clap clap!) The woman in the movie has been sexual abused. Can that be that she comprehend dominating males to be ""monsters""... is that her perspective? The viewer gets to know her more and more... and, at the end.... why is the steel bar of the cell all of a sudden straight again...? Is the perspective in her mind?<br/><br/>In a time where the neuropsychiatric world is more and more explored and ""combinations"" such as ADHD, ADD and so on is under the microscope, ""Split"" takes that social debate and twists it. Well done! Are the society labeling too harsh and being judgemental...?<br/><br/>The ending is one of the most intelligent I have seen in a long, long time. Made the rate jump up a bit, actually... over 8,0. It starts about 1 hour and 50 minutes into the movie. The music, the timing... M. Night Shyamalan... Sixth sense, Unbreakable... Bruce Willis.... Mr. Glass..... it all came down to this. I shouted right out and felt my hands applaud... What an ending!<br/><br/>Over to the movie as a product: - The production : An simple and pure production. In its narrow path of production, the horror elements become grotesque. Mr. Shyamalans way of letting the truth and authentic story come forward is right in place in ""Split"". M. Night Shyamalan has almost perfected his own style. - The actors : James McAvoy nails the part. He delivers both pure evil, manipulation and grief of some kind. A textbook example of schizophrenia; see about 40 minutes into ""Split"". The whole session is finalized with depth of an competent actor surrounded with expertise of M. Night Shyamalan. - Entertainment : The motion picture takes you on a roller coaster. Up...down...here and there... and inside out, if you let it. - Age : 15, due to strong psychological aspects, violence and blood.<br/><br/>8,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 9 Brilliant and admirable 8 Excellent movie and a solid production)"
"Vivekmaru45","3","7","23","12 April 2017"," The Script Of The Film Is Far Too Complex For Its Own Good.
","I am giving the film a rating of 3 because I have seen two good films by M. Night Shyamalan mainly The Sixth Sense 1999 and Unbreakable 2000. You should add these two films in your movie collection.<br/><br/>This film starts off with the abduction of three teenage girls Claire, Marcia, and Casey by an unknown young man(James McAvoy). This man later on, exhibits symptoms of multiple personality disorder towards the young girls. They in turn are scared out of their wits and devise futile attempts at escape, all of which are thwarted. <br/><br/>The central character of this film is Wendell Crumb(James McAvoy) who exhibits 23 distinct personalities. There is also a hidden 24th personality which is in fact a demonic entity called ""The Beast"". Wendell has kidnapped these three girls in order that they be sacrificed to The Beast.<br/><br/>Though the plot of the film sounds interesting the execution of the film is not. I am a keen horror fan but this film failed to hold my attention. I have seen many good horror films in my life and I can safely say that this film is not among them. You can compare Sixth Sense and Unbreakable which have coherent plots. Mind well that Shyamalan has directed many other films - but I have singled out these two as being his best works. I also want to add the Shyamalan is not in the same league as horror writers Stephen King and Clive Barker.<br/><br/>I know that James McAvoy is a thoroughly professional actor, but he has succeeded at making a mockery of all the characters he has portrayed in this film. Just compare the acting of Sir Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence Of The Lambs(1991) and Edward Norton as Aaron in Primal Fear(1996). Other good performances by Mark Harmon as Ted Bundy The Deliberate Stranger (1986), Michael Rooker in Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986), Brian Dennehy as John Wayne Gacy in To Catch a Killer (1992) and Billy Bob Thornton as Karl in Sling Blade (1996). <br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review. Lead a long happy life and prosper."

No spoiler - but count me in for any sequels from this ""universe"".<br/><br/>Now back to the ""Split"" - i did enjoyed this movie a lot. This is a tense, involving and intriguing thriller where once my favorite M. Night Shyamalan is on his good form - writing was good, dark and involving - its like non of those shxx movies before have ever happened (and you know what movies i do refer). Acting was very strong by James McAvoy and good by Anya Taylor-Joy. Directing was solid - the movie is intense, good / dark looking and moody thriller. <br/><br/>Overall, hopefully M. Night Shyamalan has returned to the form for which i enjoyed his movies A LOT (to say the least) in the past and he will stay with it.

","Split is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a very tense, thrilling film as we follow three girls who have been kidnapped by a man with a serious case of schizophrenia. It kept me at the edge of my seat throughout as we follow these girls struggling to escape and being forced to deal with his many different personalities.<br/><br/>The only thing about the movie that did bother me a little was false advertising. It was marketed that this man had 23 personalities and that he was unleashing his 24th. However, we only ever meet eight of them, so it is simply a disappointment for the audience who were expecting three times more than that. I understand that Shyamalan has plans to bring this character back, but it still should not have been advertised as such. <br/><br/>Although, I must say, you do not walk out feeling underwhelmed by the amount of characters James McAvoy transforms in to throughout. He is phenomenal in this role, delivering each character with clear, specific detail. He blew my mind in every part, playing a convincing nine year old boy, woman and even an animal. There was nothing pantomime about his performances, he lets out a presence that truly becomes these characters, no acting, simply being. <br/><br/>It is a very intense ride, one of M. Night Shyamalan's best work in years. Edge of your seat suspense and ridiculously well acted, Split is certainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good thriller. <br/><br/>Three girls must try and escape the clutches of a deranged man who has multiple personalities. <br/><br/>Best Performance: James McAvoy"

","'SPLIT': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan's new horror flick, about a man with DID (dissociative identity disorder) who kidnaps three young women and terrorizes them. Shyamalan wrote and directed the movie (on a budget of just $10 million) and it stars James McAvoy, Anya Taylor- Joy (who also co-starred in 'THE WITCH' and 'MORGAN'), Betty Buckley, Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's been a huge hit at the Box Office. I enjoyed it as well.<br/><br/>Three teenage girls are kidnapped, in broad daylight, while leaving a birthday party. Their captor is a man named Kevin (McAvoy), who also has 23 different personalities. Kevin locks the girls in a room, beneath a zoo, and continues to terrorize them; while demonstrating several different personalities. At the same time a psychologist, named Dr. Karen Fletcher (Buckley), tries to help Kevin. The doctor learns that Kevin is more than just a danger to himself, while the girls desperately try to escape him.<br/><br/>Shyamalan used to be one of my favorite directors. I haven't been too impressed with his recent films, like many others, but this is definitely a well made movie. McAvoy is great in the lead, and I'm sure he had a lot of fun with the role. The film is both suspenseful and involving. There's also a great twist at the end, especially for fans of Shyamalan, and I can't wait to see what the filmmaker does next.

"jfftalbot","5","6","19","20 February 2017"," There's nothing to spoil...
","The movie opens with three girls named Claire, Marcia, and Casey. Marcia and Claire are both assumed popular girls while Casey is somewhat of an outsider. The girls enter the car and Claire's father is attacked in broad daylight at the trunk of the car by Kevin, our antagonist. Claire and Marcia are consumed by their cell phones in the backseat while this is happening. Casey, in the front is lost in thought. Kevin enters the car and proceeds to spray some sort of aerosol mist that renders the girls unconscious. Cue the opening credits.<br/><br/>M. Night's splitting opening credit sequence (maybe my favorite part of the film) almost lends it's shuttery changing animation as a visual metaphor for Kevin's 23 personalities. In a style, reminiscent of something you may find in Hitchcock's catalogue.<br/><br/>We are now in some sort of basement/boiler room setting where the three young girls are being held captive in a small room. We start to meet the different versions of Kevin. As you may suspect, each version is quite different and in my opinion represented rather simplistically. For example, a strong masculine ""Dennis"" a feminine ""Miss Patricia"" and a child-like ""Hedwig"". Dennis informs the girls they are ""feed"" for the coming ""Beast"".<br/><br/>We spend the next good portion of the film watching the girls pathetically try to overcome Kevin (and friends) and escape captivity. There are cut scenes where we get to see Kevin being analyzed, or treated if you will, by his Psychiatrist Dr. Karen Fletcher. These scenes are rather pointless in an already slow moving, and undeserved lengthy film. Though we do learn, according to Dr. Fletcher, the ""Beast"" is just another undiscovered personality or even a fantastical imagination created by Kevin.<br/><br/>Casey steps up as our protagonist as she actually shows some depth in her character and tries to make good by Hedwig in an attempt to trick him into helping the girls escape. I've basically forgotten about Marcia and Claire at this point..Are they even alive? Do I even care?<br/><br/>Finally the ""Beast"" makes his appearance and we get a rather satisfactory kill scene. Credit where credit is due.. James McAvoy's over the top screen-whoring portrayals of the multiple identities is the only thing that kept me in it. Kudos to him, but it just wasn't enough. Split is blundery at times. It fails to create an atmosphere for suspense and it's never quite dark enough (literally and figuratively) to give any sense of concern or to feel sympathetic for any of the characters in any way.<br/><br/>That being said...<br/><br/>This movie IS watchable. Just don't be expecting ""The Seventh Sense"". As a fan of Shyamalan's early work, I have to say I'm yet again disappointed at his lapse in Direction. I wasn't expecting horror, but I was waiting the whole time for...SOMETHING.. Something that never came. Maybe we'll get it in the sequel."

"antondanilov08","5","6","19","1 February 2017"," Has good elements but doesn't quite let you enjoy it...
","Let me start by saying that I didn't understand 'The Sixth Sense' (maybe because I knew what the twist ending was) and both 'Unbreakable' and 'Sings' -- the only other Shyamalan films I'd seen until recently -- seemed good enough for me. Not long ago I saw the 'The Visit' and I found it his best effort! Seriously! Maybe it was unprofessional young actors, maybe it was digital camera and a lot of fps but for any possible reason it felt like all the things in it might as well happen to you. It was very scary, definitely one of the scariest films I've seen. As you might have guessed, I was impatiently waiting to see this one because of my recent filmmaker experience and above that -- I really-really liked the trailer.<br/><br/>When it came to seeing the film, bright and shiny hopes were seriously injured. The problem is that the director, having come up with an interesting idea, forgot to give it the main: 'What's gonna happen next?', 'How does it all work out?' questions. We are basically told what the ending will be in the first 20 or so minutes and then nothing really happens. Add the fact that the pace is very slow. Myltiply that by inert pretentious montage from 'The Visit' (which worked right in it!) and it all becomes kind of sad. Flights of stairs, pretentious montage, some unnecessary talking, pretentious montage, some unnecessary running, the end.<br/><br/>On the positive side, I liked a decent amount of Shyamalan's imagery -- I liked the idea of many different personalities living in one body, I liked that Dennis and Patricia kicked other identities to under the bed and took full control of Kevin's body, I really liked that Dennis was pretending to be Barry and kept denying he was Dennis for like an hour and then finally broke. All mentioned is greatly pulled by James McAvoy. The other characters are all right. The only thing I didn't like in that field is that the movie, immediately hinting at Casey as a protagonist, then, for unknown reason, gives a lot of screen time to other two girls which are first intended to be secondary characters. Also, flashback scenes to Casey's childhood felt strongly unnecessary.<br/><br/>All in all, it may be worth watching. You may like it or at least like it more than I did. Here's my advice to you: don't set your expectations too high."

"MrDHWong","8","5","15","12 April 2017"," Not a complete redemption for Shyamalan's filmmaking credit but certainly a step in the right direction
","Split is a psychological thriller film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and starring James McAvoy. While not a complete redemption for Shyamalan's filmmaking credit, it is certainly a step in the right direction.<br/><br/>After attending a birthday party, three girls named Casey, Marcia, and Claire are kidnapped by a mysterious man identifying himself as ""Dennis"" (James McAvoy) and are held in a prison-like basement. While trying to escape, the girls discover that ""Dennis"" is actually one of 23 distinct personalities belonging to the man in question, and is conspiring with a fellow personality to aid in the release of a frightening 24th, known only as ""The Beast"".<br/><br/>Suspenseful and often chilling, Split feels like a much needed return to form for the once disgraced writer/director. Shyamalan successfully channels the Hitchcockian method of storytelling that was present in his early films. As one would expect, there is a twist ending but unlike Shyamalan's recent duds, this one actually works quite well. James McAvoy gives a frightening, deranged performance as a man suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and he never overacts or hams up the unhinged nature of his character. Shyamalan still has a long way to go before he fully redeems himself of his recent terrible films but if Split is anything to go with, he's definitely on the right track.<br/><br/>I rate it 7.5/10"

"cdrcanteets","7","4","11","25 May 2017"," Why all the hate? *SPOILER WARNING*
","I've noticed a lot of hate towards the film because it's not a horror or because of how things play out. Let me be the guy to say...<br/><br/>It's a super villain origin story. Set in the same universe where men can be invincible. A man with DID, develops a persona that has the ability to survive point blank shotgun shots and scale walls with ease. It's not meant to be realistic. True there are parts of the film where you wonder why the girl didn't run. Because we knew that the antagonist was busy elsewhere, doesn't mean the main character does. The girls don't fight back and are helpless... Well guess what, the persona of Dennis is very strong and could open a door with the weight of two women behind it with ease. I (A full grown male) if in that situation, would bide time and not foolishly get myself killed. Strangely like the main character. <br/><br/>I find it funny that people wonder why the main character let the antagonist live. She didn't, she had no choice. He took the brunt of two shots from a shotgun and she ran out of bullets. She was locked inside the cell and had to wait for help in the form of a helpful zoo keeper. The girls were not in control of the situation what so ever. Killing the antagonist could have been helpful, but not very helpful when you have no idea where you are, if the kidnapper is definitely alone or how long you'll be trapped before you starve to death. Not to mention the very good chance that one if not all three of you will be seriously hurt in the process. Two of the three died? Great, you can see the future too, right? <br/><br/>The one thing I will admit is the issue with the psychologist. She should have done something sooner. If she had just left and called the police, things would have been different. However, poor plot development for w£$*&s = #poorplotdevelopmentforw£$*&s.<br/><br/>That part could have been better. All is well though because the film isn't perfect, just good. Even better if you like the idea of shamalama ding dong directing a film featuring Bruce Willis as an indestructible super hero fighting a less indestructible McAvoy with a very vocal inner nine year old we all want to get a real window for Christmas. <br/><br/>Watch the film and decide for yourself. Don't by any means expect a horror film, because it isn't one."

","Ok, as acting goes, McAvoy is good and has transformed the personalities well.<br/><br/>But my issue with the film is the plot itself, it's basically undone all of the important work mental health awareness has achieved over the past few decades.<br/><br/>As an example before Jaws everyone knew about sharks and sure there was a risk, but after Jaws everyone feared sharks, feared swimming, to the point they actively went out and attacked and killed them. Anyone who knows about sharks will understand that like all wild animals they have boundaries. But the film changed the perception, that sharks were only after human blood and were evil. A myth that marine experts are still trying to come to terms with and battle today.<br/><br/>This film seems to have the same effect with people who suffer from mental health. It has put up a fearful boundary that anyone with a disorder is now likely to be a homicidal killer. I hope most people can see beyond this.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment was to find that in the last 5 seconds of the movie, this film is directly linked to Unbreakable. It's just Shyamalan having to come up with a twist for twists sake. Well at least he can now cash in with a McAvoy, Willis, Jackson blockbuster..."

","I am rooting for M. Night. Really. Unfortunately, his films of late were a let down. Hence, I am keeping an open mind on Split. The first sign of a series of disappointments were on the first 10 minutes of the film. The Marcia character could not act. I just want to slap her or wished she is the first victim so I can enjoy the rest of the film.<br/><br/>John McAvoy to the rescue. This may not his finest but he can make an average script work. The story trudges along slowly. In the meantime we learn that Casey was abused. The flashback scenes were predictable, - camping trip. This could have been shorter. We get it why Casey is an outsider. Five minutes will suffice.<br/><br/>The motivation of the psychiatrist who protects her patients needs more clarity. Does she want a Noble prize for her discovery? Seriously? The case of the blind patient regaining sight and the mention of McAvoy's split personality dilemma (spoiler) are clues served on silver platter. She seemed hopeful this will have a rosy ending. <br/><br/>The third act is already revealed. There are some scary moments but that's about it. I was hoping this new M.

","Let me begin by saying that I had no hopes for this movie to be good, Shyamalan has disappointed me too many times before, and this was no exception. It's not nearly as bad as The Village or The Happening but it's at least twice as infuriating. <br/><br/>The first half-or-so of the movie is incredibly good. It balances terror, suspense and drama perfectly, while carefully developing a great social commentary about DID (the disorder that Kevin, the protagonist, suffers). It makes you feel empathetic, while at the same time creates a great tension between every character on camera, exceeding every expectation I might have had. <br/><br/>And then it happens... the most anticlimactic moment of the year in cinema. You may have thought that you were experiencing a great story about the dangers of the human brain, but you are quickly reminded that this is a Shaymalan movie when Kevin (McAvoy) becomes a weird mix between the Hulk and The Walking Dead, and the movie immediately falls flat on its face. I can't even try to express how angry I was due to my disappointment. This might as well be one of those boring ""demonic possession"" movies that we are all so tired of, but without any indication that there was a devil to begin with.<br/><br/>5/10 would break steel knives with my abs again."

","Unbelievably awesome, a total resurgence and atonement of M. Night since the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. The idea that mental disorders may represent evolutionary progression is an idea that has been on my mind for quite some time now. For example, Psychopaths are ""morally reprehensible but absolutely necessary"" is a theme all too true in real life as it is reflected in the movies. M takes the condition of Dissociative Identity Disorder (previously Multiple Personality Disorder) to a more humane, though excruciatingly terrifying, description is undeniably ingenious, and I applaud him for it. The direction and acting is absolutely superb, the editing unquestionable, and the mission to make a movie inscrutably unique and uncritically undeniable. Well done, M. very well done."

","I'm sure James McAvoy has the capacity to be a decent actor and I suppose it's possible that he might one day get a decent part to play in a decent movie with a decent script. But, this one wasn't it.<br/><br/>To illustrate the point, I look back over some of the roles that J Mc has had in fairly recent times - ""The Disappearance Of Eleanor Rigby"" (he was terrible and the movie was crap), ""Filth"" (he was awful and the movie was even worse), ""Welcome To The Punch"" (he was woefully bad and the movie was worse still) and then this lot of crap, ""Split"". A schizophrenic with 23 different and distinct persona? I'm no Psychiatrist but really, give us a break!! And then we're supposed to believe that a being of flesh and blood with 23 persona can develop a 24th and then be not only super-humanly strong but also resistant to shotgun fire at point blank range. Seriously, where do they get these dumb-arse ideas from?<br/><br/>2016 produced some wonderfully good movies but this was not one of them. It was dreadful and probably worse is the prospect of a sequel which was set up at the end of this lot of rubbish.<br/><br/>Is it the situation that J Mc just hasn't yet had enough good performances to attract decent scripts? I think that might be the case.<br/><br/>I'll just say for now, you could probably safely stay away from anything that he's in and be none the worse off.

"secondtake","7","2","4","4 August 2017"," Covers some familiar ""captive female"" territory with professionalism, nothing more
","Split (2016)<br/><br/>An interesting movie with some ""dumb"" aspects, like many horror films. The good part is how we see the villain (with multiple personalities) is slowly revealed through videos and a therapist. It's unlikely, of course, but actor James McAvoy makes it vivid and fun. And believable in the movie.<br/><br/>The three teenage girls are made to be mostly clichés (one of them much less so) and in case you are wondering, yes, they end up miserable and in their underwear by the end of the movie. This is a horrible shame because it cheapens the whole thing, and the complexity of the McAvoy's character makes it unnecessary. I'm also tired of movies where innocent females are imprisoned by crazy men, with all the ugly power trips and sexual fear involved.<br/><br/>There are some slightly superhuman aspects that get revealed (I think writer/director Shyamalan probably thought this was ""really cool"" and if you wonder about him, go see some interviews on youtube). It's fun, of course, but to me not the brilliant inventive movie some others have said. <br/><br/>If you know any of Shyamalan's other films, you might quickly characterize this one as a lesser one (like ""The Village"") and by that you'll know that there are some really fluid, beautiful aspects to the movie, and some conceptual flaws that get in the way. But still enjoyable entertainment, so weight it accordingly."
"pyrocitor","6","2","4","5 July 2017"," Bananas
","It's tempting to read the title of director M. Night Shyamalan's latest thriller as a cruelly reflexive play on the schism of his infamous filmmaking career: part I (the Early Days, where he was heralded as one of the industry's most visionary living directors), and part II (a slew of exponential misfires so inexplicably ill-advised no one, most likely including Shyamalan himself, quite knew what was Happening). Sadly, although Split does recall Shyamalan's early glory days (literally - to an almost inexcusably tacky fashion), there are mere hints of promise and potential here, skulking like phantoms amongst a film too mired in silliness and indecisive murk to leave too much of a mark. This isn't to say Split is a total write-off - there are trashy thrills to be had, and pitted against the bulk of Shyamalan's last decade of work, it's practically Citizen Kane. Still, it bears the melancholy mark of a fallen maverick who hasn't so much reclaimed his mojo as located the postal code it relocated to. <br/><br/>If anything, Shyamalan is wise to play it safe, steering clear of sci-fi, fantasy, and airbenders with a taut tale of abduction and frayed psychology that almost amorously borrows from Hitchcock's Psycho. Still, in spite of this textbook familiarity, Shyamalan still(!) somehow manages a work as loopy and hard to navigate as any of his more labyrinthine psychodramas. On the surface, he's conjured a setting rife for a satisfyingly campy b-thriller a-la Sam Raimi, replete with jittery, claustrophobic camera-work, an appropriately creaky, ominous soundtrack by West Dylan Thordson, and contrived enough reasons to strip his captive coeds to make Sharknado roll its eyes. And, for the sequences when Split commits to pure, primal 'what's around that corner' breathlessness, like a slightly sillier but equally chilling bunker buddy of last year's 10 Cloverfield Lane, it is effective as hell, and pure popcorn fun. <br/><br/>But, rather than committing to the amiable wink and nod, Shyamalan clouds his film with an uneasily out-of-place streak of (yawn) seriousness. To say the least, it sits uneasily with a wagon-load of aped genre tropes - a grainy aesthetic that hearkens back to the Doom era of action horror, hazy mental health fretting, Madonna/whore obsessions, clumsy flashbacks to our tortured protagonist's tortured childhood torturedly; even a healthy helping of cringe-worthy self- harm hero-worshipping? - that would've felt stale in a straight-to-DVD late night special from the early 2000s. The film's lugubrious editing doesn't help, making McAvoy's mysterious madman feel as sluggish as he is indecipherable. And if that wasn't enough, Shyamalan sifts in a shroud of self-important faux-mythology (wide-eyed characters whisper mental health bunk as if reciting sacred texts, conflating mental health disorders with superpowers in a way that is, amazingly, both cloyingly infantilizing and alienating as hell) that would be borderline offensive if it wasn't such silly claptrap. <br/><br/>Then, for those masochistic viewers still desperately trying to wrangle the film into being worth it, try our arch-foe(s)' motivation on for size: McAvoy's multiple personalities (or at least some of them ) kidnap high school girls something- something confused sexuality something-something abused as a child blah blah worshipping superpowered Satanic death cult to punish them for not having suffered enough? Hel-LO-O! They're in high school! Methinks it's you who doesn't know the meaning of the word suffer, Mr. 'Beast.' Go back to pining over a rose. Maybe sing about it. <br/><br/>And the invariable Shyamalan 'twist?' Only that nothing, not even standalone passion projects made by former art-house darlings, is safe from the encroaching, wearing mega-blockbuster trend towards interconnected cinematic 'universes.' Yes - our entire movie outing here exists for the sake of shoehorning in an almost staggeringly self-indulgent finale linking the film to Shyamalan's Unbreakable - a modest hit from 17 years ago(!) that a minimal percentage of viewers might remember offhand sans google - just so he can chase the superhero bandwagon like Tobey Maguire pitifully wheezing after his departing bus in Spider-Man? Nah. No thank you indeed. Good day to you, sir. <br/><br/>The film's main selling, of course, is showcasing James McAvoy's range, with the kind of role actors fight tooth and nail to show off with. Thankfully, he's fairly excellent, and transitions so seamlessly between flamboyant personalities (including some pretending to be others... oooh!) with subtle shifts of face and posture. It's almost a shame that he has to contort to the dopey 'superpower' conceits of Shyamalan's script, as he's easily fascinating and scary enough on his own without crawling on the ceiling like a bargain basement Underworld counterfeit. Apart from the central novelty of McAvoy, Anya Taylor- Joy gives an impressively enigmatic, haunted performance as our leading teen, plagued by plenty of inner demons pre-abduction (though, again, she's better off emoting on her own right, rather than having her performance hand- held by irksome, unnecessary PTSD flashbacks). Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula are both solidly credible, in spite of the 'panting cheerleader' stereotypes they're saddled with, while Betty Buckley works her darnedest to ground her breathy exposition-dolling plot devise of a therapist with wry sharpness and astute charisma. <br/><br/>The thing is, you want to like Split. You can practically smell the sweat on Shyamalan trying to rekindle his rep, and scorning poor McAvoy, practically bleeding energy onto the screen, feels like kicking a (psychopathic) puppy. And hey - if you're in the market for a silly, braindead little thriller full of nerves and amiable nonsense, Split will pass the time with a couple of jumps, shivers, and chuckles, both intentional and not. But as a purported comeback from the mind behind The Sixth Sense, and with another Unbreakable sequel that next to nobody will be waiting eagerly for still in the pipeline? Let's just say that none of us, least of all Night, are now strangers to the Beast's suffering litmus test of worthiness. <br/><br/>-6.5/10"

","M. Night Shyamalan IS BACK! After a sixteen & a half year lay-off from the Eastrail177 series, we FINALLY get the stand alone sequel! Being away for so long, Shyamalan was able to appreciate other film making styles & makers, that he meticulously picked his crew to create Split. Shyamalan hand-selected Mark Gioulakis, after seeing the beautiful cinematography in It Follows, Mara LePere-Schloop, after seeing the creative & authentic production design in Django Unchained, West Dylan Thordson after his best composition in Joy, and also came up on a diamond in the rough find, in James McAvoy. Shyamalan has this articulate sense of direction & story telling; Split is a movie you need to be patient with, and able to embrace from the start, because if you don't, you're probably not going to have the best time. With a few filler scenes, the pacing can be a bit choppy at times, but fulfilles this high octane tone, being very suspenseful, and satisfyingly unsettling.<br/><br/>My god, James McAvoy shines bright here! In order to put on such amazing performances (if you will), McAvoy really got into his role off the camera, as well as on. I personally believe that he got completely robbed of at least an Oscar nomination, regardless of when the movie was released. He did a great job sharing the wealth with Anya Taylor-Joy, who also put on a great performance. Anya Taylor-Joy just shot the movie The Witch last year, and carried her talent onto Split. Taylor-Joy is such a FANTASTIC young actress, that sells her emotions as authentic as possible. Her character development started right from the beginning, and didn't stop, due to all of the layers her character has. Betty Buckley put on a decent performance, being a nice, optimistic inspiration to McAvoy. The other two actresses in Haley Lu Richardson & Jessica Sula were nothing but plot devices. Their emotions were just okay, while having easily the worst dialogues out of all the characters.<br/><br/>The script by M. Night Shyamalan had a lot of intriguing dialogue, that sat in such an uneasy way at times. He really takes his time to tell the story he wants to tell, fleshing out each character & plot point as much as possible. M. Night kept up with his little humor flare, adding in just enough laughs.<br/><br/>Mike Gioulakis utilized a lot of dull colors, and dark lighting to create this suspenseful, and creepy tone throughout each scene. This dark, claustrophobic, basement set Mara LePere-Schloop created, leaves you at the edge of your seat at all times.<br/><br/>Overall, Split was a success! I didn't quiet enjoy it more than Unbreakable, due to some inconsistencies, and structure issues, but nonetheless, still a solid film, and a great addition to the trilogy."

","There are people out there with multiple personalities, but DID mostly manifests itself in dissociative episodes where you black out and get real vague for a while. That's it. DID represents as much as 1% of the global population. It's simply not as it's portrayed here. People like Kevin make up about 100 people in the world. And honestly, can't Hollywood vilify and stigmatize us with a bit more creativity? I'd just seen this nonsense with the third season of Iron Fist, and a variation on this nonsense in ""Joker"". But no, M. Night Shyamalan, for all his brilliance, takes the most obvious path. Is it good? Yes. James McAvoy turns stereotype into Shakespeare, via the B movie route, such that the flashes of comedy let us know none of it is to be taken that seriously. It's good. Yes, it does have its oddly exploitative moments. But I think you just let it all flow. I mean, whatever you want to call it, crazyface, I don't know, it's not so different from ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" and, you have to admit: Audrey, those sunglasses. I mean, come on. So let James McAvoy do his (admittedly ridiculous) thing, and let Joaquin do his decidedly better thing, or anyone else who wants to pretend to live in this darker world, where nothing is like Hollywood.

They are being prepared for something.<br/><br/>Casey acquires the belief that there's a trick to it all. She'll try to get 9-year-old child/man Hedwig to help them escape. Hedwig just says he 'stole the light' from Dennis who will notice soon and get angry (""etcetera""), and then cries about how Patricia thinks he's stupid. Dennis takes over again after an escape attempt, isolating Claire in a closet and demanding they each remove an article of clothing on the pretense that they got dirty. There are bad angles in the wood panels by Casey as she surrenders her first shirt.<br/><br/>Dr. Fletcher pitches a lecture about her patients having powers in the far upper spectrum of human ability, thanks to their suffering and at their own insistence. It's an interesting concept.<br/><br/>As they stand over the body of a young deer in the woods, Casey's dad says ""The thrill, Casey, is about whether you can or can't outsmart this animal."" Casey steps forward almost defiantly before the carcass; it's almost like she's empowered.<br/><br/>Marcia is down to her crop top and panties as Patricia leads her and Casey to the kitchen. Patricia seems pleasant as she prepares sandwiches with paprika. Patricia personally likes paprika and she pontificates about the eating predilections of lions (incidentally, they favor the belly). After an escape attempt, she holds a knife to Marcia's bare belly and says she was chosen because she's always been protected and has never truly suffered: ""You never had a chance"". Patricia's particularly creepuscular and prone to perversion. Dennis later menaces Casey angrily like she's some kind of threat, saying they'll be kept separate, The Beast is coming for all three of them, and she has a crumb on her (second) shirt; she must take it off.<br/><br/>Little Casey is in the woods with Uncle John with his shotgun. He looks like he may be trying to impress her. There's an interesting tension.<br/><br/>Hedwig roughhouses with Casey a bit and brags about his ""special power"" (the 9-year-old can come out any time). She wins Hedwig's trust by telling him about how she gets detention on purpose to get away from everyone. Now he'll bring her to his room where there's a window; her suffering has a special use. She is specially suffering.<br/><br/>Dr. Fletcher fawns over Dennis, saying he's needed by the others because he's strong and he cares for Kevin (so himself, ultimately); he's not evil, but ""necessary"". She's especially good at postulating the many ways in which Kevin and his many personalities are functional.<br/><br/>It's Casey's 'privilege' to go to Hedwig's room to be really impressed when he does a 'funny' dance before The Victim. It's a Special version of a sacrificial dance (a headdress and spear would complete the look). Casey's losing hope in this multi-creep, multi-room dungeon and she needs to escape through his window, but his window is a drawing in crayon on craft paper and he's busy being interesting.<br/><br/>Back in the room, Dennis tells Casey that The Beast is an evolved being that believes ""the time of ordinary humanity is over"" (the typical Super Serial Killer), she will be in the presence of something ""greater"", and he's not going to take her last shirt because tonight is a sacred night.<br/><br/>Little Casey walks somberly down a hill in the woods. Uncle John's there and he tells her to take off her clothes so they can play their 'game'. She's later shown holding a shotgun on her uncle and pumping it, as if a child might be expected to have the bravado to even begin to 'handle' the situation in this way, as well as the ability to handle the shotgun (and possibly even pull the heavy trigger).<br/><br/>Dr. Fletcher goes to the Zoo and tells Dennis they're extraordinary. Dennis agrees and tells her about The Beast. He also tells an interesting story about how when he was three his mother would punish him cruelly if he made a mess. In her closet, Marcia finds a wire hanger which she bends and shimmies through a door crack to try to release the outside latch, but it's not possible (it doesn't have the rigidity needed for that kind of use). When Dr. Fletcher discovers he's abducted the girls she tries to reason with him, as if that'd be possible now after facilitating the escalation of his condition with little in the way of therapy and an abundance of undiscerning praise. He maces her.<br/><br/>At night the Patricia/Dennis-via-Hedwig 'Horde' attain an even lower level of Creepuscular; just 'magically' mutating into The Beast by the power of their insistence. It bolts through a train tunnel into town, then bolts back home to crush Dr. Fletcher to death like a boa constrictor.<br/><br/>Casey gets out of the room and discovers Marcia's half-naked dead body; her stomach (and its contents) gruesomely devoured. Horrified, she moves on to the next room where she sees Claire lying face-down on the floor behind a rack - half-naked as well, of course. Casey whispers ""Claire, let's go"". Claire moves a little and looks up at Casey in abject misery, unable to speak. She's snatched away and it's immediately clear that her abdomen is being devoured. There's a real likelihood that she's still alive and, perversely, we can only look at her face hoping for an indication that she's not still suffering a slow death. It's clear that she doesn't have a chance. It's been vilely arranged.<br/><br/>The Beast comes for Casey and literally starts climbing the walls (pointlessly). Casey says Kevin's full name (as prescribed on paper by Dr. Fletcher before her death), and The Beast is briefly exorcised as Kevin resumes (recalling an INTERESTING childhood scene where his mother comes after him with a bent wire hanger to inflict extreme MISERY on him for making a mess). He tells Casey where the shotgun is and instructs her to kill him, but he's swiftly overcome by weaker personalities insisting on their innocence. Then Hedwig returns. In despair, Casey says ""Stop it Hedwig!"" but Hedwig stops nothing; he's where it begins. He'll give Patricia and Dennis the light: ""No one's allowed to make fun of me anymore."" He's a stupid boy.<br/><br/>Patricia takes the light. At Patricia's insistence, The Beast begins to re-emerge - but not before she declares the typical Serial Killer Escalation Vow that it'll be 10-12 young victims next time (the higher number isn't impressive; it just makes her that much more of a repulsive coward). Casey finds the shotgun. She's shown running through the service tunnel in her skimpy shirt then she's shown rolling around on the ground as The Beast bites a chunk out of her calf and rips her (last) shirt apart at the front. It hides when she loads the shotgun and she runs to the end of the corridor.<br/><br/>Little Casey sits sadly in the playground. Dad died prematurely of a heart attack and burly Uncle John will be her guardian. Interestingly, she'll be miserable for years now.<br/><br/>The Beast yells ""Only through pain can you achieve your greatness..."" and Casey locks herself in a cage, firing and missing as It bolts toward her. As she loads the last two shells her torn sleeve becomes a nuisance. She says ""F-!"" (but that's very unlikely to be what she wants to invoke); she must tear it off.<br/><br/>Casey fires, hitting It twice at close range to little effect. The Beast has already simply insisted that It is ""more"" than human, so It just stands back up and begins to bend the bars of her cage. Luckily though, she has many meticulously placed scars on her body, exposed due to the calculated elimination her of her clothes. When It sees her scars It says she's ""different from the rest"" and she should ""Rejoice"". It simply walks away then; she is 'saved' by the unbelievable transformation of self-abuse injuries into a survival mechanism (made possible by the incidental 'benefit' of being progressively undressed).<br/><br/>Casey is later found and when she's notified by a police officer that her uncle is there to pick her up she looks like she may object. So, maybe this miserable experience was 'good for her'. Incidentally.<br/><br/>In a new (old dilapidated) hideout, The Horde converse among himself about how he came away unharmed, people will have to believe they exist now, and the thing to do is to trust in The Beast: ""Let him show the world how powerful we can be"". By bolting around, climbing the walls, and getting angry. Etcetera."

"amullen34","9","0","0","24 March 2020"," Thrilling, tense, brilliantly acted and directed
","When people hear the name M. Night Shyamalan, many will cringe and recall The Last Airbender or The Happening. I make no claims that those movies aren't terrible, but many people judge the director based solely on those films rather than the Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, his two best movies in my opinion. But if someone still needed convincing that Shyamalan is a director worth respecting and following after those movies, I would show them Split next.<br/><br/>Many people call this movie Shyamalan's return to form (I liked The Visit more than most, but this movie is definitely better). After big budget, high CGI blockbusters like After Earth, it's so refreshing to see Shyamalan returning to what he does best: low-budget thrillers. This movie is excellently directed, with the incredible cinematography I've come to expect from Shyamalan. This movie feels very claustrophobic, and it pulls you into the movie and won't let go. I couldn't be happier to see Shyamalan in full control of this movie, and its all the better for it.<br/><br/>Of course, the star of this movie is James McAvoy. He gives himself fully to this role and doesn't hold back, and I would seriously call this his best performance ever. The way he can switch from one personality to another so quickly is astonishing. Anya Taylor-Joy is also very good in this movie, but unfortunately, aside from those two leads, most of the other characters feel one-dimensional and uninteresting.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is incredible. I would say that James McAvoy carries this film, but there is still a lot to love outside of his performance. Although there are minor problems with pacing and the exposition sometimes feels forced, this movie is thrilling and deserves to be right up there with the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable as Shyamalan's best."

","Preface:<br/><br/>I'll be honest. I watched this film without even realising it was part of a trilogy, and the second title at that. I did watch Unbreakable quite some time ago. It was a memorable movie and I am excited to watch it again now that I've seen Split.<br/><br/>
Review as a stand alone movie:<br/><br/>Simply brilliant. Thought provoking. It left me pondering the potential abilities of the mind. As a stand alone movie, you can be assured that it is entirely disconnected from the first movie apart from a very small section of the film. It can therefore be viewed on it's own should you wish."
"jamesrupert2014","8","0","0","20 March 2020"," Good psychological fantasy-horror
","Young women are held captive by a man with an extreme psychological disorder than manifests as personalities ranging from a naÃ¯ve child to a near preternatural killer. M. Night Shyamalan's horror-thrillers can be hit-or-miss, but this one is pretty good. James McAvoy is excellent as Kevin Wendell Crumb and his various personalities, as are the young women that he imprisons. The story moves along well and the climax, while obviously setting up a sequel ('Glass', 2019), is satisfying. The depiction of dissociative identity disorder (DID) had been criticised as unrealistic but ultimately the film is a fantasy, playing with the idea that Crumb's alternate personalities are actually biologically independent entities, including one with paranormal abilities. All in all, a fast moving, well made, and entertaining horror-lite film."
"jamiedarlow-37510","10","0","0","18 March 2020"," Masterfully made psychological thriller
","With a stunning knock out performance by James McAvoy! Three teenage girls (Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula) are abducted by a man named Kevin formally with split personality disorder. They need to escape him before a life-threatening 24th personality is unleashed. That's the basic setup for this brilliant and massively engaging film that is one of Shyamalan's best works. McAvoy is truly outstanding in the central role; his best performance to date and he really seems to transcend through the role, showcasing his incredible talent. Sudden but natural shifts from scary to serious to funny to sad and disturbing are expertly crafted by him and the same most certainly can be said for the tone of the film which is so fantastically and seamlessly put together. Anya Taylor-Joy is outstanding in the role of Casey; a character whose survival instincts are second to none and abuse she has suffered in the past is not exploited and shown in just the right amount of flashbacks. She totally stands tall next to the monolithic performance McAvoy conveys. Betty Buckley is also great as Dr Fletcher; a constant support for Kevin. The music by West Dylan Thordson is tense, twisted and at times emotional. It's so much more than just an abduction film; although that is its theme, it's quite unlike any other in that vein. Such a cool twist right in the last seconds too. A brilliant film that elevates to classic status mainly thanks to two insanely great performances"

"kefinka","5","0","0","28 January 2020"," Conflict of interests
","Okay, this one is difficult for me. On the one hand, my favourite classic gothic tale of all time is The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson, and I could definitely see some influence in Split. But then again, this is M. Night Shyamalan, and I know that while he can get the ball rolling when it comes to storytelling, he is almost physically incapable of sticking the landing. In the end, I decided to watch this movie because I has been curious about James McAvoy's take on the character(s).<br/><br/>In this one respect, I was far from disappointed. McAvoy is a brilliant actor, and he pulled off not only all the various characters so that they were believable and distinctive, but he especially excelled in transitions between them. His performance was strong and seemingly effortless, and, as usual, his biggest forte was the non-verbal part of acting (gestures, posture, facial expressions).<br/><br/>I also think that Anya Taylor-Joy did a great job. I appreciate that this was not ""just"" another typical hostage character, and in my opinion, she delivered beautifully.<br/><br/>As I said before, there were aspects of the movie that really worked for me. I liked the pacing, the lack of physical violence or graphic content which seems to be the staple of thriller/horror movies of this kind. Altogether, the film would have probably been good enough for me...<br/><br/>BUT:<br/><br/>1. Editing in this thing was awful. We were jumping in and out of scenes abruptly without any apparent reason. It was very distracting and kept pulling me out of the story.<br/><br/>2. Even though I had an idea about the way the story would go towards the end, it did not make it any less nonsensical and almost cartoonishly ridiculous. Personally, I feel there is always a line between realism and fantasy, and even though I love both genres, once this line gets crossed, my mind instinctively recoils. This happened when the Beast was presented. Yes, mind over matter is a powerful message, but there are physical limitations to this. Had this been a fantastical story, I would have been okay with it, but if you set a story within our world as we know it, no one should be able to simply walk off shotgun wounds. Also, I found it completely unnecessary because the Beast letting Casey go based on her scars would have followed the logic of the story well enough. To me, the whole supernatural angle undermined and cheapened the overall story.<br/><br/>3. The thing that bothered me the most, however, was the psychiatrist. How was this quack ever allowed anywhere near patients?! She deliberately ignored signs, completely dismissed quite a dramatic change, presumed she could impose intimacy on a personality she had not met before, and never even thought about involving the police.<br/><br/>Overall, I am quite torn about this film. I expected I would either hate it or that it would pleasantly surprise me. Instead, I got an even worse outcome. I feel it could have been decent, if only...<br/><br/>Given a better screenplay and different editing, it could have been a good standalone movie. But the compromises made in order to set it up for a supernatural ""universe"" took away too much of the storyline in service of the box office, and that, for me, is always going to be a dealbreaker."

","Allow me to enthuse about the true merit of a movie that starts off very, very promising, but steadily begins to derail and SPLIT apart with an uneven performance, at times seriously flawed, by the lead actor. That said, this is a good movie, it certainly has some suspenseful moments, but all in all, built on a bunch of psycho-babble claptrap... I mean, I watch a buncha vampire TV shows and superheroine TV shows, but ol' Betty Buckley here with her these people's suffering and trauma brought us to the breakthrough, aw, bull, come on...! Metamorphosis is best left to caterpillars.<br/><br/>Largely disappointing except for one. There is a jewel of a performance in this movie, Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke, oh, that beautifully-intense girl with the long, long brown hair and the soulful brown doe eyes. She's the one who should be mentioned as the true acting talent, because she was consistent all the way through... (and the reason for me being on this one, for I got a sneak preview of the parking lot scene)<br/><br/>Too much old lady. Too little of the two other victim girls. Too little Beast. Too much Hedwig. Oh, and by the way, when alter-ego Patricia was on the scene, gee whiz, a guy in high heels, attack, attack, attack, off balance, couldn't have recovered...! :)<br/><br/>Anya 10/10, movie started off like an eight or nine, but gets a dismal seven on merit with minus points for failed opportunity to make something better worthy off Anya = 6 points<br/><br/>And I won't be signing up for the sequel or prequel, thanks."

However, it's clear that this beastly 24th personality is no super hero, he's a villain...with super powers. That's right! A super villain!<br/><br/>Why couldn't they just leave the film as a thriller without having to introduce the idea that his personality disorder eventually imbued him with super human abilities?! What were they thinking?! By this point the plot becomes corny, silly and overdone because the thriller dimension is shattered.<br/><br/>I think a thriller should be at least believable to some extent in order to achieve and sustain your interest and excitement.

","When the Visit came out, it seemed like Shyamalan was coming out of rock bottom. With Split, he shows a continuum of that momentum. However, unlike the Visit, this is not an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Split is the story (actually to call it a story is being a bit generous) of Kevin Crumb, a man with 24 personalities. In the opening scene, he highjacks a car, and kidnaps three girls. They are kept in a locked room, in what looks like a renovated heritage building. Every now and then the door opens and the girls get a visit from one of Kevin's, alter egos. The movie intercuts between the girls escape attempts and Kevin's session with his doctor.<br/><br/>The fundamental problem with Split is that there is really no story to tell. It feels like an isolated chapter of a larger narrative, and indeed it is, (tying in to Unbreakable and the follow up movie Glass). The editing is erratic, including flashbacks into the life of the principle heroine, whom the movie is not about. On top of that, the whole catalyst of the plot. (the kidnapping) is never coherently explained.<br/><br/>The movie is at its most compelling in the smaller scenes, such as when the camera is on McAvoy and his doctor. We see a character who is paradoxically fighting to keep his secrets yet at the same time to reveal them.<br/><br/>In the end, Split is watchable because of McAvoy. As he ping pongs between his personalities and emotions, he creates a 'poly-character' that is simultaneously whimsical, and frightening, even sympathetic at times. The personalities are self aware that they exist to 'protect' their host. Whether or not this is an accurate picture of a mental condition is sometimes questionable. The line between mental ability and supernatural is raised in a rather expository (and obviously fore shadowing) scene midway through the picture. The 24th personality of 'The Beast' (yet to be seen) keeps getting mentioned in conversation, which unfortunately is the movies only dramatic momentum. It leads to a rather cliched horror film climax, in underground tunnels, with the heroine's clothes getting progressively shredded (another cliche).<br/><br/>
In the end Split is a mediocre movie about a fascinating character."

The films I am 100% sure I'm reviewing in this series are: Signs, The Sixth Sense, The Happening and Glass. But enough about that let's get right into the meat of it!<br/><br/>First off, I gotta give mad props to James Mcavoy in this movie. He really puts himself out there and honestly should have gotten an Oscar or at least nominated for his performance. The plot was intriguing and interesting. The lead girl was good and convincing as well as the old lady in it. The Horde (James Mcavoy) was genuinely threatening and unpredictable and you understood their motivations. Hedwig was funny and Mrs. Patricia and Dennis have their moments. The Beast was scary than I expected. Shyamalan really puts faith in the audience for this one and you can tell. I like how the main character's backstory gets slowly revealed to you, because she feels so calm when she's kidnapped and you learn why.<br/><br/>This however is not a perfect movie. (Unlike Unbreakable.) The first 10-15 minutes are really bad and everyone brought their C game. The acting from the bimbos that are kidnapped with the lead girl is consistently bad.<br/><br/>I won't spoil (even though everyone knows now) but the twist is AMAZING. 8/10 for me.

I think that bit of a reveal worked towards my enjoyment of the movie far more than it should have. Since this is a non spoiler review, I will simply say its one of those rear treats from Shyamalan who was once a rising film director that eventually faded to obscurity after a sling of failed movies.

","Phenomenal performance by McAvoy who disappears into all of the characters he plays, perfectly making them distinguishable even when the personality has only limited time on screen. Especially impressive is the scene where during a monologue in front of a mirror, he seamlessly goes through multiple personalities within just beats, each only lasting a line.<br/><br/>The plot is however predictable and heavily spoiled by the trailers, sometimes even seeming to drag along to the admittedly unexpected sequel setup. Another issue is characters motivations & actions or, rather, inaction. But I guess in such a movie you are expected to suspend a lot of disbelief, like three girls not even trying to overpower one medium sized guy.<br/><br/>Also present are some sporadic philosophical arguments about the strength of the human psyche and how trauma shapes people or even strengthens us."
"bowmanblue","7","0","0","21 January 2019"," Contains the most well-publicised 'twist' ever
","Once upon a time, film-maker M. Night Shyamalan could do no wrong. Then, almost as abruptly, he could do no right. He made 'The Visit' which some claimed went some way to regain his previously excellent reputation, but it wasn't until 'Split' which really reinforced that he was back in business.<br/><br/>His early films became synonymous with having a 'twist' at the end - one that you never saw coming. However, once audiences got wise to this trait, he stopped trying - especially when the twists became a little too over the top to be believable. 'Split' has, what you might call, a 'twist.' And, once this became common knowledge, it seemed to help the film snowball and become much bigger than its initial predictions. Whereas most people respected others enough not to let slip the ending to Shyamalan's earlier films such as 'The 6th Sense' and 'Unbreakable,' reviews seemed to be only too happy to give the ending away in order to help promote it. So, with that view mind, I too will let everyone know that the ending implies that 'Split' is actually (a kind of indirect) sequel to 'Unbreakable.'<br/><br/>However, it's definitely not a requisite to have watched Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson's 2001 outing in order to understand 'Split.' Here, James McAvoy plays a man who suffers from 'multiple personality disorders.' To be precise he has 23 personalities, most completely bonkers, but even his worst doesn't compare to the 24th personality which is on its way. He then kidnaps three teenage girls and they have to work out how to escape before this psychotic 24th personality comes into play.<br/><br/>And that's about it. You can kind of guess how everything plays out (especially now I've given away the ending - sorry!). There's actually not that much there in terms of story-telling. However, it's not all bad - mainly due to McAvoy's performance. I know that some people have called his switching from one personality to the other 'Oscar worthy.' I'm not sure how much he should have at least been nominated, but I did enjoy his performance and he puts his all into the role.<br/><br/>This contrasts to the three girls who are pretty forgettable. One gets more screentime and backstory than the other two - guess why that is? But, anyway, seeing as the film can't just be the girls failed escape attempts piled on top of each other, until one or more ultimately either gets away or dies trying, it gets padded out by plenty of flashbacks of McVoy's character visiting his psychiatrist for various exposition segments.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people have loved this film and heaped praise on it. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it and would probably watch it again some time. However, I wouldn't say it's as revolutionary as some are making out. It's long and a little drawn out at time. But, McVoy is clearly able to carry the film and the fact that it's linked to 'Unbreakable' add extra points, so to speak. It also sets up the final part of what is going to be a trilogy and will certainly get me ready to watched the upcoming concluding part, 'Glass.'"

"aciessi","9","0","0","19 January 2019"," Split Decisions
","M. Night Shyamalan walks a thin line between being clever, and overreaching in an attempt to be clever. When he succeeds, his films are astoundingly compelling and fascinating. When he fails, he makes films like ""The Happening"" and ""Lady in the Water"". There is no middle ground for Shyamalan. So where does Split fall? Fortunately, Split is a successful Shyamalan movie. Arguably, since Unbreakable, it's his most captivating film. A film that explored mental illness and trauma through an interesting perspective. Strange, considering this film was advertised as a psychological thriller. Does that sound problematic? Bear with me.<br/><br/>Kevin is our focus. He kidnaps three teenage girls and locks them in an undisclosed basement. To their horror, the three girls discover that Kevin isn't who he says he is. In fact, he's not one person, he's multiple. Men, women and children combined. What they don't know is that he is under the surveillance of a psychiatrist, Dr. Fletcher, who tries to crack the code behind his extreme case of Dissociative Identity Disorder, and whether or not it has unleashed powers within him unknown to science. The only other person that may be on to him is Casey (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), one of the three girls who herself understands what past trauma does to a fragile mind. She was molested as a young girl, whereas Kevin was verbally abused by his overbearing mother. Her goal is to escape the basement, while also trying to figure out how to tame the beast of Kevin's psyche. What she doesn't realize is that there happens to be a real beast lurking within Kevin. The 24th personality. A superhuman animal strong enough to bend steel and devour humans.<br/><br/>Split's thesis is both disturbing and endearing, if that even makes a lick of sense. Shyamalan keeps going back to the theme of the ""broken"" person. How trauma can at times harness untold, unknown abilities later on that can be used as protection mechanisms. Through the lens of a psychological horror thriller, Syamalan want's us to sympathize with Kevin and look into our own perceptions of what mental disorders really are so that we can challenge them. It all demands of a fantastic performance by James McEvoy, and he delivers full on. This is one of the unsung performances of 2017. He received no award show love. That's a crying shame.<br/><br/>There's a lot to take in, but a lot to love about Split."

"BA_Harrison","7","0","0","17 January 2019"," Lays the groundwork for Glass.
","M. Night Shyamalan's Split is essentially one long 'set-up' movie, introducing us to the many personalities of disassociative identity disorder patient Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), as well as teen-in peril Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy), both of whom play a part in the director's forthcoming Unbreakable sequel Glass.<br/><br/>As such, the film feels a little inconclusive, but still manages to be fully engrossing thanks to a standout performance from McAvoy, who brilliantly handles his character's many personalities, and a likeable turn from Taylor-Joy, who plays one of three teenage girls abducted by Crumb as food for his burgeoning twenty-fourth identity, the Beast.<br/><br/>The film is a bit head-scratching at times, but Shyamalan pulls it all together nicely for a rousing finale, and tops it off with a surprising end credits scene guaranteed to leave fans of Unbreakable champing at the bit for the next instalment in what is becoming a delightfully unorthodox superhero series."
"classicsoncall","8","0","0","17 January 2019"," ""In the sun, we will find our passion.""
","I'm probably like a lot of the viewers for M. Night Shyamalan's films, in that I felt his best efforts, ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"", came early in his career and he's struggled to match the intensity and credibility of those pictures. ""Split"", I think, gets him back on the right track with a psychological thriller that contains elements of horror, not so much for what you see on screen, but what your imagination suggests might be terrifying. I thought James McAvoy did a commendable job in a role calling for a split personality with multiple characters. I also thought the picture cleverly included a back story for the character of Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy), who was able to relate to the 'Hedwig' portion of Kevin Wendell's (McAvoy) psyche by virtue of being an abuse victim herself. The only thing I get frustrated about in stories like this is when the main protagonist is outnumbered, and the 'victims' can't or won't come to an understanding that they could take him out if they joined forces. Now maybe the 'Barry' facet of Wendell's alter-ego might have been too strong to overcome, but the 'Dennis' or 'Patricia' personalities might have succumbed to a three on one attack. Easy enough for me to say because I've never been in that position, and each of the kidnapped girls individually were too traumatized to take direct action initially. Then once they were separated, the 'gang up' option went away. The final scene of Bruce Willis reprising his character David Dunn from ""Unbreakable"" was a neat way to whet the appetite of Shyamalan fans who would never have expected a follow up to that earlier film, and I for one will be on hand to see if ""Glass"" restores some of the magic of that masterful film. My only other comment is reserved for Betty Buckley portraying the sympathetic psychologist Dr. Karen Fletcher, who's painstaking patience in attempting to reconcile Wendell's twenty three personalities ultimately ended in tragedy. Wisely, the story didn't try to account for all of them, and in Dr. Fletcher's case, it appeared that eight was enough."

","Although we didn't know it on first viewing, ""Split"" is the second film in Shaymalan's ""Unbreakable"" trilogy, due to be concluded in early 2019 with ""Glass"". In preparation for that I rewatched ""Split"" and found an entertaining film, that's undermined slightly by the necessarily low key ending.<br/><br/>Three young women; Casey (Anna Taylor-Joy), Claire (Haley Lu-Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) are kidnapped by Kevin (James McAvoy) a man with a split personality disorder whose lost control to some of the other 23 distinct personalities that live within him. Though some of those personalities are trying to get help, others are preparing for the arrival of a monstrous 24th personality.<br/><br/>What ""Split"" does have, unquestionably is a wonderful central performance from James McAvoy. He plays the principle personalities really well, so you're never not sure which personality you're seeing (apart from when the story needs it). The setup first two thirds of the movie is really solid too. It's mostly scientific justification mixed with some classic (if familiar) horror movie set up and execution. Mixed into this is some unsettling, if necessary, back story for Casey's character - explaining why she seems much more capable in the girl's predicament that Claire and Marcia. I also enjoyed the direction. Shyamalan is a much more gifted filmmaker visually beyond the ""twist master"" clichÃ© that he's become known for. (I know ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" was a bit of a trainwreck, but I'd like to see him take a few more gigs that he hasn't also written in the future).<br/><br/>Though this list of negatives might seem more comprehensive, I'd like to reiterate that overall I enjoyed it. The ending though is a bit underwhelming. I was not lost by the ""other worldly"" aspect of it, that was fine, it's more that the film doesn't build towards a real climax. Presumably they had half an eye on the sequel but still, a more contrived escape attempt, or a rescue wouldn't have undermined the characters and made for a better finale. I also felt that the gradual undressing of the girls across the movie was a bit unnecessary - it didn't play out in the story at all, and felt it was more to pacify a studio head wary about their bottom line. I was also going to criticise the heavy handed portrayal of the gay personality ""Barry"" but given time to consider it, it perhaps makes more sense given the reveal regarding that character that we get towards the end.<br/><br/>There's elements of a great movie in ""Split"" and if it was just slightly more concerned with its own plot it might have made it. Instead we've a solid character driven thriller that, if nothing else, has built my anticipation for ""Glass""."

They do think that all three of them need to attack together. Casey(Taylor-Joy, easily the second-most compelling actor in this. Very nearly first) refuses. While no one is quite sure why, soon enough the audience will find out. Every so often, the door will be opened. And it may be by the captor. However, ultimately the trio can't be sure exactly who it will be.<br/><br/>I'm not going to give away what is going on for those who wish to go in blind. You can't say very much about this without giving something major away. What I will say, and I realise I'm not alone in doing so, is that James McAvoy gives an incredible performance. I haven't watched very much of M. Night Shyamalan's work, but you'd have to be asleep for the last 15 years to not realise that, while he did deliver the goods the first time(counting from the Sixth Sense and on, as everyone does), and perhaps the next one(which is where I land on it. Unbreakable is amazing) or two, the rest of what he has put out, up to maybe The Visit, has been hated by moviegoers and critics alike. He's back. And how. This is without a doubt one of the best psychological horror films that I have ever watched. And I say that as a huge fan of the subgenre. It's claustrophobic, creepy, unsettling, and the tension is unbelievably thick. Do note that it goes incredibly far to horrify us, and there's definitely an argument to be made that some of it is gratuitous and crosses a line. Or three.<br/><br/>I'm not going to detail the messed up material in this for those who don't want to know beforehand... if you do want to know, the Parents Guide is thorough in describing it.

The Visit, which was very good, and this are his two latest which prove that he truly is a master storyteller and filmmaker combine. I have heard he wanted to make like a Marvel type movie but do it his own. And this is what he came up with and I think its better than any of the Marvel or DC super hero movies they make these days. Its original and from the heart and best of all is that M. Night is back baby!"

","McAvoy is fantastic playing a modern day version of Cybil, who was the original poster child for Multiple Personality Disorders , or DID as it's referred to now.<br/><br/>James McAvoy plays Kevin Crumb, who with the help of his Doctor, Karen Fletcher manages 23 unique personalities so that he can retain some independence in the outside world.
Unfortunately, Kevin's personality has been asleep since 2015, allowing most of the other personalities to share what is referred to as the light. Now two of the most malevolent ones, Kevin and Patricia have taken charge, and together with a third personality Hedwig, a 9 year old ""boy"", they have kidnapped three high school girls and are working together to birth a malevolent 24th personality into existence, one who's power will eclipse thr average human.<br/><br/>

"Thrashman88","6","0","0","22 October 2018"," A slow burner without a Shyamalan Twist Ending
","I like M. Night Shyamalan movies. They were sort of a commodity in the late 90s/early 2000s. ""Signals"" has to be my fave Shyamalan movie because I think it's his most original. ""The 6th Sense"" was like a watered down ""Jacob's Ladder"". With ""Split"", we deal with a psycho with multiple (and I mean MULTIPLE) personality disorder. 23 personalities linger inside James McAvoy's character, if I reckon.
Shyamalan's movies became famous for their ""twist"" ending: you expect one thing and get something totally unexpected. It's a gimmick that would eventually wear off as his movie career progressed. With ""Split"", he doesn't pull any sort of twist ending, which in this particular case would've elevated the movie to far higher level. Story plots are left unexplained or for the audience to figure out (after subsequent viewings, I might add). James McAvoy's performance is indeed OSCAR worthy, but that's about it. The movie drags along at a excruciating slow pace, giving little to no explanation to what happened before.<br/><br/>Having a psychiatric patient this sick out on his own was the film's first major mistake. I've worked with psychiatrists before and know for a FACT they would never let anyone resembling James McAvoy's character out in the open. This is a patient that requires heavy medication and heavy surveillance, yet he was living all by ""himself"" making a living doing god knows what.<br/><br/>The idea behind ""Split"" is fascinating; mental disorders can become great Hollywood fodder but in this case, Shyamalan fell very short. What's worse: linking this movie to his previous film, ""Unbreakable"" (a certified snore fest) does not help at all. At least ""Split"" is a superior movie than ""Unbreakable"". So sad he had to link both movies."

","Efore I say anything about the actual movie, I want to address something here; there has been a lot, and I mean a lot, of controversy surrounding this film, specifically for its insensitivity towards people suffering from DID, and making one of them into the villain; WTH people, have we become such a nation of victims that EVERYTHING has to offend someone? Newsflash, this isn't new, there have been countless films making villains out of people suffering from mental disorders; Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, arguably one of the best films ever made, covered this exact subject and no-one ostracized it for its insensitivity. We need to seriously start getting past this new trend of getting offended by everything, because we are turning ourselves into a nation of victims. 
Okay onto the actual movie. As we all know, M. Night Shyamalan went through bit of a rough patch for many years, but kind of redeemed himself after his 2015 film 'The Visit' got well received by both critics and audiences. 'Split' is the first film that he has released since then, and, in my opinion, is an improvement over even that film. James McAvoy nails the part of the character with 23 completely different personalities, and is actually really fascinating to watch, that not taking anything away from Anya Taylor-Joy, playing the part of one of the three kidnapped girl. Both these main actors bring a certain depth to their characters, which we haven't seen in a Shyamalan film since 'Unbreakable' back in the year 2000. The movie itself wastes absolutely no time before getting to the suspense, and trust me, it is suspenseful as hell, creating a feeling of claustrophobia that I haven't felt since 'The Descent'. Now to be a bit of a Debbie Downer, although the film had me captivated through both the first acts, it did kind of lose me in the final half hour. I knew they were going for this, as it's hinted at constantly throughout the film, but even knowing that it was coming...I was wishing they wouldn't. Before it happens, one of the characters actually speaks the line ""There have to be limits"" and I personally wish that Shyamalan had listened to his own character. My reason being that even though this film is by no stretch an accurate depiction of people suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder, the first two acts still kept it realistic enough that I could buy into the theories put forth and extend my brain to a place where this could actually be possible, the third act kind of ruined that for me. This being said, it didn't bother me so much that I started disliking the film, or that I'm saying don't go see it, because McAvoy's performance alone is worth the price of an admission's ticket, and, even though I wasn't a fan of the final act, this is still a really good movie and proves that Shyamalan still has it in him to be a really good filmmaker."

"allann-58424","10","0","0","30 August 2018"," Night returns to glorious form with Split
","Forgetiing the connections between unbreakable and Split, director and writer M. Night Shaymalan has made his best movie probably since...there's not a ton of debate about Shyamalan's best film, Sixth Sense, it made the Indian director who he is and he progressed with a string of excellent movies from then on, unbreakable was a incredible return and then he even doubled his credibility with the excellent Signs. Split would rank in as his 4th best film, and is not only a fascinating look at dissociative identity disorder with the almost credible supernatural element considering, psychoneurologies recent discoveries of our brain and quantum theory. It is hard to believe James McAvoy, though he was not the first choice for the role but became the best choice did not wrack up a myriad of awards. He just seems to be that type of actor, even in Atomic Blonde that gets the parts perfect but never gets the recognition. He knows his talents and huge following we will even forgive him for being scottish. The Village then caught viewers off guard and was a clever follow up to his straight horror, Devil was his first film he allowed input from another director, and for me it deserved more recognition, fans just weren't sure if this was an official NigHT film But it definitely was and he even plans a sequel seeing now his proposed filim of combining unbreakable with split. Sometimes it can all just all end in the directors head. Night though having his critics for The Village, seemed to begin a period when his writing could not end stories. The Hapenning, was for the most part a suspenseful thriller, and then Night, seemed to forget he had to write an ending. It was half a film and the aura Night had carried as a master film maker was slowly beginning to dim. But it gets even worse.The VISIT is next on Night's catalogue, it doesn't realise any great heights and Night would attempt, it never becomes scary and often you feel it could even be a comedy, the story showed again that at times his story telling wanders have a dispelling effect rather than hypnotising. I cannot say it but rating it this idea shows how ponderous and loose in story telling Lady in the water, was supposedly inspired from a tale he told his children when they slept and thats where it should have stayed. There is an incredible discord between his brilliance of his earlier movies and Lady in the water which now left his reputation on the scrap heap. But it gets even worse. If he was trying to change genre, surprise viewers, but I cannot what was worse. The last Air Bender, an anime, was close to hos most clueless work. By now studios should have realised Night was out of ideas for original scripts and if anyone could sit through this they truly deserve an award. I was shocked when I realised it was a Night movie and realised the man had some serious soul searching to even add an ounce of felt to his now crestfallen career. But believe if you will, if this was a favour for Will Smith, Night made the worst of all his films trying his best to show that Jaden Smith can act. Well he cannot. And I hope he is never cast again. Never mind a ludicrous storyline, Will Smith even added that the flm was the most painful moment of his career. It surely also was Night's biggest plodding mess and ranks as the nadir of his career, a low of lows. I have skipped out some earlier Night movie's as they are far from his Hollywood conquests. <br/><br/>So it was with absolute relief that we have waited since Devil for a Night film, that can be added to his classics. He clearly will not make other film makers scripts and I am hoping he doesn't get too entangled in his obsession with the unbreakable/split idea. Sequels are the fashion and if he can get McAvoy and Bruce Willis together and write a tight script there is potential. We all love many of his films but 10 to 20 years hanging around, surely should show him he either must allow for extra help on the scripts . He was my favourite director before christopher nolan brothers and having Night make if not regular but hypnotic, supernatural films would be a fantastic pleasure. p.s it is worrying if the Nolan brothers are going the same way after the plodding dull fest of Dunkirk. I dont know it was rated an 8, most likely due to director reputation but we know how quickly that fades. Split is worth every moment and a wonderful return to form for Night even if we had to wait....."

","This movie tells the story of Kevin Wendell Crumb, a patient suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder, having 23 personalities living on his head, each one being able to change the chemistry of his body. This personalities are waiting to take the ""Light"" or the ""Spot"" of Kevin. One day, at the beginning of the film, he kidnaps three girls, saying they are important for ""thr beast"", another persona inside Kevin that is waiting to take the ""ligth"". <br/><br/>This movie is great. The plot is very well unfold scene by scene, reaching the climax with the espectator fully connected to it's characters and intrigue. Maybe it starts a little bit slow, and the lack of a characteristics music makes it hard to keep up, but if you are one of those who don't want to miss a thing, you've got to watch it with full concentration.<br/><br/>The character(s) of Kevin is the best thing of the movie, being portrayed by James McCavoy with an outstanding performance, changing completely his character in a few seconds. I really liked his backstory, and the explanation to the persona of The Beast. Cassey is also an interesting character, developing her backstory progressively through flashbacks, making it haunting and thrilling. What I didn't like was the other two kidnapped girls. They are a bit cliché, plus their acting is a bit mediocre.<br/><br/>
Technically this movie is great too. It has a very haunting color pallette, even though it's not very wide, but coloring every scene with warm, yellow tones. The composition of the shots are interesting, because sometimes the scenes are cut, showing a portion of the characters and the situations, doing justice to the title, 'Split'.<br/><br/>The scenography fullfils it's purpose, placing the characters and the espectators in a very claustrophobic ambient, sharing the haunting and thrilling feel of being kidnapped by a mad man, 23 mad men, however. <br/><br/>Finally, when you reach the ending you can be one of two kind of person: the one that doesn't understand what's the point of that scene; or the other kind, who understands that this movie is part of a larger universe, leading to a future crossover."

","At the outset of this movie, I loved the premise, a suspenseful thriller with 3 girls kidnapped and having to manage a way to escape a man with over 20 varying personalities. It was an exceedingly interesting concept and as the plot and the character of Kevin developed, it only became more compelling. James McAvoy did an excellent job with one of the more difficult roles imaginable in the film industry. Where this movie faltered, and in a major way, was the ending, in which Kevin becomes ""The Beast,"" a new manifestation of his personality disorder that is essentially a supervillain that his brain has willed into existence. The movie departed from the suspenseful, intense story of a fairly believable character with a split personality disorder into this fantastical horror movie that was bordering on ridiculous. I think that the movie still had enough entertainment value and a compelling enough story to manage a 5/10 but I was entirely disappointed by the decision to wrap this story up with the unleashing of The Beast."

Dear god!). While 2015's The Visit returned him as a director that's a force to be reckoned with, with Split he got even better, giving us perhaps his greatest movie yet. James McAvoy may get overlooked by the Oscars for his multilayered performance, but those that pay attention know how hard it really is to pull a multiple personality disorder off and have it not be laughable."

","Slight spoilers for those of you who haven't figured out the twist yet, even if it's pretty obvious. <br/><br/>I'm gonna try and keep this short and sweet : this movie isn't a mess, but isn't flawless neither. <br/><br/>The acting of our two leads (James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy) is pretty solid but the side characters (especially the Psychiatrists) could use some polish. <br/><br/>The script is interesting and well crafted, but sometimes feels a bit convoluted and strange and strange for some. Some of the scenes in this movie ask the viewer to suspend their disbelief and accept the some-what strange interaction between the characters. "" Why couldn't they hear the scuffle behind the car?"" ""Why did it take that long for McAvoy to notice Taylor-Joy in the car?"" ""Why isn't she fighting back?"" ""Why is that train empty?"" those aren't the question the viewers should be asking, it's not the point. This isn't supposed to be a realistic portrayal of abduction nor an analytical piece on people with mental illness. This is a movie about two people finding strength in trauma, one of them in a perverse and unhealthy way.<br/><br/>Again, this movie is about trauma, not mental illness. <br/><br/>Lastly, the camera work was a bit shabby at first (the first scene seemed to me like a slightly better version of the train scene in unbreakable, shaky and poor), but stabilized as the movie went along and ended up really good by the end. I especially liked the transitions between the present and the flashbacks They never get in the way and enhance the dramatic tension.<br/><br/>Overall good movie. I wasn't a fan of the BIG twist at the end and the third act seemed a bit rushed, but still a good watch."

","Horror movies are not really my kind of movies, but this one I liked. Perhaps that is there is a lot more emphasis on the thriller part of the movie than the horror part. And the horror part is much more the psychological kind of horror than blood, gore, violence and shocking moments (though there are a few exceptions that are quite bloody I should mention)<br/><br/>A man with split personalities abduct three teenage girls and lock them in his basement. There is always a very tense and heavy atmosphere, and honestly quite sickening atmosphere, both in the basement and thus in the movie. A few of the personalities are hostile to the girls, a few a symphatetic. The friendly ones warn of the last personality, The Beast. There is always a promise of something bad happening hanging in the air, but what? Violent? Sexual? It is not pronounced and adds to the uneasy tense emotions. In that aspect, ut really is a horror movie.<br/><br/>Shyamalan has returned here with a really good script, acted out very well of the small cast. A special mention must go to McAvoy for his portrayal of the abductor. Fantastic.<br/><br/>For all the Shyamalan fans out there, this is highly recommended, although you might not find the usual twist you expect...<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

This movie is also less refined and more raw than the director's previous films, and is far better than his most recent effort previously (2015's THE VISIT).<br/><br/>James McAvoy plays the main character, and his acting is incredible as he transforms into several of the personalities.

As for the signature ""M.

The way that he can essentially play five different characters in the same movie is mind-blowing, but sometimes it's a bit jarring and awkward, but that might just lie in the humour of the movie, which I liked.<br/><br/>I did have an issue with the constant stoic look of our main protagonist, but that's explained through a backstory which, overall, kinda makes sense.<br/><br/>The Fictional element of this movie about the body chemistry changing thing was interesting, and since we never witnessed it really ""happen"", it keeps you in the dark to the ""Monster"", capitalizing off of our inherent fear of the unknown.<br/><br/>Yes. There are jumpscares. That's cheap scares. Moving on.<br/><br/>The secondary protagonists are forgettable, so it's hard to really get invested in them, unlike our main protagonist, who's backstory is well-weaved through the movie, as well as holds plot importance.<br/><br/>effects were good, as well as cinematography, capitalizing off of dark corridors with well done lighting during the final scenes to hide the ""Final Form"" of our antagonist, which, again, capitalizes off our fear of the unknown to the very end.<br/><br/>Overall, great movie.

"TheLittleSongbird","6","6","20","4 February 2017"," Feelings are fairly ""split"" here
","As said in my recent review for 'The Visit', M Night Shyamalan is one inconsistent director, with films that have fallen on both extreme sides of the film spectrum. The great films being 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' and the terrible films (especially) being 'The Last Airbender', 'The Happening' and 'After Earth'. It was frustrating to see a director start so promisingly and fall downhill and showing few signs of learning from his mistakes.<br/><br/>'Split' now replaces 'The Visit' as Shyamalan's best film since 'The Village. Neither were perfect films or were to me the returns to form often touted, both with many great things which made it more frustrating that they also had flaws big enough to stop them from living to full potential. Ranking 'Split' with the rest of the films, it's for me one of his better ones (while 'The Visit' is somewhere in the middle), not a patch on 'Unbreakable' and especially 'The Sixth Sense' but certainly better than all his previous films post-'The Village' (and that is saying volumes, due to that the least bad of his ""panned"" films 'Lady in the Water' was still poor).<br/><br/>The best thing about 'Split' is the performance of James McAvoy, who has never been creepier on film and it is a side that is just startling to watch. He has a very difficult role here, with 20+ very contrasting personalities sometimes having to change without warning quite violently and absolutely nails it in a way that one wouldn't think would expect from him. Anya Taylor Joy is more than up to his level in an enigmatic turn that combines shock, spunk and pathos. As is Betty Buckley in a sympathetic role that she does a lot with.<br/><br/>Production design, lighting and effects have a real eeriness that adds hugely to the atmosphere, while the cinematography is significantly better than it was in 'The Visit', having an audacious and atmospheric professionalism and not done with a technique that will alienate (and has alienated) many. The music is suitably eerie, and Shyamalan does direct more than competently in building on the scares and tension.<br/><br/>Apart from an ever so slightly dull beginning, much of the film up to the last half an hour is genuinely scary and suspenseful, with many twisty suspenseful turns, a sense of fun, frightening chills and contortions enough to bend the mind, more than delivering on the horror and psychological thriller elements.<br/><br/>However, the last half an hour does disappoint, with a revelation that while certainly not obvious (far from it, actually very much unexpected) is revealed prematurely still which does hurt the momentum and tension, horror and suspense is replaced by head-scratching confusion (in the execution that is because it did feel muddled and under-explained) and behaviours and decisions that will induce groans of frustration. Unfortunately that last personality was as far from realistic or properly scary as one could possibly get (not McAvoy's fault at all, actually he did give the needed creepiness, but what he was given which was goofy), coming over as pretty silly actually and that jarred.<br/><br/>Writing could have been much better, with a better and less awkward flow, the dialogue could have been less clunky and forced as well as less sloppily melodramatic. The victims also were written very lazily, constantly making stupid and illogical decisions that makes one frustrated at them rather than rooting for them.<br/><br/>On the whole, fairly split here. A lot of great merits but could have been better. Still one of Shyamalan's better films, just not enough to make me proclaim ""he's back!"" 6/10 Bethany Cox"

","Split (2017) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>James McAvoy plays a man with twenty-three different personalities who kidnaps three young girls and holds them hostage in an unknown location.<br/><br/>Normally I offer up more more of a plot description but the less you know about this film the better you'll enjoy it. M. Night Shyamalan's SPLIT is certainly a very interesting movie that clearly seems to have been inspired by the various Brian De Palma thrillers that he directed throughout his career. I had a couple major issues with the film but there's still no doubt that the director-writer is back on top of his game in this well-made and at times tense thriller.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed most about the film should come as no surprise. James McAvoy really gets to shine in this film as you'd expect since he plays so many different characters. I'm not going to spoil all of the personalities but it was really amazing getting to see a talented actor play a chess match and come up with the various different personalities and bringing little touches to each of them. There are a few scenes where the actor is forced to go from one character to another in the matter of seconds and he perfectly nails it. There's no question that he brings a wide range of emotions as there are times where you feel bad for him and other times where he's downright creepy to say the least. All of the supporting cast are good but Ana Taylor Joy deserves a special mention.<br/><br/>The screenplay most takes place inside this unknown location where we see the three girls being stalked by one personality after another. The film exits the location a couple times including introducing us to the man's doctor who is trying to control the personalities as well as some flashback scenes dealing with the main girl's childhood. It's here where I think the film makes it's biggest mistake. I don't mind anything that's in the actual film but it ends up running at a 118-minutes and I thought this was a bit too long and slow. I think everything in the film could have worked much better with a faster pace and perhaps a tighter editing job.<br/><br/>With that said, there's no question that SPLIT holds your attention throughout and yes, there's that ending, which I certainly won't spoil here but I found it to be excellent. It's great that Shyamalan is back and doing such fine work and I really can't wait to see what he does next."

Then, all of the sudden, he starts releasing some bad, bad movies (""The Happening"", ""The Last Airbender""...). Then he redeemed himself with 2015's The Visit which was quite a refreshing thing for the found footage genre and it took everyone by surprise. That gave a bit more hope for this one when it was getting released. And now we can finally safely say that Shyamalan is back on track!<br/><br/>I've always liked Shyamalan as a director. He had some horrible movies, but still, he was one of the only ones who mostly had original stories and ideas with movies and that alone makes me respect him. I expected this to be good, but it took me off guards. It's his best since ""The Sixth Sense"" and I'd even go as far to say that it's even better. It has a small opening scene and then it throws you straight into action to assure that you're following. Then, after that, you get to know the backstories and characters little by little. And each new reveal, pumps up the anxiety of this film. From the first few minutes, Shyamalan assures that he has our attention and the feeling of uneasiness grows throughout the movie. Visually, the film looks beautiful and cinematography is fantastic. But even though everything impressed me about this film, there's one more particular thing that blew me away and that's James McAvoy. He has to get recognition on the next awards season. It would be a crime if he got snubbed. Let's just hope he doesn't get overshadowed by someone who got a certain accent right or who perfectly portrayed a mental breakdown in one scene because McAvoy does it all here. He was incredible and boosted up the creepiness in some scenes. The rest of the cast is pretty good too, but all of them are overshadowed by McAvoy. And also, you might know Shyamalan is known for twist endings. Trust me, you WON'T see this one coming.<br/><br/>I have no flaws with this film. I loved absolutely everything about it. It's for now my favorite movie of 2017 and it's likely to stay that way. But, you never know."

","James McAvoy is the only reason to watch Split. He is a man with 23 separate and distinct personalities. Three high school girls are abducted from a parking lot in a Pennsylvania town. Kevin(McAvoy) has placed them in a room and appears as a different person with each encounter, including one as a little boy. He also is a regular patient of a college professor, Dr. Fletcher(Betty Buckley), who not only treats him as a client, but uses him in lectures as an example of an extreme multiple personality disorder. The three victims are downright silly and the doctor clueless as to just how dangerous her pet project is to society. His means of financial support are never explained and how he is able to survive and live in some abandoned building with no one seeing him come and go is absurd. M. Night Shyamalan has left too many gaping plot holes here. He uses a flashback involving one of the girls as a small child in the woods with her father and uncle hunting deer. It makes no sense as to the rest of the story. McAvoy is riveting as he transitions from one personality to the next with both voice and body mannerisms that are uncanny. I was impressed with him previously in another movie from Scotland in 2013 which is fairly unknown, Filth. He is hilarious as a corrupt policeman and it is a better film then Split."

Night knows the magic of silence and quietness in the movie just make us wonder whats the next thing. Acting as 23 different persons even for a short periods is such a big task, James nailed it. A little more Horror and thrill in the movie would have been wonders. Still a good watchable movie."

","""Paisa Vasool"" (Hindi expression often used by satisfied moviegoers exiting the theatre) means ""Money's Worth"" and that's what you can expect to get from watching 'Split.' James McAvoy gives one of his career's best performance(s) and his director M. Night finally redeems himself with a much deserved and long awaited blockbuster comeback from a career slump following a string of poorly conceived & received box office under performers (The Happening, The Last Airbender, The Lady in the Water & After Earth). Finally, M. Night has returned to the beast mode he was in when he gave us (The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village & Unbreakable) and you dare not leave your brain at home for this one because there is a lot of thinking, comparing & remembering required. Special props to the attention paid to stereotypes in this film, the embodiment of those clearly defined roles and filling them was impeccable & quite remarkable. If you loved 'Identity' & 'Unbreakable' you will love 'Split.'"

","Three girls are being kidnapped and held hostage in mysterious place which is held by Kevin, a man with dissociative identity disorder. It is one creepy, terrific, disturbing and dark ride from the beginning to the end of the movie. As we learn more and more about Kevin and some of his personalities it gets more and more complicated and it starts to get really dark. With constant mention of the Beast and some doubts about it which are beautifully given us by Kevin's psychiatrist Fletcher. Only Casey from those three girls has a real values to story and with flashbacks that were from beginning weird and seemed like something was off they towards end filled magnificently and gave a real power to story. From early age and abuse that Kevin experienced now he developed mechanisms to keep him from harm and some so evil and powerful that will blow our minds. Tension kept building up really fast and time has come to final act of the movie. It was insane how vision of Shyamalan went to screen. It was bloody, dark, terrific, horrible and very disturbing. All praise to James McAvoy for playing 9 characters out of 23 (24) and his brilliant performance as well as characters shifting scene which was mind blowing. Shyamalan creation has returned more powerful than ever and there is much to say to his creation of this beautiful story. 4/4<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT! Considering flashbacks it was quite fitting to have them in way that Night put them so he could not give us too many information but kept us wondering and trying to figure things out. Showing the Beast and it's power is pretty intense with some great capabilities for further development. As some other characters in Unbreakable universe this one feels really superior and dark. Cafe scene was such a great ending for the movie and it finally gave this movie a genre, place and power that it deserved."
"Troy_Campbell","7","5","16","1 February 2017"," Tense, exciting and a welcome return to form for Shyamalan.
","The double whammy of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable saw filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan ascend to the throne as the master of twists. Yet after delivering a string of debacles (The Happening, The Last Airbender, and After Earth) his title was lost, seemingly forever. Thanks to a career shakeup—involving collaboration with super successful low-budget producer Jason Blumhouse (Paranormal Activity, The Purge)—Shyamalan has announced his return to form with this creepy psychological thriller. Creating an atmosphere of dread via constant tension building and a genuinely unpredictable narrative, Shyamalan is back to his old tricks of misdirection, rug-pulling and Kafka-esque storytelling. Opening with the kidnapping of three teenage girls in an utterly unnerving sequence, the tale unravels to explore the complicated lives of both abductee Casey (Anna Taylor Joy) and split-personality abductor Kevin (James McAvoy). Or is it Barry? Or Patricia? Chewing the scenery with aplomb, McAvoy delights in a role that allows him to segue between an obsessive compulsive weirdo, a frightfully stern mother-figure, a whimsical (and hilarious) 9 year old, and, in the final act, something else entirely. There are undoubtedly flaws—an underwhelming and frustratingly ambiguous climax for example—in addition to a few nonsensical genre tropes, but the film's tempo and energy diminishes the negative effects of these missteps. Possibly a transcendent movie short of regaining his old position amongst Hollywood royalty, Split is nevertheless an exciting and gratifying thriller that continues the Shyamalanaissance."

","The one that wrote this movie actually started writing a movie about a child that was abused in the childhood by his mother. But he has more than one personality and the other one wonted to write about split personality but there is a third personality that wonted to write about molested female child who was abused by her pedophile uncle to prove to the first personality his mother didn't abuse him but did normal parenting. And then the forth one who is a piece of shi* wrote about human who becomes human animal because he is a piece of shi* with a sense of humor. I don't know but I think the writer has a problem and should talk to the doctor...Oooh never mind they killed her... Ouu and thanks to the fifth personality who just doesn't like girls and wants to make a point on new generations and just putting it out there that young girls are unworthy of living, you are just food, sorry that's higher purpose... I think boys should be food... Or maybe I am just mad because of the beginning of the movie and aaaallll the important names that are sooo important, more than the movie itself! Well I didn't read any, so who won? All in all I didn't realize it a children movie when I got in the movie theater and saw all the kid's I realized it's a children movie when the kiss scene was on and he sad that she could be pregnant now and they all laugh't so hard. Oh did I say it is a movie for children because if you don't behave and be good the monster will come and eat you ALIVE! James McAvoy did a good job, but I think he is also disappointed because he thought he would act 23 personalities and ended acting only eight I think..."

","I've been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan ever since I saw The Sixth Sense (1999), though I must admit that his last couple films haven't been good. Split changes that.<br/><br/>The story of a man with 23 different personalities living inside him, with the 24th, known as The Beast soon emerging. The idea is original when everything coming out of Hollywood is a repeat. The writing, dialogue and camera work are all done with such precision. M. Night has an eye for camera angles and this is the best it has ever been. The acting from all players were top notch, but the stand out is from James McAvoy, who plays each personalty perfectly. He was creepy and chilling and why he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar is beyond me.<br/><br/>Of course, what is an M. Night movie without a twist. There are actually to in this one, but the biggest twist is the last 30 seconds, and I wont spoil it, but If you've watched M. Night's movies, this one will leave you speechless. It actually gave me chills.<br/><br/>I honestly have nothing negative to say about this movie. This is M. Night back at the top of his game and I can't wait to see what he does next."
"zkonedog","7","4","12","24 February 2017"," Doesn't Always Make Sense, But So Much Fun You May Not Care
","The resume of filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan reads like a roller coaster: Peak (Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs), Decline (Village, Lady In The Water), complete bottoming out (Happening, Devil, Last Airbender, After Earth), and recent resurgence (Visit). ""Split"" fits right in with that narrative, as it turns out to be Shyamalan's best movie this decade.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Split"" sees three teenagers Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), Marcia (Jessica Sula), and Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) abducted by a mysterious man (James McAvoy) who seems to be harboring multiple personalities. As the girls struggle to find a way to stay alive and escape, the man's therapist (Betty Buckley) starts smelling something fishy, while flashbacks show that Casey may have some similar demons in common with this mystery kidnapper.<br/><br/>""Split"" is more of a psychological thriller than, say, ""The Visit"", and I think that really suits Shyamalan's filmmaking style. He's great at creating an atmosphere of tension and setting up some really creepy scenarios. There is even a sliver of ""real science"" permeating the film that at least tries to ground it in reality a bit. What it all adds up to is a film that is equal parts creepy and fun.<br/><br/>That being said, ""Split"" doesn't always make sense or amount to the scale it seems to be built upon. In other words, the setup is significantly better than the climax. Even the traditional ""twist ending"" from Shyamalan, though present here, is of a completely different variety than his usual shenanigans (probably a good thing, though, in all honestly). Like I said, though, ""Split"" is just so much fun to watch as it's rolling along that its shortcomings are usually overshadowed.<br/><br/>The acting in ""Split"" also goes into the ""plus"" column. McAvoy is truly a treat (a performance worthy of anything that will be featured at the Oscars), while Taylor-Joy continues to establish herself (after ""The Witch"") as an up-and-coming star.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Split"" is the kind of film that epitomizes what Shyamalan is all about. It isn't his peak, but it does showcase his taut, spooky, madcap style of movie-making. It may not hold up to intense scrutiny, but it was one of the most enjoyable, exciting film experiences I've had of late."

His acting in this film is incredible. He plays a man with 23 distinct personalities including women and a child. I think we see him portray nine on screen and he plays them all so differently with different mannerisms, facial expressions and speech patterns.

","First of all, I really appreciated James McAvoy's effort to deliver a good performance. His character had lots of potential for him to work on, and I think he did a pretty good job. Beyond that, I thought the movie had lots of plot holes. So many opportunities for the girls to think of a plan to take him down, especially when he was impersonating the harmless kid, but they never took advantage of that?!... And I didn't quite understand why the kidnapping of the girls? Was there a point to it? Was is random? Why them? And for what reason? Were these frightened girls the symbol of what was wrong with the world on McAvoy's mind? And what was the reason for the cannibalism? What was that all about? And then the guy realizes he made a mistake when we sees the scars on the girl's body?! We have to concede that the story is a little bit dubious... I gave it a 6 for McAvoy."
"jadagirl","8","3","8","27 May 2017"," I enjoyed it
","Hello 'Split'. I was glad to see M. Night returning back to what made me like his movies in the first place. While the end did not have the twists of Unbreakable or Sixth Sense, the build up of characters and the suspense of the situation made it a good watch.<br/><br/>So I learned long ago that sometimes people just don't get a movie, the context behind it, why the characters behave such and such, and instead just write it off as stupid. A lot of the negativity I read in reviews (after I watched the movie of course) were made by people not understanding, or just didn't take the time to understand that the lead girl behaved the way she did because of what happened to her, the other girls were not 'dumb, slow, twittering idiots' but actually did try to rescue themselves. And they WERE teenagers, so of course they wouldn't be expecting anyone other than dad to be around. I can say quite easily that when I was a teenager it was all about getting good grades, hanging with friends, and living in our own bubble.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, I liked this movie. There is very little in terms of blood, guts and gore, so if that is what you are expecting, move on. McAvoy was fantastic as the antagonist and made you believer in multiple personalities. Taylor-Joy was also very believable as our damaged heroine. In the end, watch it for yourself. If you liked Shyamalan back in the day I think you will like this one."
"bilderbergr","9","3","8","26 May 2017"," I've reached a Split Decision -Contains Spoilers-
","I've always dreamed of writing a review on IMDb.<br/><br/>Well, not really. Just seemed like an odd comment to start a review of what is an usual movie to rate.<br/><br/>This film starts off strong, but does tend to get a bit sluggish and somewhat repetitive. I'll come back to touch on the ending.<br/><br/>James McAvoy proves he's a really fine actor - Betty Buckley is a joy to watch as well. The other actors seem shallow and unconvincing by comparison.<br/><br/>This movie, given the lead's multiple personalities, led me to consider what I now realize I've known for some time. If the actor or actress has a likable personality or intriguing characteristics in real life viewers tend to relate and enjoy watching them regardless of the character they play in a particular film.<br/><br/>Split certainly contains plot holes and clichés, but there's some truly interesting aspects of this film as well(Spoilers ahead): -The notion that multiple personality disorders may manifest and affect one's mental as well as physical attributes -Individuals greatly affected by traumatic life experiences can transfer that to a source of great inner strength -There's a lot of creepy uncles out there.<br/><br/>Now for the list of items this film would have benefited from removing (again Spoilers): - Absurdly loud knocking on walls to ultimately find a hollow area of ceiling, taking 10 minutes to remove said sheet rock with a high heel shoe while others miraculously hold the door closed. Escape into an unnecessarily large air duct - only to hide in a locker and get caught.<br/><br/>-Girl with no pants and under high duress using a coat hanger slid through the top of a door to open the slide lock on the other side of the door. Anyone that has attempted to use a coat hanger to open a car lock in plain sight realizes it's absurd to think the hanger could be bent and used with such precision to latch onto a small knob that can't be seen.<br/><br/>-Girl's father teaches her how to shoot a gun in flashback scene. Apparently she wasn't a good student as she totally waste countless opportunities to kill her assailant.<br/><br/>-24 toothbrushes and convenient voice dialogues on PC with any password protection.<br/><br/>-Finally, Bruce Willis' character from Unbreakable cameo at the end. It would seem he hasn't yet figured out how to parlay his indestructibility into anything profitable as he has on the same blue collar clothes.<br/><br/>But this led me to consider there could be an interesting point to all Shyamalan's less than stellar movies...could he be telling us all one larger story in parts? Are his films and characters all just pieces that will all merge into one future film? Now that would be the ultimate twist."

I hope it is possible to do another even if it's a prequel as it sounds like some of the personalities have a colourful past.<br/><br/>Even though James McAvoy stole the film, the rest of The cast were well chosen for their roles. I will be watching this again and rewatching more M. Night films.

Night Shyamalan's work, so I went into this movie knowing that I would probably like it. I think that James McAvoy was perfectly cast and also rising star Anya Taylor Joy. Anya Taylor Joy's character was a very interesting girl and I really liked her! I like her character development and flashbacks. She was a strong fighter throughout the film and I enjoyed that. I was a huge fan of the personality named Hedwig, I thought he was hilarious. I was afraid at first that I would get lost and confused with all of the personalities, but thankfully the film elaborates on several of them so no confusion happened. Whenever the Beast personality arrived near the end, I was completely hooked on what was going to happen.

","I was once a fan of M Night Shyamalan. I absolutely love The Village and Signs and feel he was on a fantastic creative run at one point. That ended when he made The Happening and then even worse, The Last Airbender. I thought The Visit was a nice reminder that he could bring forth an entertainingly thrilling film. I was hoping Split would give me the satisfaction of being comparable to M Nights' glory days but I am sad to say I am disappointed.<br/><br/>The film is about three teenage girls who are unexpectedly kidnapped in a parking lot by a mentally ill man with dissociative identity disorder. He has 23 different personalities and a 24th called the beast which seems to be the most threatening of them all. The hype for this one seemed to be real and I heard many raving about it but I didn't have fun during this film.I know many won't agree with some of my criticisms but I wish I could have liked this more.<br/><br/>First of all the film should have been shorter. There were areas of the film that dragged. M Night was trying to build tense moments , a lot of which I felt fell short and were worn out. I have a background in psychology and know of dissociative identity disorder but am certain that a lot of the elements of it were fantastical. Too many personalities and that final form stuff just doesn't gel well and borders on silly. Not to mention the shift between characters feels incoherent at times. Saying all that I have to say that James McAvoy is absolutely superb in this. Like so alluringly good. I'm glad an actor of his caliber was able to showcase his range and ability although I wish the film was written better.<br/><br/>The transpiring of some of the events were so stupid. There are a few plot holes but I couldn't ever really sit back and enjoy the film. The three actresses did a decent job, Anya Taylor-Joy will certainly become a big name but I have a hard time getting over the implausibility and the buildup to the final act. I don't want to say anything that will spoil it for other viewers but the ending is pretty cool and a nice callback to a time where M Night was on top of his craft.<br/><br/>6/10"
"cherold","8","3","9","20 October 2017"," dark and suspenseful, but ignore people who claim there's a twist ending
","Split is possibly the most creepy and suspenseful movie of director Shymalan's career. This dark film follows three girls kidnapped by a man with multiple personalities, brilliantly played by James McAvoy, whose transitions from one personality to another are seamless and who maintains a disturbed, threatening quality through all of them.<br/><br/>The movie was, however, slightly wrecked for me because I was trying to guess the ""twist"" that some critics claim the movie has. And here's the thing to know: no one would be saying this movie had a twist if it wasn't directed by someone famous for his twists.<br/><br/>A twist is when you are lead to believe something and then your perspective is shifted. It's something Twilight Zone did a lot. <br/><br/>Split certainly has plot turns, some of them interesting, some rather unconvincing, but none all that surprising. This is a movie about suspense and character, not brilliant plotting. If you spend the movie, as I did, trying to figure out how Shyamalan is going to flip everything on its head, it will take you out of the movie and lead nowhere. But if you just appreciate the beautifully constructed shots and the flow of action, you'll be impressed.<br/><br/>There is something very surprising in the last second of the movie, but it's not a plot twist because it doesn't come out of the story. Most people will have to google the ending to understand what it means.<br/><br/>This twist distraction is not Shyamalan's fault, but that of critics determined to talk about the director in twist terms regardless of the movie. I just wanted to let people know that, as a public service, so that they can enjoy the movie without false expectations. Because it's well worth watching."

Anya Taylor-Joy is mesmerizing, what a remarkable young lady.<br/><br/>It's the kind of movie with the kind of ending that screams for a sequеl. I loved how they connected it to Unbreakable, since I loved that one as well... and it totally made sense.

","Personally I am not really a fan but I watched Sixth Sense, Signs and Unbreakable. Those three were really good. After making three good films in a row some said the Village was horrible but I did not see it for myself. I watched Happening and Airbender. Happening was a strange horror film and quite interesting but Airbender was where he made an unforgivable mistake. Mentioning Shyamalan to those who loved the animated show is like a taboo. I gave Shyamalan one more chance with After Earth but it was silly and devoid of reason. After Earth was still a unique film if you come to think about it. When it came to Shyamalan it was interesting to watch a potentially good director spiral out into a messy movie maker. <br/><br/>Split sounded like a good concept but my expectations were low before I began. Split got into it straightaway, no bullshit and it keeps you guessing at every turn. As the movie progresses your expectations increase and it had a good payoff in the end. But don't you see in a way this movie speaks about Shyamalan directing ability split between the bad director and good director. The good director is back people and hopefully the bad director will not come back in control again."

","Split should be the final nail in the coffin for M Night's career. The film is boring, unimaginative, cliché ridden and worst of all- overstays its welcome. Worst of all there isn't any tension or dread which are the staple of a well-made horror film. This isn't the Shyamalan that made the Sixth Sense or even the Village. Split should be avoided unless you take pleasure in pain and keep track of how far M Night continues to fall. (Should be avoided by all-even M Night fans)"
"writeguyr","2","2","5","15 February 2018"," Another disapointing Shyamalan film
","Film writer/director/producer M.Night Shyamalan has made it his trademark for his films to include a surprising twist revealed at the conclusion of each of his films. Such as in his very popular and successful film ""The Sixth Sense"" and later in the less popular films of his "" The Village"" and in the ""Lady in the Water"" The two latter films had to deal with some threatening, mysterious monster, beast or creature that is revealed at the climax of the film. 
The problem with Shyamalan's latest film ""Split"" is that the writer/director Shyamalan let the mystery twist out of the bag too early in the film. We are all aware by way of the film's early trailers that actor James McAvoy who portrays four characters exceptionally well in the film as; Dennis the strong aggressive one, Patricia a female, Barry an artist with a gay personality and Hedwig as a nine year old boy all are going to become the character called the beast. Who they claim will do terrible things to the three young teens girls that Dennis has kidnapped and brought to his dungeon/basement hideout. <br/><br/>The concept of three young women being kidnaped and locked up is very close to the true life story of young women being held prisoner by a sick man in Ohio a few years ago. Of course the real life kidnapped victims had a very long duration of imprisonment, rape and sexual abuse. While the three young women in ""Split"" Here Marcia (Jessica Sula) Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) are merely locked in the basement while Dennis enters the room he grabs Marcia, now all three of these teen girls are gorgeous and curvaceous, so one would think that Dennis wants to satisfy his sexual desires. The smartest of the trio of girls is Casey, she is a loner while Marcia and Claire are more of the popular teen schoolgirls. Casey shouts out to Marcia for her to pee on herself since Dennis has cleanliness issues, this seem to spurn whatever intention Dennis had for the trio of teen beauties. The three girls watch as each time the door to their room opens a different personality portrayed by McAvoy appears to perform.<br/><br/>I always wondered where writers obtained their inspiration to write their stories. I read Shyamalan's bio where he and his family lived in an affluent town in Pennsylvania and that he attended a strict all Catholic school even though he and his family were of a different religion. Woody Allen in his film ""Annie Hall"" poked fun at his school experiences being spurned by the pretty girls in his classroom. I wonder if Shyamalan may have had similar experiences at the Catholic school, being rejected by the pretty Catholic girls of his school. Thus he had this beast of revenge inside of him, using the film ""Split"" to release his inner beast as well. For we all have some kind of dark hidden sides and secrets and inner beasts that we wish to hide.. Writers can release their beasts and have fiction characters play out their fantasies or their revenge. <br/><br/>The film has long lulls of no action and may seem very boring to many. As Dr. Fletcher (Betty Buckley) who is caring for Barry/Dennis/Patricia and Hedwig is receiving distress red flag emails from one the personalities. Her sessions with Barry reveals nothing and is wasted film time. Also Claire suggests that the trio of girls try to attack Dennis and fight for their freedom. While Dennis is too physically strong, the other personality Hedwig the nine year old boy, could have been easily over powered by one of the girls, yet they all just sit there and watch Hedwig as a nine year old rants and raves how the beast is coming and that they are food for the beast. All these personality performances become too repetitious. Wait aren't there supposed to be 24 personalities, we only see five, where are the rest of the personalities? 
""Split"" like Shyamalan's ""The Village"" is all build up to a disappointing conclusion. The bright spot to bring to light is actress Anya Taylor Joy, she is a joy to watch a true future superstar actress, with fabulous beauty and talent!!"

"edmontonspy","2","2","5","12 October 2017"," Another Shyamalan disappointment....SIGH!
","This movie had a decent rating, so we thought we would give it a chance, even though I've been so disappointed with Shyamalan films. The whole plot idea was interesting, and the movie started out alright, but it soon became ridiculous and pointless. I think this director tries WAY too hard. I don't know how the industry keeps allowing this guy to write and direct movies when they are shockingly horrible. What kind of director would put himself in a movie as a complete loser character who happens to like chicken wings at Hooters? There were a lot of holes in the plot too (as usual with Shyamalan). When the doctor wrote out the Beast's full name so that the last surviving female prisoner could call out his name to tame the beast, why didn't she call out his name herself so she could survive? The whole story line became stupid and could have been much better with a talented writer and director. Why does Shyamalan think that putting in a Bruce Willis cameo will make this movie so dramatic and memorable? That was stupid and pointless, just like the whole movie. I think some people gave this movie a decent rating just to trick people like me into watching it. I gave this movie a rating of 2 because there are actually worse films out there by this director."
"aliceflupper","6","2","5","8 August 2017"," Split
","Split (2016) is a story of a deranged young man whose twenty-three personalities control his life. Sounds as interesting as watching a clinical trial. Throw into the mix a kidnapping and it sounds like a third-rate thriller. A psycho keeping people (most likely vulnerable people like kids, or teenage girls) in the basement rings too familiar. Compare 'Split' with William Wyler's 'The Collector,' or Mark Tonderai's 'House at the End of the Street,' and you end up with a bad remake. 'Split,' '24,' 'Room,' 'Prisoners,' and the list goes on. Three words: Seen it before. What, if anything, makes 'Split' different and somehow watchable is the charismatic performance of James McAvoy whose acting reaches new heights. <br/><br/>Not only is he playing nine drastically different characters, managing to smoothly transition between them, but he also succeeds in making the spectator comfortable with his deranged incarnations. In a way, Kevin is as vulnerable, if not more, than his victims. He is a prisoner too and his prison is not made of walls which, once escaped, can be forever left behind. His prison is his mind. The twenty-three characters represent lost pieces of his mind, each struggling to have a life of its own. Each of them has a distinct set of qualities as well as flaws which make them all human, breeding empathy for the anti-hero. The question becomes, who do we root for? And so, the meaning of a happy ending shifts. Watching the film, I yearned for all the prisoners, especially Kevin, to be set free from what confined them. The film has succeeded in familiarizing people with multiple personality disorder and spreading awareness about mental health issues. This definitely helps integrate the people affected into society which could treat them as different, or even dangerous, otherwise.<br/><br/>Besides, watching James McAvoy become a woman, a child, an obsessive cleaner, and many more is simply great entertainment and 'Split' is worth a watch, if only to see that happen. However, if you expect to be blown away by the story, or the layers of meaning, or the ethereal context. You might just hit a wall. In other words, if you look for originality, look elsewhere."
"AnishMisra","8","4","14","8 April 2017"," Split: Movie Review
","Plot: 3 Girls are kidnapped and kept in a place by a man who suffers from multiple personality disorder. He has 23 identities of himself and warns the girls of a 24th one who is about to come.<br/><br/>Review: This review of mine will be containing some Spoilers, so please if you haven't watched the film please don't read the review.<br/><br/>So Split is a film directed by M. Night Shyamalan who is mostly known for the films which have some sense of super-naturalism in it. I saw this film with huge expectations and man the expectations (if not all) were met. The film is 117 minutes long and I was invested in it for most of the time.<br/><br/>Talking about the plot of the film. The plot started out as a somewhat normal Kidnapping type of film. But then as the story progresses, we see that the kidnapping goes way deeper than what is was meant for. For me, the pace of the film started after 30-35 minutes or so. I guess that is when Kevin's personalities come to light. At first many people would think how the hell is Shyamalan going to manage the space for 24 personalities. But yes he does. Hats off for that. I also for some time wondered what the hell does Casey's backstory have to do with this. But you see that the backstory is an integral part of Casey. Also we do have a Dr. Karen who's character is fleshed out quite good who tries to help our protagonist (antagonist).<br/><br/>Now about the performances. James McAvoy (who I better know as Professor Charles Xavier of X men) killed it. The personalities were portrayed by him were near perfect. I especially like the characters of Patricia and Hedwig. The 24th character (Beast) was not too convincing for me (Maybe I have a taste for violent films, so that is why I was expecting some gore in that part). Anna Taylor as Casey was also great. Actually if you see it is a film about the way how both Casey and Kevin deal with the abuse in their childhood in the present day. The film shows the contrast between these 2 behaviors in a very nice way. The role of Betty too as the caring doctor was great.<br/><br/>My Favorite scene would be towards the climax where Casey tells Kevin's whole name. Kevin comes to his normal self and asks Casey to kill him. But then the other personalities of Kevin come and scare off Casey. As I said above, the Beast wasn't too convincing for me, but Casey's fear during the scene actually made up for the horror that was needed for the scene.<br/><br/>Spoiler reveal: (which I had actually known for quite some time). We see Bruce Willis in the end as David Dunn sitting in a cafe watching a news about Kevin. Many Unbreakable fans (as myself) would be quite happy seeing that. Many people were waiting for a sequel to a Unbreakable. And I am happy we have got something close to that. Shyamalan too has said that his next film will be in this U/S U (My abbreviation for Unbreakable/Split Universe). So can't wait for David vs Kevin (if that would be the plot for the next film in this universe).<br/><br/>Final word: Split is actually a great film. Do watch out for the great performance by James McAvoy. Although little loose during the start, but once it keeps the grip it never loosens it till the very last scene. The opening and closing credits are also done in a quite interesting way.<br/><br/>So for me Split is an 8/10 film."

","The story of a man who has 23 different personalities and the only person he actually trust is his therapist Dr.Fletcher. One day, one of his personalities kidnaps three girls and locked them in a windowless room. Anya Taylor portraits the role of Casey superbly, unfortunately the one who steals the show was James McAvoy for his career defining performance as Kevin. His speech tone and body language were completely different for each personality. Speaking of M. Night Shyamalan movie, He has a style of ending the movie with a surprise and this time he literally got me. Overall, it's a smart movie that can easily thrills you and highly recommended to everyone."
"mortalkomvate-14510","10","4","14","5 March 2017"," An excellent and chilling film that'll keep you awake at night
","Since i saw for the very first time, X-Men: First Class, i sensed something special and unique about James McAvoy, but I said to myself ""It's nothing, he's just a great actor"". Then, I watched X- Men: Days Of Future Past and X-Men: Apocalypse. He was excellent, specially on Apcalypse. Then, I saw him on Victor Frankenstein with another excellent performance. Welcome To The Punch was the next one, the first movie starred by him that din't captivate me like others. And finally, I saw him on Filth, a movie that I didn't like at all but that made me realize that even on a bad movie, James McAvoy can force you to watch the entire thing without sleeping; that even in a bad movie, James McAvoy can amaze you like he does all the time. SPLIT was the first film I ever saw with absolute knowledge about the greatness of McAvoy. Like I've said, I knew that he was an excellent actor but I was never so sure. And after seeing SPLIT, I can completely say that James McAvoy is one of the best actors of the 21st century, if not the best. As for Shyamalan, I'm not a big fan of his. Most of the people either hates his guts or loves him. I'm not in the middle, I don't hate him at all. Shymalan's movies that I watched are all between 6 or 7 so when I first saw that it was directed by him I said to myself ""this can't be more than 8 or lower than 6"". But then, I knew that McAvoy was on it and my expectations grew up a little, just a little. I though that the best I could get off this film could be a 9. When I came out of the cinema, I was shocked and all the words I said before were no valid at all. This movie is majestuos, excellent, unique. It's great. It's absolutely scary, I've never felt this scared since a long time and i'm a fan of horror genre so almost every horror movie that comes out, I watch it on cinemas. To conclude, this is a great film, 10 is a short note for this. It's one of those movies that deserves more than 10. Great start of 2017 (this film arrived to Argentinian cinemas on 2017). PD: James McAvoy is one of the greatest actor this world has seen on this age."
"JohnD_ro","9","4","14","5 March 2017"," This movie goes straight to the core of you
","Movie rating 8.5/10 - Just seen it and I must say I liked this movie more than Tarantino's The Hateful Eight. The main role is played by James McAvoy, for those of us still unfamiliar with him, he's the guy from X-Men: Origins/Apocalypse, the young Professor X. As we didn't have a feast in this year's Oscars as I think most would agree, I was wandering why wasn't he nominated there, I mean fuak, has anyone else seen what he did here!? But then I read more carefully, this movie was released only about mid January so it did not classify as a 2016 movie. <br/><br/>You can't tell what's what about an actor until he is given the right stuff, the right scenery to work with. Take the guy from Deadpool for example, Ryan Reynolds, he does well in that movie, but 14 years ago he played that extremely superficial Van Wilder and fed those stuck up Harvard shits some dog cum in cookies. :D Of coarse we all liked that scene but his role was out of the charts of dumb. And then only 8 years later he plays that great role in Buried, in 2010. Practically he makes all that movie almost all by himself and manages a very good movie out of it. <br/><br/>The moral is that you never know how an actor will develop or how deep his talent goes until he is put to the real test. And that my friends happened in Split with our dear young Professor X. I deeply enjoyed this movie, watched the ending about 4 times and I regret I didn't wait for the HD/Bluray version as I have no cinema in my little town for the moment. I thought it will be a 7/10, mostly 7.5/10 rated movie so with no obvious special effects I might lose, I thought I would give it a go in a shady quality. Boy was I wrong, this is the type of movie you see as clear as possible, in a cinema if you got the chance. I will re watch it in the best quality possible when it will be released, no doubt, I don't wanna miss every little thing from McAvoy's best performance to date! <br/><br/>I regret ever calling him gay in relations with the new young X-Men I disliked at the time, this guy is simply... great. He would have been an Oscar nominee I think, if the movie would have been released just a month earlier. Bad luck for him opposed to us, who got the real treat in early 2017."

Casey, Claire & Marcia have to figure out what Kevin wants with them & escape, before the appearance of a terrifying 24th personality. <br/><br/>Split is a mind blowing film. Director M. Night Shyamalan delivers another unforgettable thriller, after The Visit(2015). Shyamalan's original script is one of a kind & maintains the suspense & tension, throughout the movie. You just cannot predict what Kevin is going to do next. The performances are the highlight of the film. James McAvoy has given the best performance of his career so far, as Dennis/Patricia/Hedwig/The Beast/Kevin Wendell Crumb/Barry/Orwell/Jade. McAvoy alters his speech, gait & mannerisms for each personality, with ease & panache. Not even one personality feels like a rehash of another. James McAvoy astoundingly portrays a man suffering from DID. Anya Taylor-Joy is spectacular as Casey Cooke. Betty Buckley is superb as Dr. Karen Fletcher. Haley Lu Richardson is great as Claire Benoit. Jessica Sula is brilliant as Marcia. Izzie Coffey is outstanding as Five-Year-Old Casey. Brad William Henke, Sebastian Arcelus & Neal Huff are impressive as Uncle John, Casey's Father & Mr. Benoit, respectively. Split is a must watch for psychological thriller fans. Also, I recommend everyone to watch it for its sheer unpredictability & the performance of a lifetime by James McAvoy."
"phanthinga","10","4","14","22 February 2017"," It good but maybe too good ?
","Just came back from the theater after watching Split for the first time and it probably stick to my brain for a long time.First off i very happy to see M. Night Shyamalan is back in the director chair one again and gave us this masterpieces of modern horror movie.Even through he kinda back with the movie The Visit in 2015 but in this movie i dare to say he finally back in the glorious day when he directing movie like The Sixth Sense or even Unbreakable that i will talk about it later.Really this movie is very good from the casting choice,the acting ,the location to some small details that require you to focus 100% to fully understand the situation the character has been to. James McAvoy give us a brilliance and jaw-dropping performance as the highly disturbed man with a diagnosed 23 distinct personalities that the idea itself is so refreshing and intriguing to see after countless bad horror movie or sequels that no one ask.The character is so complex when he has to change personalities every time from a little kid to a man with OCD Symptoms to a nice middle age woman and finally The Beast.The idea may seem extreme and not convincing at all but seeing James facial expression,the way he talk or movement to match each character make me totally buying it.The rest of the cast did a very good job with the material their handle especially young actress Anya Taylor-Joy who one again impress me with the character Casey Cooke a lonely girl also have a disturbing past so her chemistry on screen with James McAvoy is so thrilling and interesting to watch.The part that i say too good is not only the shocking final part when she face off with The Beast but also the ballsy of director M. Night Shyamalan when he let the antagonist got away in the end leave a unsatisfied feeling in our heart then the confusing scene set up for the future movie with character David Dunn played by Bruce Willis"
"carsonwhale","8","4","14","21 February 2017"," Great Movie, minor issues
","Before I start this very late review, I just want to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I'm happy M. Night has come back with a hit movie that puts forth gripping suspense, terror, and even mild humor at times. It should be noted that this movie is still a very dark one, with scenes of open wounds and pedophilia shown on screen. I'm very surprised it ended up with a PG-13 rating when it's all said and done.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, 'Split' cuts to the chase, diving right into the kidnapping of three teenage girls. There is great camera work in this scene and definitely hooks you right in. It was exciting watching them piece together the strange actions of Kevin and his odd behavior. It isn't exciting however, watching some of the girls struggle to act. They do a poor job, and for a second it took me out of the viewing experience. Thankfully, not all the girls get an even amount of screen time as the trailer might have you believe.<br/><br/>There are two other stories that the movie will jump back and forth throughout. One is of Dr. Karen Fletcher, who Kevin turns to so the audience can help understand him better, as well as Fletcher herself. In these scenes James McAvoy really gets to show off his acting skills, and he is awesome to watch. The other is a flashback that could have been cut down a few minutes, but still brought forth an important aspect of one main character that helps the audience understand them better. The movie ends with some plots I felt did not have much closure, but it did not lessen the quality of the movie. And then there's the end credit scene, which felt silly but could be enjoyable for those who understand it.<br/><br/>In short, Split is a tense, but slower paced movie with solid acting from McAvoy and decent acting from the rest of the cast. I would definitely recommend seeing this whenever you can. Though the run time could be taken down a bit, it still leaves you on the edge of your seat as the main characters learn piece by piece the dangers of Kevin and his multiple personalities."

","Ah, Shyamalan. What a complex opinion I have of you. ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" had made such an impression on me that as an eleven-year-old I had decided that you were my favourite director. Little did I know that your following films would steadily disappoint me over the years to a point that I had almost completely given up on you.<br/><br/>""The Visit"" was a spark of hope. ""Split"" is a flame. <br/><br/>This thriller turned out to be much better than I expected. A trio of teenage girls are kidnapped by a mysterious man who suffered from multiple personality disorders. There are a whopping 23 of them, and the ones responsible for the kidnapping are three: the stern-faced Dennis, the calm and collected Patricia, and the child-like Hedwig. However, a far more dangerous personality is threatening to emerge, and it is a race against time for the girls to escape before their luck runs out.<br/><br/>The film is intense and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The viewer feels the pressure and you will be trying to connect the dots throughout the flick. The Shyamalan twist (or, more accurately, the reveal) explains a lot and is satisfying. <br/><br/>After 16 long years, I think I can shyly say: Shyamalan is back."
"ReelLifeReviews","8","4","14","12 February 2017"," Shyamalan is back....FINALLY
","I never understood how MNS could do The 6th Sense, Signs, and Unbreakable, but then make train wrecks like The Village, Lady in the Water, The Happening, After Earth, etc. (My apologies if you like any of those) It took over a decade, but to quote Harry, he TOTALLY redeemed himself! An issue with his films is that you watch them, but the whole time you're trying to figure out 'the twist' before it happens. This pulled me away from the story quite a bit in this one unfortunately. I think it was more out of spite this time around. It was a disservice to the film to do so. It's a shame it came out in January, because James McAvoy legitimately deserves Oscar consideration for his performance(s). The Academy will see just too many performances between now and next year's ceremonies for him to stand a chance I'm afraid. I hope I'm wrong, however. There is some clunky exposition at times, and you could tag a plot hole or two, but overall it was a gripping psychological thriller. It has a very satisfying ending, but it's so much more than that. 8.5/10"

Great job to the writer the author the actors and everyone who worked on it. I personally loved it and would like to see more.

"themovieparadise","8","4","14","20 January 2017"," I Think Shyamalan May Be Back!
","In many ways, this is a return to Shyamalan's classic films. It puts its emphasis on characters and atmosphere. Instead of being a horror movie, it's more of a psychological thriller. It builds its atmosphere, and uses it as a weapon to toy with the characters. It employs a subtlety that Shyamalan has lost in some of his latter films. It's a show-don't-tell mindset that allows James McAvoy to shine as his character. McAvoy is absolutely brilliant in this movie. He turns in probably one of the best performances of his career. He completely transforms himself for each personality, really taking on an entirely new character. There are some overt differences between personalities, and then there are some subtle ones. Throughout most of the film, I wasn't seeing McAvoy. I was seeing Hedwig, or Barry, or Patricia. He cultivated these personalities so well and so independently, that you only saw those characters, and not McAvoy. It's hard enough for an actor to lose themselves in one character, let alone close to two dozen. I think Shyamalan and McAvoy share ownership for the brilliance of the performance. McAvoy delivered on his end, and Shyamalan clearly guided him towards the finish line..."

"RussHog","8","4","14","5 February 2017"," Nice addition to M Night's World
","Split is a strange movie - and one that probably is not entirely advertised appropriately - which may have led to some of the negative feedback. Split is not a horror film - it is more of a mystery thriller but it also a character study in the rise of an evil villain.<br/><br/>The movie is about a man who has split personalities - and one of them may or may not be a supernatural force that seeks to unleash chaos. To find out of this supernatural force is real - he kidnaps three women and holds them in a secret chamber until the time is right to find out if his supernatural split personality can rise to devour them.<br/><br/>The women are led by a brave heroine who has her own past that is shrouded in sorrow. For when she was a child her beloved father was killed and she was left alone with her uncle - who abused her. She once tried to kill the uncle - but she failed - and perhaps she owes the devil its due.<br/><br/>These two character's are bound for a showdown where they will battle one another and find find the answers that they seek to link them to their destiny in life - and what some may have felt was a let down I was highly moved and thought the performance of both lead actors was fantastic. As was the directing in the final moments. <br/><br/>There is a super cool plot twist in the very end that blew me away - that the movie takes place in M Night's Unbreakable universe - which is an old M Night movie about a man who discovers he is a real life superhero and the world is full of wicked villains he is destined to combat.<br/><br/>Split is not a scary movie - and there are some really badly written scenes. Some of the exposition is textbook highly problematic - but the truth is that M Night can get away with some bad writing - because his name has proved to sell millions of dollars so I let him pass."

I'll give you a hint!, Remember Bruce Willis from ""Unbreakable"" This is a beginning and a continuation of an already fascinating and heart felt kind of comic book styled villains and heroes that are more real than flame throwing humanoids and shape changing green things.<br/><br/>I had a sense of predictability but the tension was timed right, character development was done well, I learned as the movie taught to feel for characters when it was needed.<br/><br/>I loved it and discussed it after it was over which proves to me it was worth thinking and watching."
"chrichtonsworld","8","4","14","31 January 2017"," McAvoy is absolutely terrifying!
","The second film in a short while where M. Night Shyamalan successfully has managed to scare the living hell out of us. The previous being The Visit of course.<br/><br/>Now I know that there have been quite a few thrillers that make use of the Dissociative identity disorder or multiple personality disorder (MPD) and that at this point there is very little that can be done to truly surprise you. But by god M. Night has succeeded in a way that will put you on the edge of your seat multiple times. Not all the time mind you since the film dials down a few notches a couple of times. And this could make it seem the film drags here and there. In hindsight though it was M. Night teaching us what a master of horror he truly can be since he plays around with the tension to keep your interest peaked. Trust me on this that even when some of the plot developments may appear predictable it goes into different directions entirely. Especially at the very end of the film since it gives us a twist that is so meta that it will make your head spin. Very daring and incredibly effective. It is like he is saying, I told you that I am still very much on top of my game. But aside from this, the film in itself is incredible brilliant. James McAvoy was having a blast and he shows us what an amazing actor he is by switching up personalities like it's nothing. Still I do have to remark that Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke made a good impression as well. I did not even recognize her as she also was in The Witch.<br/><br/>Split is one of those movies that does a lot of things really good and has you singing praise right after. But of course there will always be people hating on this film just because Shyamalan is involved. He does tend to make films that require you to suspend disbelief and have somewhat of an imagination. Doesn't always mean you have to like or agree with his vision because I am pretty aware he can make terrible films as well. Still Split is certainly is one of his better ones and deserves to be watched by many. So go forth ladies and gentlemen and enjoy yourselves. I certainly did!"

","Simply put what a brilliant film, McAvoy's performance was just a joy to behold, intense and gripping. It is quite an intense film, that really towards the end had me on the edge of my seat. <br/><br/>Wasn't quite sure where it was going with the three female prisoners, but once they were gradually separated and we were left with Anya Taylor-Joy's Casey, who gave us sympathetic point of view as we were left to watch her battle of wills with ""The Horde"".<br/><br/>Love the little twist at the end that ties it and implies it's sequel to the previous Shyamalan film, Unbreakable, that sort of hints that we may get third movie involving Bruce Willis' David Dunn.<br/><br/>For me this felt Shyamalan was back on form and if we do get a follow-up to make this a trilogy hopefully we will get see to David V Goliath clash of epic proportions of David Dunn v The Horde/Beast.<br/><br/>Time up the ante and bring it on Mr Shyamalan."

","yes, this excellent McAvoy movie comes in the wake of 'eyes of my Mother', but multiplied by 10. I would think that the title 'SPLIT' infers 'split personality', as in schizophrenia(most of the inmates at Atascadero Prison for the criminally Insane, Atascadero, California),but it actually refers to DID, & other types of mental disorders(petit & grand mal seizures?);however, unlike DID, or petit mal, schizophrenia is not only a mental disorder, it is a confirmed genetic illness, ie, blond parents, their offspring will also have blond hair? Which is why I do not think DID is as dangerous as depicted in this movie; but I agree w/ Shyamalan, that both DID & schizophrenia also highlight the incredible intelligence of these victims of these disorders?(the business of DID altering the physical chemistry of the body is a bunch of Hollywood artistic license hoo- hah, though..)"

","Yesterday I finally got to take a moment to get out to the theater to see Split (2016) directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Now at first when I saw the trailer I had a strong interest in seeing this film until I saw the name M. Night Shyamalan, the trailer made it look intense and I was really wanting to see it. I only waited to see it due to since the movie the Village also by M. Night Shyamalan there seemed to be a trend that every film with his name on it was completely something different than what was marketed, well finally this one isn't<br/><br/>Split is a superb film, it's exactly what the trailer showed and more. The acting, especially by James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy were off the charts; impeccable to say the least. These two actors keep you on your toes the entire film. The story, like all stories by M. Night Shyamalan had more than one meaning so the stylings of his did show in this film too though it didn't kill it.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this film, finally a very well-made suspenseful thriller film."
"nesskimo","8","4","14","27 January 2017"," Excellent!!
","If you are reading this, I strongly urge you to disregard any negative reviews about this movie. I think most of us agree that M Night Syamalan's early work set such a precedent, expectations have been extremely high ever since. I believe 'Split' is very close to reaching the same level of reverence awarded 'The Sixth Sense'. James McAvoy's performance is astounding and develops into something quite terrifying. I wasn't disappointed with the rest of the cast either. <br/><br/>There seem to be conflicting opinions about multiple personality disorders, the prognosis and perceptions; this film touches on that. As well as exploring the facts we know about DID, it delves into speculations about the disorder. Shyamalan's parents are both Doctors therefore we expect appropriate research will have been done, but it is a fictional story at the end of the day and doesn't deserve some of the simple minded criticism it has received. Thankfully this appears to be a minority opinion and shouldn't deter anyone with an open mind.<br/><br/>Oh and there's a damn good unexpected twist at the end<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!"
"matthewssilverhammer","8","4","14","26 January 2017"," 20 of My 23 Personalities Love Split
","Few directors inspire more intense reactions than Shyamalan. Starting out on the highest-of-highs (Sixth Sense) before steadily falling to the lowest-of-lows (Happening), his career wasn't so much a roller coaster as a log-flume-drop with seemingly no end. So while 2014's Visit was a nice rise back to quality, Split is a true return. A bold, original vision that hearkens his earlier work; a fascinating mixture of drama, horror and psychological world-building. Following the recent trend of ""kidnapped-and-trapped-with-a-crazy-man"" (10 Cloverfield Lane, Room), a trio of teenage girls are captured by a disturbed man (McAvoy) with 23 different split personalities. It's clear Shyamalan did extensive research, as the attention to and mentions of real-life disorder case studies is impressive. McAvoy's giant performance had every chance to be obnoxiously overacted, yet his commitment and intrigue ultimately wins each scene. His moments with his psycho-therapist are intuitive and curious, with an underpinning of unknown menace, as it all leads to an emotionally difficult message about handling and living with trauma. On top of all this, Split's ending surprise, a trademark of Shyamalan's, may be his best and most satisfying since The Sixth Sense. Still, even with all the good in Shyamalan's, he still has his hang-ups, many of which are on display here. For all the powerful horror visuals, ominously toned pacing, and humor that wonderfully walks the line between funny and disturbing, his direction makes the performances feel fairly unnatural, and his dialogue is sometimes oddly stilted and explicitly expositional. Despite the messiness and weak script moments, Split is an enveloping psychological thriller whose yarn is dutifully weaved with darkness and intrigue."

","On a perfect sunny day three teenage girls are kidnapped by a man(James McAvoy) for reasons unknown. The girls try to figure away to escape, soon the guy has a personality disorder, and are scared if they are gonna get out alive.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan once again proves he's still got it after The Visit(2015), and now Split, James McAvoys performance really keeps you on edge, as an actor he really believes he is all these personalities, that is how an actor sometimes works cause if he doesn't believe it, then the audience won't either. Anya Taylor Joy is also great here, I believe one day we'll see an Oscar in her future. Betty Buckley(Carrie, Eight is Enough) is great has the doctor trying to help McAvoy. You may think it's a movie about a man with a personality disorder, but it becomes so much more than that. If you like a movie that will keep you on edge, then check Split out.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Shyamalans earlier work, then stay around towards the end, cause he puts one of his earlier films in the same universe with this film, which makes me excited for a sequel."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","14","22 January 2017"," Director Shyamalan receiving generally nods of approval
","A psychopath (term used in a very general and imprecise sense) kidnapping a bunch of girls is a not a novel plot. Morgan Freeman's ""Kiss the girls"" (1997) is one that comes to mind right away. But while in that movie there is only one kidnapper, here in ""Split"", there are 23, as if you still haven't heard, occupying the same body. But obviously, we will not be shown all of them. In addition to the original personality that had suffered certain childhood tremor, we see a woman, a 9-year old child, an assertive schemer, an artistic homosexual and ""the beast"", among others.<br/><br/>Ever since ""Sixth sense"" (1999) Night M. Night Shyamalan has made numerous attempts but has not been able to repeat that feat. ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"" and ""The Village"" all had something to offer in the department of finale twist, although a far cry from ""Sixth sense"". ""Lady in the water"" is a let-down. Personally, I like ""The happening"" although I am quite aware that this view is not generally shared. ""The Last Airbender"" appeared to be his final abandonment of his signature genre and hence a total disappointment. I am therefore delighted to see that there is a certain degree of his return to form in ""Split"", in masterful handling of thrill and suspense, even if not in devising clever twists.<br/><br/>""Split"" is not a convoluted contrivance. The narrative is orderly, told essentially through omniscient narration granted the audience via the POV of a number of characters.<br/><br/>The motive for the kidnapping is not entirely clear. Two have been offered. On a simpler plain, one of the 23 personalities enjoys watching sexy girls dancing. On a subtler plain, everything is under the ultimate control of ""the beast"" who wants to collect innocent girls who have never seen any vicissitudes for some ominous, dark purposes. The three kidnapped is just a start.<br/><br/>After Anthony Perkins, James McAvoy is arguably among the best actors in this generation to play this multi-split-personality protagonist. This he has demonstrated convincingly, switching seamlessly from one personality to another right under the unforgiving scrutiny of the close-up camera. Anya Taylor-Joy, in what is closest to the lead female role here, shows her worth acting opposite McAvoy. Playing the kidnapped girl who had a childhood tremor just as bad as the protagonist's, Taylor-Joy captures the audience's imagination in a scene with a devious attempt to trick the 9-year-old personality into helping them escape. Also excellent is Betty Buckley as the protagonist's doctor who is, among other things, a sort of surrogate VO explaining the details of his case. ""Split"" to-date has earned an average 7.7 score from IMDb users, as well as generally favourable critic reviews."
"rdbrown-zeteo","7","4","14","21 January 2017"," A Really Good M. Night Film with some deep thoughts to consider
","This is not a perfect film - but it is still a really good film and I think it explores deep, dark territory. <br/><br/>It was intense. Though, in a way it felt more predictable in some ways compared to other M. Night's movies. Because of this it felt less like a horror film and more an exploration of psychological trauma. <br/><br/>The topic of multiple personalities is not something new to the world of cinema - nor the presentation that a person suffering this type of mental health disorder is a dangerous person. Yet, some find offense by how ""Split"" presents and treats mental illness to scare people. <br/><br/>In my experience of the move, Split does not have many in your face jumps or scares. And I feel like that was intentional on M. Night's part.<br/><br/>Though the antagonist is portrayed as a monster, I found some elements of the character(s) to be conveyed that this is a person who is suffering from a traumatic past and there seemed to me to be some level of sensitivity. <br/><br/>At first, with the beast, I was a little put off by the sense of the character being able to evolve to some degree. But, I have to remind myself that M. Night is storyteller and along with that comes symbolism and allegory. Perhaps we are not meant to take some of these seemingly ridiculous factors so seriously - but look deeper into what those elements represent and the story they are telling. <br/><br/>With that in mind. I feel this story explores brokenness, and even though a person suffers from mental health issues, a traumatic past, etc., they may see themselves as ""impure"" and broken - but they are strong and can survive their situation - there is hope. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm the only one who is seeing this film and story from this perspective. I can see how it can be seen that using mental illness to entertain in a horror film is disrespectful. I think it is easy to come away confused about what M. Night is trying to say about the whole ""pure"" versus ""impure"" thing. That the broken are the pure and the unbroken are the impure. That can seem on the surface rather ridiculous, but maybe with a little more thought - it could actually make sense.<br/><br/>I mean, what is the difference between someone who has suffered and someone who is foreign to suffering? People don't understand mental illness, how trauma affects a person's mental health, and yes the world in reality tend to place labels and see people with mental health issues as ""monsters"" in various different contexts. Maybe this film was geared to showing challenge and complexity of these issues, while using a popularly entertaining medium to present these ideas to the audience to grapple with. I usually come away from M. Night's movies talking about them for a long time and more interesting exploring some sort of deep philosophical-type insight expressed through the films. <br/><br/>As expressed through one of the girls, we see in subtlety how she comes to realize that she is not a monster because of her past and her own mental health needs - that because she is broken she has a different understanding of life which in some way of looking at it - makes her pure. Sort of playing off the concept of Plato's cave. To be in ignorance of pain and suffering, or of reality such as in living a lie whether you realize it or not could be seen as something of impure. Impure may be a confusing way to express a concept but I'm sort of thinking of the Matrix movies here. Maybe I'm going way off topic here. But those who know the truth, such as in Plato's Cave and in the Matrix - perhaps they are pure because they are free from the lie, the illusion - that we are all broken. <br/><br/>Pain and suffering can lead a person to becoming something more. That pain is a chisel which can shape a person depending on how a person chooses to see and understand that pain and suffering. Not in the sense of biological evolution - but that of character, of maturity, of spiritual growth in a sense. <br/><br/>Anyway, enough of my two-cents on the meaning behind the story. <br/><br/>Split is a very well-made film. Well-acted. In some ways it didn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary. It was intense and suspenseful. Funny and enjoyable, all the while it is heart-breaking and hopefully eye-opening for people. It is worth the watch and I will likely watch it again."
"s-middendorf","10","4","14","21 January 2017"," The Greatest Trick A Writer/Director Ever Pulled....
","At the turn of the century M. Night Shyamalan captivated audiences with his films, largely in part to his patented ""twist"" endings. I can still remember the awe I felt watching 1999's Sixth Sense, 2000's Unbreakable, 2002's Signs and reeling when the final scene was laid out and the revelations brought to light.<br/><br/>In his newest movie, Split, M. Night pulls the greatest trick a director ever pulled. Marketed as a psychological thriller starring a riveting performance by James McAvoy as a man suffering from DID who has 23 personalities living inside of him you are prepared for a taut tale of fear and suspense. And fans of M. Night who have seen his earlier works and even the more recent thrill fest, The Visit, you're expecting the M. Night twist at the end. Split delivers on both the thrilling tale and the twist, but then goes beyond with a tag (movie speak for a short scene at the end of a film) so profoundly unique it blew my mind and had me rushing back out to the theater the same weekend to watch again.<br/><br/>Because what you don't know until the very end is that the entire time you have been watching a movie you thought was a new story from a great writer/director it was in fact the second chapter, a sequel actually, to an earlier work from this Grandmaster. And not just any one of M. Night's earlier works, arguably one of his best, one that has grown a cult following over the almost two decades since its release and had fans of it begging for a sequel for some time.<br/><br/>When that tag rolls and you realize that what you were really watching was the origin story of a new Shyamalan villain and the tie is made to this earlier work, it takes Split to a whole new level. Suddenly so many other things come to mind. The core themes and supernatural undertones of the two movies are the same (how powerful or villainous can our mind make us if we let it?). The exploration of the childhood of key characters (in one the villain, in another the heroine) plays an important role. In both movies colors are associated with the core characters (green, purple, gray, white). The movie posters both share the same design elements (I'll admit I had to go back and look up the other one to make that comparison). Even the titles of the movies themselves could be considered related, almost antonyms of one another. How could all of this been missed at first? Because you weren't expecting it at all, you weren't looking for it. That's what makes a second viewing all the better. That's what makes M. Night an incredible storyteller and a magical director and Split an amazing movie."

","In this M.

When three girls are abducted, she begins to suspect her clients behaviour may be linked.<br/><br/>The girls are friends Claire Benoit (Haley Lu Richardson: The Edge of Seventeen, The Last Survivors) and Marcia (Jessica Sula: Honeytrap, Skins), along with loner Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy: Morgan, The Witch) who was invited to Claire's party on a pity invite. Taken by Kevin and locked away, they must trust each other to try and survive.<br/><br/>McAvoy is brilliant in the main role and as his various personalities emerge, he is mesmerising as Barry, Hedwig, Patricia, Crumb, Dennis, Jade and Orwell and absolutely terrifying as The Beast. We are given snatches of his traumatising backstory through his sessions with Dr Fletcher and his conversations with Casey, the hostage that best appears to understand him. Taylor-Joy is outstanding as Casey, who has a heart-breaking reason for this, which is revealed alongside Kevin's in a deftness of touch that is both illuminating and highlighting a duality of the human psyche. Her character is haunting both as an adult and as a 5 year-old child, played by Izzie Coffey (Bad Girl, Cargo), where we see her hunting in the woods with her father (Sebastian Arcelus: House of Cards, The Best of me) and Uncle John (Brad William Henke: Orange is The New Black, Fury).<br/><br/>Two of Kevin's personalities, Dennis and Patricia have combined to ready the rest for the emergence of the 24th personality, The Beast, yet two others Barry and Hedwig (who is 9 years-old), fight to take the light and try to warn Dr Fletcher and help the girls.<br/><br/>In such tight confines of this cinematic universe, Shyamalan's supernatural overtones work well when they could so easily have gone the way of some of his previous movies. The film caused me to hold my breath so much my husband had to remind me to breathe and it is a long time since I have literally sat on the edge of my seat whilst watching a riveting movie world emerge.<br/><br/>Two outstanding performances from McAvoy and Taylor-Joy and I am at a loss to understand why neither has been nominated in any award categories.<br/><br/>Don't miss the lovely touch right at the end, who knew that the humble toothbrush could convey so much?"

"quinimdb","6","4","15","21 January 2017"," Split
","M. Night Shyamalan isn't the worst director of all time, but he's definitely been one of the most monumentally disappointing. Luckily, it seems he's come back with ""Split"", a dark, fun, psychological thriller. It's not perfect by any means, but this one definitely belongs in the former part of Shyamalan's filmography.<br/><br/>The first shot is Casey Cook sitting to the side, facing away from a group of girls her age that are taking a selfie together during a birthday party. We learn that Casey is a loner, and often acts up in class. She was forced into the party by a mercy invite, and she is forced to take a car ride with the birthday girl, Claire, and her friend, Marcia. Suddenly, they're kidnapped in a great moment that is done ""Halloween"" style (although not held out for as long), with a seemingly normal shot from a good distance away from the family, before the camera slowly gets closer to them and it is revealed to be a POV shot. The shot (and the scene in general) is an example of how visually impressive the film is, mostly due to the ""It Follows"" cinematographer, Mike Gioulakis. The only problem in this scene would be Casey's reaction, which is very unrealistic and could've been handled much better for sure, just like many other moments in this film. The writing for the most part is pretty good, even if there are definitely plenty of mistakes, such as one unnecessary and forced scene in which Kyle's therapist, Dr. Fletcher. The set up is that she is giving a speech over Skype, but this is just an excuse to force-feed information to us that was already obvious in the first place. There are plenty of incredibly stupid character decisions here and there, that exist solely as an attempt to make the situation more tense, even though it really just takes you out of the experience. Also, the obligatory M. Night Shyamalan cameo scene that he puts into every one of his movies does contain some cringe worthy attempts at humor, even if the rest of the humor in the film actually works. One element of the writing I can praise about this film are its characters. Casey is an empathetic character with actual depth. She seems to have a good relationship with her father, who we see teaching her to hunt and be self-reliant. At first it seems she also has a good relationship with her uncle, but in reality, she has been abused and raped by him throughout her life and forced to live with him after her father's death. Like Kevin, her uncle almost has multiple personalities, and like Kevin, she has gone through major trauma that has forced her to be completely self- reliant, and feel isolated. This story is her personal journey to becoming strong enough to truly stand up to her uncle, something she tried to do at a young age but couldn't ultimately follow through with. Anya Taylor-Joy's performance as this character is pretty great, definitely overshadowing the mediocre performance given by Haley Lu Richardson as Claire and Jessica Sula as Marcia. Kevin was a good character that was ruined by the lack of a significant arc. It is implied that his father took a train and never came back when he was young, and he was abused by his mother and bullied in school. Each prominent personality in the film actually has a psychological reason for being a part of him, because of his trauma. Hedwig is the child-like and afraid part of his mind; Patricia is his own mind's substitute for Dr. Fletcher, in other words the intellectual, calm, and therapeutic one; Barry is the cool and confident one that is taken over by Dennis, the overbearing and controlling aspect that he needed; and, finally, the Beast, a representation of his father, the dominant figure in his life that he was missing, one that he depicted as a monster and could only make up for by becoming a monster. This character and, by extension, the whole movie could've been laughably bad had the central performance of Kevin been lackluster, but luckily James McAvoy gives a great performance, with it probably being the highlight of the film. He truly transforms into 5 different characters in one body, and does each one with just as much skill as the last, flawlessly switching between each of them. The movie is incredibly dark and deranged and occasionally darkly comedic, often in quick succession. My largest complaint is definitely the ending. Shyamalan started his career with two film that have good twist endings, and for some reason thought it was a good idea to try to shoehorn one in for every film after that. I don't even know what to call the ending (or should I say endings) of this film. There was a good place this could've ended (on a shot of Casey), yet it continued to show an unnecessary moment where Kevin talks to himself for a couple seconds. Then I thought it would end there. It goes on for a little longer to show a scene in a random diner in which people are watching the news report of this event, before one horrible actor messes up her only line, and Bruce Willis makes an unnecessary last second cameo for no reason. It was really baffling.<br/><br/>Edit: Found out the end was related to ""Unbreakable"". Haven't seen it yet, but still, why?<br/><br/>The editing and shot selection during some scenes make them all the more intense, and the lack of jump-scares was definitely appreciated. The music was used sparingly, but it worked most of the time when it was used, save for maybe one scene in which I found the music choice off-putting. Despite all of the flaws I mentioned, the good aspects outweigh the bad ones, and this could be a return to the stories that Shyamalan does best: interesting, psychological, character driven thrillers."
"moviexclusive","8","4","15","19 January 2017"," Great weaving of compelling story arcs and masterful performances by all the main actors makes Split a welcome sophomore return effort by Shyamalan
","If you've seen the trailer, you'll know the surprisingly clear premise of Split - the latest film from M. Night Shyamalan. A mysterious man kidnaps three girls and traps them in an unknown location. As they struggle to escape, it would seem that he has accomplices - except it turns out, ""they"" are him. It's all him.<br/><br/>James McAvoy is Kevin, the kidnapper who suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). We start the film when he is controlled by the stern and OCD-inflicted ""Dennis"", kidnapping Casey (Anya Taylor- Joy), Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) for a mysterious reason, with his companion personalities, ""Ms Patricia"" and ""Hedwig"". Together, they are considered ""the Horde""; three of twenty-three personalities taking turns to be ""in the light"" inside Kevin. This only turns more disturbing, as words like ""The Beast"" and ""sacred food"" are whispered by the trio, and the girls, naturally panic-stricken, work towards finding their way out of their jail.<br/><br/>It would seem that thirteen is a lucky number for Shyamalan. The 2015 The Visit was his return to form after a string of embarrassing work. He's always been a good explorer, asking what-ifs that turn subject matter on their heads, ending them with his signature plot twists. After realising this became his Achilles Heel, he has reinvented himself with a refreshed formula, and Split would reinforce that he is succeeding.<br/><br/>With his latest film, he comes at you three ways - the obvious plot of the girls being abducted by a trio of cultish personas that wants to somehow use them to release ""the beast"". The second is Casey's story, that runs parallel in the form of flashbacks, slowly unfurling the reason behind this youth's unusual behaviour. This explains not only her aloof and uncooperative nature, but also her worldly and calculated maneuvers, relative to the other two girls who are more impulsive.<br/><br/>It is the last that rattles the most, and it lies in the hands of both slayer and savior - the beast's doctrine that ""those who have not suffered are impure"" and Kevin's therapist, Dr. Fletcher (Betty Buckley), who theorised that those suffering from DID are not lesser human beings with damaged minds, but evolved greater beings, with sometimes supernatural traits. Weaving these three arcs seamlessly into Split is a testament to Shyamalan's persistent skill.<br/><br/>McAvoy is a notable actor, with enough fluidity to make for a fascinating Kevin. As ""Dennis"", he is sombre and uptight, crunching brows and fidgeting with object placements. ""Ms. Patricia"" comes along and he turns poised and deliberate, with arched eyebrows and tightened lips, holding back her delicious secrets. ""Hedwig"" is the attention-seeking nine-year-old, who we slowly find out has managed to steal ""the light"" from ""Barry"" - the usual benign controller of Kevin.<br/><br/>McAvoy does an admirable job, shifting nuances between the personas. But maybe his recent appearances as the bald Charles Xavier has grown too ingrained, and Kevin's transformations, though laudable, are not as defined as they should be. And though interesting to watch, and sometimes terrifying to decipher (as to who's in charge), the mental patient he plays does feel cliché and a bit of a caricature. Maybe Joaquin Phoenix (Shyamalan's original choice) would have fared better? Unfortunately, we'll never know.<br/><br/>Though the early scenes of escape were tense and exciting, the ones with Dr. Fletcher made for some of the most engaging watch. Although therapists are roles that tend to be relegated to help with exposition, Fletcher serves to be an equal and compassionate player in the hide-and-seek game, where she susses out who the controller might be. As she figures out that her theory might be more terrifying true than she expected, the audience follows her through her mortification.<br/><br/>Anna Taylor-Joy was a riveting victim. Her startling fragility and angst as Casey gives the movie its most moving moments. Her quick- thinking and measured moves reveals a survivor honed by the past, and as we get fed her history, we become thankful for it, and yet in the most conflicted of ways. Her ending scene and that withering look has us knowing that she's in for more terrifying stories to run from, and proves to be the most disturbing takeaway of all.<br/><br/>Shyamalan remains a great storyteller, reinforcing the main plot with small vignettes of charm and wit. In the scenes where ""Dennis"" masquerades as ""Barry"", he makes himself overly effete, and over- populates his speech with fashion trivia, when ""Barry"" was nothing like that, revealing stereotypes even among personas. In another snippet, as Fletcher shares her theory with her elderly neighbour, and calls her patients superior human beings, the old lady rejects her proposal, calling it rubbish, before picking up her phone having succumbed to an infomercial.<br/><br/>Split is so many things, and served up by the skillful editing of Luke Clarrocchi and the magnificently atmospheric score by West Dylan Thordson which swings overhead like a metallic guillotine, explores and represents this old adage the best - whatever doesn't kill you, makes you stronger."
"bsempowski","1","3","10","23 March 2019"," Worst movie of 2016
","Split is a terrible movie that promotes the idea the idea that people with mental illnesses are dangerous and need to be isolated and stopped before they destroy the lives of people that do not have mental illness. The pacing of this movie is also extremely terrible of the overall plot is pertaining ridiculous. I the movie really began to go hit downhill with the main character changes from someone with mental illness to a strong powerful almost supernatural creature is intended on destroying the lives of people. The movie almost makes it seem like it's better for them to die. This is extremely problematic considering the movie initially talks about having a real-life mental illness. Also the way to dissociated personality disorder is shown is inaccurate and extremely weird. The movie is very inconsistent sometimes it makes you try and feel sympathy for the main character and other times it depicts him as an unstable monster. It's not shopping at the still is terrible because M night Shyamalan is known for terrible movies. He made one good movie and never made another one. Also the ending is weird because his link to a movie 20 years ago."
"skybrick736","8","3","10","4 June 2017"," Split (8/10)
","When it comes to Split, M. Night Shyamalan has put questions to rest if he can ever create a thriller with terrific built suspense or a thoughtfully written twist ending. The story really anchored the film, which relied on intricate dialogue, scene by scene and a limited cast to sell it. What's different about modern Shyamalan thrillers compared to his past ones is his comic relief that he's been able to successfully apply. The ensemble of personalities James McAvoy portrays was engaging, each well-crafted and had their own distinguished presence. Along with McAvoy's performances, Anya Taylor-Joy was also marvelous as the introverted lead female with complexities that were well built. Split establishes an anxiety-filled atmosphere, fluid build up to the end, with little mercy shown to characters and viewers. Split is well worth the watch, and without spoiler, its recommended to watch Shyamalan's early thrillers beforehand."

I'm not saying it's a voluntary copy. Maybe both, Shyamalan and Williamson, being very smart connoisseurs of horror/mystery conventions have taking his stories of the same sources, but in any case I recommend you to see this curious episode of ""Glory Days"" and, after all, the complete t.v. show ""Glory Days"", a little underrated and very enjoyable for fans of mystery/horror and of Mr. Williamson clever thrillers."

"ycho-29371","8","3","10","8 May 2017"," M. Night's Comeback and an Outstanding Performance from James McAvoy
","Split is the newest film from the writer and director, M. Night Shyamalan which his name became a joke since he has created some disasters films mostly in the category of action and blockbusters. However, with the 2015's The Visit he has shown signals of his recreation of the genre as well as a sign for his return to thrilling form. As this was my anticipated film of the moment, I was vastly surprised from this movie. At this point, we could agree that M. Night Shyamalan has been returned and welcomed by other audiences in return form for thrillers. Not only does this film succeeds his career in recent memory, but also creates an unexpected super villain origin story that is a form of a rarity these days. <br/><br/>When the term 'superhero' or 'super villain' comes to our mind, we genuinely think of huge Hollywood action blockbusters, that is a huge aspect of modern day entertainment and a leasehold to most modern released films. As it takes incredibly huge budgets to create, it also earns or exceeds these amounts of money/box offices that have become extremely essential. However, with the film Split it breaks this stereotypes instantaneously. It may trick most audiences as a straight- up thrilling film, as three girls including Casey Cook (Anya Taylor Joy) gets kidnapped by a man named Kevin (James Mcavoy). As it seems that the man has OCD and perfectionism, as the days increases other unusually uncommon events occur as different personalities or identities are expressed. Half way, the film reveals that the man named Kevin has a rare psychological disease called 'Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)' and has distinct 23 different personalities that live in Kevin one form body. First off, the film's entire premise and the plot is very unusual and interesting as in cinema history, this range of ideas hasn't been thought out. The film does handle this idea in a fascinating method and a classical method that does not follow similar routines of modern day film storytelling. Also, it has a sense of 'fun' as the film essentially knows how to express these different identities and has fun playing around with them. Most of all, James Mcavoy is absolutely courageous in this film. He gives a variety of range of his acting ability while encouraging himself deeply that he might just be one of those rare actors who is 'really' acting. He gives such an amazing and phenomenal performance that you just cannot keep your eyes off. When the film falters at a certain point, James Mcavoy arrives to pick it up again and he is the best aspect that elevates this film in a high ranking. Anya Taylor Joy is good as well as she gives a very compelling performance as the lead girl. The film uses a lot of its tension on the environmental conditions, the sense of deep isolation. It does not have a consistent flow of true tension and thrills which could have been improved. Some of the dialogues are clunky and unusual in which some character human interactions seemed awkward and too much scientific. However, the cinematography is truly excellent. From the cinematographer of It Follows, it does have a very sleek and immaculate visual to be viewed. To sum up, it is a beautiful looking movie. As a film made by M. Night, we definitely expect ending plot twists that make us praise this filmmaker. The ending of this film is definitely one of his best endings and a very unexpected, surprising treat for fans of M. Night, himself. Aside from some major flaws, this film is excellent of what it has achieved through the ingredients M. Night has been given."
"SnoopyStyle","7","3","10","16 April 2017"," M. Night comeback gaining speed
","Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy) has been getting into trouble at school. She and her two young friends, Claire Benoit (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula), are kidnapped by a mysterious stranger named Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy). Kevin has been getting treatment from Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley) for having 23 personalities. Dr. Fletcher fears Kevin has been taken over by the less desirable identities Dennis and Patricia. She dismisses their fears of an emerging Beast in their psyche. The movie also flashbacks to a young Casey on a hunting trip with her uncle John.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan has regained much of his footing. There are some good scenes and the acting is great. McAvoy has the showy acting and he delivers. Anya Taylor-Joy does most of her work with her stone-face and those eyes. There is a nice sequence with a coat-hanger. I wonder if there is more tension to be had. M. Night keeps most of the violence off camera. I would definitely change the number 23 to something more manageable. Six would be more compelling as the audience counts up each identity. This is a solid addition to the M. Night library."
"joelypo","6","3","10","11 April 2017"," Disappointing
","Despite its very good reviews, ""Split"" is a rather boring film. The majority of the film takes place in an unknown building (which turns out to be in a zoo) with 3 girls who have been captured by a man with dissociative identity disorder (he has 23 personalities, the 24th is yet to be unleashed). The kidnap scene could have been easily avoided, the girl in the front seat made absolutely no effort to escape. The ending is dreadful. When the 24th personality is unleashed, the man gains supernatural abilities making the film hard to believe/relate to. Overall, some parts of the film were intense and relatively enjoyable, but the nonsensical situation is very hard to believe."
"cyokel","5","4","16","22 February 2017"," Average
","I was really excited about this one and was, for the most part, let down. I cannot say completely let down, because as I sit here writing this about six hours after I saw the movie, I do have some of the images from it in my mind, and while they seem dull, are actually sort of creeping me out and staying with me. But still, unfortunately I have to say this was just average. It was simply too slow, repetitive, and honestly pretty boring for about 70% of the movie. If you have seen The Happening, it's pretty much like that, and honestly The Happening might be better than this. It probably is. But if you remember those sort of awkward stares between Marky Mark and co. imagine 10 times that, and you get the awkward stares of this movie. It's just one awkward stare after another, and the dialogue which starts out interesting and telling of mental illness gets very repetitive and anticlimactic. I enjoyed some of the twisty nature toward the end, but I was having a hard time staying gripped for much of the movie. It was like I was forcing myself to be gripped. Jumped in my seat once, and that was fun. Had a kind of rich proposition placed on me at the end. So....not all bad, but I feel like after two hours I should have been more thrilled."

","The plot is basically a kidnapping where three captive women need to match wits with their abductor's supposed 23 personalities. James McAvoy brilliantly portrays maybe 6 of the 23, ranging from a 9 yr old boy to a woman, a fashion designer, etc. I suppose a 2 hr film wasn't enough time to develop more.<br/><br/>5 points for truly scaring me and the 6th for James McAvoy's performance.

","I really enjoyed watching this movie. James McAvoy does a brilliant job playing the different personalities he has. The main character suffers from Disociated Identity Disorder and has twenty three different personalities. You only get to see about eight different personalities but they are all great to watch and add the necessary suspense for this movie. Some personalities are harmless and others are dangerous, and that's what makes it interesting to watch because the girls that have been kidnapped try to figure out who they could trust to get out of their imprisonment. Anya Taylor-Joy does also a great job playing one of the kidnapped girls, while she had herself suffered of traumatic events in her life. Some reviewers will tell you that people that suffer from D.I.D. are not violent or whatever but it doesn't matter because they just don't get the point that this is a movie. It's not real folks, so get over it that not everything is accurate in a movie. I thought the movie was better then a lot of other movies in the same genre so it deserves a higher rating."

I will not talk about what happened in the body of the movie, only the last few seconds before the credits. (altough i did want to add that James Mcavoy did an AMAZING job, and made the character so good, the movie is worth watching for him alone, as he just ate a hot dog, lol.) It will make your opinion raise a point or two on the 10 point scale just knowing this. This movie is a kind of like a bridge. Its not really a sequel, but its setting up a sequel to unbreakable. The movie unbreakable, as you remember, is about Bruce willis's character gaining extraordinary powers of strength and clairvoyance, and his subsequent rise as a hero. Split, is a movie about james McAvoy character also gaining strength and powers, and his subsequent rise as a supervillan. At the end credits you see Bruce willis show up, and as I went home to rewatch unbreakable, it dawned on me, where they were going. They are going to make an UNBREAKABLE 2. I cant wait!!!!

I was a huge fan of his earlier films like The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs. Then, in my opinion, he made some films that missed the mark. It has been a while since I thoroughly enjoyed one of his movies. But, now that has changed! I absolutely loved Split! I thought it was a redemption for Shyamalan. The story, in my opinion, is incredibly engrossing and captivating. The performances are strong and worthy of accolades. I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller and who is familiar with M. Night's unique style.

","""He's done awful things to people, and he'll do awful things to you."" <br/><br/>This statement is applicable to most of M. Night Shyamalan's recent movies. Making us watch films like ""The Happening"" and ""The Last Airbender"" made me skeptical that he would ever make a comeback. <br/><br/>But boy was I wrong! Split is a fantastic movie. McAvoy's performance is nothing short of perfection. Cycling through 9 different personalities is an incredible feat. Anya Tayor-Joy shows promise as the smart, and skilled heroin. Even Betty Buckley (Who plays Kevin's Psychiatrist) did a fine job. <br/><br/>The story is not lacking either. It's compelling, tense, and oh so Shyamalan. As McAvoy cycles through characters, it is exciting to see where this personality will take the story, as well as what it will do with its time ""in the light"".<br/><br/>And who can write a review without talking about the ending? Of course, this is a spoiler free review, so I won't go into detail, but it is great. Nothing short of great. <br/><br/>The only thing is I would not have marketed this movie as a ""horror"" film. I know that scared a lot of my friends and family away, so I would've said ""psychological thriller"" for sure.

The answer seems to be no.<br/><br/>I thought this would be a psychological thriller, which it leads you to believe. But it ends up being a cheesy ""comic book"" style movie, with scantily-clad teenage girls being abused and a supernatural human monster. I thought at least there would be some big ""reveal"" near the end to make it satisfying, but there wasn't. Are we supposed to be impressed that it all took place in a zoo? (Notice that ""zoo"" starts with zzzzzzz...) Or that this film is apparently a sequel to ""Unbreakable,"" a forgettable movie I saw ages ago? <br/><br/>There's also a subtext about child abuse which is disturbing. The psycho was abused as a child, and we learn that the survivor girl ALSO was abused...by a creepy uncle. She has marks on her body from cutting and from cigarettes, which we don't see until about 1:42:00 - self-inflicted, or done by uncle? And at the end we learn she is still in the custody of said uncle. This girl is supposed to be smart, yet she says nothing to anyone about the abuse?<br/><br/>Now MNS reveals this is the ""middle film"" in a trilogy. And if you're familiar with other middle films of trilogies, you know that usually means an unsatisfactory ending and a plot that just treads water. That's what we have here, folks. Don't waste your time, despite good performances by McEvoy and Buckley."

There are some scenes like when Barry's therapist (or psychologist, sorry I don't know the correct term) is finding out that he might have done something wrong, it is incredibly tense. And that is because James McAvoy and Betty Buckley give fantastic performances (although McAvoy can ham it up a bit). But there are also some scenes that just fail to scare me or tense me up in the same way. This movie has an interesting ""message"" to it and that is the best people out there are the people who experienced a lot of hardship and pain. I like that, however the people who didn't live a hard life are portrayed as stupid and worthless. And again, in the movies eyes. Of the three girls kidnapped, two of them are portrayed as stupid and as stereotypical ""millennials"" (which holy Jesus bugs me), but they weren't that bad to me. They were scared, just because they are used to scary situations like our main protagonist doesn't mean they are dumb, it just means they aren't as likely to escape. But the movie really wants us to hate them. But whatever, that is a big rant. Overall, it didn't waste my time, but I wouldn't care to watch it again.<br/><br/>Solid C"

"kermitkid","8","1","2","30 March 2020"," Terrifying
","I've had skepticism with M. Night Shamalayan lately. His films have been kind of hit-and-miss these past few years. I think if he does more of what he did with this movie, he can be back on top in a few years. This movie is crazy intense! It was actually a lot darker than I thought it would be. There are some extremely mature and dark themes and subject matter and it almost goes into rated R territory at points. However, it is these themes and subject matter that make these characters who they are, and explains why they act the way they do. James McAvoy's performance is particularly impressive. This film proves that he can play anyone a director needs him to play. There's moments where he's funny there's moments where he's chilling, and there's moments where his performance makes you hold your breath worried he'll harm you. The three young actresses in the film provide stellar performances as well. There's such range of emotion with them. You sympathize with them, you fear for them, you feel what they feel. Genuine, tearful performances, that actually look tearful and not like acting are hard to come by, and they pulled it off very well. Like I said, this film is very heavy. It's a hard PG-13. I don't want to advocate for this film due to the dark, heavy themes and subject matter so I don't want to say that it was a good movie. At times, it is very hard to watch. But judging it purely from a filmmaking standpoint of ""Was it well made? Was it well written? Was it well acted? Was it well directed?"" etc. the answer is yes. If you're a fan of M Night's earlier work, this hearkens back to that. It's still too early at this point to say if he's redeemed himself from the garbage that was ""The Last Airbender"" and ""After Earth"", but if he can keep doing what he did with this film, he just might.

And of course I can't NOT mention James McAvoy's AMAZING ACTING! Almost made me believe that they were separate people entirely, you could tell just by the facial expressions who he was."
"pokemon_trainer_lucas","9","1","2","21 June 2019"," Mindblowing
","This film is worthy of a lot of praise! This was one of my favourite horrors for a long time, simply because it is daring and unique, and handles difficult subjects (such as child abuse, mental health and self harm) as sensitively as it can whilst still being shocking. The twist at the end isn't quite as good as some of M Shyamalan's other movies, but it is still very good, and the ending sets it up nicely for the sequel which came this year. If you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend it."

","Split is a unique film that presents a different perspective than horror movies. It shows us fascinating moments full of mystery and suspense while at the same time offering us scenes with a high quality, especially for the fantastic work that James McAvoy does when it comes to acting the different personalities of the protagonist.<br/><br/>A film full of suspense with quite intense scenes that manage to put us on the edge of our chairs; the fascinating narrative shows us a special case of a young man with multiple personalities ranging from innocent attitudes to violent and dangerous personalities. To achieve this, it requires a quality of performance quite high, and McAvoy simply does the perfect job for it, is the star of this film, the face completely, he sells us this film.<br/><br/>However, although the movie itself owes its success to the excellent performances, also has a script and a convincing direction that helps us get into the film and feel the emotions of each person. Humanly and emotionally structured, it makes us want/concern about each person. It is especially great the relationship that we can get to feel for the multiple personalities presented by James, because they are different complementary people, which are represented completely different thanks to the incredible work of James.<br/><br/>An intense movie with thrilling and excellent performances."
"douglasassisrj","10","1","2","15 June 2019"," Incredible
","Split is a movie of psychological terror featuring an excellent performance by Scottish actor James McAvoy (X-Men) as a deranged killer named Kevin (main character) sometimes terrifying, grotesque, pitiful, lovable, brilliant, confident, pathetic, happy, sad, mad, and glad. Kevin is everyone - and a lot more. That's because he suffers from multiple personality disorder (MPD). He has 23 distinct personalities. Some are sweet, as Hedwig, a 9-year-old boy who loves to dance. Others, like the fashion designer Barry, are bizarre and obsessive. Still others are dangerous sociopaths. There's Dennis the rapist, and Patricia, a woman with ice water in her veins. Split is a disturbing film that covers every evil human going from kidnapping to cannibalism. But it's also wildly funny in parts.
I like the fact that Shyamalan has chosen to focus on MPD (Dissociative identity disorder) after the MPD becomes news of newspaper headlines and special talk-shows. The story is simple: Kevin is convinced that the beast, which is, in effect, his 24th personality, is finally ready to arrive. He abducts three teenage girls, played by Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, and Jessica Sula which are supporting characters, to offer to the creature as food. It's heavy on character and dialogue, and when it comes to special effects and action is poor. The Film is set in an underground bunker surrounded by endless tunnels and corridors. Split isn't propelled by violence, but by suspense, with scene parts that focus on each girl's attempt to escape or to outwit Kevin. Shyamalan created a series that don't fit neatly into a genre. Best described as explorations of the fantastique, works such as Signs and The Village are all based in a scientific reality. They are truly exhilarating and fun. The film is good as its predecessor (Unbreakable).

","It never gets suspenseful because all of the split characters look and sound so damn hilarious. It's not like Buffalo Bill, in Silence of the lambs, who was tragically comical and chilling to the bone at the same time. These characters are just plain silly. To be honest I only kept watching because McAvoy gave such a delightfully funny performance all throughout the movie. It's not his fault the writing and the direction he received wasn't beneficial to the story.
At the end of the movie I was left with one question. Is Dennis a side of Shyamalans personality? Is that why there were a bunch of very young girls in bras and panties in the movie?"
"jp281995","8","1","2","26 February 2019"," Unsettling
","Upon watching the trailer, I assumed Split is one of those horror movies doomed to be flops. But I was wrong.<br/><br/>Split is about three teenaged girls who are abducted by a man. The title suggests that the man has a dissociative identity disorder. He has a lot of personalities (16 personalities, correct me if I'm wrong). And each personality has a different memory and attitude.<br/><br/>James Macavoy gave me creeps in portraying the unsettling villain. Anya Taylor-Joy also did a good job portraying the young woman with a troubled past. The story is creepy, and the reveal that the villain actually has superpowers didn't shock me (because of spoilers) but it was great. The ending reveals that this is actually the sequel to Unreakable. Makes me excited to watch the third movie.<br/><br/>Recommended."

"EddyTheMartian007","8","1","2","22 January 2019"," Another Great Shyamalan film with a great surprise at the end!
","Split another actually really good movie from M. Night Shyamalan.<br/><br/>Let's get this started with the best part of the movie, James McAvoy as the 24 personalities (which we don't get to see all of though). He's brilliant, just phenomenal, honestly amazing. If it wasn't for McAvoy's stellar performance this movie wouldn't have been that good, he really carries the movie. The rest of the cast is mostly good. Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke, was good, and I thought she was a very intriguing character. The psychiatrist, Dr. Fletcher, who's played by Betty Buckley was really good too. At first I wasn't sure if I'd like that aspect of the film, but It ended up being one of the best parts of the movie. The other side characters are whatever. Nothing special, nothing really to talk about. The other 2 kidnapped girls, which I can't remember the names are just the cliched characters, I didn't care for them at all, and they were honestly a little annoying, but I think that was their purpose.<br/><br/>There isn't too much to dissect story wise. I mean it's a pretty simple plot, with some twists and turns along the way, but nothing too amazing. It was pretty exciting at moments though. I think the start was kinda slow, and the weakest part, but once it picks up it really gets great.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie there were some flashbacks, and at first I was a little confused about these. What was the point? They were just little tiny tidbits every once in a while, and then at the end you realize why they were here the whole time. It explains some stuff about the characters, and it's shown when it's relevant to the story. I thought it was very well done, and it goes into some surprisingly dark territory.<br/><br/>If I'd have to look at the horror elements I'd say it fails in that aspect. It isn't scary, it's more of a thriller. The cinematography is great, and there are some horror elements, but it was never really enough. The same thing goes with the score from West Dylan Thordson. It has some horror elements, and I think it's really good for the most part, but it didn't enhance the scene enough to make it scary. However the set design is great, and it gives a creepy atmosphere, but I still didn't wasn't scary, or even that creepy. I mean if it was labeled as a horror I was expecting some scarier stuff, but this is a very minor problem for me, because I mean the horror wouldn't have really made the movie that much better, it would've just heightened an already really good movie for me.<br/><br/>The third act when it all comes together was surprisingly good. The movie doesn't feed you a lot of information, it lets you interpret it for yourself, which I really liked. Once we get to the finale and everything starts getting revealed and everything happens I really just loved it. I do think however that there are some inconsistencies with the hoard. Also earlier there's something a certain character could've done to save themselves, but they don't for some reason. Also I do feel like the ending was a bit sudden, but I really don't have any other complaints though. The final scene was seriously so exciting though to see that certain character appear.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed this movie. I think James McAvoy gives a phenomenal performance. He truly is amazing. I loved the creepy atmosphere the movie has. The cinematography and score are just really good. I was constantly engaged and intrigued. I liked how the movie gave you little hints, and never really explained what really happens. It lets you think about these moments, and then it call clicks. Even though I have some minor problems with the film, I still really enjoyed it, and I think the it was very well done. Also again the finale is awesome!<br/><br/>8/10"
"SharkByteAudioProductions","10","1","2","13 January 2019"," A surprisingly effective rush with grand themes
","M Night Shyamalan can be hit or miss but I can honestly say I wasn't expecting to enjoy Split as much as I did. Starting with a simple enough premise, the intensity and pacing is really effective - it hooks you in straight away.<br/><br/>Simply put, the cinematography, soundtrack and acting is really well crafted (James McAvoy acts his character VERY well) and it makes Split a really entertaining watch - it executes everything really well and keeps you interested with its intriguing plot.<br/><br/>It won't be for everyone and it isn't very straightforward with its plot but I believe it alludes to grand themes that elevates what could have been a simple thriller concept and story."

An intriguing setup is wasted in this sloppy, laborious blend of horror film and psychological thriller which lacks suspense, scares, or a really good payoff. McAvoy appears to be having a ball conveying all those various personalities, but the rest of the acting is so underwhelming, the plot twists and the exposition so ineffectual that it really doesn't seem to be worth the effort.

","Split<br/><br/>Split is a return to form for writer/director M.Night Shyamalan and also offers a career best performance by James McAvoy.
Or should I say career best performances?
McAvoy plays Kevin a man diagnosed with twenty three distinct personalities. He is responsible for abducting three young women and holds them captive against their will.
What is most impressive about this tightly scripted thriller is McAvoy's ability to switch between the personalities so convincingly. Every little trait and mannerism is brilliantly performed as he changes his voice and body language to create the distinctive characters.
One moment McAvoy could be a nine year old boy and the next he's a creepy OCD ridden middle aged man.
He bounces from one character to another with seamless efficiency.<br/><br/>The three kidnapped girls must find means of escape before a twenty-fourth personality surfaces.
One that is monsterous and all together evil.
Ana Taylor-Joy is the stand
out abductee as she plays Casey Cooke. A troubled girl with just enough survival instinct to challenge all of Kevin's personas.<br/><br/>Split is carefully written and wonderfully shot. Reminiscent of Shyamalan's early work, such as Unbreakable and The Sixth sense.
There's a intriguing twist at the end that links this story to one of Shyamalan's earlier films too.
I'll not give the surprise away as it will set up a sequel to Split and another one of Shyamalan's movies.
Split could be considered to be a sequel in its own right.
Subtle nods may indicate to this but it is only truly revealed right before credits role.
This is a superbly acted, directed and written thriller that is well worth your time.
I'm now looking forward to seeing what will happen next."

","Shyamalan has made a few films in his career that didn't quite grab me (The Village, The Happening and The Last Airbender for instance). However, this is not one of them. I didn't know much about this film other than having a basic idea of the premise and no expectations, and I am so glad I watched it (if only I had of seen it at the movies!). <br/><br/>Split is the story of a man, who in his suffering the hands of his abusive mother and abandoning father, developed Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). This results in the emergence of 23 personalities as a coping/defence mechanism, gifting him the nickname 'The Horde'. With hint of a 24th personality on the way, three girls being held captive by The Horde must escape before the 24th personality emerges.<br/><br/>This film looks at DID through the lens of how the disorder can unlock the potential of the human psyche and transcend the limits of human physiology - believing is to become. James McAavoy gives an absolutely amazing performance whilst shifting seamlessly through multiple personalities, in body and in voice, along side the talented Anya Taylor-Joy who also gives a great performance of her own as the intelligent and troubled Casey Cooke.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an emotionally stirring thriller with great acting and an interesting story line, this is a film to watch."

The guy turned into an actual beast at the end of the movie! Did you think a person who have mental illness irl can transform their body like that?? <br/><br/>For those who don't know or haven't watch it, this film is a sequel to M.

It's ridiculous how some people taking the mental illness theme in this movie so seriously and hating on it without watching it first.<br/><br/>What I love about this movie was James McAvoy superb acting.

","Odd-girl-out Claire and two classmates are kidnapped by Kevin, host to multiple personalities. Can they escape, or enlist the help of one or more of McAvoy's personalities, before The Beast arrives. Does The Beast even exist?<br/><br/>This claustrophobic suspense thriller clatters along very satisfactorily in its own right - the girls, held prisoner by someone who is clearly very wrong in the head, have to overcome tearful hysteria and try to find a way out of their predicament before the much-heralded Beast arrives, a story which has its own self-contained clock ticking away. The girls are pleasingly hysterical - Claire, who has her own secrets, less so - but turn their attentions to problem-solving, and you root for them to find a way out of the trap they are in. Shyamalan's writing here works well after a number of clunkers.<br/><br/>Then we have to factor in James McAvoy's performance/s as 8 or so of the two dozen multiple personalities. If I am ruthlessly critical, a couple of those are a bit on the obvious side. However, given that these are by far the most entertaining personalities - the audience was laughing out loud at Hedwig's dancing - and that they contrast so well with their far more sinister confederates, I think this can be forgiven.<br/><br/>This is McAvoy's film. He holds the screen effortlessly whenever he is in front of the camera, and much of the film's effectiveness comes from not knowing who he is going to be next.<br/><br/>Which is not to dismiss the girls. All are excellent, but I continue to be excited by Anya Taylor-Joy: after The Witch and Morgan, this role is a departure which, again, suits the off-kilter intensity she projects so well.<br/><br/>And the final throwaway scene was an utter delight."

'Split (2017)' is a bit silly regardless of its retroactive narrative justifications and lacks confidence in a number of key places, leading to a few on-the-nose expository dumps and jarringly unnecessary flashbacks. Despite some downright dodgy dialogue, it still manages to be both entertaining and interesting throughout, even if it's final act is incredibly rushed and wraps itself up in a neat yet unsatisfying way that only serves to bait a sequel that, with Shyamalan not quite back to what he once was, will surely disappoint. 7/10"

","Plot; Three teenage girls are kidnapped by a man with Dissociative identity disorder whose various personalities perform an increasingly macabre play for his literally captive audience. <br/><br/>The arc M. Night Shyamalan's career is an interesting one. Though not technically his first film, for all intents and purposes The Sixth Sense is the beginning of his career. For better or worse, that film's infamous twist branded him as the ""twist guy"". Follow-up Unbreakable was less successful both critically and commercially (likely due audiences expecting one thing and getting something else entirely), but has since grown in stature and may rank as his most beloved. Signs had Newsweek declaring him the next Spielberg and it seemed nothing could stop the Shyamalan express. Then came The Village. Though a hit, it was less so than his previous efforts, and the twist left fans divided. From there it was a bit of a downward spiral. Lady in the Water left people scratching their heads, and The Happening had them laughing in a bad way. No longer able to do M. Night Shyamalan films, he took for hire gigs like The Last Airbender and After Earth. They weren't catastrophic financial flops, but neither film was well received (though I actually liked After Earth). But then Shyamalan made The Visit, which did modestly well (though exceptionally well when juxtaposed against its tiny budget) and met with equally modest critical response (though exceptional when juxtaposed against his previous efforts this decade).<br/><br/>That brings us to Split. A hit with critics and audiences, it seemed to signal Shyamalan getting his mojo back. This wasn't a for hire gig, but a return to the kinds of films he'd built his reputation on. The latter is certainly true. Whatever else it is, Split is pure Shyamalan. The first two acts are very solid, with Shyamalan slowly winding the string tighter and tighter as his principle cast do excellent work; particularly James McAvoy. Playing a man with 23 personalities (though only about a quarter of those are shown), he creates distinct characters. Sometimes transforming right before your eyes. It's impressive stuff, and worthy of Oscar consideration. Things fall apart a bit in the third act, as Shyamalan doubles down on the more fantastical aspects of the story with diminishing returns. A last second reveal does change how we view these events, and in this new context the last act works considerably better. Whether or not Split would've worked better as a standalone piece without the more fantastical elements than it does now merged with another of Shyamalan's works is up to the viewer. For me, I kinda side with the former, but I must admit that I'm intrigued to see where things go from here in the announced sequel."
"jimbo-53-186511","6","1","2","18 November 2017"," A strong performance from McAvoy and a fairly well-constructed first two-thirds make this worthwhile, but it derails and becomes a bit silly and absurd in its final third
","Three girls are kidnapped by a man with Dissociative Personality Disorder (with a total of 23 personalities). The girls try their best to escape from said individual, but little do they know the fate that awaits them when a new 24th personality is said to emerge in the very near future...<br/><br/>In Shyamalan's latest film he throws us into the main plot of the film more-or-less straight away which in one way is good (we don't get a long and potentially dull build up prior to being thrown into the kidnapping itself) and bad because there's no development of the principal protagonists. On balance, the set-up provides more good than bad; whilst I found that I didn't care much for the protagonists as people I did care for the situation that they were caught up in which meant that I did find Split to be a fairly involving experience overall..<br/><br/>I think one slight problem with films that explore D.I.D or any other personality disorders is that sometimes it's hard to perhaps give them the true justice that they deserve... I think that in order to make them truly compelling, terrifying and realistic the filmmakers would have to explore each personality on more than a superficial level in order to make this aspect work, but in an average 105 to 120 minute film you don't really have the sufficient time to accomplish this goal. This is perhaps one reason why films focusing on personality disorders of say two or perhaps 3 different personalities arguably work better as there is more time afforded to each personality. By attempting to cover a multitude of personalities, Shyamalan's narrative unfortunately lacks depth as we never really learn a great deal about the various personalities...<br/><br/>Whilst Shyamalan's narrative may not be quite up to scratch thankfully the same cannot be said for his directing which here is actually superb... The isolated setting is put to good use and Shyamalan also gets one hell of a performance from James McAvoy - some of his personas are chilling whilst some of his personas show a vulnerable side to him and he's so convincing that you sometimes forget that this is all done by the same person. The film is also well-paced with plenty going on and few, if any dull moments.<br/><br/>There are parts of the film where one of the girls is trying to manipulate one of McAvoy's weaker personas in order to effect her escape. This was an interesting part of the story and the film probably would have been stronger if this was utilised more in the film... perhaps if all 3 girls worked together in trying to achieve this or maybe if they tried playing the personalities off against each other. If you think about it I'm almost certain that this would have made the film stronger as there is already something of a power-struggle between some of the personalities which would have been exacerbated had the girls managed to manipulate the necessary personalities. For me, this would have made the film more involving and would have perhaps had me on the edge-of-my seat a bit more. However, Shyamalan seems to put most of the focus on McAvoy's personas either intimidating the girls, discussing power struggling and the 24th personality in therapy sessions or sermonising on the reasons that the girls have been chosen; these things are strong enough to make it work, but I got the feeling that a bit more effort the film could have been better.<br/><br/>Sadly, the film does derail slightly into the absurd in its final third; in fact it becomes so silly and ridiculous that it becomes hard to take it seriously - which is odd considering the film is about an individual with D.I.D and one wonders why Shyamalan felt the need to drag the film in a silly direction given the rather serious subject matter?<br/><br/>Still it is a pretty solid film and whilst it's not in the same league as Shyamalan's earlier films such as The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable it is much better than The Visit which Shyamalan released a year earlier than this one."
"proenne","6","1","2","15 October 2017"," From 8 to 6 stars
","Very, very good movie, as most of M. Shyamalan's movies are. James McAvoy is playing geniusly well. Kind of surprising and twisted plot, which is a favorite of mine. The movie throughout is a certain 8, or maybe even higher, but then M. Shyamalan twisted it even further in the last scene, and the movie dropped way low for me. 6 stars for the ridiculously bad ending - we know you're a big time producer and director, but a connecting dot to one of your other movies like that, is like watching a rapper who just hit the jackpot, and is throwing 100 dollar bills around in his new musicvideo."
"ryansssemple","7","1","2","1 October 2017"," Could have been amazing!
","I enjoyed this film but I wouldn't watch it again nor will I ever rave about it.<br/><br/>Firstly I must say I loved McAvoy's acting in this, he was creepy, funny and slightly sexy in some ways. The films ending left me feeling underwhelmed and a little bit flat, I wanted more. I think if the story went in a different direction it could have been one of the better horror films of late."
"chris-bushwacker","6","1","2","26 September 2017"," Mostly Entertaining but ultimately an indulgent mess
","I would rate this a 2 star film but because James McAvoy is good value, the other 4 stars are for his performance.<br/><br/>I have deliberately not read any other reviews, just jumped straight to leaving this one having finished watching a scant 5 minutes ago.<br/><br/>It seems to me reading the trivia section, that M. Night Shyamalan just loves himself, from appearing in his own films (no, I did not know that) and referencing his previous films that many viewers (myself included) may not have seen, and rendering the final scenes of ""Split"" into the kind of gibberish spouted all along by James McAvoy's character(s). <br/><br/>The 'heroine in peril' moment towards the end was dragged out for so long I was muttering ""Come on, give us a twist or just end it"". I got my wish - within 5 minutes it was ended with an apparent twist I just didn't get at all (that's right! Because I was supposed to know all about some previous film which I had never seen). Total crock of crap, I'm sorry.<br/><br/>Dr. Fletcher ought to have been locked up herself, allowing a bunch of personalities to take control of poor Kevin, who had not seen the light of day himself since 2014. Just like many in the medical profession, for the sake of a good published paper she had no problem with Kevin being incarcerated somewhere inside himself while the criminals he harboured ran amok in all directions. Obviously interviewing them was more important than Kevin's wellbeing and public safety.<br/><br/>At the beginning, when the three girls were abducted, Casey was so passive and weird I was expecting to discover she was a party to the abduction. Well apparently she wasn't. She was just traumatised by past events in her own life that ultimately had no real bearing on her character's behaviour, unless we are supposed to applaud that she eventually fights back (if you can call shutting yourself in a cage and being willing to fire at a crazy man as liberating in some way). I mean, who wouldn't fire at him in the same circumstances, whether you had a sense of deja vu or not? <br/><br/>The final 5 minutes were total nonsense for anyone who has not seen whatever film it was we were all supposed to have a light bulb moment over. At best it is cavalier behaviour towards the viewer, who will likely be confused when the whole film collapses into an incoherent mess, and at worst it shows what hubris can do to a man, that he would hang the ending of a film on a previous work because he is too important and full of himself to bother finishing it in a way everyone can understand.<br/><br/>(Spoiler alert: Bruce Willis? What? A man in a wheelchair 15 years ago? What? Mr. Who?). That may not have been a spoiler for you ... if so, welcome to the club!<br/><br/>Crap, crap, absolute crap. And if anyone is moved to think ""Stupid Reviewer, fancy not knowing blah blah blah ..."" it is really unattractive to lord it over other people because they don't know squat about this director's previous films. Why should we? That's just buying into his little superiority club and being self-congratulatory. Perhaps I should binge view every film that has ever been made by living directors in case another one decides to follow suit! <br/><br/>I have never seen such a mess and deflating ending in ages and I'm sorry about that. M. Night Shyamalan, shame on you. You don't deserve the veneer of respectability and professionalism conferred on this film by Mr. McAvoy. I sat and watched it for 2 hours and you ridicule me by offering an ending for the ""in crowd"". So maybe now I know how Casey felt all this time, on the outside with the other girls laughing at her. Eat as many burgers as you like in your next film - I won't be admiring your cameo because I won't be watching."

","M Night Shyamalan's Split starts with three teenage girls being kidnapped by Kevin (James McAvoy) who traps them in a dungeon of some kind. The girls do plot to escape but get caught, they discover that Kevin has multiple personalities although only a few tend to emerge more regularly. However Kevin seems to be on the verge of the creation of a more beastlier manifestation.<br/><br/>One of the kidnapped girl's Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) seems to be more competent with her survivalist instincts due to how she was bought up which we find out in flashbacks. Meanwhile Kevin has been in the care of a renowned psychiatrist who seems to be concerned about him and investigates further.<br/><br/>Shyamalan hints at a universe shown in his previous film Unbreakable, where a person could elevate to a different level of being. He is helped by a stellar performance by McAvoy who does struggle to show all 23 personalities.<br/><br/>In its heart though it is still 'girls that are kidnapped and held in a dungeon film' and frankly they tend to be two a penny in any given month. Despite the split personality gimmick the film was not that innovative or interesting and derivative of films like Silence of the Lambs."

"RLTerry1","9","3","12","20 January 2017"," Intensely Captivating! Hitchcockian!
","Intensely captivating! M. Night Shyamalan stages a successful return to the horror-thriller genre in the brilliantly intriguing motion picture Split. When Universal Pictures, arguably the king of the American horror film, Blumhouse Productions, and Shyamalan combine their respective visual storytelling skills, the result is a dynamic thriller full of outstanding twists and turns. Shyamalan, long known for surprise or bizarre endings, provides audiences with the biggest surprise of all: he is back, and it's a completely satisfying cinematic experience! Beginning with 2015's The Visit, Shyamalan has been working on a comeback; and Split is the final evidence needed to support his successful return to the silver screen. James McAvoy delivers an outstanding performance–or should I say performances–every minute of the film. Although the concept of building a suspense- thriller around a character with dissociative identify disorder (DID), formerly known as multiple personality disorder, is not a new one–after all Norman Bates is the most iconic example. M. Night Shyamalan puts his own spin on the character-type by adding his special blend of what can only be referred to as ""shyamalan-ness."" You'll definitely want to see it again in order to catch everything that you missed the first time.<br/><br/>Just when you think the movie is going one direction, it throws you for an unpredictable loop. Split provides audiences with the same level of captivation as M. Night delivered in Signs or even in The Visit. Very much character-driven, this film could have easily taken a turn for the campy or par-for- the-course approach to a central character with DID; but Shyamalan proves that a familiar premise can be crafted into a whole new experience. After the incredible success of 1999's The Sixth Sense, audiences everywhere set the bar for Shyamalan quite high–in fact he was prematurely compared to a 21st century Alfred Hitchcock. While it is highly unlikely that any director will reach the iconic status of Hitchcock, Shyamalan was seen as a director who would provide a similar experience to that which earned Hitchcock the moniker the master of suspense. Evidence of his admiration of Hitchcock can be been in the title sequence of Split. It bares a striking resemblance to the opening title sequence from Psycho. <br/><br/>However, the danger in prematurely setting expectations too high is that you may likely be setting yourself up for disappointment. And that is precisely what happened with Shyamalan. From killer plants to invisible supernatural entities, he began to lose the cache he earned in the early 2000s. M. Night would spend years disappointing audiences to the point that he became a joke–a parody– perfect material for Family Guy. Then just when all hope for Shyamalan to regain the admiration of movie patrons–especially those who enjoy horror/suspense/thrillers–he gives us The Visit in 2015. That film was the glimmer of hope he needed to begin to rebuild his status as a thriller/suspense/horror filmmaker. And with the incredibly satisfying Split, M. Night Shyamalan is BACK!<br/><br/>Films like Psycho and Split only work as well as their respective director and cast–primarily the villain. Obviously, Psycho stands up to the test of time and will forever be a favorite of many cinephiles and a testament to the power of visual storytelling, Split had to be a new experience while still channeling the director that Shyamalan admires and patterns himself after. The success of Split rested upon the performance of McAvoy as Kevin (and the 23 others with a 24th on the horizon). McAvoy's performance in this film is quite possibly the best of his career. Each identity is clearly seen as individuals. From his facial expressions to his gait to the manner in which he carries himself, every identity is unique in voice and appearance. Even in the middle of a conversation, one identity goes away while another surfaces into ""the light."" Although there are only a few identities that have prominence in the diegesis, the others give audiences just enough nuance to register them as having a presence in the subconscious of Kevin.<br/><br/>For all the excellence in cinematic storytelling Split has to offer, there is no denying that it may be controversial in that it uses DID to construct a ""beast."" There are already members of the mental- illness community who have expressed disdain for the subject matter and context of the film. However, prematurely dismissing this film as offensive to those suffering from cognitive disorders would be ill-conceived. After screening the film, it is clear that the focus is not on DID itself (or any other cognitive disorder that Kevin may have), nor is Kevin crafted to be an unredeemable monster; but, this film uses DID and the character of Casey (one of the young ladies who is captured at the beginning of the film) as tools through which to explore childhood trauma, abuse, and coping mechanisms. Isn't that what films do? Push the envelop in an effort to provide a different perspective on an issue, problem, or circumstance? Horror is often concerned with ""other"" scenes–revealing that which should remain hidden–and Shyamalan does precisely that in Split.<br/><br/>If you enjoy horror, suspense, or thriller films, then you are definitely going to enjoy Split. There is so much to take in, that you may want to watch it again in order to catch everything that you may have missed the first time. Even if you are skeptical or think the content may be offensive to the mental-illness community, you may be surprised that there is a lot that can be gleaned from the narrative. With brilliant performances, excellent writing, and outstanding direction, Split should be on your radar of films to watch this weekend."

","I am an Indian and think movie was crap. I mention this as I see some reviewers think Indians are upvoting this to back Shyamalan.Seriously he is not that popular here.
The ratings completely deluded me.
Anyway the movie really never lived up to the premise it builds up. I thought the flashback and the psychiatrist will somehow link to the main story but nothing happens.All the time the director gives a feel as if Casey already knows the man but she doesn't so why is she not helping others to escape. Seriously three people with the kind of stuff lying around could have overcome this guy but Casey never seems to even try.
You wonder if ""Sixth Sense"" was somebody else's idea because nothing after that by Shyamalan has lived up to that. ""The Village"" was also mentioned by Indian writer as a local story Shyamalan had picked up."

","The movie was just awful. I mean, worse than that. It was like if you got a bunch of high school kids with some expensive equipment and editing software, this is what they'd make. There was nothing clever about the movie: it was a dumb fantasy. Yes, there are kidnappings, but it's never this bad or ridiculous.<br/><br/>The ending didn't make sense. He chose not to die. Really? Okay, whatever. I guess I'll go and get shot twice and see whether I survive, because obviously rupturing arteries and veins and losing blood doesn't matter if you don't care. Yeah, no. As a scientific kind of person, it's just dumb. It's fine if you're in the land of 'Doctor Who', but there was no supernatural premise to allow for that kind of fantasy. I would have shot McAvoy with all the bullets I had anyway. His dumb 9 year old character was a pain to withstand.<br/><br/>Just save your time, I guess. You won't get anything from this. There's no moral to be learnt or some creative expression of an idea. The movie tried to be bigger than itself, a bit like 'The Beast'; it didn't need to. But there is no clever twist or surprise ending. It's just BS city all the way to the end.<br/><br/>The movie would have been better if the shrink ended up conducting undercover detective work as a sleuth to unveil the crimes of Kevin's personas. Dealing with the insanity that way would have been more intriguing, but 'The Shining' rip off and moving metal bars... no. Just no.<br/><br/>Overall: good cinematography, but generally mediocre to cringe levels of acting and nonsense all in one package that seeks to waste your time. Watch Groundhog Day instead, really: it's a fun movie that basically has this funny/crazy premise, but it's fine in the universe of the movie. Split had a crazy premise that didn't *materially* add to the excitement or entertainment: that's why it was hard to buy into the craziness and appreciate the intentions of the director/writer (M. Night). Also, if you watch the movie Penelope, you'll find McAvoy to be way more enjoyable to watch."

Sure, the movie had some great moments, but the storyline was just too predictable, and when the main character started to climb on the wall and ceiling I was just about ready to turn off the movie and find something else to watch.<br/><br/>It should be said that this movie is watchable and enjoyable only because of the interesting and diverse performance that James McAvoy puts on as he portrays multiple personalities trapped within the same body.<br/><br/>""Split"" is about as predictable as they come, and you got it figured out not way too far into the movie, and the storyline was suffering from that face, as if being relatively weak in storyline wasn't enough.<br/><br/>All in all, James McAvoy carries this movie and makes it worth watching. However, ""Split"" is not an oustanding movie from director M. Night Shyamalan. The movie does have fans, that much is clear from the high rating.

"brendancox","5","3","13","17 February 2017"," Almost a Good Movie
","""Split"", by M. Night Shyamalan, is not a good movie. If I had to describe how I felt after watching the film I would say that I was overwhelmingly disappointed. There are quite a few things that this movie did right that I can really appreciate. However, the cons greatly outweigh the positives.<br/><br/>As a director, M. Night has always really been a hit or miss. After the release of ""The Sixth Sense"" Newsweek magazine had regarded him as ""the next Spielberg"", but his films became progressively more mediocre after ""Signs"". After the release of ""The Last Airbender""(arguably his worst movie) I was unsure he could ever redeem himself.<br/><br/>When I saw the trailer for ""Split"", I was thoroughly interested in what M. Night had to offer (despite how corny the trailer was). Shyamalan had painted a brief picture of an enveloping psychological thriller that anyone could get invested in. I and the rest of America were immediately hooked, and with a box office 164.4 million dollars you know that your trailer was well marketed. This is the biggest problem that I personally had with the movie. The trailer gave false expectations for the movie you were about to see. Instead of the psychological thriller that I was prepared to watch, I got something that leaned more towards the supernatural. While this isn't inherently a problem it still didn't really seem to fit the tone of the movie.<br/><br/>The real problems with the movie come from the script and the three lead girls. The protagonist, Casey (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), is probably the best of the three. Still her performance doesn't match the situation that she's presented with, and is unbelievable at best. I'm uncertain if this is because of the script she was given, if she was just not well directed, or if she's just a bad actor. Either way it wasn't very good for the movie. The script doesn't help much. It's really easy to see that it had been rewritten a few times at least. You can tell that Shyamalan really wanted to use a couple of scenes, but he couldn't figure out a clever way of writing them in. This is especially evident in the final scene of the movie where an unnecessary connection to ""Unbreakable"" (another one of his films) is made.<br/><br/>The majority of this movie was bad, but it's still really important to recognize what was good about it. This movie had a good atmosphere. Albeit one that didn't match the supernatural twist that accompanied it, but a good atmosphere nonetheless. Another thing that I liked was the cinematography and some of the shots. They were very well thought out. There were a lot of good overhead and creeping shots that really helped develop the mood and a sense of dread. My favorite element of this move was the performance of James McAvoy (Kevin), the antagonist of the film. He did a great job of being able to depict the multiple personalities of Kevin and made the roles seem natural 100% of the time he was on screen. This feat is astounding to say the least, and could not have been pulled off by a less talented actor.<br/><br/>Too sum it up ""Split"" was not a good movie. It wasn't horrible, but it was by no means good. I was entertained (mostly because it is one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies I've ever seen), but very disappointed and disconnected from the film. Overall I would rate this a 5/10."
"EleinevdV","6","3","13","25 January 2017"," It started off so good...
","I really liked the beginning and the middle of the movie. This is a scenario that is somewhat realistic and could happen to someone. I could even handle the therapist and her believes that this was something that is thought of as the Supernatural. But then... it goes completely crazy with the main character turning into some kind of beast man, running up to straight walls and all. That just ruined it for me, it was so stupid and unnecessary. If it had had a different ending, I would have rated it higher because I did really like the idea of this movie. I also was a little annoyed with the acting of the two friends and the speed at which they came up with 'plans' to escape their kidnapper. I liked James McAvoy and the way he presented all his personalities, especially Patricia and Hedwig."

","Split is about three girls who are captured by a person with multiple identity disorder. In fact,this person has 23 identities. The girls must escape their prison before the worst identity comes out.<br/><br/>The only real reason I went to see this movie was the leads McAvoy and Taylor-Joy. On that level I was not disappointed in the slightest. McAvoy brings many unique and interesting characters to the light. I think he should be applauding for tackling this kind of role given his status in Hollywood. It seems like more and more top tier actors are playing it safe by staying in their characters that audiences love.Taylor-Joy also did well in her role but I was expecting a little more out of the character.<br/><br/>The story felt pretty ho-hum as it kept my interest but didn't have me holding my seat the whole way through. I think the reason why this movie is being praised is the twist, which is fine but this twist will not hit everyone the same. If you are not in the know on that subject you will be left saying ""Ok?"" and the end will have a meh-like quality to it. When I go see a movie that is being advertised as a suspenseful thriller; I expect some kind of payoff at the end. This movie fails to deliver on that. <br/><br/>This is a movie that you don't have to automatically go out and see unless you are a fan of McAvoy or just appreciate great character acting. The plot is fairly average with most kidnapper movies so if the reason you watch movies is the storytelling this might be one to skip."

Will a movie about split personalities kidnapping girls be the step he needs to climb back to top notch director, or will his movie be laughable at best? Robbie K here with yet another review, and as always I appreciate your reads. Let's get started!<br/><br/>LIKE:  Creepy kind of horror  Decent plot to keep it interesting  Complex morals  James McAvoy<br/><br/>Summary: Fans of my reviews know creepy horror is better for me than jump scares, and Split is a prime example of spine-tingling chills. Shyamalan and his crew get incredible effects from such simple tactics, using isolation, subtle piano background music, and gradual information revelation to keep you in suspense. By using a believable human as the monster instead of some cheesy creature, the creeps are only further amplified by how horrible such a thing can be. <br/><br/>But scares alone don't make a movie and Split does a decent job of crafting a tale to keep you hooked into the movie. While certainly not original, Split's plot is a culmination of smaller stories that detail the background info of a majority of our characters, helping to develop them in the short run time. All of these tales have a moral twist to it, but one story in particular raises an intriguing concept that may provide some food for thought, or at least an ethical dilemma for future talks. <br/><br/>However, the piece de resistance is the leading actor James McAvoy who carries much of the movie. The man can play multiple personalities well, tweaking his mannerisms and dialogues in subtle ways to craft an entirely different identity. His talents, as well as the direction, kept all his characters in the realistic zone, which while creepy, also made engaging characters to grab on to. There are few actors to which I could see doing the spectacular job he did.<br/><br/>DISLIKE:  Predictable Story  Trailer has shown much  Don't see all the personalities  Mixed on the ending<br/><br/>Summary: Despite the story being very well-developed for a horror story, it also isn't the most unique either. Outside of the twenty-three-personality quirk, you can guess much of the backstory of each character and where the film is going by about the 30-minute mark. Part of the predictability can be attributed to the trailer revealing a lot of key details in the short collection of scenes, including the big revelation at the end. <br/><br/>The trailer also harbors on the twenty-three personalities, but in reality, it's more like four with a few cameos from the others. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing (as too many personalities could be very sloppily done), it also was a wasted gimmick. What do I mean by this confusing statement? I mean, why make twenty-three, instead of say ten, or even five? What was the significance of twenty-three outside of a nickname if you weren't going to integrate all of them? This dislike comes from the trailer's focus on high number only to once again let it fizzle out. And as for the ending, it's a very open-ended finale that leaves a lot of questions up in the air. Perhaps the potential sequel will answer these components, but only time will tell. <br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>Split, to my surprise, was much better than I thought and was a horror movie worthy of the franchise. If you are looking for realistic chills, a satisfying plot, and fantastic acting of someone with a mental health disorder then certainly check this movie out. In fact, in regards to the horror genre I would warrant this movie earns a trip to the theater. However, as a movie overall, it still has its shortcomings, especially in regards to the twenty-three-personality gimmick. Yet one thing is for certain, if Shyamalan can continue this trend he may fall back into the favorable director field once more. <br/><br/>My scores are:<br/><br/>Horror/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0"

","Why do movies have to repeat the same script over and over again? There are so many other things they could write about. James McAvoy's character and his multiple personalities are done really well. The main girl character is also very talented. However as usual it's about 3 young girls being abducted with the threat of rape constantly on the cards and not surprisingly the female protagonist's character is made ""interesting"" because of a child abuse backstory. Same old same old yawn yawn. Having the same rhetoric surrounding us in films, the media and porn over and over again makes us start to believe that women are weak and that it's normal to sexually abuse or hurt women and that it's normal to sexualise adolescent girls. Why not abduct 2 boys and a girl? The narrative could still be the same. Why not have the person with DID being female? But also why so much predator behaviour in films anyway. I only watched this because I am interested in the psychological disorder. I would have been more entertained by watching a non predatory DID person's journey."

"lavatch","Null","2","8","18 May 2017"," Kevin Wendell Crumb, etc.
","The films of M. Night Shyamalan typically exploit the supernatural in order to develop a suspenseful story with well-rounded characters. Unfortunately, ""Split"" relies primarily on pop psychology to explore a troubled man's multiple personalities in what is called Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). The wildly speculative case study in the film includes one personality type that should be placed in a cage and out of harm of any bystanders.<br/><br/>The bystanders who come in the way of Kevin Wendell Crumb, who has a habit of ending his sentences with the expression ""etcetera.,"" are three young women who are improbably kidnapped and held hostage by Kevin, etc. The one character who is more interesting that all of the characters rolled into Kevin, etc. is the young loner Casey Cooke. As developed in lurid detail through flashbacks, little Casey was an abused child who has learned to cope with her pedophile tormentor, Uncle John. Her survival skills will be put to the test by Kevin, etc.<br/><br/>A kindly psychiatrist (well performed by stage actress Betty Buckley) badly underestimates the capabilities of her patient. She deludes herself into believing that she has some control over the wide-ranging behavior of Kevin, etc. Her fatal mistake is to pay a visit to his home. The alert viewer will surely recognize that her fate is sealed when she arrives at his odd living quarters, which turn out to be the sub-basement of the Philadelphia zoo.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS: M. Night Shyamalan's original ending for the film appears as an outtake in the DVD version of ""Split."" Curiously, the director changed the ending because he felt the original version was too dark. The deleted scene was to have Kevin seated atop a building decrying how unfortunate it was that most people go about their lives in an un-split manner, as opposed his subjective realities of multiple personalities. But in a film that is so unpleasant from the outset, it was difficult to see how changing the final scene could possibly have made the film any less depressing than it already was."

","I've been going back and forth on whether I want to give this film a 6 or a 7. On one hand, it's way too long. It's 110 minutes and yet it feels even longer than that. It's also simply not as ""fun"" as I wanted it to be. Instead of not taking it self seriously at all, the film is way too solemn and serious for its own good. At the same time, however, I admire its willingness to be something more than a cheesy horror/thriller, as it is also highlighting the types of mental processes that can occur with this type of medical condition. It's also very well shot, with some nice, fluid camera-work. The acting is also solid, but it's James McAvoy who impresses the most. He is easily the biggest reason to see this. He gives it his all."

The setting was choice, very threatening yet with lots of little homely touches so that you knew there was more than one person thinking they are living an ordinary life there. There are lots of high tension moments as well as some predictable ones.<br/><br/>Strangely I never felt sorry for Kevin being invaded by so many different personalities as they were all very individual.<br/><br/>This movie was so good that I didn't even go out for a cigarette."

Of course you want to see what happens if the girls live or die but it wasn't scary just boring and predictable.<br/><br/>It's good Betty Buckley had a big role as the psychiatrist. She is so talented she deserves a resurrection in her film career. Unfortunately the character she plays is rather dumb. James MacAvoy tries hard with the material - A for effort.

","M.

""Split"" turns out to be a pretty interesting movie, as James McAvoy's character - suffering from dissociative personality disorder - holds three teenage girls hostage and they meet his multiple personalities.<br/><br/>I'm not a psychologist, so I can neither confirm nor refute the movie's depiction of the main character. But I did like what the psychologist (Betty Buckley, who played the gym teacher in the original ""Carrie"") said. I wonder if this will interest more people in the topic. Whether or not it does, I still find this to be Shyamalan's most interesting movie of the past decade. And there just might be a little surprise at the end."
"bxhancock","9","2","9","29 April 2017"," Intense Movie, in all the right ways.
","I should start this off with stating that I'm not an M. Night Shyamalan fan. I've only blandly enjoyed one of his previous efforts. This movie went way beyond anything that I was expecting. <br/><br/>The intensity is thick in almost every scene. There was not a point where I felt that the movie slowed down or went off point. It continually surprised me, even at points where I expected something to surprise me.<br/><br/>James McAvoy aka Dennis / Patricia / Hedwig / The Beast / Kevin Wendell Crumb / Barry / Orwell / Jade is the best bad guy since Buffalo Bill and Dr. Lecter. We've been waiting for a bad guy of this magnitude to grace us with his presence and he arrived in this movie. McAvoy's portrayal of the various personalities is electrifying. His ability to switch from one personality to another in the blink of an eye, with not hint what-so-ever of the previous personality is Daniel Day-Lewis worthy. No one sold out on this movie. From the director to the actors, you could see that everyone was on top of their game and taking their various roles seriously. <br/><br/>Betty Buckley's performance as a supporting actor was pulled off almost perfectly. You believed what she said, you believed that she believed in what she was saying, even when talking to the panel via Skype. Her portrayal of Dr. Fletcher was solid from the start.<br/><br/>Casey, Claire and Marcia made you genuinely feel their fear. When their hopes were dashed, your heart sank. Casey's manipulation of ""Hedwig"" was perfectly pulled off. As for McAvoy, you felt as though you were actually watching a nine year old boy talking. The interaction between those two alone made the movie worth watching.<br/><br/>The cinematography was perfect. The grittiness of the place coupled with the cleanliness of the rooms and the changes in lighting really set the mood for each scene. Rather than the low lighting wanting to put you to sleep, it added to the intensity. <br/><br/>The final scene made you feel sorry for an abused little boy and for the trauma he must have gone through to have reached such extremes. You don't even see the killer at the point until he spends that last few seconds revealing that he was going to be the new dominant personality.<br/><br/>There is much more that is wonderful about this movie but I'll leave that for people to see for themselves."

I watched the trailers and thought, aw man I thought he was supposed to be better now with the visit being a good movie. The trailers didn't do it justice. All I knew of Shyamalan was that he likes his twists, keep in mind the only movies of his that I've seen to this point in my story are the visit and avatar. When I watched this movie, I loved it, I loved the cinematography, the soundtrack, the acting everything. But there was a problem, when the big twist came on I was like huh?

It has so much suspense, there are shots of characters just staring at each other for seconds on end, the closeups of McAvoys face changing to change with his alters are so unsettling. I personally didn't have a problem with the whole abuse storyline, I felt it fit in and was a way for the main character and antagonist to connect.

Tension slowly builds and builds throughout the movie and reaches a crescendo in an absolutely gob smacking final third.<br/><br/>James McAvoy, in what could easily be the performance of his lifetime, lifts what could have been a role heavily dependent on gimmicks into something magnetic and terrifying. The spectre of the Beast looms over the movie the whole time, and for once, the Beast doesn't disappoint. I like how Shyamalan's twist on the typical Final Girl survival. One of the greatest assets he has is the organic ability to subvert mainstream movie tropes without it seeming like something played for shock value.<br/><br/>PS: I didn't make the connection to Unbreakable as well.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","9","1","3","8 March 2019"," A fantastic film that shows Shyamalan still has what it takes to make great movies
","For many years, M. Night Shyamalan's directing career has been in continual decline. Many people, myself included, felt his groundbreaking work with The Sixth Sense (1999) was the peak of what he had to offer. Sure, Unbreakable (2000) and Signs (2002) were good movies that had their moments, but from that point onward, the films he made just got worse and worse. Although I have not seen it, 2015's The Visit seemed to be a return to form for Shyamalan, indicating that his directing was no longer washed up. In Split (2017), we see that Shyamalan has been able to recapture the magic that made his previous films so memorable.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed in Split was the cinematography. The camera lets the audience see just enough to let them know that something is amiss, often preparing the viewer for an occasional jump scare. Secondly, James McAvoy's performance was impeccable. Taking on the role of a man with multiple personalities, he was able to give each one a unique feel through his expressions and language alone. Finally, the concept that people with multiple personalities are somehow super-powered instead of disabled was an interesting take on the almost clichÃ© mental disorder.<br/><br/>I do have to admit that the ""twist"" ending (of which we have come to expect from Shyamalan) was a little spoiled for me from some articles I had read beforehand. Of course, this twist was also why I decided to watch a film from a director I used to think was past his prime. Were it not for the childhood trauma that seems to be a cover-all in today's society, the character development with the main female protagonist was well done. Either way, while the revelation involving her character wasn't necessarily surprising, it was a great turn of events in the final moments of this engaging film.<br/><br/>A fantastic film that shows Shyamalan still has what it takes to make great movies, I give Split 4.5 stars out of 5."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Split is directed by M. Night Shyamalan and stars James McAvoy and Anya Taylor Joy. The movie follows a group of young girls that are kidnapped by a man with multiple personalities. The man intends to sacrifice them to a rumored new personality named 'The Beast'.<br/><br/>Split is a welcome back to form for M. Night Shyamalan. The movie is much better written and directed than his recent movies. The dialogue is not as unintentionally hilarious as Shyamalan's previous movie, The Happening. Each of the characters feels important to the story and the direction of the movie feels unique like The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Split felt more accessible and unique more so than other Shyamalan flops. Although the movie is funny at times, these felt intentional and added to the character's backstory. I was riveted to watch more of the personalities.<br/><br/>James McAvoy is the stand-out actor here. He does a fantastic job as Kevin and all of his personalities. Each of them are distinct and even James McAvoy's body language is spot-on. I felt that all of the personalities acted appropriately. Each personality is portrayed well and both the acting and writing should be praised. The final reveal of 'The Beat' and that the movie is an indirect sequel to Unbreakable was well done. It was appropriate seeing the cameo of Bruce Willis as David Dunn. Anya Taylor-Joy does a good job as a damaged teenager. Her performance is not as overt as James McAvoy's and she does a good job with the role. She is out-shined by James McAvoy.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend Split. It is a tense movie with Shyamalan finally doing a good job.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

His near perfect portrayal of many personalities of one individual is inspiring.<br/><br/>But the real brilliance of this film is at a deeper level. At its heart the movie is a fine study of Dissociative Identity Disorder. First, the conception is wonderful and one wonders how many personalities would the audience get to see. The number of personalities that we get to see are plenty and yet it does not go overboard in introducing too many personalities. I think this movie would be a source of inspiration for many filmmakers desiring to make films on this subject. In case you are interested in films exploring DID I suggest Peacock starring Cilian Murphy. That film is a very different take on the subject. Witnessing many different personalities of the protagonist, in Split, is emotionally moving every time a new identity is revealed.<br/><br/>The writing is top notch. The acting is engrossing. The art direction is superb. Costumes, lighting, sounds and yes the music, everything comes together to make a powerful cinematic experience. This is not one of your superficial thriller where it is merely a matter of survival of the innocent facing the wicked. The evil here is nuanced and immersing. Isn't that a treat?<br/><br/>One objection that can be made against the film is that the plot could have been tighter. But in that case, the story would have lost its meat. That is always the case with thrillers. If you do not watch movies to numb your brain and if you are looking for something that will stay with you after the movie has ended, this is a good one for you."
"gbill-74877","6","1","3","9 February 2018"," Run of the mill suspense film
","James McAvoy turns in a strong performance here, adding some nice touches to the various personalities of his character(s), and is probably the best thing this film has going for it. Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, and Jessica Sula, the three teenage girls he abducts at the beginning of the film, are all reasonably good as well, and pretty besides. Maybe too pretty, as their casting and the plot feel a bit packaged. I liked the back-story of abuse and implication of going from one beast to another, and the line ""the broken are the more evolved"", which will resonate with anyone who has suffered while growing up. M. Night Shyamalan is at least coherent in this movie, but in the end, he doesn't really add all that much to the genre. It all seems done before, and the one 'new' element, the 24th personality, wasn't all that interesting. I wasn't too jazzed about the concept of setting up the next film either. This is a run of the mill suspense film, which is a shame given McAvoy's performance."

","Split (2016) is M Night Shamylan's newest film. I was a big fan of his last work, The Visit. That movie really was Shamylan's way of proving to people that he still has what it takes. This movie continues to prove that he still has it, that he's capable of making a great psychological thriller. This movie surrounds James Macavoy's character Henry, well Henry and his 23 identities. Henry suffers from dissociative identity disorder (DID). He is a mental patient who goes to see Dr. Karen Fletcher, played by Betty Buckley. She is increasingly concerned because of urgent emails she keeps receiving from Henry, different identities take Henry over and email her about the urgent situation that's going on. A very dangerous one of Henry's 23 different identities had taken over him and abducted three innocent teenage girls. I absolutely loved the acting performances in this movie. Macavoy is perfect as Henry, and he plays the different identities wonderfully. I also really liked Buckley as Dr. Fletcher, her character is so well meaning and tries to her best to reach/help Henry. As she attempts to get to the bottom of what's happening, these three abducted girls try to find a way to escape. Things grow more and more creepy and freaky as the film progresses. I suggest this creepy intelligent film to any and all who enjoy this kind of thing. 8/10"
"suzanne-sellers","10","1","3","11 November 2017"," Difficult challenge for an actor and McAvoy more than delivers
","There are several things that make, for me, a terrific film: an excellent script and excellent acting. This film has both. The challenge faced by James McAvoy is to present 5 or 6 main personalities in the course of one scene and this is amazing to watch. There is one scene where one of these personalities is talking with the psychiatrist and this scene is so well written it actually gives me goosebumps. The shrink suspects that the person she is talking to is not the person he says he is. Their conversation goes on for a while until she convinces him to identify himself. This is an amazing scene for McAvoy and Betty Buckley, the shrink.<br/><br/>Well, let me say the entire movie is full of these types of scenes. Excellent script, excellent delivery by all the actors. Amazing film all around. I can't wait for the sequel.<br/><br/>Finally, I truly believe this film is actually BETTER than Silence of the Lambs. It is as frightening and suspenseful as SOTL, but not as gruesome , which I felt was far too emphasized in SOTL. The character in Split allowed us to feel some compassion after all, because of what he had been through as a child, but we will see what he will become in the sequel. And it won't be pretty."

","I watched this movie with high expectations, having seen the reviews of this film. The idea of split personalities has also always enticed me. However, I cannot describe how disappointed I was in this film after watching it. I even thought of forsaking it halfway due to the unbearable acting. <br/><br/>I actually felt that the plot was pretty good if we were to disregard the amount of fantasy added to the plot regarding split personalities, but it's a movie so I don't have much issue with that. The acting of one of the main characters James McAvoy was brilliant as he brings out the distinct personalities of the different identities. His great acting, coupled with the decent script, makes up the factors of a promising film.<br/><br/>However, the acting of the 3 girls who were kidnapped is outrageously bad. I cannot describe how much I am annoyed by the character. Both the character's script and how the actresses acted annoyed me to no end. If there's one word to describe the 3 characters, it would be bad. The potential of the film was ruined by these characters. It could have been so much better.<br/><br/>But of course, with every opinion, not everyone would agree with what I have to say. This is just my 2 cents on the film. If I were to overlook the character flaws of the film, this movie would probably be around 7-8. I would probably still recommend it but it is definitely not a great movie that I can enjoy fully."
"view_and_review","6","1","3","4 November 2017"," Not Shayamalan's best, but far from his worst
","I had written off M. Night Shayamalan. He had a string of bad movies and it seemed that was the new norm for him: The Happening, The Last Air Bender, Lady in the Water and perhaps there are others I'm forgetting. So, when Split was released and they said it was a Shayamalan production I thought: ""I'll pass.""<br/><br/>Then I started hearing the rave reviews. I heard more than one which planted a small seed in my head like maybe I should watch this. So I did.<br/><br/>Split wasn't as bad as the aforementioned movies but it wasn't all that great either. As the title indicates the movie is about an individual with dissociative identity disorder (i.e. multiple personalities). One (or maybe more) personality is responsible for kidnapping three teenage girls and it is unknown what his plans are for them. Because it is a Shayamalan movie your mind is trying to dream up all kinds of possibilities.<br/><br/>The film moves somewhat slow as the plot is gradually unfolded. McAvoy is adequate as the main character although there was a lot to be desired from the rest. The movie is OK as it explores the mind, its fragility and its strength. It's not Shayamalan's best but it is far from his worst."

","I finally got to see the movie, Split. Multiple personality stories have always been very unsettling for me, but this one so far (and I'm 65) is the scariest ever. And I am completely convinced the reason —not counting the director's beautiful work—is James McAvoy. My God! His skill! Each personality he expressed was utterly believable and finite. It was clear what a true artist McAvoy truly is. What I don't understand, and as a result, have a considerably lessoned opinion of the Academy, is why James McAvoy was not nominated the Oscar for best actor. There is no indication of it on IMDb.com that I can see."

He has a pretty complicated character, or sets of characters, and he delivers them all with easy. ""Identity"" had a far superior plot but the actors had a much easier task, comparatively speaking. For his interpretation alone this movie is worth watching. But unfortunately, for not much more else.<br/><br/>So, if you come to see this movie with low expectations you will be satisfied.

The remarkable point is that his next personality are about to wake up, which makes me astonished because it is beyond our expectation. Other than that, James McAvoy's performance is outstanding, and each personality is completely different and insane. I was glued to the screen through it. Actually, Kevin was abused by his mother as a kid, which causes to have split personalities. I suppose his 23 personalities protects himself and puts a value on his existence by himself.

It's hard to be decisive about how good are M.night shaymalan 's movies are , since two of this era's most acclaimed movies ( ""the sixth sense"" and ""unbreakable"". ) were his making , yet his career was undoubtedly in a huge recession or even in a distressing decline since ""the happening"" . Yet , Mr.shaymalan never ceases to amaze,not only did he make ""split"" which is the triumph of 2017's thrillers list , he also showcased one of this decade's most brilliant actors; James Mcavoy, this movie's ultimate star.Even though his ecstatic acting talent had been cornered and frankly wasted on either bad dramas or corny PG-13 superhero movies he made his breakthrough in this tremendous portrayal of the multi personality young man named,truly and among others , Kevin Wendell in his deranged journey in depths of his own dissociative mind , and in his life long struggle between complete insanity and a promised normal life, under the guidance of his most faithful companion and ""DID"" activist Dr. Karen Fletcher portrayed by the astonishing Betty Buckely . James Mcavoy has exhibited under Mr.shaymalan's visionary supervision a great deal of talent as he shifts both physically and mentally between twenty two completely distinguished personalities, in which the youngster Hedwig resides the hardest to portray, leading Mr. Mcavoy to lead one of this industry's best performances of all time. In this Odessy like journey Kevin drags Casey Cooke who's portrayed by Anya- Taylor joy in a labyrinth of despair and terror, this put the promising actress in a position in which she had excelled being one of the key elements of the well crafted psychological horror story. Split is by all means the gem of M.shaymalan 's movie universe and quite the kick starter for all the incredible young cast .It's a new take on this new fusion that mixes both the horror elements from a neo noir movie and the entertaining thriller action in one brilliant story that proves one more time that the director M.shaymalan made his comeback, knowing a new tie-in movie is already in pre production. This only leaves to wait for the visionary's big psychologically themed pictures in which he exceeds."

It is a silly movie written, directed and produced by a person who means well but lacks an ability to tell a story. There is no purpose to the story. It is meaningless.<br/><br/>*Yes I know it is part of a trilogy, but this movie is more about the creator of the story. It has nothing to do with you or me.

The most interesting part is how the actor plays, I think the casting was great and the actor is perfect for the role, you can actually witness the personalities speak to each other and how the body, language, voice etc changes. The end is extraordinary, never expected it. I usually guess the ending of these movies but not this one. This is why i think it's great, you can't see what happens next even though the movie gives you hints.

"asifahsankhan","8","2","10","10 April 2017"," Split garnered controversy for its alleged stigmatisation of mental illness but it was worth it!
","Let's start with James McAvoy who definitely gives, in my opinion, the best performance of his career. As Kevin Wendell Crumb, a sufferer of dissociated identity disorder (DID), who has 23 prominently different personalities, each with something peculiar or dangerous for his captives. Kevin's body chemistry changes with each personality, resulting in his 24th and final personality, ""The Beast"", being capable of superhuman levels of strength, speed, mobility (allowing him to scale walls and ceilings), and a voracious hunger for human flesh. Yeah, sounds a bit too risky for all that to be the main plot- line for a film doesn't it?<br/><br/>Well the film itself was as risky as ever as it garnered controversy for its alleged stigmatisation of a real-life mental illness which happens to be the most controversial psychiatric disorder, with no clear consensus on diagnostic criteria or treatment.<br/><br/>McAvoy, from a general point of view, is absolutely incredible in this film, and he drove it all the way home. He had to inhabit so many different personalities for this role, and every single time he shifts, you can tell by his posture, the way he moves, and the way he talks. He's so automatic and smooth in his shifts, but he never stays in transition. It's instantaneous, and he gives everything he has to every second of screen time he gets. By the end of the film, it's almost like we've grown accustom to this man as compared to James McAvoy,and I forgot he was even in the movie. I also have to give Anya Taylor-Joy a ton of credit. The cute lady perfectly pulls off the stress, horror, and shock that her character needs to go through. I really didn't like Morgan, but she wasn't the problem with that film, but I've had a huge talent-crush on her afterwards. Seriously, she's incredible in The Witch!. I think she has so much ahead of her, especially in the horror and thriller genres. Next, this movie looks absolutely beautiful. The colours are dark and dreary, but they're used so well, and the lighting is perfect to set mood and to make an incredible looking movie. Shyamalan also uses the camera well for the most part. The movie has so many amazing looking still frames that allow you to think about everything going on. It doesn't need a fast-paced cut or dynamic sound design to pull out the thrills. We just see a lot of shots that linger on a character or a setting, and it gives the perfect amount of information and time necessary to process ideas yet still leave questions spinning in your mind. The first half is where this movie really excels in that area, and Shyamalan crafts the thrills so quietly and delicately that you don't even realise the small frog that's building in your throat. Split shows that Shyamalan can still do it when he stays small and returns to his roots. That talent is still inside him, and it came out for this movie.<br/><br/>The first half and a few more is really, very good, and can blow you away. But to be frank, the reason why the first half of this movie is so breathtaking is because it's where the director, 'Shyamalan' excels. <br/><br/>Well, now to be really really honest, if the first half is where he goes back to his classic thrills, the second half is where he comes unglued and lets everything fly. He did such an incredible job staying contained and quiet in the first half, but all of a sudden the movie introduces a few twists and turns that didn't work for me. Twists and turns are to be expected in a movie like this, but if Shyamalan continued on his path of containment, he probably would have been better off. I'll definitely outline which twists and turns didn't work for me in the spoiler- filled review, but for right now I'll just say that it was a combination of interjecting scenes and story arcs. Next, this movie has definite pacing issues. <br/><br/>Overall, I like Split more and more as I think about it, (don't worry you'll do it too!) and I can't wait to see what Shyamalan is going to do in the future. I think Split is going to hold up in the same way that Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense, and most of Signs does. It's not even a movie that proves Shyamalan's not a dud. It's a pretty darn good movie, and it has to get you excited for an Unbreakable series. Who knows? Maybe Elijah Price comes back and teams up with The Beast to be the brains and brawn against David Dunn. We've been waiting for an Unbreakable sequel, and Split gives us some hope for that. It's also a great origin story of a villain, and another great Shyamalan thriller.<br/><br/>Seriously, GO Watch it TWICE!"

","I cannot believe people giving this movie one or two stars out of ten. The box office and ratings speak for themselves. This was superbly acted by James Mcavoy, I was amazed at how he could almost seemingly be different people during the movie. We only saw a few main characters of his disorder. People complained about mental health, well every horror and thriller has someone involved with mental health issues. People complained about the girls not escaping easily, as far as I was concerned the clichés of the kidnap genre were not blaring obvious at all. I was very sceptical when I saw the running length almost 2 hours, and yet I found the pacing and plot to be involved enough. The finale was terrifying and mind blowing and realistic, and I was on the edge of my seat rooting for everyone involved. People have panned the director, but I think this movie was up there with 6th Sense. The kidnap scenario has been done to death in horror movies, but this movie managed to be so much more. In short, I was almost disappointed the movie ended, and would have liked to see another half hour of the beast in charge along with Dennis and Patricia. There was no sex, no gore, no real violence, and I agree this wasn't really a horror movie. It was a trip into a severely disturbed mind and a happy ending (sort of) for some of the characters."

","A troubled girl is kidnapped by a strange man and must reveal her past in the struggle to escape.<br/><br/>Standard captive-captor plot enlivened by a fascinating conceit over multiple personalities, and well performed by the lead actors. Almost two hours long, but it flies by at great pace despite the mostly claustrophobic sequences. The story is well put together, but it's not a horror and nowhere near as creepy as the director's last outing in The Visit. Nor does it give its violent moments real life, which is typical of this director. Only three characters, with the minor parts badly underwritten, and mostly it's a two-hander with an interesting antagonism. A few plot holes, and a couple of implausible plot points involving locks. In the end the director adds a decent twist, but then he reveals his ambition and I was left shrugging my shoulders.<br/><br/>I looked forward to the lead actor's performance after his showing in Scum, and he does really well, but the lightweight mood drains his power, and the whole thing falls way short of, say, the basement scenes in Silence Of The Lambs. The lead actress is very good in close up.<br/><br/>Music is atmospheric but laid on too thick, especially over some dialogue scenes that should have been more powerful with simple delivery. Photography is good, and the editing and writing keep up an excellent pace.<br/><br/>Overall: fascinating premise, but the director wimps out on the horror."

Something with the editing and scenes didn't work that well for me, as is the psychiatrist decisions. Maybe it lacked a musical sense of dread like in The silence of the lamb?

","There was a time where M. Night Shyamalan was hailed as the next Spielberg or Hitchcock. Audiences flocked to his movies eagerly awaiting a thought-provoking thriller.<br/><br/>As the years went on however, his name became tainted. What started as ""Oh wow! Shyamalan? I can't wait!"" after The Sixth Sense, eventually became, ""ugh him again?"" with The Last Airbender.<br/><br/>While 2015's The Visit showed a promising comeback for the director, Split is finally the return to form we all wanted from the director and ranks among Shyamalan's best work.<br/><br/>This is an engrossing, edge of your seat thrill ride that's incredibly tense and captivating. Its unsettling and creepy tone create such an uneasy atmosphere, it's what made previous Shyamlan movies like The Sixth Sense or Signs work so well.<br/><br/>James McAvoy stars as Kevin, a man who suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). One afternoon, he kidnaps three girls and takes them to an underground bunker of some sort for reasons that are not fully understood until the midway point of the movie.<br/><br/>Through the eyes of these girls, we the audience see a few of the other identities within Kevin. We see the physically intimidating OCD Dennis, a slightly gentle woman Patricia and a 9-year-old trouble maker Hedwig who we learn quite a bit of information from.<br/><br/>James McAvoy is outstanding in the movie. The movie rests on his performance and he delivers a perfect performance. One of the most impressive things is how he makes each of the 23 identities unique. One moment, one identity is speaking, and with such ease he'll switch to another. It's a brave and bold performance. It's haunting, chilling, and he knows just when to be slightly humorous. It's an incredible performance and one of the best performances in any Shyamalan Film.<br/><br/>Also good is Betty Buckley as the psychiatrist trying to help Kevin with DID. She is the leading doctor and has made a career out of trying to understand DID. She believes that these individuals are special with unique gifts that need to be understood. Through her we learn the information we need so we can come to understand just slightly what Kevin is experiencing. Throughout the movie the personality known as Barry makes frequent visits to her office and each visit has a feeling of dread. Each one seems to be building to something. These meetings are all handled very well.<br/><br/>Anya Taylor-Joy is also very good as one of the kidnapped girls. She's the outcast who was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. Her character is troubled, she seems detached from the situation at hand. As the movie progresses we see increasingly disturbing flashbacks to her childhood where we slowly understand who she is and where she is coming from.<br/><br/>This is a very well shot movie. It's from the same cinematographer as It Follows, which was another remarkably beautiful looking movie. This is one of Shyamalan's best looking movies. The use of light and shadows is utilized to the full extent. The camera gives perspective for each character and throughout the movie there is ample opportunities to see the situation from each character.<br/><br/>The real star of course is Shyamalan. Shyamalan is one of the best directors working today and Split is proof. This is a very well directed movie. Shyamalan uses closeups a lot in this movie and while a lot of movies rely too much on closeups and they sometimes get distracting, they work here because you see the hidden emotions the characters have. It's the perspective spoken of earlier. The camera movements are all slow moving which builds up a feeling of dread and uneasiness.<br/><br/>Split is indeed a return to form for Shyamalan. It's well written and well paced. It has incredible performances portraying great, well-rounded characters. Oh and the ending? Well let's just say it's one of the best Shyamalan endingsever.<br/><br/>Definitely check this movie out."

","An unrelenting cerebral thriller, Split strikes deep with its exploration of human nature and its possibilities. M. Night Shyamalan's return to form is strong in character and visuals yet it is this controversial director's own quirks and flaws that stop it from being great.<br/><br/>Shyamalan is known for his big yet often flawed ideas but Split manages to ground the often absurd dialogue and lingering camera through the strength of the performances across the board. While the whole cast does a good job, our two primary characters, troubled captive Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) and the mentally unstable Kevin (James McAvoy), are a wonder that completely captivate you throughout. Their skill in invoking a true sense of sympathy and fear despite the beautiful but often blatant use of camera is a merit to their performances. Newcomer Taylor-Joy is a true talent for holding her own against the powerhouse McAvoy whose Kevin is destined to become a classic character. Suffering from dissociative identity disorder, each of Kevin's personalities shown on screen comes across as a distinctive being, often fooling even the audience into forgetting the innocent, playful Hedwig and the OCD afflicted paedophile Dennis are technically the same person. As the film progresses and we build to the reveal of 'The Beast,' Kevin's hidden 24th personality, Shyamalan masterfully keeps us on our toes regarding his true nature. Thankfully he shows restraint in maintaining the more grounded tone rather than surprising us with a cheap twist, adding an element of rewatchability lacking in even his best works.<br/><br/>Despite these merits, the film often falls into the Shyamalan trap of unnatural, forced dialogue that in a second can undo any tension or investment in the plot. While nowhere near the painfulness of The Happening or After Earth, Split still fails to put faith in its visuals and feels the need to explain everything to the audience. Often it also falls into awkward, sudden humour that feels unwarranted and not in line with the otherwise extremely tense atmosphere it creates. As a result of these factors, it is easy to see why one may call the film arrogant or self-congratulatory and I would definitely agree with them in part yet, overall, I still find myself having enjoyed the film due simply to the power of the premise and performances.<br/><br/>Thrilling but flawed, Split seems to suffer from the same tonal shifts as its antagonist, the moments of terror undercut by Shyamalan's awkward humour and blatant dialogue. Regardless, the tense atmosphere and a truly mesmerising performance from James McAvoy raise it above mediocrity.<br/><br/>SWEET<br/><br/>Visit https://sweetorsaltedmoviereviews.com/ for more."
"sarahcast","8","2","10","3 March 2017"," An interesting theory explored well in macabre detail
","I read a review on this site slating this film for its abhorrent view of schizoid personality disorders and whilst I empathise with the critic (being a sufferer of mental health problems myself, I understand the stigma), he forgets that this is a horror film and therefore artistic license can be applied, an expansion of the truth. I could argue that Rain Man pokes fun at autism but it doesn't; it highlights, if anything how the mentally ill can be exploited and its a darn good film, to boot.<br/><br/>But back to this film. If you've seen Fight Club then the concept of dual personalities that have little understanding of one another is familiar. It is explored in depth in this film with at least four of MacAvoy's twenty-three personalities being showcased, a few more during an interim period of discovery in the movie. He plays each role extremely well and I enjoyed the film thoroughly. <br/><br/>I was let down by Shyamalan's films in the past with the exceptions of the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable but this one seems to have redeemed him as a master of suspense. The cast is great with MacAvoy as the lead role and the support cast are pretty good, too especially the lead female role (I forget her name) upon whom most of the film centres.<br/><br/>The only issue I had was, as I already suffer personality disorders it gave me a bit too much food for thought. I spent a fair while researching the fact behind the fiction and it made for interesting reading.<br/><br/>As a horror/suspense this works exceptionally well despite most of the action taking place in one location. That is irrelevant (or is it?) as the focus is on the characters and they develop well.<br/><br/>The twist, for me was expected but it ended nicely and as I am the macabre sort, I was well pleased.<br/><br/>Don't be offended by the portrayal of a man with split personalities; his psychosis is so deep that it edges into the realms of fantasy yet with every myth there is a grain of truth, they do say.<br/><br/>Enjoy the movie for what it is; a tense urban thriller slash horror that will make you both laugh and gasp."

","Why wasn't much said about this film? I'd hardly heard of it before my friend was reading out the next weeks Vue movie choices. We decided we may as well go and see it, and I'm so glad we did as its excellent! Its a really good slow burning thriller that leaves you hanging and I can't wait till they make the Sequel ! James McAvoy is Brilliant and I think its possibly his best work. There's a similarity to ""Silence of the Lambs"", nail biting and thrilling!"
"SquigglyCrunch","6","2","10","23 February 2017"," A Largely Well-Made Movie
","Split follows three young women who are kidnapped by a man with multiple personalities who, supposedly, has sinister intentions for said girls. <br/><br/>When I first heard about this movie I wasn't excited. It's M. Night Shyamalan, what could possibly go right? After 'The Visit' from 2015, which received mixed reception (but I hated it), I was fairly done with M. Night. Still, Split was well met, so I gave it a go. <br/><br/>Going in I wasn't totally sure what I would think of James McAvoy in this role. It would be easy to mess up, but it very well could be good. I'm happy to say that I walked out thoroughly impressed by his performance. He managed to embody each personality perfectly, portraying each one as a totally different person. Come Oscar season, I hope this guy at least gets a nomination. As for the others, they were fine. Anya Taylor-Joy is the standout of the three main females, though this is far from her best. The other two girls are good, but nothing worth mentioning. <br/><br/>The tone of the movie is rather dark, and it doesn't hold many punches. It explores dark themes in ways that I haven't seen in movies much as of late. It was great to see a movie put itself out there and be a little more than edgy. <br/><br/>The writing is almost all great. The dialogue is most always well- written, the plot moves at a good pace, and the characters are interesting and fleshed out. At least, the important ones are. Where the writing falters is with Betty Buckley's character. She is, while important, poorly written. Her dialogue is forced and doesn't really make sense. She talks to the audience more than she does McAvoy's character. More than once, she says things that, while you can tell the writers were trying to work it in well, it was clear that they didn't succeed. She'll just throw bits of information into conversations where both parties know said information so that we'd know. It doesn't work very well, and as such the movie suffers from being a little exposition-heavy. <br/><br/>The movie takes a little while to really get going. It fakes out the audience at the beginning by making them think that there will be a set-up for the characters, then it just gets right into the plot. While I don't have a problem with movies skipping the intro and getting right into it, the way Split handles it doesn't totally work. The tone just shifts from one side of the spectrum to the other in about 5 minutes. <br/><br/>There is one thing at the very end of this movie that is kind of fantastic. It actually makes some aspects of this movie that, at first appeared goofy and dumb, actually make sense. So when you get confused, just wait. It pulls off a different kind of twist ending that I absolutely loved. <br/><br/>Overall, Split has a rocky start that once you settle into really is a lot of fun in the long run. McAvoy is outstanding, and the writing is more often than not great. I had a great time with this movie, and I really can't wait to see it again. In the end, I would definitely recommend Split."

","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5) <br/><br/>GRADE: B- <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED <br/><br/>IN BRIEF: James McAvoy's performance(s) is (are) the real reason to see this flawed thriller.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: Three teenagers are kidnapped and held captive by a deranged loner.<br/><br/>Dissociate Identity Disorder, a form of mental illness in which one has multiple personalities, is the inspiration for M. Night Shyamalan's latest psychological thriller, Split. While the premise for his film is always intriguing, the execution is as mix-up as his central character(s). One begins to wonder if the talented director/writer will ever find his true visionary self as well, but he is on his way to self discovery with this outing.<br/><br/>Three teenagers (Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, and Jessica Sula) are abducted by a man who suffers from multiple split personalities, 23 and counting. James McAvoy plays Kevin aka Dennis / Patricia / Barry / Hedwig and other various individuals that possess this man at a moment's notice. While this may be taking diversity to extremes, the film lays the groundwork for a taut thriller, especially with the director's use of atmospheric visuals. He creates tension very well. If only his screenplay would have avoided stock characters and predictable outcomes.<br/><br/>After setting up an effectively creepy and overused story-line, Mr. Shyamalan relies too heavily on his characters' dumb reactions to situations that could have been easily (and logically) avoided during parts of the cat-and-mouse games. His screenplay has gaping leaps of logic and one too many plot contrivances that make little sense except to advance the action and make the film more suspenseful. Especially odd is the obsessive behavior of Kevin's psychiatrist, Dr. Fletcher (Betty Buckley), but you know where that is heading from their first session. There is a flashback story that fills in some exposition to one of the characters, but more development on that aspect was needed. Of course, there is also his trademark twist ending, and it worked well enough, just not very surprising or exciting.<br/><br/>But it is Mr. McAvoy who impresses with his acting choices and he is terrific. With a wide range of quirks and subtlety, he play Kevin with the widest of strokes. Displaying extreme mood swings from childlike behavior or sudden violent tendencies, the actor brings the proper degree of menace and vulnerability in his many transitions. Ms. Taylor-Joy gives strong support as his sharp-witted adversary and Ms. Buckley adds greater depth to a standard rote role.<br/><br/>Split is an entertaining psychological thriller that uses mental illness as a plot device for cheap thrills. And though Mr. Shyamalan remains in full control, except for a script that could have used a rewrite or two, it is his lead actor who rescues his film from its run-of-the-mill mediocre origins."
"pauliecorleone-72628","6","2","10","30 January 2017"," Enough now
","Here I am, about to disagree with the popular view again. Watching this did not make me think Shyamalan is ""back"", or has vastly improved or something along those lines. If anything, it all strikes me as a tad 'samey'.<br/><br/>Even on the back of good cinematography, the movie itself suffers from atmospheric deprivation, ill-timed and unfocused characterization framing, a complete absence of story foundation and cringeworthy, cheap, try-hard attempts at distracting the viewer into the supposed twists instead of purposefully diverting us into them.<br/><br/>On top of all that, the by now Shyamalan-trademarked lacklustre structure and pace, the terrible (TERRIBLE!) writing and the doltish efforts to force a ""surprise"" ending upon us, it all contributes to the creation of a weak, ineffective movie, generously saved by one thing alone.<br/><br/>James McAvoy is superb.<br/><br/>Now, imagine the same exact movie and replace McAvoy with anyone else (who isn't also Tom Hardy because if you've seen Bronson, you know that boy would own this role, too). It just would not work. As it stands, miraculously and above its many, many shortcomings, Split does work — on the shoulders of its protagonist. That is not to say that Anya Taylor-Joy is not worthy, she also has to be mentioned with praise, however, I found her budding talent severely underused here and her performance caged within the screen writing confines of a shadowed, mismanaged backstory and character stagnancy.<br/><br/>Going back to McAvoy, thank the cinematic Gods for that man. A premium performance, engaging to the point of actually making the surrounding happenings an irritating distraction — I would happily spend the duration of the movie watching him doing his ""thing"" without anything else interrupting me, no background plot, no other actors, just all 24 of him in front of a camera.<br/><br/>Lucky, James McAvoy's Kevin is making this a must-watch for anyone interested in harvesting the prime, ripe offerings of a true thespian — but that's all you can expect from yet another poor effort coming to you directly from Mr Shyamalan's clouded mind and overinflated ego.<br/><br/>tl;dr: Woman or man, watch this and James McAvoy will get you pregnant.<br/><br/>Salud!"

","This movie turns dark .. then darker .. then darkest .. very fast. When first watching I had the impression it wouldn't go supernatural, but it does, which is definitely a good thing. <br/><br/>I'm not a fan of Shyalaman, but this is definitely part of his better accomplishments like The Village or Unbreakable. In my opinion, The Sixth Sense is not as good as everyone said (or thought) it was.<br/><br/>I don't like the fact that Shyalaman has been compared to Hitchcock all this time. I get the influences and parallels, but these two are very separate to me. Shyalaman will never reach Hitchcock-status. <br/><br/>McAvoy is very good in this, which is no surprise. Taylor-Joy is a good choice.<br/><br/>Also look out for an interesting cameo (and revelation) at the end.<br/><br/>All in all, a pleasant and unexpected surprise. 6.9/10."
"khylil","7","2","11","1 April 2017"," entertaining old school suspense
","I don't know why the movie is getting so much hate. I have usually found something in all of M Night's movies that I have liked whether from the acting, directing, writing or musical score. Unbreakable, Signs, The Village and Lady in the Water are actually favourites of his. I even found the concept of The Happening interesting even if it wasn't conveyed well. <br/><br/>I was ready to give up after Devil, The Last Airbender and After Earth but with the release of The Visit I was ready to jump back in and I am glad I did. Both The Visit and Split are getting back to the roots of story telling. Forgoing big budget and special effects for a simpler more suspenseful atmosphere.<br/><br/>Obviously as has been stated McAvoy is fantastic. Totally disarming and chilling at the same time. I also found Anya Taylor Joy did an amazing. <br/><br/>Other reviewer have wondered at Anya flashbacks as having nothing to do with the movie. I disagree. Her flashbacks show she is a survivor, a fighter. Its the reason she doesn't crumble. She has already faced a monster and she is still alive. People are also wondering why she just didn't show her scars when McAvoy was talking about them being 'pure' and he would have let her go. Once again her back story is important. She has spent the last 10+ years of her life hiding her scars and hiding what is being done to her. Sharing them just doesn't occur to her.<br/><br/>Many people are also stating this is putting people with DID in a bad light or putting mental illness back in the dark ages. To that I say this is a movie, not a documentary. I would actually be more upset with the movies based on Ed Gein or Jeffrey Dahmer except I realise there is still a difference with people who have a mental illness and people who are serial killers. The two are not mutually exclusive and believing they are is a disservice to people with a mental illness. <br/><br/>Lastly the ending. I loved it. It actually wasn't a surprise because if you listen to the doctor her whole thesis is that a person presenting with 'Split' personalities can evolve into more. The word 'supernatural' is used throughout the movie. If you know and like M Night you could see where it was going. <br/><br/>The only thing I have missed in the last two movies has been the musical score that gives you goosebumps. Thats OK though. I understand why he has chosen to do that and will look forward to watching what he comes up with in the future."

He kidnaps three young girls for his scheme but one of them has a very troubled past.<br/><br/>Directed by M Night Shymalan<br/><br/>Starring James McAvoy, Anya-Taylor Joy and Betty Buckley<br/><br/># NO SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Overall: You will either love this movie and everything about it... or you will absolutely despise it and not get it. The reason too that is a spoiler so I won't say it however if you want to see it(which I do recommend), I recommend you watch Shymalan's earlier work to get a better grasp of his movies. If you don't, I guarantee you won't enjoy this movie as much.<br/><br/># POSSIBLE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Good: <br/><br/>1. James McAvoy gives a career highlight performance and is truly fantastic in this movie. Doing one character well is impressive but the sheer scope of characters he plays in this, each with such drastically different and unique personalities is awe inspiring.<br/><br/>2. Anya-Taylor Joy was also excellent as Casey and you really see and understand her character as the story progresses.<br/><br/>3. Betty Buckley was also excellent as his therapist and gave an actual human character to the movie.<br/><br/>4. The premise is excellent and genuinely original(I believe).<br/><br/>5. Now the ending. You will either love this movie to pieces or see it as two hours of your life wasted, and that is all down to this ending. I won't spoil it but to truly understand and enjoy it, you must have watched 'Unbreakable' beforehand, which I know many people wont have. There is also an arc left unfinished in this movie which is such a bold move but also such a genius and excellent one. Leaving it like this is brave but pays off because it leaves you with questions but in a good way.<br/><br/>6. The cinematography is excellent.<br/><br/>Bad:<br/><br/>1. The other two girls abducted with Casey were so bland and forgettable and their purpose felt completely pointless.<br/><br/>2. To get maximum enjoyment in this movie, you must have watched Unbreakable beforehand. That is great for people who have(like myself) but makes the film awful for those who haven't(like who I watched it with). The movie is potentially fine without it but Shymalan makes some peculiar decisions at points and without a proper reason given in the movie, many people with feel unsatisfied and not enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>9/10"

","After so many disappointments from M. Night Shyamalan, I was concerned that Split would be another bomb. However, the trailer alone gave me hope. It looked eery and supernatural, much like many of his other works. I was intrigued.<br/><br/>I hadn't seen James McAvoy in a role that I could remember in a while, so I was excited to see him on the bill. The first few scenes of the movie set the premise of the film quite well. A man with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) comprised of 23 personalities had kidnapped 3 girls. As the film goes on we meet some of these personalities and learn more about the history of this man, along with the girls he has kidnapped. It gave us a sense that we knew a little about each character as the story progressed.<br/><br/>It was only until later in the film that James McAvoy really impresses. He passes off the individual personalities so well and in a way that really makes you think you are looking at a different person each time. However, when the 24th personality comes into play, you are left in bewilderment. It was scary to see a human take the form of this personality, but nonetheless incredible. <br/><br/>In true M. Night Shymalan style, this film ends in a way you might not expect. Without revealing anything, it was somewhat anticlimactic but worth sticking around for. Overall, this was a great film and is definitely worth a watch if you think that his previous films were a disappointment."

","This movie puts M. Night back where he belongs: in between 8 and 9. Nothing spectacular, but worth watching. Some scenes do disappoint - like the confusing weird end mirror sequence with Mcavoy playing the horde. Unnecessary. It feels really similar to the rest of his work, doesn't really surprise anyone there. His movies have a eerie feel to it, with this weird humorous almost dumb little particularities, like the ending cameo, and the whole last 4 minutes of the movie - I didn't know whether I wanted to awe or laugh at the 23 toothbrushes that appear close to the end. <br/><br/>Acting wise I guess McAvoy does a pretty acceptable job; Anya was, as I feel always is, her usual ""ok"", and cudos to Betty Buckley. Decent.<br/><br/>If you have a LOT of free time on your hands, watch it, otherwise there's a LOT of better stuff out there."

Even in ""Signs"", Shyamalan remained granting films with excellent class relative to the suspense, exposition and his regular formula ala Hitchcock. Deplorably, a swift, appalling and distressing professional decline came from his seventh project ""Lady in the Water"", this one was a brutal turning point in his career, which finalized with the calamitous economic busts: ""After Earth"" and ""The Last Airbender"". However, 2015 brought back that director who has a jaw-dropping talent, with horror thriller ""The Visit"", witnessing that the competences of the director come out specifically with low-budgets and professional actors. Keeping in mind that some money means better brainstorms, he resolves to continue with needs for ""Split"", feature film which is positioned in the top 3 between his films due to its attractive story, almost perfect performances and that heady final gesture to his dissimilar filmography.<br/><br/>After the air of dread overlaid on the beginning (it's straight to the point) around to the kidnapping of the three young women who's in different averages of moral, intellectual and corporal nudity; the film pays homage to the supreme genre classics, besides, the director-I don't know how-gives with infinite ways to equip each frame of own personality, as if it were several filmmakers who are merged into a single mind, a frightening mind.<br/><br/>It escorted by a B movie frank charm, the crucial condition for the psychological feat to work properly is the proficient cast, of which two people were superior. McAvoy's performance(s) feels like a veneration to Anthony Perkins' ""Psycho"" or many of the actors and actresses who have portrayed multi-dimensionally creditable characters. The interpretative conveniences of ""Split"" are the fantasy for any actor craving to bring his capabilities to light, and on this occasion, young Magneto of X-Men franchise was who got the vote of confidence to demonstrate what he treasures, making manifest the multifaceted person that he is. One of the most remarkable and compelling acting tours de force of recent times, one which has been carved out with fire into universal filmography, a round of applause for this master. It'd not be correct to set aside his companion, Anya Taylor-Joy, who accomplished tremendous debut in Robert Eggers' ""The Witch"". She transmits intrinsic loneliness and self-destruction which have been aroused by a tragic last. This one is a testimony more about we're witnessing to one of the next matrons of the interpretation.<br/><br/>Thanks to the alternate and incessant flashbacks that gradually paints Casey's infancy, Shyamalan sets up timing in due course and manufactures a parallelism between its two main characters, who find their generic reason for living: pain. Both battle against the hapless last, both want to leave the darkness, however, it's not until they discover natural correlation of their lives, that they observe that are intimately equal. A parallel which gives big suspense and intrigue amounts around the desired self-discovery, but that also proposes an interesting and controversial approach to those people who collide with the cruel reality, which causes in them a pure human metamorphosis.<br/><br/>Deplorably, the film has flaws in sporadic maneuvers, iterative situations and temp lost of pace and emotion, besides the detrimental marketing, which will do away with many, rather too many, of the strong points and surprises that saves the movie, it's like a direct spoiler which gonna mess up more than the half of it.<br/><br/>""Split"" is a resource working for rational reconfirmations. The first one, its director is back, returning to his origins where low budgets generate showy ideas; ""do more with less"". The second one, James McAvoy is a prodigious acting chameleon, his performance will never perish. The last one, Taylor-Joy is one of the most promising gems currently, we have to monitor her closely.<br/><br/>As film, ""Split"" is fascinating and disturbing from the minute one due to its modern photography, supported by a tenacious opacity within the suffocating underground den and the shots mostly enclosed. Shyamalan writes congenial characters in order to actors win audience over, causing we follow terrified three young women's future, but even more, the dreadful birth of personality number twenty-four of Kevin, all this thing while it delivers audiovisual quality to handfuls with a perturbing soundtrack, a claustrophobic staging and a plot in which we should not trust. Contemplating the last, not only the protagonists had a hurtful yesterday, Shyamalan also had it, and although we shouldn't be too optimistic, we can assert or at least predict the return of the director thanks to one of the most memorable suspense/thriller motion pictures of the last five-year period."

However, it didn't quite deliver for me.<br/><br/>There were lots of good things. First of all, I believe it is safe to say this is the role of James McAvoy's lifetime. Even though we only get to see 8 of the 23 (or is it 24?) multiple personalities, what we are presented with is utterly brilliant.<br/><br/>There was depth to the movie. We are told bits of Casey's past that serve to give important background to the character, even though they are never too obvious.<br/><br/>The tension is palpable in several scenes and you're constantly on tiptoe, never knowing what comes next.<br/><br/>As in all horror movies there are scenes where you just can't help wonder what the hell the character is doing. Why didn't Casey open the car door when she obviously had plenty of time but most of all - edited out-.<br/><br/>It's a pet peeve of mine when the trailer features scenes that don't appear in the movie. In this case, it was Casey saying that the flowers meant they were special.<br/><br/>The film wasn't very well balanced, in my opinion. The pace that seemed so well accomplished in the trailer just wasn't. It was quite slow in the beginning and also there were scenes where Dr Fletcher spoke for what felt like forever.<br/><br/>Split was an exciting film but there was much too hype around it. It's exciting but not mindblowing."

","The story was realistic, with good acting, but it wasn't a very interesting or complicated story.

"amesmonde","Null","2","11","13 February 2017"," Interesting thriller McAvoy and Buckley are outstanding
","Three girls are kidnapped by a man and must try and escape before a frightful personality The Beast comes to get them. <br/><br/>With hints Red Dragon (2002) and echoes of Sybil (1976/2007) with a touch of 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) director, writer M. Night Shyamalan offers an interesting thriller. James McAvoy delivers a performance of a life time as Kevin who has 23 distinct personalities and one additional one, that all play off against each other, even imitating each other at one point. After kidnapping three girls and keeping them locked up in a cellar, surprisingly it is the edgy visits to his therapist, Dr. Karen Fletcher, wonderfully played by Betty Buckley that provide the most tension as you never know when he is going to snap. <br/><br/>The slow undercurrent build up is Split's strength as the girls attempt to escape and we get to know many of Kevin's personas, Dennis / Patricia / Hedwig / The Beast / Kevin Wendell Crumb / Barry / Orwell / Jade. While McAvoy's 9 year old doesn't ring as true as the other characters he encompasses, the distinction between each is impressive. Especially the 24th personality which builds up like a High Noon (1952) showdown. Anya Taylor-Joy's Casey Cooke has a developed character and poignant story arc but always feel second to McAvoy.<br/><br/>The worn on location feel works, a cellar, long corridors, city apartments and a zoo, Shyamalan's realistic setting has become a staple of his work, which helps draw you into the story. Two of the kidnapped girls feel under developed but possibly Shyamalan purposely does this for the viewer to focus on the third and in bid for you to sympathise with her and Kevin.<br/><br/>With a Bruce Willis cameo, the post story twist of sorts will be lost on anyone who hasn't seen one particular film of Shyamalan. And to be honest unless you love this particular film or have a great memory, it will probably annoy rather than entice. That said, all that comes before draws the viewer in. Right down to Dr. Fletcher's assessment of what advantage split personalities can have and its application. Fletcher concludes that 'they' may something more.<br/><br/>Although a mash-up of other films, thanks to McAvoy and Buckley it stands out from most in the genre. Shyamalan's atmosphere and attention to detail gives it some gravitas. Overall, worth watching for McAvoy's performance(s) alone."
"austin0731","7","2","11","12 February 2017"," One of the best character performances in a great psychological thriller
","""Split"" is M. Night Shyamalan return to forms. It was really a character act, upon viewing it really does seem like a sort of supervillain origin story (the ending does sort of reveal /confirm this). The way that the film depicts the character of Kevin is stellar due to the acting and narrative flow. I thought that this is a very solid psychological thriller, one that we haven't gotten a lot of recently. <br/><br/>The film manages a steady pace with a very intense theme that is enforced by the films brilliant score. This was something I really liked, the build up to the reveal, the way we slowly peel away at this character. However I do feel that the trailers sort of spoil it for us and it might be more effective if nothing is given away however that probably wouldn't work marketing wise. <br/><br/>The way that James McAvoy depicts each individual personality is amazing, the way he contorts himself, squeezes his brows together or stand upright, subtle details like that make it a performance to watch out for. The female lead, Anya Taylor-Joy was also really good in her role and was great at depicting this cold, broken individual. The way she intuitively was able to calmly decipher the situation and identify what to do made her character great. The film really thrives at unravelling these two character's past in a very great way.<br/><br/>However once we enter the last act where the final personality dubbed ""the beast"" is unleashed i feel the film starts to go down hill, this is the most action heavy part of the film however it may be pushing the boundaries a little with the development of the personality. It was horrendous to see how this such well crafted and built up character crawl around on walls like spiderman. This was a really kind of off putting ending however it was well resolved in terms of having an amazing epilogue in which kicks off with Taylor-Joy's character giving a final emotional stare, as she contemplates which is worst, returning to her abusive and sexually harassing uncle or to have just been locked up here for ever. Followed up by the reveal that this movie sets place in the same universe as ""Unbreakable"". Setting up the potential Unbreakable trilogy."

"nurserannaree","8","2","11","12 February 2017"," I could say that this is one of the best movie in 2017.Every casts have done their best to get into the characters and James McAvoy deserves an Oscar from this role.
","I love all of the characters in Kevin's body and I also love James McAvoy who has showed all of them out completely perfect. A review that you're going to read after this has a spoiler so if you don't want to see it,you can skip this review. I'm very impressed all of Kevin's identities in different ways. The first person that I will talk about is Hedwig. Yes! He is 9 years old, he still very young but I think he might be the best identity in Kevin's body. Because he has showed the good feeling to Casey and I think he loves her. He almost helped Casey got out off there but he wasn't brave enough. The second identities,Dennis. He isn't that bad for me. He likes to keep everything clean all the time and always looks serious. The third one, Patricia. Oh..I love her! She is a good person for me even if she still isn't perfect. She is kind to all of 3 girls who got caught, she made the meal and take care of them. And there are a lot of identities that I still didn't mention but you have to go to know them yourself. Now, let's talk about the plot. I don't like the plot so much but I don't hate it too. I would say that it's good but isn't great. I think they should introduce Kevin to us more and reduce the story about Casey. The director or producer should only focus on Kevin's details. And the movie told us that Kevin has 24 different identities but it told us a little bit about each one. I want to know about them more! But don't believe everything that I say. You can't judge it if you still hasn't see it! Good luck!"

","So hearing good reviews about this movie and the fact that Shyamalan's last movie The Visit was decent, I was generally excited to see if the hype was real. And I was not let down! This is a really good and original film. We have hardly seen anything so unique like this in horror movies these days. Shyamalan's direction and screenplay are both excellent. You can really tell he put a lot of effort in making a good film to please us. James McAvoy was such a great casting choice! He did an outstanding job as Kevin with 23 different personalities. Anya Taylor Joy also did great. Her character was well written. The screenplay had a great story that kept us on the edge of our seats! My only issue is that the climax while I admit it was scary, I found it unrealistic compared to the realism of the entire rest of the film. Before I go I just want to also say the direction of photography was very unique and was done in a way I adored! Definitely go see this one, it's worth your time and money!"
"jackson-regurge","7","2","11","11 February 2017"," My Split Opinion
","Split is an intriguing film which follows the story of a man who has different 24 personalities. It is a tense thrill ride and the story has you gripped from the start. <br/><br/>James McAvoy's performance is breathtaking. At no point in the film do you think that McAvoy is acting; it all feels very real. His portrayal of a person with multiple personalities is truly incredible. Compared to McAvoy' performance, the other actors' contribution is a little underwhelming – although this is not a big problem. <br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan's direction is consistent throughout the movie. However, there are plot holes. The movie keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat throughout. It is well made and brimming with suspense. <br/><br/>I feel that the story and pacing of the film is well constructed and I look forward to seeing what Shyamalan releases next, now he has returned from his fall from grace. We get a hint that he may be building a cinematic universe at the end of 'Split' but, the scene in question does feel a little shoehorned in. <br/><br/>Overall, I liked the film, but feel it was insensitive to sufferers of Dissociative Personality Disorder. I would give the film 7 out of 10."
"emmzio","8","2","11","9 February 2017"," Chilling, strangely charming, etc...
","Somehow I managed to miss all promotional material for Split before deciding to see in the cinema. It is very rare that I see films without researching it first, and I was expecting a throwaway thriller/horror at best. I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>This film could have very easily failed if it weren't for James McAvoy. He delivered a fantastic performance in possibly one of his most challenging role(s) to date. I was in awe every time he was on screen. His acting was simultaneously chilling and charming - the flow between characters was seamless and he provided comedy, invoked fear and provoked sympathy throughout.<br/><br/>Was the story unique? No. But it did feel more in depth than your usual abduction movie. The representation of individuals with DID goes further than the trailers portray, and of course, better than most horror films which seem to demonise its sufferers. Kevin (McAvoy) is host to 23 alters, and only 3 are shown to be malicious. Many people are very sensitive about representation, but I believe DID and PTSD were handled very delicately.<br/><br/>Other characters, especially Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) and Dr. Fletcher (Betty Buckley), also provided excellent performances. My one criticism is the twist at the end of the film, which I felt took away from the flow. The reference at the very end also makes me wonder where M. Night Shyamalan is taking this next.<br/><br/>Overall, highly recommend."
"eddie_baggins","7","2","11","2 February 2017"," A creepy and unique thriller dominated by McAvoy's turn
","Until last year's mini-comeback The Visit hit our cinema screens, it seemed like the ""it"" thing to do was talk down the undeniable talents of M. Night Shyamalan as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>A writer/director of unique vision that gave birth to one of the greatest debuts of all time with The Sixth Sense and followed it up with the memorable Unbreakable and Signs and the underrated The Village, only to be found wanting with misguided films Lady in the Water and (cold shudder alert) The Last Airbender and The Happening, the young director seemed to have lost his way and everyone was having a great time reminding each other about it, but showing once and for all that you can't keep a talent down forever, the commercially successful and critically liked Split see's Shyamalan back doing what he does best, delivering audience appeasing thrillers with fresh unpredictable twists.<br/><br/>While not reaching the grand heights of his early products, Split which ends up going to some fairly dark and twisted places as it deals with a group of abducted teenage girls led by The Witch's Anya Taylor-Joy's Casey and their increasingly demented encounters with their adductor Kevin, who just so happens to have a further 22 personalities with an added addition on its way, is a constantly engaging and often unpredictable beast that is anchored by a powerful display of acting turns from James McAvoy.<br/><br/>Whether playing the OCD Dennis, the child like Hedwig, the fashion introvert Barry or an array of other identities including a late starter to the horde in the films final stages, McAvoy dominates the film and elevates it to grander heights than it's somewhat slight narrative aims go for and while Split is unlikely to be a film awards season cares to recognise come the end of 2017, there's little denying that we've already seen one of the year's most standout acting displays and arguably the turn of McAvoy's still developing career.<br/><br/>The other highlight of Split is seeing Shyamalan back on impressive directing and writing duties with the film featuring a number of tension riddled examples of direction (and a standout dance scene) and a number of brave writing choices, some of which will shock the audiences in the later stages, and in particular give greater meaning to Casey's plight.<br/><br/>It's great to have the Shyamalan of old back, not to the level we know his capable of, but Split is a thriller with a difference, filled with an odd yet evident heart and James McAvoy having the time of his life running wild with one of modern cinemas most spine-tingling villains. With the added addition of an end coda likely to please Shyamalan fans of old, Split is well worth your time.<br/><br/>3 ½ cd players out of 5"
"bkrauser-81-311064","6","2","11","22 January 2017"," More of the Same from M. Night Shymalan
","The works of M. Night Shymalan are certainly an acquired taste. A taste that has not been acquired by mainstream American audiences for the better part of seventeen years if we're being totally honest. Make a short list of movies that have angered audiences with misplaced pretension and/or rug-pulling twists that don't make sense, and you're liable to find the directors name all over it. Yet much like fake news, ska music and smallpox, his personal clout and unique mix of genre tropes are having themselves a bit of a comeback. And nowhere is that more evident than in his newest film Split.<br/><br/>Split's main conceit; the mysteries of the human mind, are exemplified by the traumatized Kevin (McAvoy) who becomes our villain of sorts. His psychoanalyst Dr. Fletcher (Buckley) believes he possesses 23 distinct personalities, all of whom vary in age, gender, interests, mannerisms, personal histories and even body chemistry. This of course comes as a shock to three teenage girls who have been taken hostage by one or more of Kevin's personalities, many of whom have a cult-like obsession or fear of ""The Beast"" the rumored 24th. While huddled in a locked basement awaiting their fates, the three girls must decide which personalities to trust while keeping their eyes peeled for ways to escape.<br/><br/>With Split, it seems that Shymalan has finally accepted the fact that he'll never be anything more than a B-movie director. A brief look at his filmography reveals that even at his worst, Shymalan has used the same sophisticated visual vocabulary and affinity for psychological pablum as Hitchcock. Yet much like using a pipe wrench for an oil change, Shymalan's work doesn't come with the same sophistication or practical applications. Shymalan's fateful decision to eschew big-budget projects like The Last Airbender (2010) for smaller genre-niche movies has yielded some objectively better results over the last few years. He's still using the exact same formula that made him a household name, only now his clumsiness is seen as endearing or quirky in smaller movies. If one were to compare the found-footage proclivities of The Visit (2015) to the horrifyingly excessive The Happening (2008), you'd realize that the only real difference, is one actually knows it's a black comedy.<br/><br/>Split is simply more of the same - ominous atmospherics, pseudo-religious iconography, quasi-Jungian pop psychology and excessive brooding, all dialed up to eleven. Clearly never learning from his mistakes, Shymalan has also speckled in wind-baggy in-world explanations and redundant plot information, all but guaranteeing that audiences will burst out laughter before they cower in fear. Add to all that a complete inability to marry his technical abilities with a unifying tone and you got yourself a carnival full of cheap tricks and cheaper thrills.<br/><br/>Aiding in this carnival act is James McAvoy whose campy performance is fun to watch, if for no other reason than its so far beyond the pail of plausibility. Kevin is one of those characters that most actors secretly dream of doing because, while they may be broad and even offensive, they do supply facets of an actor's range. Plus, by the time one of the kidnap victims opens the files on all the personalities, Kevin's kinship to those suffering from Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is about as tangential as Pure Flix's kinship is to Christianity.<br/><br/>Out of all of Kevin's victims, Anya Taylor-Joy's outsider Casey has the easiest time adjusting to Kevin's solipsistic creep vacuum, allowing her characters lack of character color the background like the blank stare of a China doll. Her background, parceled in segments, does give reason for this; reasons that ultimately endear her to her kidnapper/s in the most unsettling of ways. While some may see her eventual fortitude as a source of strength, her inherent lack of agency throughout just reeks of exploitation.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, our fully-realized villain purports to bring salvation through suffering. Yet when you realize that you're not watching a bizzaro girls-in-peril kidnap movie but something else entirely, the suffering just becomes too unbearable."
"zack217","8","2","11","7 February 2017"," Very Good Film
","This movie is a tense thriller. I liked the pacing of the film as it took its time to build the motives and characters. The final act did get my heart pumping as it was a welcome contrast to the build up. You can really understand the motives of the characters. The ending scene also provided a great surprise to fans of Unbreakable. The ending makes the plot more believable as well as explains some small details. All in all this is a nice film that sticks to a simple plot and makes it work. Downsides one might find in viewing this is the films slow buildup. This does have a nice payoff at the end though. If you haven't see this film already then go out and see it!"
"annuskavdpol","8","2","11","2 February 2017"," Aliens type design
","Watched Split in the Odeon, February 2nd, 2017. The movie is about a man with 23 personalities and which the 24th personality takes over all of the other personalities. This mental illness is called Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). I liked the role of the psychiatrist. She was a caring and curious woman. I also liked how the lead character turned into an Alien life-form at the end of the movie. It reminded me of Aliens, the movie combined with V-for Vendetta, especially close to the end when the lead character was in the subway station and placed the flowers on the ground. In V-for Vendetta, the lead character also used flowers in a subway station to symbolize a violent ending. The story line between V-for Vendetta and Split are also similar in the way that both lead characters wanted to overcome societal challenges by using violence as the answer. Within the field of psychiatry it is the hope that patients can transform and in a sense that is what the lead character in Split does; like the movie Ex-Machina - the antagonist wins - which is an ending unlike Star Wars were good always overcomes evil."
"beatriceyongyuexuan","5","2","11","1 February 2017"," Made me tense all the way in a good way
","Split is a movie with constant suspense, but personally I find it gives out too little information and is a too mysterious for my taste. I had hoped to explore more of the characters that roam in Kevin's mind, but the movie emphasizes more on the other leading character's tragic past, which could have been more interesting if it focused more on how Kevin's other personalities surfaced. Split also maintained a potential for something greater, which had me at the edge of my seat, bracing myself for the worst that was yet to come, but unfortunately, I found it slightly disappointing that the revelation does not pay off the tension throughout the film. Some actions made by the characters in the movie are deliberately meant to guide the movie to a desired ending, which personally applies to many of the horror films I have watched. But I enjoyed the cinematography, of how many shots were composed of the expressions of changing personalities."

","Why cash in on the merging of various cinematic universes, where the ultimate good, Mr. Nakatomi Plaza himself decides to get an upgrade from doing mostly B movies to getting featured in, what you could call Shyamalan's welcome return to form with an effective thriller of the mental disorder variety?<br/><br/>Why not?<br/><br/>Why use a mental disorder as a scare tactic?<br/><br/>Why not? Plus the director's downright bad recent ventures and then suddenly coming up with ""The Visit, 2015"" and now ""Split"", make it seem he just recovered; or, it could could be withdrawal, a ten million dollar worth of fracking withdrawal. I pray it isn't. I also pray they don't add another five to that ten - Shyamalan, it seems, is better off with restrained financing, which push him to concentrate on the plot more than the air bending CGI or a hundred men shaking trees tops, to make it look windy. Or was the wind also CGI? I couldn't tell except for when Mr. Ex-Underwear-Model wanted everyone to run with him to perceived (again by Shyamalan) safety.<br/><br/>Yup, the audience and the critics and pilgrims like yours truly are, for lack of a better word, split. Dr. Fletcher's dramaturgy thesis on MPD, now called DID - because the guys at SHIELD (or in this case The Mutant Enforcers of Xavier) now think its disassociating to have more than one consciousness within a single human being - is there, perhaps only to fill in on the disorder and also for innovative structural attempts. There couldn't be a better 'shot by the fracking ""Red Dragon"" book' picture this year.<br/><br/>I'll tell you what really takes you off tangent and to the fracking moon; the hellish moves that Hedwig forks over to the strange as frack dubstep track, Snails by Frogbass; it could be the other way round but that doesn't change the fact that McAvoy gives a terrific, masterful show, changing in to all twenty three (one to go) personalities by the end (in the beginning there's six, tops, that Shyamalan focuses on), in quick facial transitions. It frighteningly reminded me of Ledger's Joker. And that's saying a lot.<br/><br/>Anya Taylor-Joy is another force to reckon with the shotgun show n' tell and running like Ripley, from a xenomorph.<br/><br/>It did get a little over the top but hey, after all if the keen viewer and Shyamalan are convinced of a 'superhuman' trail, then by all means.<br/><br/>Why not?"

This is hands down the best acting I've ever seen and has left me thinking about this movie for days. Given there is one bad actor (one of the girls) however the lead character plays several persons flawlessly. his transition from one personality into another is seamless and amazing to watch as not only his voice changes but his facial expressions and behavioral actions change along with it, each personality is unique and its as if you are watching a new actor each time.

","Movie- M. Night Shyamalans comeback to the movie industry, by making a brand new movie, that caught the interests of everyone seeking a new, fresh, thrilling movie. M. Night Shyamalans previous works doesn't impress people with movies like, signs and after earth, which were total failures. M. Night Shyamalan released the movie The Visit in 2015 which was kind of a funny- thriller. Now when I say funny-thriller I mean it wasn't supposed to be humorous but gave a few laughs in some scenes and the same happened with split. I don't think it should of got the "" horror "" tag as its not a horror its a thriller. One thing that really caught my attention and a small detail that was in the movie was at the start when they address the cast they do it in a kind of a old thriller type of thing where its a split 10 screens, it just made the beginning look so cool. The story, plot, and idea of this movie was very unique and special, M. Night Shyamalan was smart to come up with something like this as a lot of directors would not think as something as smart as that.<br/><br/>Actors:<br/><br/>Now actors, I can not exaggerate how much of a great performance James McAvoy pulled off, really Oscar worthy. His character kind of reminded me of Heath Ledgers Joker. That was something that was a highlight of the movie. Other actors such as Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, were outstanding with the characters, especially Anya Taylor-Joy.<br/><br/>Plot: As I said before the plot was very unique, and was something fresh, and new for people to watch, but as a thriller not a horror. It was sort of a mysterious film where you didn't know what was happening next but not to a high level.<br/><br/>Feedback: Overall I recommend watching this movie, its really entertaining for any type of audience. One thing was the ending. You know its going to be confusing if there's ending explanations when you type in ""split"" in google or YouTube. The order of events is really tense and you're always wondering whats going to happen next. If you are into M. Night Shyamalan, go see this movie to see a tremendous comeback. The only downfall was a confusing ending that only a small group of M. Night Shyamalan super fans would understand, you would understand if you look at a ending explanation if you didn't already understand the ending like I did. I rate M. Night Shyamalans Split a 7.5/10."
"ChrisKleinFangirl","9","2","11","29 January 2017"," Gripping and tragic
","Shyamalan did not disappoint in this unique and totally gripping thriller.<br/><br/>Initially, the controversy surrounding this film made me more inclined to see it, several news sources had stated the film was nothing but a hate-crime that spread misinformation about mental health (crucially, dissociative disorders)and were concerned of the film portrayal of sufferers, painting them as evil, murderers. However, I couldn't disagree more. Split shone a unique, interesting and somewhat positive light on DID, which is treated in a sensitive yet still captivating way.<br/><br/>James Mcavoy gave a totally sensational performance, every 'character' he played was totally believable, from the accents to the mannerisms, their was nothing gimmicky or cliché about the characters. Along with this, Anya Taylor-Joy, also performed wonderfully. Giving her character just the right amount of mystery to get you questioning.<br/><br/>Good acting, non-clichéd characters and a gritty balance of reality and fantasy were the main components in making Split so gripping yet tragic. The mood of the film remains dark throughout, with just the right amount of Comic Relief to not drain you entirely. The ending is somewhat uplifting, but will leave you asking hundreds of questions. Whether you've read good or bad things about Split, I would recommend giving it a chance. You won't forget it :)"
"Fiurilli","8","2","11","29 January 2017"," A return to form
","Almost every director has a period one can call their 'golden years'. For some directors these last their entire career, while for others it merely consist of one or maybe two movies . A few years back director M. Night Shyamalan experienced his 'golden years' with three consecutive movies much loved by fans. Back then it was no wonder that Shyamalan was often given the nickname ''the golden boy''. As a fan of his earlier work it was sad to see that he never came close to accomplishing the wonderful craftsmanship he showed during his 'golden years' with movies such as The Sixth Sense. Every film released by Shyamalan after Signs was a major disappointment and after just a few movies he fell from grace reaching his lowest point in 2010 with The Last Airbender. <br/><br/>However in 2015 something changed when Shyamalan released the comedy/horror movie The Visit. Although this still wasn't a very good film it did provide a very fun experience and it seemed as if Shyamalan was beginning to understand what made his earlier work so much fun to watch. All the more reasons to be excited about his latest film Split, which follows actor James McAvoy in the role of Kevin Crumb, a man with 23 distinct personalities. In the beginning of the movie one of these personalities kidnaps three young women who he holds hostage in some sort of underground facility. These women must try to survive while facing Crumb's many personalities. Things take a turn for the worse however, as Crumb starts to develop a monstrous 24th personality.<br/><br/>If one were to judge this movie based on its premise it's easy to disregard this film completely. Another dumb movie by Shyamalan that will probably be just as terrible as his earlier film 'After Earth', right? While the trailers may give this impression, just a few minutes in it is clear that 'Split' is a different beast altogether. Right off the bat Split takes a hold of the audience and exerts a grip so tight that one can only forget its ridiculous premise and suspend their disbelief altogether. The story of Kevin is very interesting to watch especially since the mystery surrounding him seems to be growing by the minute. The manner in which questions are answered is perfectly balanced between conversations and even though the dialogue is exposition heavy as a result it never actually seems that way. This can be attributed to the fact that most conversations have a certain sense of realism such that it never appears as if the information is being told to the audience instead of to the characters on the screen. For the first time in a few years Shyamalan has created an amazing story and although it does take a few twist and turns that seem out of place it is incredibly fun to experience.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's story is also very well presented on the big screen. The eeriness of the events surrounding Kevin is very well framed by the slow moving shots that often linger a little bit longer than usual. Combined with the story itself this in turn provides some great psychological horror with a tension that almost always appears to be at a boiling point. This sense of tension never lets up and it alone is what can pull one through the few moments where the scrip falters. Scattered throughout the film are some beautiful shots and a lot of times what is actually happening on the screen is very well mirrored with the manner in which it is framed. Shyamalan and cinematographer Mike Gioulakis have created a very good looking film but by far the most noteworthy aspect of Split is the amazing acting by James McAvoy in the role of Kevin and seven of his personalities. McAvoy really owns the part and presents every personality very much as its own character. Every second with McAvoy on the screen was a delight to see and his performance alone made Kevin's journey worth the watch.<br/><br/>All in all Split is a very solid movie that is definitely worth the price of admission. Both the script and the direction by M. Night Shyamalan are very good and on top of that all is the amazing acting performance by James McAvoy. If you are a fan of the horror/thriller genre then Split is a must watch for you, however even if you are not it is worth checking out regardless."

","This film is original and it really makes you wonder about the potential of the human brain. As always with Shymalan there will be a plot twist and the film was put together so beautifully. I can easily describe it as a horror film but also a film that truly saddens me because of people that actually have this as part of their lives and Mcavoy really conveys to you how they would feel.<br/><br/>In my opinion both Shymalan and Mcavoy deserve an award for delivering not only a horror film true to its name but a piece of art that cannot be compared to another film. I would love to give my thanks to Mcavoy and Shymalan for creating this beautiful film. <br/><br/>Easily a 10 out of 10"
"Ben_Cap","7","2","11","28 January 2017"," M. Night Shyamalan's Best Idea In Years.
","This past Halloween I revisited The Sixth Sense(1999) to see how well the horror classic had aged. I remembered it being a perfect piece of new age horror, that changed the way ghost stories would be told in movies. While The Sixth Sense does hold up as a terrific movie, there are problems mostly with the direction of the story and the dialogue. It may please you to hear that Split has a lot of the same elements that made The Sixth Sense great, but also some of the faults. They are not the same movie at all, but M. Night Shyamalan may have stumbled upon his best idea since Unbreakable(2000) and while he has taken quite a fall in recent years, he still has the ability to create worlds that are interesting and watchable.<br/><br/>Split is about 3 teenage girls who after attending a birthday party, are abducted by a man who seems to have some significant mental problems. The girls are placed in a room who's only contents are 3 beds, a door and a bathroom. The girls can hear a few different voices on the other side of the door, even a woman who seems to be willing to help the girls, but as the girls find out, their captor has split personality disorder, and has been talking to himself the whole time. The plot is incredibly easy to understand, while also feeling like a complicated web of stories and characters that we will most likely never fully know about.<br/><br/>While Shyamalan has always been known for his twists at the end of his movies, his overall writing ability has been lacking. Where he really excels is in creating worlds that exist in the same one we live in, but adding an element that changes the whole story. For example The Sixth Sense is about a boy who is struggling to grow up, who also happens to see dead people. In Unbreakable Bruce Willis is a regular down on his luck guy looking for meaning in his life, who just happens to not be able to get hurt. Split follows the same formula and it is this which really took Split from a bad movie to a good one for me. The way the different personalities take hold of James McAvoy's character is just so darn cool and inventive. The more I learned about the process the more I wanted to see it used in other movies.<br/><br/>James McAvoy, who is probably best known for playing a young Professor X in the recent X-Men movies has been at this for a while. I first remember him as Mr. Tumnus in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) movie, but McAvoy has moved out of family movie actor and has become one who takes some challenging roles. McAvoy has played characters with mental disorders before, in Filth(2013) he played a cop with Bipolar Disorder and his performance in that was great. While he takes his role in Split a little over the top, its almost what the character needs, Kevin does not have a run of the mill case of split personality disorder, he has 23 unique personalities who seem to be completely separate people, to the point that one of them can have diabetes while the other 22 do not. While not his grandest performance, McAvoy gives a good one and one that fits into the movie.<br/><br/>I have tried to avoid using the wordplay that I'm sure every other review of this movie has used, but since were almost done I figure using this pun won't ruin your opinion of my opinion. I felt very SPLIT in my opinion of Split while watching it. On one hand there were some lines of dialogue that I could not believe made it past the first draft of the script, let alone into the final cut, but on the other Split kept my attention for most of the 117 minute run time. If you don't understand the ending that is fine, just do a quick internet search and the results should solve at least some of the confusion. Split is an entertaining movie, that was marketed more as a horror movie than a thriller, but if you keep an open mind and allow Split to be entertaining you should have a fun time at the movies."

","I honestly do not understand all of the bad reviews I'm seeing from other people on here. To me, this movie was a nice reminder that M. Night Shyamalan can still make quality movies. The story has an overall slow pace and I don't think people were expecting that, so they give it hate. You have to go into this expecting a story to be slowly told over two hours, but that doesn't mean that it's boring. Not to mention the slower pace to the movie is completely overshadowed by a great performance by James McAvoy, who deserves nothing short of an Oscar nod for the role. The movie doesn't really have a lot of unexpected twists or turns so don't expect an over the top Shyamalan style movie either. If you have seen most of his work, then you'll understand the ""twist"" at the end, but if you haven't seen a lot of Shyamalan movies you'll most likely just end up confused. Overall, I would just say to form your own opinion on it and ignore the hate. Go in ready for a good story to be told with just enough there to make it a great movie that holds your interest."
"MaximumMadness","9","2","11","27 January 2017"," ""Split""- The M. Night Shyamalan we knew and loved is back with a vengeance! 'Split' is a taut and intense thriller!
","Save for a few controversial political figures, fewer people have proved to be as divisive in recent years as the filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan. Though his career got off to a promising start with an excellent trilogy of thrillers including the iconic ""Sixth Sense"", underrated ""Unbreakable"" and heartfelt and frightening ""Signs"", he soon took a nosedive with a series of severe misjudgments and a string of critical failures. Whereas before 2004, his name piqued curiosity and excitement, for a time there, he became a small laughing stock. Thankfully, he's gone through something of a career-renaissance. Between his very decent television series ""Wayward Pines"", his entertaining 2015 found-footage horror-comedy ""The Visit"" and now his excellent new feature ""Split"", it appears that the M. Night we so fondly remember the same man who brought us that brilliant trilogy of films so many years ago is back with a vengeance!<br/><br/>""Split"", a sort-of drama/thriller starring the excellent James McAvoy and wonderful newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy might just be one of his best films yet. It's a shocking return to form for Shyamalan, and it honestly came out of nowhere for me. I never gave up on him entirely even when his later films started to get progressively worse... but even I wasn't expecting ""Split"" to be just as good as it is. It's still early in the year, but I have my doubts that the year will produce any other thrillers that are just as deliciously creative, genuinely suspenseful, oftentimes hilarious and downright breathtaking as this film. Bravo, Mr. Shyamalan! Bravo.<br/><br/>We follow a trio of teenaged girls, including troubled outsider Casey (Taylor-Joy), who are kidnapped by a troubled man named Kevin (McAvoy) who suffers from Dissociative Idenity Disorder. With twenty-three identities inside of his mind, Kevin is completely unable to control his own body, which is being increasingly inhabited by a small group of corrupt and twisted personalities who tease the girls about the coming of a twenty-fourth personality known only as ""The Beast."" Casey, herself coming from a dark history, tries to assist the others in figuring out how to save themselves, all while Kevin's psychiatrist Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley) becomes increasingly alarmed by his recent behavior.<br/><br/>To star, the cast is just phenomenal, and everyone is perfectly cast in their respective roles. Anya Taylor-Joy, who got her start in the excellent art-house horror feature ""The Witch"", makes for a remarkable protagonist who you can't help but root for. She has a talent far beyond her years, and it's going to be great fun seeing her career develop. Betty Buckley is wonderful as a brilliant psychiatrist whose goal is to help Kevin, even if she suspects there might be something sinister going on. She adds a great sense of class to the role and also helps to fill the audience in on the details and eccentricities of Kevin and his disorder. But of course, James McAvoy is the real standout here. The role of Kevin is one that if played poorly, could have destroyed the entire film. But McAvoy is absolutely stunning, and steals the show in virtually every scene. He perfectly balances his performance, and plays it just over-the-top enough that it works, while never becoming cartoony. Each of his ""alters"" feels like a unique role, and all of them elicit a different reaction from the viewer- whether it be the threat of the predatory ""Dennis"", the entertainment and sadness brought about by the childlike ""Hedwig"" or the likability of the dominant personality ""Barry."" Just an incredible, award-worthy turn from the excellent McAvoy.<br/><br/>Shyamalan is at the top of his game in regards to his writing and direction, and I actually found this one of his most ambitious and striking films to date. His script has a wonderful sense of pace and structure, doling out information at a deliberate but steady pace, allowing the pieces to organically fall into place. You'll always be at the edge of your seat. He's also thankfully dialed back quite a bit on the eccentric ""quirky characters"" and wonky dialog that have made his last few films somewhat unbearable, and it feels a bit more naturalistic as a result. In addition, I think his keen eye for visuals- which has always been one of his greatest strengths- is on full-display in this film. Despite being one of his lowest-budget features, the film is never anything less than slick and stylish, with the camera snaking along like a serpent ready to strike at any moment, and a chilling atmosphere of isolation and oppression established early on. This is also perfectly complimented by the moody and grungy soundtrack courtesy West Dylan Thordson, whose tones and themes match the picture perfectly.<br/><br/>And then there's the big finale. I won't spoil it, but suffice to say my jaw was literally on the floor for the rest of the day. Just an astonishing climax.<br/><br/>""Split"" will no doubt go down as one of the most pleasant surprises of the year. It's a refreshing and much-needed return to form for director Shyamalan, and is definitely amongst his best work. It's thrilling. Exciting. Spellbinding. And incredibly eerie. While I did have some very minor issues with a few of the developments and the handling of a few key sequences, these faults were so small that they cannot detract from the otherwise completely enthralling experience. If you're one of those people who has dismissed Shyamalan's work or completely written him off, I beg you to give him another chance. Because ""Split"" is without question right up there with his excellent earlier work.<br/><br/>I give it a fantastic 9 out of 10!"
"mace-roache","8","2","11","27 January 2017"," Loved it
","I for one love movies that portray psychotic humans and their stories. ""D.I.D."" portrayed in this movie by James McAvoy was seriously hardcore and SO well done! I gave it an 8 though, because I felt like the story being told was missing something. I haven't quite figured ""what"" yet, but other than that, I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>People annoyed by the ending of this movie will not realize the meaning unless they've seen another movie from about 17 years ago. That's all I'll say about that.<br/><br/>I'll also say this, there are some unusual ""sexual"" portrayals of the girl(s), I really thought could be left out. It was almost like they said ""oh, this part is boring, lets have a girl running in her little white tank top and a loose fitting bra""."

","I was not expecting much.<br/><br/>Looking back on M.

The plot of this movie follows three girls who are captured by James McAvoy's characters. <br/><br/>This film has some amazing acting coming from James McAvoy, probably the best in his career. He puts so much effort into each character he plays and each one is unique and interesting in their own way. Anya Taylor-Joy also brings a lot to the movie, her character's arc in the film in deeply interesting and she acted it out very well. <br/><br/>The cinematography in this movie is very good. Mike Gioulakis makes the film feel claustrophobic while bringing a stylized look. <br/><br/>My only gripes with the movie are some of the acting and the plot near the end. The two other girls that get captured along with the main girl overacted or underacted most of the time and usually did some pretty stupid stuff. Some of the plot near the end of the movie starts to become a bit unbelievable but doesn't ruin the entire film.<br/><br/>Overall, Split is a great horror film with some fantastic acting, great cinematography, some twists and turns, and a solid story with some flaws mixed in."
"Oberrated","8","2","11","23 January 2017"," Shyamalan has returned with the fire
","Just to reiterate, Shyamalan has not impressed me with his most recent works. I went into 'Split' very interested in the material presented in the trailer and especially with how McAvoy was going to approach a character with DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder), but regardless, I had very low expectations. Upon finishing my viewing of 'Split', I was incredibly impressed and satisfied with the film. Shyamalan (finally) delivered a film up to par with his classic works. I felt immersed in the story of 'Split', and that is strongly due to James McAvoy's performance, hands down. James plays a man with twenty-three different personalities. Within the film, we see him actively portray nine of them and some were even coexisting one after the other. It was simply astounding to witness him play this role. I truly felt I was watching a different actor each time until returning to the fact that this was still THE James McAvoy... Beyond the endless praise I could deliver for James, outshined but not to be forgotten, Anya Taylor-Joy remains to be one of my favorite newer actresses to hit the silver screen. Her character of Casey had a wide range of depth to her and was interesting to see develop... the story, as previously stated, is very well-done and immersive from start to finish... One only gripe I had with the film was that it seemed to lull for just a couple moments but it was hardly anything to alter my feel for the film.<br/><br/>Shyamalan has come back with the fire. 'Split' is a sight to see and one I could watch over and over again. I hope to see Shyamalan continue this upward run and, as we have all come to expect and know of the director; lookout for a twist!<br/><br/>-- Oberrated --"
"realmovieman-09862","6","2","11","23 January 2017"," Split B-
","Split is the most recent movie made by M. Night Shymalan, and fans of him (especially me) were very excited to see it because of the supposed ""comeback"" Shymalan is making after going on a rampage of bad films. Split is much better than a lot of the bad Shymalan projects like The Last Airbender, The Happening, and After Earth. However, it doesn't come close to the great ones like The Sixth Sense, Signs, and Unbreakable. The movie has a lot going for it, such as spectacular acting performances from James McAvoy and Anna Taylor-Joy. I also really enjoyed the realism of the film, but it gets completely thrown out the window when ""the beast"" shows up. The pacing also really brings the movie down. There are points where you just want to see one of McAvoy's weird personalities but instead we are learning about side characters that nobody would care about. The worst thing about the movie in my opinion, is the twist ending. M. Night Shymalan is known for being the master of the twist ending, but this one felt extremely out of place. SPOILER: It sets up a sequel for Unbreakable, which makes Split feel like a set piece in Shymalan's plan to make money. (Split was a origin story for a villain in the Unbreakable universe.) In the long run, I like Split and LOVE Unbreakable on its own, but I don't think they would mesh well together in the same universe."
"RforFilm","8","2","11","21 January 2017"," Split is intentionally frustrating and crazy...right for a thrilling look at multiple personality disorder
","I think it's safe to say that everyone must have some voice in their head. Most would say it was their conscience, but what if it were another real person. If you didn't know who they were and what was going in their head, you'd probably run and get the mental hospital down there a.s.a.p. But if you understood what multiple personality disorder was like, then you'd understand that the person with two people on the inside is telling the truth. Taking insanity out of the books, it needs to be understood that ones identity is already complex with tangents of owns thoughts. Now picture having another complex mind in your body. <br/><br/>While the idea has been done in other movies (The Three Faces of Eve, Fight Club, and Me, Myself and Irene), I cannot recall it at the extent that director M. Night Shyamalan is going for in today's movie. I feel bad for the guy as he scored with two great movies (The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) yet has become a Hollywood laughing stock with the majority of his resume not being that hot. After making a better comeback film with The Visit, Split seems more like a spiritual redemption for the man's career. <br/><br/>Teenager Casey (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) is quiet, introverted, and doesn't seem to be enjoying a birthday party of a fellow student who was probably forced to invite her. As Casey and the other girls, Claire and Marsa, are sitting in the car waiting for their dad to drive them home, a stranger enters and knocks them out of conciseness. When they wake up, the women are now in a windowless room with a bathroom and a locked door. Entering in at first is the stranger, who calls himself Dennis (played by James McAvory) who tells them that they have been chosen.<br/><br/>Sometime later, the girls see a woman through the keyhole of their room and try to alert her. To their shock, this is the same man who is presenting himself as ""Patrica"" who assures them that ""Dennis"" is not allowed to touch them, but they are being saved for something great. More so later, Casey find the guy sitting at the door, now saying he's a nine year old named Hedwig. It's revealed that not only does this guy have twenty-three personalities but another called ""The Beast"" is coming and will do horrible things.<br/><br/>I need to stop here as the majority of the second half of Split is spoilers. What makes this really good is that not only is the multiple personalities fully fleshed out people, but that some are stronger and can even impersonate the others. I can only say that actor James McAvoy may have already given one of the best performances of 2017. Aside for being frightening, he carries the weight of several people and makes you both hate and sympathize with him. What your going to feel for in the end cannot be spoiled with. <br/><br/>What I can say is that on it's own, Split is really good. Is it great? I don't know is I can go that far. My problem is not with McAvoy nor the young women, but rather the subplot involving McAvoy's therapist. It's not that Betty Buckley is bad, but given how she's trying to say that his personalities are a part of something bigger (again, cannot give away), it's somewhat campy and even a little campy. And give in mind, her side story is supposed to be taken seriously. It does add up in the end, but I felt that could have been portrayed better. At least Split still makes for a thrilling ride through ones mind.<br/><br/>I'll give this eight pictures of windows out of ten. I can see this not just doing well for a mainstream audience, but for previous fans of Shyamalan who have felt let down by the man's previous work. Without spoiling, I'll say that a lot of people are going to want something of a follow up. I really can't say more, but they'll want it. Trust me. See if this stories' personality makes sense and give this redemption a chance."
"Matt_Layden","7","2","11","21 January 2017"," A Return To Form For Shyamalan, Great Performance from McAvoy.
","I get the feeling that Shyamalan wrote and directed this film, got it down to the 2 hour running time and screened it. Then the studio asked him; ""Shyamalan, don't your movies always have twists? Why doesn't this film have a twist? I think this film needs a twist. Put a twist in"". Then Shyamalan decides to tack some cheap ending onto an otherwise suspenseful film with a career performance from McAvoy. Now people might be upset that I said this film has a twist because saying that is in fact a spoiler. This spoils nothing. The so-called twist, if you even want to call it that, has nothing to do with the film and makes me question why the hell such a scene exists in this film to being with. Now...in saying all that. I honestly don't know if I hated it or loved it. I'm split. (Bad dad joke)<br/><br/>McAvoy plays Dennis / Patricia / Hedwig / Kevin Wendell Crumb / Barry / Orwell / Jade...etc. He kidnaps three young girls and brings them to his lair. The girls are desperate to escape and try everything they can, but soon realize that their kidnapper is not all there. Each of his personalities have completely different conversations with them and himself. Can they escape before ""he"" arrives, a yet to be discovered 24th personality? <br/><br/>We can all agree that when the name M. Night Shyamalan is attached to a project, the groans, the eye rolling and the utter disinterest immediately hits you. Whatever goodwill he did with his first three films seems to have been completely destroyed with The Happening, Last Airbender and After Earth. A low budget horror flick came out recently, from Shyamalan, and people were surprised at how not terrible it was. The Visit was a found footage film and Shyamalan managed to use it to pretty good results. Now he Split, a suspense thriller that boarders body horror and I think it's another hit. <br/><br/>The film relies, heavily, on James McCoy's performance and I'm glad to say it's really strong. He's able to snake his way in and out of the vastly different personalities on a whim and each one is as believable as the last. He gives 100% in his performance here, being terrifying, funny and sad at any moment. Anya Taylor-Joy is the 'lead' girl out of the three, we are given snippets of a backstory through some flashbacks. She's damaged and fits the victim role perfectly. The problem is that we've seen it all before, trouble girl is trapped and has to muster the strength to fight back. <br/><br/>Split was really fun and tense. I'd love to see Shyamalan stick to this genre and stay away from big budgets. The run time might work against the film, it runs two hours and can easily lose some material, but as a whole this film worked for me."
"abouhelier-r","9","2","11","22 January 2017"," Split: 23 Shades of Creepy
","Think Room meets The Missing at 10 Cloverfield Lane. Having seen Split, it is a very good time to be a M. Night Shyamalan fan. Split might be M. Night Shyamalan most compellingly warped concoction to date its genre trappings, acting merely as gateway drugs to the altogether more insanely interesting thriller taking place in Kevin's head. Shyamalan puts all his trust in his audience as he sets up various story elements here and there that won't be fully understood till you have seen the full movie; we learn about characters and the big picture becomes so much more impactful afterwards. <br/><br/>The more we learn, the scarier McAvoy's character(s) starts to sound. Split goes all-in on McAvoy slipping from persona to persona, and luckily the man has the acting skills to do so. Indeed, James McAvoy might be one of the most underrated actors nowadays. I loved him in every movie he has done so far, he is excellent, insanely courageous, fully committed and it pays off. Every personality is specifically distinguishable just by his different vocal pattern and his mannerism. Nominate this man right now. This is the role of his career. <br/><br/>Usually, when a character talks to a shrink it is because the screenwriter couldn't find a more elegant way to weave in exposition. However with this film, despite being a horror-thriller, the most fascinating moments are the ones, McAvoy spends on Dr Fletcher's couch. Betty Buckley has an amazing character as she tries to cure Kevin. She shines and brings a lot to the proper film. Plus, Anya Taylor-Joy's character back story is beautiful and haunting. She was very impressive in The Witch and is even finer here as a deceptively docile captive whose passivity masks both intelligence and gumption. yet it would be foolish to suggest this is anything but McAvoy's movie. <br/><br/>Here's where I mention that Split resembles Psycho when the screenplay makes some riskier moves. Shyamalan's love of tricks is very much alive and well. He also hired the director of photography of It Follows and it really paid off because Split has some brilliant claustrophobic camera work, the lighting is superb, this is a great looking movie. the score is refreshingly subtle. Sometimes you won't even notice how it will be creeping into a scene, while slowly building an intense aura of dreadfulness. <br/><br/>Finally, I loved the ending, I won't spoil anything for you but you know I do love me some good ending. There's a neutron bomb dropped in the final scene that essentially reframes everything you just saw. It isn't a whopping reveal like the one in The Sixth Sense. For a movie nerd like me, it is extremely gratifying. For others, it will fly right over their heads and they will wonder why others in the audience are whispering, ""Oh my God! NO WAY!"". I am so genuinely excited by the ending of this movie, the implication it has and what it can mean for Shyamalan's fans, the future and what he can do with his career.<br/><br/>Overall, Split is a masterful blend of Hitchcock, horror and therapy session. The storytelling is amazingly brave because Night Shyamalan ultimately trusts his audience."

","M. Night's career has for the longest time been considered a tragedy. A director whose debut was so great he was hyped up to be the next Spielberg, followed up that film with two decent films, two controversial films, and three downright awful films. What a mixed bag of a career.<br/><br/>When he made the film 'The Visit', while I didn't like it myself, some critics and fans began saying it may be a return to true form for the writer/director.<br/><br/>Now we know it's true, at least for now, that M. Night is coming back around to critics and fans alike with Split, a genuinely suspenseful and well written thriller.<br/><br/>The film follows three teenage girls, who are abducted by a man with dissociative identity disorder (aka Split Personality Disorder) for an unknown purpose. While the girls attempt to escape their prison, the man visits an elderly psychologist with a long-standing relationship with the man. This is the basic gist of the story without venturing too far into spoilers.<br/><br/>From Psycho to Fight Club, split personality stories are fairly common within the thriller genre. It, along with Schizophrenia and Psychopathy/Sociopathy, is a fairly easy way to create a 'complex' villain for the story, however I believe that with the film's major twist (because of course there's a twist), Split becomes a unique entry in this particular trope.<br/><br/>James McAvoy is great as the man, he has very distinct and developed postures and voices for each of the personalities that is quite outstanding. The three girls are also quite decent in their portrayals, and the psychologist is a very likable side character that genuinely cares for McAvoy's character(s).<br/><br/>Overall, this film is great for the thriller fan, and a great return to form for the director."
"DVR_Brale","6","2","12","26 April 2017"," Heads in the right direction but doesn't fully utilize its potential
","Split is a psychological thriller, not a horror. Everything this movie delivers, together with all suspense, culminates in the final few scenes. So don't expect seeing a movie in which particular scenes alone make sense or are able to scare you. It's like a one coherent experience in which what is to happen heavily depends on what has happened. And it develops slowly.<br/><br/>As the story continues you somehow get to know one person with many different personalities. All of them stand as characters in themselves but tell one story about a particular individual named Kevin. Kevin kidnaps three teenage girls who serve as interlocutors; they don't take pivotal role. Split is not about them and their effort to escape. This is not escape the room stuff.<br/><br/>Seeing how many different personalities interchange in between as if they were not manifestations of a single person is what makes Split so interesting. To help you understand what may be going on inside of Kevin's head, a woman psychologist is utilized as a facilitator. So you get to see Kevin (and some of his personalities) interact with several different characters as to bring about better understanding of why kidnapping and split syndrome. Let me mention that it's not all about Kevin only as you'll get to see as the final moments approach.<br/><br/>McAvoy deserves every single applause he had got. Even critics who didn't like the movie thought acting on his part was excellent. Three young actresses who played girls that got kidnapped did what they were supposed to do. They're not spoiled or stubborn as teens in some other horrors.<br/><br/>I gave it a six because I found the story of 23 different personalities as almost being an excuse for horrible things. Yes, at the bottom Split deals with very difficult and important issues of mental health and wounds we get from the love ones. No matter how sad his story may be, Kevin is a deranged and mentally unstable kidnapper. There's a moment where psychologists says that people like Kevin may have unlocked secret potentials and so somehow surpassed other people. This is pure wishful thinking which Shyamalan apparently took seriously. I may be wrong, but this quaint taste is what I had been left with after seeing it. Other than that, there are several boring and unnecessary parts which should have been replaced with something more interesting. There was a plenty of material for Shyamalan to do that given this topic.<br/><br/>So to conclude. Split is somewhat original in his attempts to deal with serious issues like mental scars, but you'll enjoy it as much as your views on this issues allow you to."

M Night Shyamalan has never been able to replicate the box office or critical success that he enjoyed with those two films  but, oh how he has tried. It's this latest that finally makes us believe he is at least having fun again.<br/><br/>James McAvoy plays Dennis and Patricia and Hedwig and  well  he plays a guy with 23 distinct personalities. As you might imagine, some of these personalities are nicer than others, while some are stronger in their fight for the spotlight. As Dennis, a button-upped neat freak, he captures 3 teenage girls and holds them captive. At first, the purpose is a bit murky, but the delay does allow the girls to meet some of the personalities.<br/><br/>The girls are Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy, who was so good in The Witch), Claire (Haley Lu Richardson from The Bronze), and Marcia (Jessica Sula). Claire and Marcia are the popular girls who react with typical teenage emotions, while Casey pushes for patience and observation. It's Casey who may be the film's most interesting character as childhood flashbacks occur that are first thought to explain her survival skills, but soon enough disclose a darker, more unfortunate past. The younger Casey is coolly played by newcomer Izzie Coffey, and holds her own with Sebastian Arcelus (her dad) and Brad William Henke (her Uncle John).<br/><br/>The always terrific Betty Buckley is outstanding as Dr Fletcher, the psychologist treating McAvoy's character(s). Ms. Buckley adds class and a connection to the real world that gives us hope for the future of the girls being held. McAvoy really seems to be enjoying the acting challenge and shape-shifting that accompanies this mental disorder, and he will likely creep you out a few times. Cinematographer Mike Gioukakis was a key to the look and mood of It Follows, and his camera work here is superb in mostly confined areas. Sure, the whole thing is preposterous, but it's fun and wicked  and with this director, you can expect a surprise or twist – even after all these years."

","Listen, let's just face it...M. Night will always be the director that everyone remembers for his ""Twist Ending"". It's cool...I don't bother knowing that he really only has an affinity to wrapping this up his way...no matter the path it takes to get there.<br/><br/>(MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW...WARNING!!)<br/><br/>Last chance...<br/><br/>...really? Have you seen it yet? If not...just see it, don't let this ruin the perfect ending for you.<br/><br/>OK...you made it. Was this ending better than the Sixth Sense? No. Does it matter more? Absolutely.<br/><br/>The movie itself is long. Don't get me wrong. For the type of story he was trying to tell, there could have been a little less going on.<br/><br/>M. Night starts meandering down this road that I questioned at first. The flashbacks to hunting trips with a Dad and Uncle, which leads to sexual abuse was a complete red-herring. One of the greatest red-herrings in history. Why? Because at one point I thought, ""Jesus...not this again. He's going for that twist...""<br/><br/>At first, I really thought the 24th personality was going to be Casey all along, and she had made up the whole thing in her head, like that really crappy movie with John Cusack ""Identity"". As the movie slowly began to wind down, I truly thought I was going to hate the direction the ending was going. Then, HOLY S***, it did a complete 180 degree turn, and threw me off completely.<br/><br/>The whole movie was just the perfect set-up for the most perfect tie-in in movie history in my opinion. One beloved favorite movie of mine, brought back with only 2 minutes of film.<br/><br/>Philadelphia = The New Gotham.

","PROS: The ending, which is the most controversial part, was still my favorite part. For some reason it left me wanting to see more, which is a very good quality to have. Through the duration of the film I was just sitting there, but the end was when I was truly at the edge of my seat. The acting was very varied throughout the film. This was aggravating because some actors did a really good job in one scene, then a crappy job in the next. There was no one actor that carried the film, and no one actor that ruined it. To sidetrack a little bit, the tension that was made in this film was very average...<br/><br/>CONS: The part that was so upsetting was the character development. This movie had one job, and that was to make the characters have depth. I was just so ticked off throughout the film watching blank actors walk across the screen. This includes the main character, the one with multiple personalities, who was constructed with so little finesse. None of his personalities had depth nor were they explained enough for an ENTIRE film to be carried on them. Another thing was how unethically they portrayed this mental health disorder. It wasn't handled properly, and they put incorrect sciences in that had no relevance to the film whatsoever. This led to numerous amounts of plot holes. Where was never fully answered, who was never fully answered, and why was never fully answered; these are possibly the three most important questions that should probably be answered throughout the film, and nothing was answered. The final thing was how utterly pathetic the characters relationships were portrayed through the movie. It was just so incomprehensible and unrealized that I was sitting there filling in the holes of the movie during the movie. This ended up distracting me from how the film was overall, it was an OK movie.<br/><br/>www.chorror.com"

","M.

He manages to work through his Scottish accent and speaks perfectly well in an American English accent. Plus he is kinda cute. That was this movie's only saving grace. I was mad from the very beginning when the girl had a chance to get out the car and run for her life; then I was mad again when the child personality showed up. I was thinking, ""if this was me and two of my homegirls were with me, we would have beat the hell out of this guy!"" Actually, we would have jumped him no matter which personality he was in.

He coaxes primo performances from James McAvoy as a deeply damaged schizophrenic and Betty Buckley (one of THE hottest TV mom's EVER on the '70's series ""Eight Is Enough"") as his/her shrink.<br/><br/>May I suggest clinging closely to this tried and true formula, MNS.

","Spit captivated my attention and provoked thought into deeper meaning like no film before it. I sat in my seat as the credits rolled contemplating the events that I just encountered. I reviewed every minute detail that occurred to come to a central conclusion of the film. Every scene and piece of dialogue has meaning in Spilt. The concept of Dissociative Identity Disorder is emphasized as the main arch of this film to create a true thriller. Split will leave you asking questions and on the edge of your seat till the very end. Throughout the film, the differences in the characters are shown through the use of flashbacks and foreshadowing to help aide the suspenseful conclusion of the plot.

"jboothmillard","5","2","14","5 February 2017"," Split
","Director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Signs) has had a string of failures, including The Village, The Happening and The Last Airbender, I heard the reviews and saw the clips for this new film, it seemed worth a go. Basically three teenagers, Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and outsider Casey (Anya Taylor- Joy) are kidnapped by a man, who they later realise has more than one personality, in fact he inhabits twenty-three. The kidnapper, Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) was a victim of abuse during childhood, he has severe dissociative identity disorder. Kevin's personalities include ""Dennis"" who is a control freak and has obsessive-compulsive disorder, ""Barry"" who is an artistic fashion designer and the dominant personality, ""Patricia"" who is an assuring prissy woman, and ""Hedwig"" who is a vulnerable nine-year- old boy. While the kidnapped girls try to find a way out, including manipulating the various personalities to escape, Kevin in his other guises often visits his psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), who believes some of his personalities can manifest unique physical attributes for each personality. As ""Dennis"" and ""Patricia"", Kevin warns the girls that they will sacrificed to ""The Beast"", the twenty-fourth personality waiting to be unleashed, he also talks about the possibility of this ""real"" personality emerging with Dr. Fletcher, who is trying to understand the reason for his disorder. While this is all going, the film goes into flashback to see five-year-old Casey (Izzie Leigh Coffey) and her own traumatic childhood, who suffered the death of her father (Sebastian Arcelus), and was molested by her uncle John (Brad William Henke), who became her legal guardian, she completed shooting him with a rifle, but hesitated. Eventually Dr. Fletcher slowly realises something is wrong and that Kevin is hiding something, and Kevin meanwhile does bring out the feared personality ""The Beast"", capable of superhuman levels of strength, speed, mobility and the hunger for human flesh. Marcia and Claire are killed by ""The Beast"", but Casey manages to escape, it turns out they were trapped underneath Philadelphia Zoo, where Kevin lives and works, ""Dennis"", ""Patricia"" and ""Hedwig"" exert permanent control of Kevin's body. In the end, the news of Kevin's crimes is reported on the news, he is nicknamed ""The Horde"", someone in a diner watching remarks that it reminds them of a wheelchair-bound terrorist from 15 years ago, an older David Dunn (Bruce Willis) tells them it was ""Mr. Glass"", this is a twist ending to show that this was a sequel to Unvreakable, ""The Horde"" is supposed to be another villain of Dunn's story. Also starring James McAvoy ""Barry"" / ""Orwell"" / ""Jade"", Neal Huff as Mr. Benoit and M. Night Shyamalan as Jai, Hooters Lover. McAvoy demonstrates his splendid acting ability as the lunatic kidnapper with the severe personality disorder, he is both chilling and at times amusing, the supporting characters never know which personality they are dealing with, it is creepy almost all the way through, and it is a good twist to the kidnap scenario movie, but the flashbacks are pointless, and the ""twist"" ending is nothing that memorable, the film as a whole is so- so, an average psychology horror style thriller. Worth watching!"
"NewandykeFreddie","9","2","15","22 January 2017"," Amazing! Could Split be the beginning of something much bigger?
","When I first saw the trailer for Split I was excited because it reminded me a lot of Alfred Hitchcock's classic Psycho (1960). I feel that the idea of Norman Bates having a separate personality, which he modelled after his mother, is what really made the movie so great. In Split, however, Kevin has 23 (later revealed to be 24) personalities, each with its own memories, beliefs, physical features, and email apparently.<br/><br/>When the movie finally came out, I really wanted to see it because it had been a while since I had seen a movie that wasn't a sequel, prequel, Marvel-related or a tie-in to a previously popular movie. Though (spoiler alert) it turned out to be at least on of these in the end.<br/><br/>I went in to see this movie, and one of the things I enjoyed the most was that the kidnapping began from the get-go. There wasn't an elaborate backstory to show us exactly what was going on. It was unnecessary. We came for Kevin and by god we got Kevin. The initial kidnapping scene was extremely entertaining. Firstly, the girls were so preoccupied with their cellphones that they didn't notice the strange man in their car. I felt that this emphasized the idea that modern day technology has left us so oblivious and unaware of what's going on around us (locally and globally). Secondly, the fact that Kevin (as Dennis) didn't notice Casey sitting right next to him showed that Dennis' mind is very one tracked. Dennis had been planning to kidnap those two girls weeks in advance, so he was either oblivious of Casey's presence or was just indifferent to it. So long as she didn't try to escape. Of course this is exactly what she tried to do, and she may have gotten away if it wasn't for that darned beeping that began when she opened the door. I found Dennis noticing her only at that instant very funny and it immediately had me excited for the rest of the movie. This opening scene was critical, as it set the tone for the rest of the movie, and it was executed very well.<br/><br/>We find out that Kevin is seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. Fletcher. A woman who not only knows about Kevin and his other personalities, but is fighting for the acceptance of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) as a legitimate mental disorder. I found this very interesting, as it was able to shine a light on the fact that most people don't believe in the existence of some mental disorders. These disorders are hard to understand because the involve the mind, which we still don't understand as well as the body.<br/><br/>Later in the movie we get to meet some of Kevin's other personalities, including Patricia, the lovable Hedwig and Barry, or so we thought. Dr. Fletcher realizes that Barry, the leader of the group who chooses which member of Kevin can take control, has actually been silenced. Three (or at least two) of the personalities take control in order to unleash The Beast. I actually wanted to meet all the personalities, so I was a a bit disappointed to hear this.<br/><br/>The acting, however, by James McAvoy who played Kevin and all his personalities was outstanding. There were moments when I would actually believe that his different personalities were different people entirely. Furthermore, his ability to transform from one character to another, using not only his voice, but his facial expressions and body language, was inspiring. This was most evident to me near the end of the movie when Kevin, wearing a towel on his upper body, took the personality of Patricia. It was very subtle, but one could notice that when he took this form Patricia adjusted the towel to cover her left nipple that had been exposed. I found this to be both hilarious and clever at the same time. In addition, his ability to act as the personality of Dennis who was himself acting as another personality (Barry) was amazing.<br/><br/>As the movie went on and the existence of The Beast became more and more apparent, I started to see the movie differently. It felt less like a movie about a ""Psycho"" and more like a superhero/villain origin story. But it was far from a Marvel/DC movie. It was like one of those movies with ""superheroes"" that are more believable, Kickass (2010) is specifically what came to mind. Rather than being explained by a radioactive spider or gamma rays, it was explained using a known mental disorder. Even though I still don't see it as likely to occur in real life, I still love these kinds of movies.<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about the end (major spoiler alert).<br/><br/>I had just re-watched Unbreakable (2000) a couple weeks before seeing this movie. Now I have to say, although I didn't find Unbreakable as good as Split and, in fact, found it boring at times, I loved Mr. Glass' (or rather M. Night Shyamalan's) take on superheroes. How, although now superheroes have been altered using flashy colours and effects (not to mention CGI), the original superheroes were based on stories of people who had actually existed. Both of these movies represented that idea so well by using known medical conditions to explain their abilities (except in the case of David Dunn). It's almost as if M. Night is trying to challenge the current ""Marvel-istic"" view of superheroes. Like he is trying to wake us all up, as Mr. Glass wanted to do, to show us that superheroes do not need to be flashy and do not need to fly in order to be ""super"". M. Night may even be trying to start his own universe, similar to what Marvel and DC Comics have done. One that is pure and unaltered. Just as Mr. Glass would have wanted it."
"hnt_dnl","10","1","5","24 February 2020"," Shyamalan's best film
","After having seen SPLIT (2017) when it first premiered and Glass last year, I started to think about what M. Night Shyamalan's best film really was. I've always believed The Sixth Sense to be overrated. Awards aren't everything. Then there's Unbreakable, which I actually hadn't got around to seeing until after I watched Split (and anyone who's seen the ending knows why) and ignoring the fact that I saw Split first, I would definitely say that Unbreakable is Shyamalan's best film UNTIL Split. Everything in between is a mixed bag from the super slow Signs to the mildly entertaining The Visit. Then Glass comes out and while I really liked it and thought it had some great moments and a well-written story, it didn't quite hit the spot for me. So I re-watched and analyzed Split and concluded that this film is indeed the BEST of the famous director's works.<br/><br/>Set in Philly (where else?), Split tells the story of the disturbed Dennis, a man afflicted multiple personalities, 23 in fact, only some of which are essayed in this film. James McAvoy is utterly brilliant as the man of many layers. The way that he shuffles in and out of the various personas is jaw-dropping. When the movie came out, there was no doubt in my mind that McAvoy deserved Oscar consideration, which sadly he didn't get I think in large part of when the film premiered, too early in the year and the Academy had memory loss come voting time.<br/><br/>In the opening scene, Dennis kidnaps 3 teenage girls in a mall parking lot where they had just celebrated one of the girl's birthday party. The 3 girls are birthday girl Claire and her best friend Marcia (excellently played by Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula) and loner girl Casey (superbly performed by Anya Taylor-Joy, more on her later), who Claire only invited to her party out of pity as Casey is extremely introverted and rebellious with no friends. But it's Casey's very street smarts and personal experiences that helps the trio navigate through their predicament as the other 2 girls are more sheltered and clueless as to what to do.<br/><br/>During their capture, they begin to learn of Dennis' various personalities, which include a crafty British woman named Patricia as well as a 9-year old boy named Hedwig. While Dennis has OCD and needs everything neat and clean, Patricia is the mastermind of the personalities and acts as a kind of gatekeeper, and Hedwig is the unfiltered observer who gleefully tells the girls what Dennis is capable of.Again, McAvoy manages to shift back and forth among these fascinating characters without ever devolving into silliness. While there are moments of levity and humor, of course it's all rather sad and shocking.<br/><br/>Along the way, we find out that Dennis is actually being treated by a psychiatrist Dr. Karen Fletcher (wonderfully played by screen veteran Betty Buckley). Dr. Fletcher specializes in patients with DID and as the film progresses, tries to break through Dennis' walls and unwittingly begins to unravel his machinations. Meanwhile the female trio bang their heads together to escape Dennis' lair. Split is virtually all psychological drama as it is dialogue-heavy and is as much about tapping into what makes these characters tick as it about moving the plot forward to see if the girls can escape and Dennis will be apprehended.<br/><br/>In addition to McAvoy, I honestly believe that both Buckley and especially Taylor-Joy deserved Oscar love. As blown away as I was by McAvoy's work, I was equally enamored by Taylor-Joy's contribution to this piece. As iconic as McAvoy's characters are, I think Casey is just as memorable and the damaged, internal, survivor Casey is the true protagonist of this masterwork, while McAvoy's characters all function as pretty much villains that need to be defeated.<br/><br/>Despite the film's 2-hour length, Shyamalan fashions a very tight film with no wasted moments or unnecessary scenes. I've even seen some of the deleted scenes and think they would have fit well into the film. Some times, you can never have too much of a good thing and Split is more than good. Now that the decade has come to a close, I can honestly say it's in my Top 5 films of the 2010s. Shyamalan is officially back!"

"KirkFogg","4","1","5","7 May 2019"," Two hours and nine minutes that I'll never get back.
","It's really my own fault that I gave this a chance. I watched ""Unbreakable"" in theaters years ago and hadn't revisited it until this year. It held up. In fact, it's almost the best in a long chain of mostly terrible M. Night Shyamalan movies, second only to ""The Sixth Sense."" I thought ""Unbreakable"" was original and fun and exciting, but it was 19 years ago. Then ""Split"" came along, and it wasn't terrible in my opinion. It was far fetched and silly but McAvoy's acting was entertaining enough to carry the movie, though the ending was very silly and took away from the rest of the film. We've all been conditioned to expect a twist at the end of these movies, and I truly wasn't expecting ""Split"" to reveal that it was in the same universe as ""Unbreakable."" It was genuinely surprising, though still very silly. So I figured, ""okay I need to finish this trilogy to at least see the outcome."" I don't know if I've ever seen a movie that expected less of the audience. I truly felt like the film maker thought I was stupid, that's how heavy handed and miserable this movie was to me. There were so many instances in which I couldn't even believe the dialogue written for these characters. Half of the lines spoken had my head in my palm from the physical pain from cringing so hard. The plot line barely makes sense. The ""twist"" is something so obvious that I thought it was just a plot point the audience was supposed to already know. James McAvoy changes personalities so frequently at some points that it plays like the hilarious scene in ""The Mask"" in which Jim Carrey is playfully shot and accepts the academy award. Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis really phoned this one in, and I would believe they shot all of their scenes in one afternoon just after eating a hot sandwich and warm glass of milk. Even the ""Easter eggs"" are thrown in your face. You can't watch the movie without catching the ham fisted allusions to Marvel and DC in newspaper headlines, or Shyamalan's ridiculous cameo. All in all, I love bad D class movies, but this wasn't even ""so bad it's good."" It was just terrible.<br/><br/>PS - They felt it necessary to include three shots of James McAvoy (The Beast) running across a lawn on all fours like a rhino, but it only served to slow his running pace and look absolutely ridiculous. I mean, my mouth was agape at that point. What were they thinking?"

He is supposed to be a banned personality because he is bad for liking to watch young girls dance naked...plot spoiler...it never happens. Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) is different from the other two girls captured. She is not part of the clique. We see her childhood through flashbacks, setting her up for the ""final girl."" The film is NOT a tie the girls up rip their blouse off type of adventure...although there are some token bra and pantie shots. It is a psychological thriller that looks at two ""damaged"" personalities.

","""Split"" is an intensely realized thriller that pulls the rug out from under you every time you think you have it pegged as competent genre fare.

Equally credible in SPLIT's success is James McAvoy, who is let loose in a multifaceted, titular-phenomenon of screen acting that will likely go down as his best moment. Relative newcomer Anya Taylor- Joy (terrific in last year's THE WITCH) holds her own in yet another terrific, mature turn.<br/><br/>But the story of the hour is M.

This is not a movie to watch alone on a dark night.<br/><br/>The three female victims are young nubile and spend most of the movie running around in their underwear crying panting and displaying all the usual attributes of terrified teens.<br/><br/>The wise middle aged psychologist is sweet and motherly and adds a nice contrast to the beastly main character.

"pranther","7","1","6","18 May 2017"," Very good indeed
","So the plot dives right in with McAvoy's character kidnapping the girls within the first 5 minutes of the movie. Shyamalan then proceeds to establish the premise of the movie, furthering the plot by explaining the personality and past of Anya Taylor-Joy's protagonist role as Casey Cooke. He also explores McAvoy's antagonist character through his relationship with a psychiatrist and the therapy sessions they share. The movie builds to an intense crescendo with a face off at the end between Casey Cooke and the Beast with a mild twist of sorts. However the end product is more mild than anything else. It lacks the spice of M.Night's works from the early 2000s and although I enjoyed most of the film thoroughly,the ending left my appetite unsatisfied. There was a lens of irritating vagueness or obscurity over the ending which left me feeling a little unhappy. Further plot development would've been interesting, although I have no doubt that at least a few great scenes were probably discarded in the editing room. McAvoy and Taylor-Joy do a fantastic job playing their respective characters. McAvoy in particular managed to capture the demeanour and subtle differences between all of the different personalities with great detail. As always, with M.Night movies, brilliant cinematography, great background music and the usual twist are all to be expected. All in all, as a total package, the movie is quite good and definitely worth a watch."
"raa-55017","7","1","6","14 May 2017"," Surprising
","M. Night Shymalan was said to have lost his special filmmaking touch. The famous director/screenwriter behind treasures like Signs, The Sixth Sense, and Unbroken destroyed his own career after having recently pumped out The Happening and After Earth, two movies classified as flops and atrocities in so many eyes. However, with his most recent film, Split, Shymalan has resurrected himself back into his former golden days of above-average filmmaking and has left the sour taste of The Last Airbender behind. Split revolves around Kevin Crumb, played brilliantly by James McAvoy, who suffers from a split-personality disorder and has twenty-three distinct personalities. One of Kevin's personalities kidnaps three teenage girls and keeps them hostage inside a locked area of his home. The film continuously jumps back and forth between the girls attempting to escape and Kevin confronting his therapist, Dr. Fletcher, to try and keep his disorder under control. Split is a unique, complex movie that isn't so much of a horror movie but more of a psychological thriller. Shymalan doesn't take the film too seriously, which works to his advantage as there are lots of funny moments involving the different personalities of Kevin's. Split also never leaves you bored because it constantly introduces new situations and information that keep you interested as the girls attempt to escape Kevin's house. Kevin Crumb's multiple personalities all feel distinct and creepy at times, expertly including eerie conversations that Kevin would carry on with himself and his own personalities. One of the downsides, unfortunately, that I experienced with Split were the constant flashbacks that were shown throughout the movie involving the main character's past as a toddler. The flashbacks came across as very distracting and it felt as if they kept interrupting and bringing you out of the rather well-written plot. Split, aided by one of the best performances of James McAvoy's career, is nothing short of a unique success that definitely brings M. Night Shymalan back into the movie business"
"javi-y-se-acabo","9","1","6","14 May 2017"," Shyamalan & McAvoy Deliver A Great Movie And Split (Pun Intended) The Public
","M. Night Shyamalan is one of those director that no matter what they do, they will have both many lovers and many haters, and that's because they usually divide the public with their style of film-making and storytelling. Since The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan has been tied to his first movie and compared with that, and that hasn't been a good thing many times. But in here he is able to reinvent himself and tells a tense story full of tension and suspense, and he does it very well.<br/><br/>The movie tells us the story of three young girls who are kidnapped by a man with split personalities (James McAvoy). And I stop here, because the less you know about this movie, the more enjoyable it is. <br/><br/>First of all I have to say that we probably are in front of one of the best performances of 2017 by the amazing James McAvoy. His ability to portray all this different personalities and making them well recognizable one of each other it's truly an achievement. And he gets that without overacting or anything like that, he just puts a different part of his personality into it so just with watching him walk or with his face gestures you can see which personality is on screen. A special mention also to Anya Taylor Joy, who was unknown to me until now and what a discover. She also makes a great performance and has a very good chemistry with McAvoy in the scenes they share together. They both are the true power of the film, because without them the probably would have been worse. That's probably because they're most of the time in screen. The psychologist was only used to help us to understand the illness of James McAvoy and the two other girls didn't got enough screen time to be useful.<br/><br/>Well not only the acting of this two but also the ability of Shyamalan of filming the scenes getting you really into the action, with first planes and the moving camera work he is used to, which adds another layer into this amazing movie. Also the score by West Dylan Thordson creates a very dark atmosphere which helps the movie to keep going, so you won't miss James Newton Howard in here, the usual composer of the Shyamalan movie, but even if so, you would get to hear something of him. I won't spoil it but it's worth the watch for the full movie.<br/><br/>And here is the last thing I have to add, the final third act of the movie is truly the thing that will leave you with these good taste when you finish it.<br/><br/>I recommend you to watch it, knowing nothing about it and trying to enjoy the best you can. It looks like Shyamaln is back and won't go for a long time (I hope)."

The movie is OK, and the quality of it is not the thing I want to discuss here.<br/><br/>What I do want to discuss is: are the themes and premises behind this movie borrowed from Frank Herbert? And how come no one talks about this?<br/><br/>It's funny, because:<br/><br/>1) Leto Atreides II, mentally superior, prescient ""prince of Dune"" was also ""a split personality"", so to say. He had access to all of his ancestors' memories. In Dune series, there is always a danger with prescient people that they may become an Abomination, meaning that one of these ancestors (especially an evil one) may take a hold of a person's consciousness permanently, subjugating all other personalities. In ""Split"" this would be similar to Denis, Patricia and the monstrous 24th personality - the Beast.<br/><br/>2) The Beast at the end of the movie becomes a superhuman. He has an impenetrable skin, runs fast and can climb walls. Guess what Leto can do after his union with sand-trouts of Arrakis?

","Split is one of those movies where I am kicking myself for not watching earlier. Completely a good movie. But there is a reason I am giving it an 8 out of 10. I will get to that.<br/><br/>Synopsis: When three girls are kidnapped by a man with 23 different personalities, they have to work out which of those personalities will help them escape and which of those personalities will try to stop them. Starring: James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy Director: M. Night Shyamalan<br/><br/>So, I am sticking with everyone else on this matter, M. Night has come back to his roots, a la Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. It seemed he really took his time with this one instead of rushing it. It seemed he did that a lot with the other movies outside of this one and the two I mentioned.<br/><br/>For James McAvoy he was phenomenal in this role. Was he the right choice for the role? We may never know how Joaquin Phoenix would have done in the first place. But McAvoy did an outstanding job in this show. That's not saying the other actors didn't do bad. I just kind of wish Anya Taylor-Joy's character wasn't so self-contained in the movie. And she isn't the reason I gave it an eight.<br/><br/>Onto that problem. Most of you know there is a twist to the end of the movie. How can a Shyamalan movie not have one? Well, much like The Sixth Sense was ruined for me by someone blurting the ending, so was this movie. Don't worry, I'm not going to ruin this movie for you. Chances are you already know the twist.<br/><br/>With the internet, the end of this movie was ruined for me a couple of days after the movie came out. I am firm believer a twist should never be ruined. Every time I see something Walking Dead related I scroll past as fast as I can. By no fault of the movie, because I was anticipating too much, I had to lower my rating. I hated doing that.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Watch, watch, watch this movie. If you do anything else this weekend it should be to watch this movie. It is such a good movie. And don't worry about the twist at the end, it only last a second. Enjoy.<br/><br/>Rating: 8 out of 10<br/><br/>That's it for me folks."

While the girls are trying to find a way to escape the kidnapper is on the verge of releasing a 24th and even more dangerous personality. This is a movie that is just flat out tense and good. The movie isn't straight horror as much as psychological and disturbing. The movie itself is almost a must see, but the real reason to watch is for McAvoy's performance. It's one of the best ever put on film. Being a Shyamalan movie I was trying to predict the crazy twist ending that he is known for, and of all my guesses I wasn't even close.

Seriously, that was his problem all this time (for the most part); he just kept trying to give us a brainy movie with some kind of twist at the end.

","McAvoy knocked it out of the park, amazing acting that would be difficult to find a better candidate. The film builds slowly but everything comes together beautifully on climax. There are familiar elements you would expect from Shyamalan, including the slow sliding cams leading to jumps. Believe me, some of these moments are going to punch you right in the gut. There is some unexpectedly graphic material for PG-13, but it's tastefully done and tied well to the horror atmosphere. I wouldn't classify this movie as horror, more like a thriller fighting to be something more sinister. My only real complaint is not enough substance in light of all the character development. I would say that a lot of users writing reviews are going overboard with the ""insulting"" young women trapped by the antagonist. To be fair, they are teenagers being kidnapped. It's understandable how emotions could run high and that fear would have an effect with decision making, especially being so young. It's all put together well and presented on a deliciously dark palate. Watch post credits for a treat, you don't wanna miss it."

We actually get to know and recognize the varied faces and personalities which make up his persona and to dread the emergence of the worst of the hidden monsters who lurks deep inside him. The story beyond that is well-done with an outstanding nod and tie in to another related work at the end which was priceless. I can definitely say this this is worth a watch. It also nicely balances the line between horror and thriller only becoming more apparent with its concluding moments. Welcome back Mr. Shyamalan.

"tomgillespie2002","5","1","8","5 May 2017"," A routine thriller elevated by the outstanding James McAvoy
","To say that the output of writer/director M. Night Shyamalan has been on a steady decline since his hit debut The Sixth Sense in 1999 would be a little bit of an understatement. While The Sixth Sense and his next feature Unbreakable (2000) had people announcing him as the next Steven Spielberg, the likes of Lady in the Water (2006) and, especially, The Happening (2008) left audiences scratching their heads at how this once-wunderkind could become such an absolute laughing stock. Each of his subsequent movies were inevitably built-up as the one in which Shyamalan would re-discover his form, only for them to receive a panning commercially and critically. However, it would seem that Shyamalan has finally located a smidgen of the talent teased in his early works with Split, a routine kidnapped-girls-in-peril horror elevated by an outstanding central performance.<br/><br/>Friends Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula), along with 'weird' outsider Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), are kidnapped in brought daylight by a stern-looking bespectacled man. They are locked in a windowless room by their captor, seemingly without any hope of escape. The girls soon to become puzzled by their abductor, who is a buttoned-up OCD-sufferer one minute, and speaking warmly while dressed in women's clothes the next. He also appears to them as a lisping, goofy 9 year old boy, and through the man's psychiatrist Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), we learn that the man, whose real name is Kevin, suffers from dissociative identity disorder (DID), and is harbouring 23 different personalities. He appears to Fletcher as Barry, but the doctor suspects that new personalities have emerged as dominant and that they putting the pieces in place for the arrival of a mysterious 24th personality, known as The Beast.<br/><br/>There is a fundamental issue with the characters of Split, and it's that the only one who truly matters is James McAvoy's Kevin, and the many personalities associated with him. Everyone else is reduced to either skimpily-clad horror-bait or exposition tool. The one exception is Casey, whose troubled background could mean that she shares more in common with her captor than we initially realise, but the film relies too heavily on lingering close-ups and clunky flashbacks to make any real impact. The other girls are only there to frustrate the audience with their terrible escape plans and inexplicably lose their clothing. Split is far more interesting when away from the kidnap plot and delving into the film's speculation on the potential of DID sufferers. Fletcher believes that different personalities can have different physical ailments, for example one could be paraplegic and the other able to run great distances, and theorises that they could even possess untapped powers. It's just a shame that her character is designed to do little more than explain this to us.<br/><br/>Yet while all the Shyamalan tics we've come to know and hate are present and annoying - such as his obligatory cameo and nails-down- a-blackboard dialogue spoken in the real world by nobody ever - Split really comes alive when McAvoy is on screen. He is scary, charming and funny, often all at once. In one scene, he dances around a character to pumping techno music, and this could be viewed as a suitable metaphor for how McAvoy puts his supporting cast to shame. This being Shyamalan, there is the inevitable twist ending, although it is not one that you could possibly guess. Just when I was at the point of thinking that he had gone and taken a story of potential and ran way too far with it, the final scene made me completely re-evaluate the entire movie. Don't get me wrong, it's nothing particularly clever, but it is a nice little bit of fan- service that helps put the movie into perspective and, I admit, left me giddy. Shyamalan is not ""back to his best"", and I think it's quite clear he never will be, but Split has at least got me somewhat excited for his next film. He'll never be forgiven for The Happening though."

The movie captures your attention easily and it's intriguing from the start.<br/><br/>TIP: If you are interested what the last scene with Bruce Willis meant, read about the relation to the movie ""Unbreakeable"" (2000) from the same writer and director of ""Split"" - M. Night Shyamalan. Is there a sequel to be expected? I don't know about you, but I really hope so!"
"blueplaza","6","1","8","26 March 2017"," A psychologically perplexing film with as many shortcomings as triumphs
","M. Night Shyamalan lost my respect as a director after he butchered The Last Airbender, as well as a few other films which never should have been green-lit. Somehow though, he has managed to put together a somewhat engaging film with Split. Supported almost entirely by the performance(s) of James McAvoy, Split engages the audience with an interesting view of multiple personality disorder. Kevin - the main character - only receives a few minutes in the lime light near the end of the film but the entire film, including the emergence of the beast, is entirely because of Kevin's need to protected. While the film likely resonates with many viewers who have likely also been hurt in life, the plot holes others have noted such as ""why didn't the girls work together to escape?"" ""Why didn't the psychologist notify the police or at least recognize the threat sooner?"", etc. While all valid questions that do in fact take away from the film, overall Split does a good job of utilizing appropriate lighting, and other visual-audio tools to convey the fear and confusion all the characters including Kevin faced. I give a 6 instead of a 7 or above because of blatantly ignored plot holes in an attempt to make the movie for ""suspenseful""."

","I dread M Knight movies anymore, as I have the opinion the scripts always feel as if they were written by a thirteen year old kid. While that still holds true for me (super powers, vengeful trees, space aliens thwarted by h20 etc.) I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this movie. Despite the stretch of imagination required for some plot points in this movie (not as far reaching as some others in the past have been) I did legitimately like the movie, and I believe it was because of McAvoy's immense talent.<br/><br/>James McAvoy could easily have slipped into a campy portrayal that had a strong potential in this script. He did not. I felt he was believable, and placed a superb premium on professional effort that was apparent to the viewer from the beginning.<br/><br/>Any other actor, and I do not believe this movie would have worked. <br/><br/>If you, like me, would have passed on another M Knight foray... rethink that choice and give this movie a try. I do not think you will regret it (despite the ending... I was satisfied with the stories ending and not the (I feel) tacked on final scene)."

","After The Village, The Happening, The Visit, and other failures, finally M. Night Shyamalan is back with a great film that make you feel terrified, excited, intrigued and bunch of other mix feelings. He wrote an amazing story about a guy with a deranged mind, a mind that makes place for 24 different people, and he gave that responsibility to James McAvoy, and he really nailed that role. Every person he plays does it with such grace, they look so masterfully researched characters, every detail in the walking, moving, speaking, looking, just everything it's amazing, i really think he deserves some kind of acting award because if it's not easy to enter the mind of another person (speaking with experience as a fellow actor), imagine entering the mind of a split personality guy, that's award season deserving. <br/><br/>Anya Taylor Joy also gives a great interpretation. I have a few complains but not to big to make the movie suck. <br/><br/>I could really see the movie again and maybe a third time, go see it you won't waste your time.

","An interesting concept and a great atmosphere brings M.

Its far from a perfect film, especially because I always felt they could have made more out of the story. What makes it really good is the ending, the final twist which gives the film a totally different view and makes it much better because it doesn't stay as a stand alone film. As a stand alone film it would have left me way more bland and I would have existed the film with a ""oh well, nice but yeah whatever"". Acting wise it shows a really outstanding performance by James McAvoy. He was in total control of most of his different personalities (just acting wise, obviously not character wise) and has some really intense moments. Anya Taylor-Joy also returns with a very solid performance. She indeed is a very promising actress. Betty Buckley had a great character but I felt she didn't put her teeth into it enough she was fine yeah but the role had more potential than what she used. She probably thought she was acting in a C-horror movie or parody. At least it felt like that at times. This surely marks the return of Shyamalan (I already liked ""The Visit"" tho) and I look forward what future films he has inside him and especially the announced sequel."

","Split is a very interesting movie. Even though some actors certainly show more experience in the business than others, all of them intertwine very smoothly to create an atmosphere of tension and fear. The story focuses on a man with multiple personalities and 3 girls that he kidnaps and holds hostage. Even though his intentions for them aren't revealed until much later in the movie, the film successfully holds the viewers attention by exploring the backstory of the man and following the attempted escape of the girls. The movie actually focuses on two stories at once; the life of the main teenage character, Casey, and the life of the man. The cinematography shines in conveying the atmosphere and overall mood of the situation. The camera rarely does jump cuts, and instead opts to focus on characters as the scene builds up tension towards an action. My only true gripes with the film are with some of it's characters. James McAvoy's character as the man steals the show and separates itself from the rest of the case, with Anya Taylor-Joy's character as a close second. The other two girls pale in comparison and the viewer will quickly fade them to the background. Some of the other characters range from decent performance, to lackluster. In conclusion, I can safely recommend Split as a rental. Even though it isn't a perfect film, it sure is a gripping one."

","Three girls, among them two popular ones and one social awkward one, are kidnapped by some guy and put in a room in a cellar. He's a clean-freak. Then the same guy shows up but this time with the personality of a little boy, at another time with the personality of a strict woman. We also see him as he visits his therapist with the personality of a fashion designer.<br/><br/>The girls try to escape so the guy separates them. The socially awkward girl, Casey, turns out to be the leader. In flashbacks we learn that her dad and uncle were hunters and for some reason took her hunting and taught her when she was very little. The uncle also apparently abused her physically and sexually.<br/><br/>There are some more visits to the therapist, who can tell something is going on because she gets several emails from the guy requesting emergency meetings, but the fashion designer who shows up claims nothing is going on. Apparently one of these personalities had an issue with girls in underwear and by now the three girls are almost in underwear.<br/><br/>The girls continue to meet with the various personalities who start warning about the coming of ""the beast."" The therapist, too, realizes she isn't really in the presence of the fashion designer but in the presence of the kidnapper/strict guy, who also starts announcing the coming of the beast.<br/><br/>The girls start again working on their escape, the therapist visits the guy's lair, and around this time the beast arrives. We also learn the fate of the girls.<br/><br/>Split, as the trailer revealed is obviously about a guy with dissociative identity disorder with more than 20 personalities. We only meet a couple of them. While we learn with the girls what is going on the movie is very exciting. Once we know what is happening, the movie loses quite a bit of steam. The announcement of the arrival of the beast isn't nearly as effective as it should be. It reminded me a bit of the more powerful Red Dragon, which benefited from a process of transformation as opposed to the sudden arrival of the beast.<br/><br/>More interesting are the therapy sessions which I take it are based on science. The psychiatrist refers to one personality coming to the fore as being ""in the light."" Her thinking through the situation and figuring things out is fascinating. She also offers interesting advice to Casey on how to take control of the situation if things go out of hand.<br/><br/>But so what? What do make of all this? The patient/kidnapper announces the beast in a Nietzschean framework of the superman. Interestingly, the psychiatrist also wonders whether a pathology such DID should be understood as potential and not just disability. Split goes beyond just the ""super"" in superman and considers the often neglected flipside, in this case, the pain and suffering required to achieve transcendence. On the one hand we have then the usual and tired 'you can be anything you set your mind- message. Oddly enough it results nevertheless in nothing but standard establishment puppets who won't dare question conventional wisdom and who put money and work ahead of everything else, including life. But here the beast also emphasizes vulnerability and weaknesses, or perhaps even the superman in the service of the weak. The setting of this movie beneath a zoo is also suggestive.<br/><br/>Split doesn't quite deliver the excitement it promises but does offer some subtle ideas."

But the story was a bit slow at the beginning, with unnecessary scenes and plot holes. For instance how did ""Kevin"" or one of his personalities manage to email the doctor when apparently there wasn't internet service in the basement. Secondly, why didn't the Doctor contact police and why did she go alone to Kevin's hideout? As for the ending, I'm still not sure what to make of it. It didn't deliver the big TWIST like I was expecting. I agree with others, it lacked closure.

"BillSims28","7","1","8","14 February 2017"," Interesting; McAvoy Stupendous; Sometimes Unremarkable
","Heralded by many as a return to form for polarising director M. Night Shyamalan, Split tells the fascinating story of a man, played by an astounding James McAvoy, who has 23 completely distinct personalities - each with different ages, genders, and characteristics - fighting for control of his body. Some of these personalities conspire to kidnap three teenage girls for mysterious and nefarious purposes, making a film which is as much a psychological abduction thriller as it is a creepy Shyamalan horror as it is a character study of McAvoy's Kevin and his split personalities. <br/><br/>Split has received a divided response, with many citing controversy around its seemingly ham-fisted portrayal of mental illness. However, upon watching the film, it soon becomes clear that this is not a scaremongering horror story of the mentally ill who could be living among us, but instead a low-key sci-fi much like Shyamalan's 2000 film Unbreakable, with McAvoy's condition being treated as more of a supernatural ability. It ultimately translates into a film which, without the hype surrounding its release, would be seen as a largely unremarkable if interestingly watchable horror-thriller piece. <br/><br/>The main draw of the guild is undoubtedly James McAvoy. In a performance which tops not only his already glittering career, but also many of the best performances of 2016. It is even Oscar-worthy, not that that is necessarily a good indicator of quality. It is a fantastic mark of the man's talents under the role's stress, given the frequency with which he has to switch between hugely varied parts. His versatility makes it akin to seeing several different actors on screen, but it is all him. He manages to carry the entire film on his shoulders whilst simultaneously stealing each of his scenes, providing an endless source of massively interesting characters, creating sympathy for the character, and even sprinkling some black comedy into the mix. A near flawless performance overall. <br/><br/>The rest of the film does not reach quite the same heights but is nevertheless decent and worth watching. The horror elements are handled very well, without too many jump scares, and although it is not designed to frighten for the most part, it certainly succeeds at several times as tensions mount, mysteries unfold, and we find out more about Kevin and Casey, the most-developed of the abductees. <br/><br/>There are certainly other portions of the film which are highly commendable: the two central characters are well fleshed-out (though some of Casey's backstory feels at times somewhat unnecessary and tacked-on), for example. McAvoy performs with a well-judged moral greyness that leaves you rooting for both Kevin and Casey, whilst the story makes for an interesting tale that continues to surprise and entertain. <br/><br/>However, ultimately too much of the film is just rote and unoriginal. Admittedly it's hard in the current cinematic climate to make anything original but certain parts of Split feel too uninspired and lazy, especially some of the plot points and dialogue - notably, discussions of Kevin's ""abilities"" sometimes serve to induce a small eye-roll. Finally, it sometimes feels far too self- indulgent on Shyamalan's part. Ignoring his jarring obligatory cameo, there is a certain reveal which, without spoiling anything, will be obvious to any Shyamalan fan, that just feels far too dumb and unnecessary, though it could be interesting to develop if there is a sequel. <br/><br/>This doesn't make it a bad film - far from it. It's definitely worth watching, though maybe doesn't warrant the level of debate it has garnered. Watch Split for the unmissable McAvoy performance, and try not to expect anything too mind-blowing, and you'll probably enjoy. A solid 72/100."
"burlesonjesse5","8","1","8","13 February 2017"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Spilt
","M. Night Shyamalan directed The Sixth Sense. To this day, that film still creeps me the heck out. It has taken seventeen years for Night to make my psyche go all frazzled again. Hence, I give you 2016's Split (my latest review). <br/><br/>Now the oddest thing about Split, is that it doesn't feel like India's favorite son was even behind the camera. Shyamalan relies on the personalities of other directors (just like Split's main lead actor, ha). And the only thing similar is that his flick takes place in Philadelphia (Shyamalan's hometown and go-to setting). Was there some Dan Trachtenberg or Sam Raimi influence involved? Oh for sure. Nevertheless, Split is traumatizing, upsetting, and unsettling. M. Night uses a handful of close-ups, effective flashbacks, and the absence of a blatant surprise twist to enhance his vision. Reluctantly, he gives his characters a few moments of screen time to breathe. Then, his film puts them through torrid, psychological hell. <br/><br/>Split isn't ghostly scary or even demon scary. It's more on the tripped out, cognitive tip. Without a happy ending or any kind of loosening resolve, this film caused me to leave the theater shaken. Heck, my pulse felt totally out of order. Granted, I'm not giving Split a favorable rating for its entertainment value. I recommending it for how it affected me and how it gave me a corresponding feeling when I saw 2014's Tusk. Hopelessness, raw fear, despair, gnawing demoralization. M. Night is back. Yup, he's back with a spurred vengeance baby! <br/><br/>Anyway, Split is about a messed up individual, a stifling son of a bitch. Kevin Wendell Crumb (played by James McAvoy) is said individual and he has 23 personalities (""23"" is a screwed up number to begin with). He kidnaps three young females and holds them captive below the famed, Philadelphia, PA Zoo. In a candid interview, McAvoy said that he only channeled 9 of the 23 weirdos throughout Split's 117-minute running time. No matter. His performance here is towering and startlingly good. You forget that a trouper is actually inhabiting this role. For the most part, you hold on to the fact that this is a real fracked person. As for McAvoy's co-stars (Anna Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, Jessica Sula), well they convey a realistic level of heightened distress. Douglas Aibel's casting of these young, unknown thespians is right on. I would put them in another horror conundrum any day. Believe it.<br/><br/>Overall, Split with its claustrophobia, its kind of movement for a sequel, and its sense of sunlight absence, is destined to become a classic. It's M. Night Shyamalan's way of giving the middle finger to all the critics who have ribbed him over the past 10-12 years. Oh and by the way, look for the Bruce Willis cameo at the end. Dang, it's been awhile since I've seen old Brucie in an actual, mainstream movie. Also, be on the lookout for Betty Buckley as Crumb's sympathetic psychologist. She was Miss Collins from 1976's infamous Carrie. Welcome back Betty. Rating: 3 and a half stars."

In addition, I would like emphasize full appreciation for credo of this movie, which is electrifying.<br/><br/>And now main disappointment - plot. Dialogs between patient and psychiatrist are cliché, mostly unbelievable, somehow irritating, because both characters doesn't seem to be as naive as they are presented. There is also a place for a disaster: idea for development of main character is absolutely amazing and... poorly executed. <br/><br/>Lastly, something which doesn't affect my rating, but I feel uneasy about: cameo with Bruce Willis felt here like a joke at the end of horror, like gore scene at the end of comedy."

"artmania90","6","1","8","1 February 2017"," With any luck this tour-de-force will get Oscar buzz for McAvoy a year from now
","It shouldn't come as a surprise that M Night Shyamalan continues to make films. Regardless of critical opinion, he somehow manages to build an impressive box office draw no matter how unimpressive his films turn out to be. In 1999 when he debuted with 'The Sixth Sense' there were people who said he would be the next Steven Spielberg. Looking back at that idea, there have got to be some pretty significant people rolling over in their graves to think that such a comparison was ever made. Regardless of my thoughts, and regardless of past works, it must be said that 'Split,' as silly as it is, still works on many levels as an intriguing thriller.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the kidnap of 3 girls (Haley Lu Richardson, Jessica Sula, and Anya Taylor-Joy) from a parking lot in broad daylight. When they wake up in a windowless room, they soon begin to see the danger of their situation. Not only are they being held by a man (James McAvoy) with vague intentions, but he displays one of many personalities; some helpful and some dangerous. The chances of escape are slim.<br/><br/>Right away, we have a flawed concept. We identify the hero of the story, the shy girl named Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy, who also appeared in 'The Witch' earlier in the year). Through endless flashbacks we see her tortured childhood, scene after scene of a small girl and her deranged uncle. Shyamalan attempts to draw sympathy with Casey and leaves the other two girls as little more than props with no clear character or motivation. Why have 3 girls at all? Kevin, as we learn the real kidnapper's name is, is in constant communication with his psychiatrist Dr Karen Fletcher who treats his split-personality disorder as though she is diagnosing a witch in the 16th Century.<br/><br/>There's a novelty that comes with the film and Kevin's personalities, and it's with a surprising amount of conviction that McAvoy pulls off a difficult task: making us believe him regardless of the silly script and silly words they speak. We learn he has 23 personalities (ranging from a sort of kinky nun named Patricia to a small boy named Hedwig) that come in and out and communicate to the kidnapped girls through locked door. Hedwig is a fan of Kanye West and is curious about kissing girls. Another personality named Dennis has obsessive-compulsive disorder and keeps a close eye on the cleanliness of the bathroom.<br/><br/>Yes it's Shyamalan so there is a twist of sorts. Whether or not you buy the ending is up to you. It comes in the final moments of the movie as patrons of a diner watch the news and react to the idea of a man living with multiple personalities. In the theater I saw it, most people didn't understand what happened. I don't blame them. The twist requires an audience's prior knowledge and history of the director's films. It's a preposterous setup and makes little sense in the context of the film, and yet die-hard fans will say they are now excited to see what M Night Shyamalan does next. That's a twist in itself.<br/><br/>I can only praise the film for McAvoy's performance, which is unbelievably clever and worked out. The movie overall is a rough cut of something that could have been much more effective, perhaps with a different director or a tighter screenplay. When we see McAvoy on screen, it's almost makes up for all the other issues. When he's absent, the story falls apart. If that's not great acting I don't know what is."

I have not seen many of his Classic films but i have heard a ton about all his movies and their ""twists"". I was enthralled by this movie from start to finish. Shyamalan captured this movie in a brilliant way that allowed his audience to delve in the depths of the movie and understand with their own minds what is really going on. there are exposition scenes throughout but none so heavy that weigh the movie down and bore you. I was very interested in the DID concept of the movie and also the therapists stand on DID and how it plays into the movies end. The movie also had some great humor that did not drain from the mood at all. one moment you could be laughing and then at the next, the very thing you were laughing at suddenly is haunting.

As for the twist, I did not find it amazing and i felt like their was no other way for the movie to go but i still enjoyed it none the less.<br/><br/>This movie is captured beautifully and you can definitely feel the grittiness of the thriller in many shots. beautiful camera work.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Number 1, if you have no desire to see the movie then just go see it for the sake of McAvoy. He is phenomenal in every second that he is on the screen. His ability to give life to these personalities is amazing especially because each one of his personalities that makes it on screen appears to be their own BEING. i found myself trying to decipher which personality it was and after the first half of the movie knowing clearly which person he was. even with his scenes where he talks to himself it feels like there honestly are multiple people having a conversation and he doesn't look weird doing it. His performance is so believable and i loved every personality that was on screen. Anya Taylor-Joy was also very into her character and always left me satisfied with her character. her character ark was of much interest to me as well and did not disappoint.<br/><br/>Only thing i did not enjoy about the movie was i felt that the other two girls that were kidnapped were extremely annoying but besides that the movie is visually great, acting is top notch, direction is once again back on top from his streak of not so enjoyable movies.Shyamalan is back and it looks like he is coming with a storm.

You get no special effects, no splatter-horror elements and surely no boo frights.<br/><br/>The film easily ranks to a 7 for what it is, but instead we have an outstanding performance from the leading actor so 8/10 from me."

","I was very excited for this film after hearing how spectacular James Mcavoy's performance of different personality. And he certainly didn't disappoint. He did a perfect job on signifying when another person had possessed him with simply facial expression which gave a genuine creepy atmosphere to the film that was terrifying. The film consisted of many disturbing scenes that shocked me and many others in the theaters. The story was laid out with the villain go to and forth from seeing a therapist and the main plot of abducting the girls. These two parts are both smartly merged together slowly to create brilliant suspense towards the finale which left my very tensed up.<br/><br/>The film was slow,but this wasn't negative as it was still very interesting and good movie to get your brain working around a very interesting concept. Although the finale was incredibly scary and well executed, the twist just flunked completely and didn't feel like it matched with theme of the story. The build up and the majority of the film was really enjoyable but the ending was heavily disappointing."
"aygocrazy","Null","1","8","22 January 2017"," Excellent movie, but a very unconvincing main actor
","The story is quite enjoyable. All female actresses showed some very convincing acting, especially Anya Taylor-Joy. Unfortunately, James McAvoy was the worst part of the movie. He did over-acting up to the point that it became annoying. He tried way too hard to portray the roles. The way he tried to be Hedwig and Barry was too much over-acting and looked very fake. James McAvoy has no clue how to act like a 9 year old child that Hedwig was supposed to be. He does it too stereotypical and too over-the-top. The female roles in the movie had to compensate for the lack of acting talent of James McAvoy. Luckily, the actresses were so good that it ended up being a good movie. The story wasn't the problem, because it was good. The main problem was the choice to cast a very unskilled actor, James McAvoy. His bad acting ruined the movie, but the excellent story and good actresses made it worth watching."
"dextercoshea","6","1","9","17 April 2017"," A confused dynamic carried by a prominent McAvoy performance.
","Split lead me to believe that M. Night Shyamalan was trying to please too many audiences resulting in a confused dynamic. Aside from the plethora of Horror/Thriller clichés, there were moments where Split took a darker and more intriguing turn. However these moments were not frequent or embedded enough to change the dynamic of the film as a whole. The initial mysterious nature of certain characters in Split was alluring, however the desire to know more about these characters faded the more I got to know them. McAvoy's prominent performance, or should I say, performances, carried this film."
"Naive-fox","5","1","9","6 April 2017"," The long way back
","Shyamalan can't find his way back home. The slow burning thriller formula that gave him success with gems such us ""The sixth sense"" or ""Signs"" is lost in the tides of a distant past, tides that have made the Indian director drift away into a sea of mediocrity.<br/><br/>In ""Split"" he tries to bring back some of those traits that defined his early works. He reaches for a clever horror thriller, but all his efforts produce nothing but an average ""psycho kidnaps girls"" movie with delusions of greatness. What promised to be a thoughtful journey through human mind finally develops into a watered-down showcase of Kevin's multiple personalities, having barely two of them some impact on the story.<br/><br/>Kudos to James McAvoy for single handedly keeping afloat a movie that tries so hard to sink. His outstanding performance might be the only thing keeping viewers in their seats until the film's finale, which makes as little sense as the erratic and incoherent behavior of the three girls during the whole kidnapping. Betty Buckley manages to deliver a satisfactory portrait of Dr. Karen Fletcher amongst a very little cast where the rest of the actors (and specially actresses) do a terrible job.<br/><br/>It may well be time for Shyamalan to find the way to travel the long way back he seems to have started with ""Split"", or give a shot to something completely new, but this generic approach on horror clichés (like in this film or ""The Visit"") won't satisfy his fans."

","Split is a navigable delirium. To get on it you have to let yourself go and be willing to abandon any previous expectation in order to buy what the movie is proposing. The first guide to navigate it is the magnificent photography, which will send us in and confine us in the characters' physical and psychological spaces, patiently leading us to Split's grand achievement: its details and subtleties. These are the great strokes of the movie, its rhythm and genius: a concert which compels us to descend based in contrapuntal gestural acting; impeccable and multicolored diction from all the characters; a tightened dark and narrow chromatic palette which restrains us up in our own personal isolation. A multitude of gestures and hints meandering a new horror story, that will only be believable if it sides with our own ability to imagine or with our own personal tile of craziness."

","It's finally happened. M Night Shyamalan has returned to form after being dismissed as a has-been,following several mistakes like After Earth,The Last Airbender and The Happening. He's made an incredibly enjoyable thriller with a very limited budget. James McAvoy is fascinating in a tour-de-force performance,bringing to life a character with 23 distinct personalities,and a soon-to-be-unleashed 24th. The film has a very good tone and flow,with nail-biting tension that really gives us a throwback to the start of Shyamalan's career. I hope he keeps it up in his next film too. He's never been as good with the ending as he has with the incredible setup,and this one suffers from that too,but in the end,there are a lot of positive factors that make thus a memorable experience. The uncredited cameo at the very end is jaw-dropping,and highlights the possibility of a sequel. I can't help but think that film could be a good one too. Welcome back Mr. Shyamalan."
"CheshireCatsGrin","6","1","9","25 February 2017"," Very Disappointed
","Not a fan of The director since Unbreakable. It was slightly above average but no whee near the quality of The Sixth Sense. I don't know why I keep watching his movies, probably hoping one will be the same extraordinary quality. With all the pre-release buzz I thought this was finally that movie. <br/><br/>I was so disappointed. I rated it slightly lower than Unbreakable. I don't know exactly where it where it went off the rails, but it never held my attention (and I'm not ADHD- I sit though three hours of a good bio pic. <br/><br/>A good part of this was the girls trying asinine ways to escape; at other time we see McAvoy play several personalities half heartily. After all the award talk I expected a much better and diverse McAvoy. Sadly, just like the majority of Night's films he has his actors perform methodically. It actually felt McAlvoy was pushing his talents against the brick wall of what the director wanted.<br/><br/>He wasn't the only actor who underplayed the role. So did the doctor and the three teenage girls. First, after all these late night calls for extra appointment why didn't she get upset earlier or pull a personality up (which she has stated she can do) to discover the emergency instead of A casual bye--you-leave when another dominant personality shows up to the appointment.<br/><br/>I rate this in the same category of Nights's films except the quality Sisth Sense and Devil, which he did not direct and only wrote the original story, <br/><br/>As for,the ending, I felt it was a cheap shot. If the point was they are in the same time, the message came across far too,strong. If it is a hint to an Unbreakable 2 I'll pass and see another big screen feature."
"shivamt25","7","1","9","23 February 2017"," SPLIT - James McAvoy's Finest!
","When I first saw McAvoy in the movie Wanted, I pegged him as just one of the plethora of actors who come and go and you don't even remember their face after some time. After about a year, I watched Atonement. I was surprised because the actor who I saw on the screen was no rookie, and before that, I was seldom wrong about such thing. So, I started looking for all the movies starring James McAvoy. In my quest, I found Filth and Trance, after which I became a die hard fan. He carries every one of his performance with a finesse which could pull up the entire movie by itself.<br/><br/>So naturally, I was very excited about Split. One other reason was M. Night Shyamalan in whom I had faith even after watching The Visit. So, I went to the theater yesterday. First-day first show in Pune, India, about a month after its release in the US. There were 7 silhouettes I could see in the hall and I was afraid they would cancel the show, but I was wrong, fortunately.<br/><br/>Let me tell you something about Split. It is not meant for a mass audience. The film is about a man named Kevin who has 23 different personalities and a 24th is about to come out. He kidnaps 3 girls for some sort of ritual to be performed before the 24th personality arrived. Some of the personalities are dominant and are eagerly waiting for the 'Beast', the 24th entity. The girls have to escape somehow before they become the victim of the beast. Also, apart from these 24 Kevins and the 3 girls, there was also Betty Buckley portraying Kevin's psychiatrist. <br/><br/>I have to say the movie left me speechless, especially the second half. It took advantage of the silence so very well that we had to refrain ourselves from taking our eyes away from the screen because it felt like anytime the movie is going to throw something awesome on our face. The main story line is in perfect blend with the past story of Casey, played by Anya Taylor Joy who did an amazing job by the way.<br/><br/>But, McAvoy stole the show. He played every one of his personalities so very well that in some of the scenes, he won't even speak a word but you will know from his body language what character he is in at that moment. In the second half, when the movie picked up a pace, you can hear a trace of a slur in his voice and then he would be a totally different person, with a different voice, accent, and behavior. My favorite out of the 24 was Hedwig, a 9-year-old child, who McAvoy portrayed with all the innocence he could bring up in his eyes. But that is the thing, there is this one personality which you would hate to love and there is this other one you would love to hate. Such a character can only come alive on screen if played by the finest actors we know."
"jordyreviewsit","8","1","9","23 February 2017"," 'Split' Might Be M. Night Shyamalan's Most Intriguing Thriller
","OVERVIEW: Outsider Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) attends a birthday party for her frenemy Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), a pity invitation obviously. After accepting a ride home with Claire's father, as well as her best friend Marcia (Jessica Sula), Casey and the two girls are attacked and kidnapped. They wake up locked in a basement by a man named Dennis (James McAvoy). However they soon find out that this man exhibits two other personalities, a woman named Patricia and a young boy named Hedwig.<br/><br/>While Claire and Marcia are terrified and ready to fight, Casey seems more reserved. She wants to dissect exactly what's going on and perhaps speak with Hedwig, who seems fond of her, to gain more insight. It is soon discovered that the mans real name is Kevin and he has 23 unique personalities. Patricia and Dennis are the strongest and waiting on the arrival of the 24th personality, ""the beast"". Time is running out for the girls to find their escape and their only hope is figuring out which personality could help them before it's too late.<br/><br/>THOUGHTS: The film itself examines the concept of dissociative identity disorder. While the science explained isn't something we're all familiar with, it definitely intrigues you as a viewer to learn more about this complex disorder. James McAvoy takes on a tremendous amount of work having to develop so many unique personalities, in some instances having to switch between them within the same scene. It's an impressive feat to take on and even more disturbing and sad that people live with this.<br/><br/>Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch), who portrays Casey in this film, deserves tremendous praise for her performance. Not only does she deal with the stresses placed on her character during her imprisonment, but also the complexity of a character that has a deeply troubling past.<br/><br/>Despite the dark tone of the film, there are moments of levity and some humor that feels well-balanced. At some times things may come off a little silly when it means to be serious, but not in a way that negates the prouder moments of the movie.<br/><br/>Pacing in this film starts to fade off at a certain point. When we reach the third act you sort of find yourself questioning exactly where this film is going. There doesn't seem to be an exact path you can find narrative-wise to get an idea of the films purpose. Are we experiencing reality, something supernatural? What exactly is it suppose to leave you with?<br/><br/>It's an enjoyable film, but you're left with these questions, until the final scene. A scene that left many in the audience confused, excited and hoping for another."

"iamtherobotman","6","1","9","21 February 2017"," A 7-10 Split.
","I was left disappointed with this sadly. I'm a huge fan of McAvoy, he's a fantastic Actor who has been is some good films and always gives his heart and soul to the role and were it not for him i think i'd have rated this a lot lower. He plays his part brilliantly in this, sadly his acting ability is what carries this as much of the script is poor, the support Actresses for being an apparent major part of the plot and film really didn't offer much and the rest of the cast including the 'Shrink' were no more than bit parts. It just however was never quite believable, i mean the film as a whole. It seemed to tread water a lot of the time. There were aspects which just didn't strike me as true to life such as lack of any Police investigation into the missing 'teens' or the Fathers apparent disappearance from the Earth after the abduction of the girls...It just all seemed a bit sterile.<br/><br/>I'd like to have seen it getting messier, more in-depth into McAvoys various characters, what it was that triggered each one to the surface, where they'd all 'come from'. We seemed to find out more about the main female character than anyone else which didn't quite sit right ( unless of course there will be a sequel where it becomes far more evident as to why we saw so much of her background). The introduction of 'The Beast' was clunky, i don't think he was meant to be 'supernatural' as i've seen suggested, but with this film tieing in with 'Unbreakable'...<br/><br/>Overall it was OK, it was interesting and nicely shot but it lacked a real purpose and some grit for my liking. It could've been brilliant, could've been a classic but 'Ramalangadingdong' messed up again sadly."

"alex-klein2424","8","1","9","20 February 2017"," Shyamalan is Back
","I want to stress as I write this review that the ratings I give at the bottom are reflective of my ratings on my IMDb profile. I often times find it difficult to rate movies on their scale because one movie may be an easy 8 but is it a 9? It's no question a high eight so might as well give it a 9, right? So from now on I will have a more fluid and descriptive rating at the end of my reviews that does not give a number or pros and cons.<br/><br/>One of the great things about this movie, right off the bat, is that it does not mess around. Within the first five minutes the scene from the trailer of the girls being kidnapped happens and it is edge of your seat suspense the entire way through. For all the trash that M. Night Shyamalan put out over the years, I think it is safe to say that he has had his midlife crisis and has moved back into what made his movies great. I would like to give a quick shout out to The Visit which came out two years ago, movie because that really was his return to form and it seems apparent he is back and better than ever. <br/><br/>The plot is almost fully given away in the trailer which really says a lot for this movie because you are still engaged the entire time waiting for The Beast to show up and to see if these girls get out alive. If you haven't seen the trailer, three girls are kidnapped by a man with 23 different personalities that are all vying for control of the body of James McAvoy who does a phenomenal job playing so many different people including a woman and a child. I don't want to say more about the plot because it is a movie you just need to go see. <br/><br/>I will let all of you in on a secret, which my brother can attest to. Upon viewing the trailer for maybe the second or third time during other movies, one night I had a really scary nightmare that I was trapped by that guy and the movie spooked me ever since. I almost didn't want to go see it but I faced my fears and I'm glad I did. One of the reasons I got so scared during the trailer was the jumpy music in spots where Kevin aka Barry aka Dennis aka the bad guy pops up very quickly but in the movie the music is more relaxed and intricate than jumpy. I think the trailer was trying to portray this as more of a horror movie when it is really a thriller and thinker. When learning about the main girl, Casey's past, that is when the real sadness crept over me due to how terrible her life was as it unfolded in flashbacks. Anya Taylor-Joy is in top form and is a rising start to watch after seeing this and her performance in The Witch."
"valen060","7","1","9","18 February 2017"," Bizarre and Oddly Disturbing Psychological Thriller
","Following from his 2015 soft comeback film 'The Visit,' director M. Night Shyamalan's next suspenseful thriller titled 'Split' was already an intrigue with the plot centering around James McAvoy's character having an unusual personality disorder. This had me jumping back to Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho, but unlike Anthony Perkins' unhinged Norman Bates with his one ""Mother"" persona, McAvoy's Kevin Crumb has twenty-three personas in his complex mind that you'd never know when his normal self is there or not (or anything that is ""normal"" for that matter).<br/><br/>A psychologist named Dr. Fletcher is trying to learn more about what makes Kevin transition from one personality to the next, but with each one that emerges, it grows even more bizarre since each one has the mindset of a nine-year-old boy, an unknown woman, or a kidnapper named ""Dennis."" It becomes increasingly ambiguous that Fletcher decides to investigate into what each personality had done in life with the help of one of his captives, a young girl named Casey.<br/><br/>For this to what could possibly be Shyamalan's next splendid follow-up, I say this is one of his long-awaited return to form. For Split, the way he tries to capture McAvoy's unpredictable notions on camera makes it feel more terrifying every time we try to comprehend each personality carefully. I did get lost in some parts of the film, but knowing McAvoy's past roles in other movies, I always pondered that a few of these personalities might as well be indirectly mirroring some of McAvoy's previous movie roles.<br/><br/>It became a psychological thrill ride that my mentality was put to the test and keeping up in some parts proved tricky, but careful observation. The twist ending (which I won't spoil) was uniquely different from the other plot twists Shyamalan had done in his previous projects. This one in particular would be one I found to be very jarring in my opinion (I know, since a few in the audience were quietly deducing a connection). Well played, sir."

","M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite writers and directors so I was really psyched about this flick and it was greatly anticipated. Just to be clear, this is not meant to be a horror flick but rather a psychological thriller. So don't go in to watch this movie thinking its a scary movie and expect the ""BOO!"" factor.<br/><br/>Mcavoy gives his most epic performance; undoubtedly his career's finest as well as most difficult. And sadly, I am sure will also be overlooked by the Academy.<br/><br/>The story line is successful in keeping the viewer engaged throughout the entire film. While the movie begins to unfolds it somewhat mirrors the 1970s film ""Sybil""; a woman afflicted with D.I.D. going thru the motions with each different personality along with the psychologist. Except THIS time it was a man. Yet the plot was still fresh and entertaining with a touch of crime and severe mental illness thrown in for extra fun.<br/><br/>The disappointment only comes as the ending starts to unfold. What was intended to be a ""twist"" in the ending was a ""Marvel Comics"" style cameo by Bruce Willis making a reference to a ""Mr. Glass"" which was a character from the movie ""Unbroken""; another Shyamalan flick. Is this an indication of an ""Unbreakable 2"" or are the two movies suggested to be connected? Who knows because the whole ending and unfolding of the ending failed miserably. If the viewer had never seen ""Unbroken"" or didn't remember the movie, the ending was even MORE ambiguous. I had seen ""Unbroken"" and still felt like I wasn't following and left with yet another frustrating ending. Also not Shyamalan's style. <br/><br/>I expected much more from this flick. I WANTED to LOVE it. It almost seems like Shyamalan just gave up when it came to finishing off the story. Not bad but not great either. Definitely not Shyamalan greatness."

I would have been quite happy to stop watching it before those last couple of minutes.<br/><br/>I'm think I know what the director was trying for with that ending but it was poorly executed and completely unnecessary.

If you take the Sixth Sense and combine it with Paranormal Activity and you have split. James Mcavoy did a pretty good job playing all of those different personalities. and the 3 women who were part of the main story really brought the emotion of the horror film to life. i also was impressed with the choice of location which was Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the whole warehouse location made the location creepy yet very creative.

","So I watched the overrated movie few days ago, unfortunately it didn't come up to my expectations at all! So here's my review:<br/><br/>It could have been made better, the events are so predictable, there's no single plot twist in the whole movie, yes I know it's not necessary to have one but when it comes to psychology, I think it's better to have at least one plot twist to catch your attention and makes you curious to follow up with the events. For example, it would be the best of the best, if it was built up in Casey's imagination because of her childhood abuse, or maybe she actually didn't go through a childhood abuse and it was just a psyche trip, and she is the one with DID condition, oh my God it would be the best plot twist ever, and maybe Mcavoy is her psychiatrist? YES! But no.. it is my imaginary scenario. <br/><br/>The story didn't keep my attention focused up to the very end, actually at some point, it was so boring and I was frustrated watching it, then suddenly the events went faster and I felt like they had only one day left to finish the movie so they were just like let's put all the beautiful touches and a very good scenario in the last 10 minutes. I also didn't like much the fantasy part in the end, it made it worse. If you're going to discuss this physiological condition, just stick to it and try to get deeper in order to show the audience something new that has never been made in such movies. Those who liked it so much, I guess it was their first time to watch a movie discussing DID case or maybe they didn't even know about this condition, but according to what I have watched before and what I have read, this is way far to be even put in a comparison with them, it's the lowest among them. <br/><br/>On the other hand; Mcavoy's performance it stunning and his facial expressions were epic! He played each and every personality in an awesome way. Although the scenario was so poor, there were a couple of quotes in the end of the movie that a must-noted ones, regardless the fantasy part in the end that rotten it; I know they wanted to deliver a message through this specific part, but they could have used another way and get you involved in it. Unfortunately, I give it 6.8. Yes I know, too little, that's why I'm disappointed!"

","Split is an interesting and intriguing film, creating a lot of questions and building an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere. It is M.Night Shyamalan's best film for a long time, as he has constantly missed the nail on his last several ventures. Split showcases the quiet skills and talents he had in building atmosphere and story in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. However, whilst those two had great endings, Split's ending; the use of the beast and his ""powers"" as well as the importance of Anya Taylor-Joy's character, is extremely unsatisfying and lacklustre.<br/><br/>The use of Bruce Willis to tie this film to unbreakable feels attached last minute, and has little effect on the previous occurrences of the film, although promising more in future films. <br/><br/>James McAvoy is the star of the show. His skill in bringing several different characters to life is incredible; through slight nuances and carefully deliberate actions. He overshadows the cast and steals every scene he is in, even when at his least formidable and least impressive, ironically, as the beast. McAvoy is unnerving, intriguing, and inspiring to watch, as he switches between and combines characters. <br/><br/>It will be very interesting to see McAvoy face off against Willis in a sequel, which in itself, gives credit to the worthiness of Split, although it was not as good as promised, or as rumoured."

","Hey there !<br/><br/>Just saw this tonight, and let me say, I am speechless, I don't know how to say it... truthfully I have difficulty sizing this film and I don't mean it in the wrong way; it has great potential and production quality. James McAvoy (if it could be anybody, he can do it better than any actor) is absolutely brilliant as the utterly insane madman with 25 split personalities - he's just outstanding in his shifting multi-layered multi-personalities TDI display : he evens plays a woman, he plays a 9 year old, he plays a killer abudctor, he plays a homosexual man, he plays 'the beast' (an enraged Hulk monster), etc... with brio and clear distinction...This is both good and bad (only for me)...I will try to explain : this film wants to be very 'serious' and about split personality people and self-mutilating people who suffer from serious mental problems. The problem is when he shifts to another 'persona/character' mid conversation...it may seem a bit jarring (for me it was a little) or let's say it made me laugh so much !!! Very Unintentionally ! (I feel guilty about it), Here is the movie trying to be Very serious about 3 young teenager ladies who are abducted by a crazy psycho murderer with dozens of personalities and brought into his psycho lair...and I'm laughing non-stop at the ridiculness of the 'different 'wacky' personalities' (more wacky/funny than psychotic)...I felt bad because there were very tense and scary moments where you feel sad/scared for the young girls who are terrified and trapped.... but then...Mr.McAvoy comes in the room and makes a big fool of himself with ultra-funny (unintentionnaly) performances of a 9 year old, of a very tender woman and then switches to a extravagant homosexual man...etc...huh!!??? lol..then...he switches to a Super Mean Killer Face... LOL...Oh that must be the Killer Personality Deciding to Come Out ! Lol (I'm really not laughing at him/or the movie, it's great quality with incredible performances of everyones including Mr.McAvoy's old lady shrink..just 'the unintentional effect' of his facial personality performances)....a nd there the young girls stare at him in utter fright (veryyy seriousss) while I'm literally cracked up laughing inside (lol)...(not at the girls' sad plight...but at the Multi-personality split personality performances of abductor Mr.McAvoy). The point I'm trying to say is this film is truly great but the unintentional effect of shifting personalities renders it 'funny' (in some points) rather than serious. Because Mr.McAvoy is so good at it he displays tons of slightly shifting nuances in his faces (crooked eyebrows/arched muscles/tons of expressions..) but it's also quite awkward (again it makes you laugh! sometimes it's slighty cringe-worthy), the film wants to be Extra-Serious, but because of that, it becomes tame and even funny (sadly unintentionnaly because of the 'comic' relief in the 'comical' personality he acts with the other 'dark' ones...I mean it's a grown man playing a 9 year old extremely well..but you know...it's an Adult Man..and he's playing a cute funny innocent 9 year old..yeah it will be awkward and end up funny/ridiculous rather than 'serious tone'). The main teenager woman in this film is Truly great, she is an upcoming actress with incredible potential (actress Anya-Taylor Joy, she played the young teenager blond in the great horror film 'The Witch (2016)', she is the brightest in the bunch/the most serious (she was a child that was molested (we see flashbacks of her past) and became a 'rebel recluse self-mutilating teenager' and will be the only one who survives), the film doesn't 'end' per say and Mr.McAvoy is not killed he survives two shotgun blasts from her (as the beast personality he comes a Hulk and his veins pop, he can literally split a metal bar in two), the film ends with cameo from Bruce Willis as Dunn his former psychotic/asylum caregiver...we understand Bruce Willis and Mr.McAvoy will come back in Split 2.<br/><br/>All in all very awkwardly surprised (if I want to good laughing psychosis therapy by Mr.McAvoy it does well, Mr. M.Night Shyamalan (the director) is truly something and keeps on creating very special and different films), stil don't let my weird review put it down, it is a definitely a good film nonetheless : 8 out of 10."
"asb_deutsch","7","1","9","9 February 2017"," It is a surprise hit...no denying about that.
","It is a hit. No denying about that. I guess I came in with more higher expectations. It was a good movie but I wouldn't say great. I'd guess that Shyamalan is back!<br/><br/>BTW, This doesn't make sense... Kevin directs Casey to where his shotgun is and orders her to kill him before his other personalities begin to take over, switching from one to the other until ""the Beast"" returns. Another question was why did not the psychologist order the hospitalization of Kevin? Shouldn't such people be in mental hospitals taken care of? Other questions could be raised as to how could he live in a zoo without anyone noticing him commuting? Is this really a sequel to Unbreakable?"
"PyroSikTh","9","1","9","25 January 2017"," An Unequivocal Return to Form for Shyamalan
","I haven't yet seen The Visit, but Split is unequivocally a return to form for Shyamalan. He is well and truly back with his own tropes and tricks and they're wonderful to behold. There's two things Shyamalan has always been synonymous with, and that's suspense and twist endings, and both are back in full force. <br/><br/>My heart was racing for the vast majority of the entire movie. He knows how to film and frame a sequence to put you in unease, and punctuate it with movements both sudden and slow, to give the scenes an aura of unpredictability. You could feel the tension in the cinema screening as everyone was brought to the edge of their seats. Entire rows of seats would jolt at sudden jumps as the suspense is built and released, but never lets up. There's a moment where one of Kevin's personalities briefly lets the girls out so they can eat on a table. The fear on the girls eyes as they look for an opportunity to escape is palpable, and the suspense of being in such close, open proximity to an individual so fundamentally unpredictable. This sense of unpredictability is punctuated perfectly by a sudden slam of a knife on the table out of petty frustration, as one of Kevin's personalities is upset that they didn't cut a sandwich in a straight line. The girl a couple of seats over from me jumped so hard that the entire row shook. This is cinema at it's finest.<br/><br/>Of course the driving factor of Split is James McAvoy's ability to effortlessly and convincingly shift between multiple different characters. Kevin is the core personality at the centre of it all, but we never really meet him. His body is taken over by a number of other individuals who all fight amongst themselves and oppress each other in a bid to take control. There's Dennis who's OCD drives him to disgust whenever things aren't clean, coupled with a penchant for watching young girls dance. He shares the ""light"" with Patricia, a well-spoken, older woman who has her own quirks and desire for control. Dennis and Patricia have taken over in order to usher in a mysterious 24th personality they refer to as The Beast. Their takeover was possible thanks to Hedwig, a 9-year old boy who enjoys dancing to Kanye West, and has the ability to take the light whenever he wants, without restriction from the others. These three are the main ones in control, but under the surface the others are fighting. Diabetic young woman Jade, homosexual fashion designer Barry, and nerdy, fact- spewing Orwell all bubble tentatively beneath the surface, yearning for help whenever they can get a chance. And this is all inside McAvoy's performance, which is nothing short of spectacular. He emphasises each one with their own mannerisms, accents, and body language. He slides into the guise of an older woman just as easily as he can embody the psych of a 9-year old boy.<br/><br/>And yet despite the slathering of suspense and dark subject matter, from kidnapping to paedophilia to cannibalism, Split has it's lighter moments that help break it up a bit and make it more bearable. Again, this is almost entirely thanks to McAvoy who's sense of comedic timing and knack for facial expressions owes to some genuinely hilarious moments. Hedwig is the big character to blame for this, being as charmingly innocent as only a child could be. His warning that Casey could be pregnant after an awkward first kiss is hilarious in it's innocence, and his performance to music in front of her is physical humour at it's finest.<br/><br/>While I've so far only given praise to Shyamalan and McAvoy, there are certainly other members of the cast and crew who deserve a mention. The sheer levels of suspense and unease wouldn't have been possible without the combined marriage of Mike Gioulakis' cinematography and West Dylan Thordson's sometimes eery and sometimes beautiful score. Anya Taylor-Joy proves that she is a force to be reckoned with, with a performance as Casey that straddles between fearful and patiently wise.<br/><br/>Split is, as I've already mentioned, a welcome return to form for Shyamalan. His brand of filmmaking, holding that special something that makes for solidly entertaining viewing, has once again returned thanks to his smaller budget and focus on actors and what limited tools he had available. Split is a suspenseful movie fundamentally about child abuse and the effects it can have once those children grow up. It's full of dark ideas and concepts and offsets them with genuine charm and humour. A solid eight/eight and a half out of ten movie. However that's not the end. The final reveal after the end of the movie somehow changes Split while not actually touching it at all. It's an ingenious twist that not everyone will fully understand, but it's a twist that will forever stick with me as one of cinema's greatest moments. So much so, that it boosts my entire rating up to an incredible 9/10. Go and see Split. Go and see it before the ending is ruined for you."
"evan_harvey","7","1","9","7 February 2017"," Brilliant thematic sequel to Unbreakable
","Split is the thematic sequel to 2000's Unbreakable. Unbreakable is about super heroes and villains who are almost ordinary people, except for some small, almost coincidental, differences. It's a slow film, but a brilliant concept.<br/><br/>****Major Spoilers****<br/><br/>If Unbreakable is about the rise of a new super hero, then Split is about the rise of a new super villain. Kevin suffers from DID - Dissociative Identity Disorder, or split personalities. These personalities were created to protect Kevin from childhood abuse and trauma. There are 23 of them, and they are all distinct as individuals. There is a rumour of a 24th personality, known as the Beast. Just as the other personalities surfaced to protect Kevin, the Beast now protects the personalities.<br/><br/>****Major Spoilers****<br/><br/>James McAvoy is great in the lead role. Anja Taylor-Joy follows up from the recent film The Witch, but this is McAvoy's film. The set is sparse, the dialogue uncomplicated, and the sense of rising dread expertly handled.<br/><br/>Any film requires you to buy into it's premise. If you're not prepared to do that, then why bother going to the movies at all? Unbreakable required that. Aliens required that. Split does as well, but keeps it's premise within the boundary of what might be possible. That's the underlying concept of both this and Unbreakable. It's not Marvel-style super heroes, but the everyday things that can't quite be explained away.<br/><br/>The Beast. He's on the move and when he arrives, he brings with him a gritty, bleak new super villain."
"ze_pedro-15708","8","1","9","7 February 2017"," Split - by pieces
","Split is certainly a must-watch for triller fans for this year. I was hyping for this film, since I'm a follower of cinema news, and critics' opinions and I had read it was Shyamalan's comeback since Sixth Sense, altho I kinda enjoyed the geriatric horror 'The Visit'. This movie can give you the creeps, if you join its mood across this journey. Without spoiling much, I'll say the performances of James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy are delightful. McAvoy cuckoos impersonation is brilliant and Anya Taylor is already a brunette scream queen of her own, since The Witch. The sound effects and video effects are nicely cut to put the atmosphere of this sick person, the main character represents. I kinda ambitionated to see more of the other personalities and also in the end it gives some hints for a potential sequel which I'd rather not want one, because it could ruin the film, prolonguing it much. Overall, if you're a triller fan, watch this one, and you'll be questioning the wonders of the human mind for a while, hours, a day..."
"pjonline66","7","1","9","7 February 2017"," An unrelenting thriller
","M. Night Shyamalan has had a very interesting directorial career to date. His films range from the wonderfully chilling The Sixth Sense to the woefully dreadful The Happening. His cannon is certainly a mixed bag but for me there is enough creativity and inspiration amongst his eclectic range of films to approach any new title he releases with an open mind. His latest venture Split boasts an interesting concept and a leading man who I consider to be one of the finest actors in his generation; James McAvoy. As a result I was cautiously optimistic when I sat down in the cinema last week and I am pleased to say that I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Split follows three young women who are kidnapped by McAvoy's character and locked in a mysterious basement. This is not your standard slasher/torture horror movie however as it quickly becomes apparent that MacAvoy's character has been diagnosed with 23 distinct 'split' personalities. Some of the personas sympathise with the female victims whereas others are not so accommodating. Up until the kidnapping this title suggests that McAvoy's character has successfully integrated into society but something has gone horribly wrong in his head and the evil personas within him have taken over his actions. The choice of victims here and the claustrophobic nature of the captivity ensure that you will be on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Interestingly although the sympathetic personas that McAvoy embodies may break the tension at times you begin to feel empathy towards his portrayal of a villain as a result.<br/><br/>To just focus on the talents of the Director or the strength of the story line for this review would completely miss the main attraction of the title. James McAvoy once again provides a towering performance as Dennis, Hedwig, Crum, Patricia...OK so there are too many to list here but you get the point!<br/><br/>Many actors have attempted to play multiple characters in titles with varying degrees of success. Alec Guinness is a classic example of an actor who could embody anyone he wished (see Kind Hearts and Coronets for example). Eddie Murphy is a more recent example of an actor who likes to play versions of himself but his movies have descended into the dreadfully self indulgent Norbit. The primary difference with both of these actors however is that they rely heavily on costume and prosthetics to embody another character. What is so impressive about McAvoy's performance here is that he is able to embody a range of different personas without the use of extensive costumes or make-up. In fact his appearance is deliberately neutral as he has a shaved head so he has to rely solely on facial, bodily and voice expression.<br/><br/>We won't see McAvoy on the podium holding an Oscar this year as he hasn't even been nominated for the best actor category (which is bizarre but that's another discussion altogether) but if he keeps putting in performances like this his talents will surely be widely recognised amongst the critical establishment. For now he can take a lot of comfort from the fact that Split has been a huge box office success so clearly his fans recognise his talents even if the Academy elite do not.<br/><br/>Split is an unrelenting thriller that will get your blood pumping for the entirety of its screen time and it certainly represents a return to form for Shyamalan. Let's hope he can keep up this quality of work.<br/><br/>see more at:<br/><br/>http://thereeltruth1.blogspot.co.uk/"

"blumdeluxe","6","1","9","5 February 2017"," A bit overrated in my eyes
","""Split"" is definitely one of the movies that people were talking about lately. It provides a story that's designated to make the audience curious. Three teenage girls, kidnapped by a man with plenty of personalities that is struggling with himself, thereby setting the girls at deadly risk.<br/><br/>The general concept is really promising. And to not get me wrong, this is by far not a bad movie. Some of the acting was brilliantly done and it would be a lie to say that you aren't excited how things will go on.<br/><br/>But there are things that prevent me from rating it better. Firstly, at time sit just tried to be a bit too much of a comedy for my taste. There were scenes that made people burst out in laughter and that kind of ruined the atmosphere of danger and risk. Of course these could be unintentional but in this case they are just not thoughtfully overthought. But most important, why did there have to be kind of a paranormal plot twist? This could have been a beautiful realistic thriller but at the point where knives just break and bullets can't kill anymore the movie just lost me. That's just ridiculous and ruins an otherwise well-made thriller. Maybe that's too harshly said but it really disappointed me. I also fear there will be a second part and I don't see how the film could benefit from that.<br/><br/>So all in all it is a good movie, no questions asked, I don't regret watching it and if you are not too keen on realism I don't see why it shouldn't please you as a thriller fan. I will just stick to other titles."
"sol-","Null","1","9","5 February 2017"," Kidnapped
","Upon discovering that the man who has kidnapped them has a multiple personality disorder, three teenage girls try to manipulate his more benevolent personalities into helping them escape in this horror thriller from M. Night Shyamalan. The film features two distinct plot lines as the kidnapper, played James McAvoy, separately converses with his psychiatrist and interacts with the girls he has kidnapped. Tension sometimes dissipates as the film switches back and forth, but McAvoy's intense and unsettlingly unpredictable performance keeps the film is chugging along. The best performance though comes from Anya Taylor-Joy (of 'The VVitch' fame) as the most introverted of the three kidnapped teens who nevertheless knows the best ways to deal with their abductor; Shyamalan's camera constantly hangs close to her face as her wide-open eyes and nervous glances convey volumes. As the film progresses, we gradually learn that she has suffered past trauma as per McAvoy, though the film's reluctance to explore her past experiences in depth (we only get the briefest of suggestive flashbacks) never feels right. The element of the film that sits least comfortably though is the fact that we are told that McAvoy has 23 distinct personalities, yet we only ever see eight of them and we are given no compelling reasons why he would have so many personalities aside from it sounding rather creepy. That said, the film offers several thought-provoking views on individuals with such a condition, questioning whether they are not in fact ""more evolved"" and whether curing such a condition is really the answer."

","spoilers lmao<br/><br/>if you haven't seen unbreakable, you will not understand the ending, or the direction of the franchise and future films. some of my major gripes with the movie were its sub par female acting roles, filled by what i would consider low budget newbie actresses, although i can understand why shymalan went that route because he had to pay bruce willis and james mccavoy a big chunk, thus leaving little to be ""split"" among the rest of the mediocre cast. another one of my major gripes with this movie is how it was marketed. it was more marketed as a standalone, rather than a sequel, which is 100% is. in understand that was probably to built up suspense to the climactic finish, but most people in the theater when i went to watch split didn't understand the ending at all, and were just ready to do be done with the movie by the time the girl was discovered underneath the zoo. however, overall, i think this movie had a good premise, and it translated nicely to the big screen, putting shymalan in a brighter light than previous movies portrayed his style."
"exup","7","1","9","2 February 2017"," almost a classic
","There is an air of confidence in learning that this is an M.Night Shyamalan film, a man that has established himself over the years as the master of tension and the king of twists, so much so that it would now be considered a twist if he didn't include one. This paired with having James McAvoy at the helm should guarantee this as another classic..right?..well almost..It's a well written film with all the apparent brilliant simplicity we require to immerse ourselves in the well toned atmosphere and suspense he is well versed in creating. The story begins to unravel in a delicate and steady enough pace to keep you engaged. A strong supporting cast helps this feel authentic. Anya Taylor-Joy does an excellent job as the quirky loner with a unexpected past and her back story was both frustrating and interesting to watch as it unravels. Now to James MvAvoy, The task set before him was a high order. He tackles this role head on and in a very committed way. My only problem was trying to decide as to whether it was tackled in too much of a theatrical 'Hollywood' way which took away a little of the authenticity of the characters. This is not so much a criticism more an personal observation. That aside it was a very skilled performance which produced some magical moments. On the whole the film was steady and the only real criticism was that it delivered a few predictable moments. These are quickly forgiven by just as many 'didn't see that coming' moments. The most frustrating thing with this film was the official trailer pretty much ruins what has been set up in this film as 'the big question' to which we are teased with the possible answer right up until the end.. yet the trailer pretty much reveals a clue to this.. why this is allowed to happen is beyond me..so as much as I enjoyed it I spent the film thinking I know the answer cause I think I saw it in the trailer..this took some of the joy away from this film for me. I know that all sounds vague but I'm trying not to give too much away. I would say this film lives up to the 'sixth sense' and 'signs' standard..but does not 'out do' them. M.Night Shyamalan delivers another steady two hours of entertainment which will not so much rock your world but leave you uneasily satisfied."

","This marks the second M. Night Shyamalan film I have seen. The first one being The Last Airbender (I was seven, cut me some slack). I wanted to know as little as possible going into this movie. I stayed away from spoilers as much as humanly possible (THIS REVIEW IS GOING TO CONTAIN MUCH SPOILERS). When I saw it, I was shocked to the tenth degree. There's no way I can talk about this movie without spoiling it. Here we go. Split marks a good starting point for 2017 movies. I loved this movie. It is a surprise if ever there was one. There are so many good things about this movie. Is it perfect? No. Is it good enough to be considered a great movie? Yes, definitely. M. Night Shyamalan is known for his movies like The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, and The Village. But, he's also known for The Last Airbender and The Happening. I think M. Night might have redeemed himself, folks. The performances are excellent, specifically James McAvoy and Anna Taylor-Joy. They are great. I'm so happy to see McAvoy go, ""Hey world! I'm not just Professor X!"" There is literally no other actor on planet Earth to be Kevin other than McAvoy. But, Talor-Joy also does a fantastic job at playing her character. She was the very skeptical one and the others were just like, ""Let's get the living hell outta here!"" The skepticism worked perfectly for this actor. I seriously need to talk about the cinematography. It is outstanding. Nitpick all you want, but you can't deny the way this movie was shot. It is a really great looking film. The movie does have disturbing moments. I won't go super deep into spoiler territory about that, but it's gross. Although, there's one moment where ""the beast"" is eating one of the girls alive. It shows guts and it's disturbing. With every M. Night Shyamalan movie, there's always a twist, spoiled in the trailer (After Earth *cough*) or not. Here's the twist: ""Split"" is set in the same universe as ""Unbreakable"". Here's why. I read on a site that it's less of a horror movie and more of a super- villain origin story. With Bruce Willis appearing at the last shot of the movie, it's almost (keep that in mind) confirming that Unbreakable 2 will be happening. That's a super cool thing! As a consensus, Split is a return to form for Shyamalan and it is such a great movie."

"Screen_Blitz","8","1","9","30 January 2017"," M. Night Shyamalan strikes back for a solidly crafted, spine-chilling experience
","After his major success with the 1999 psychological horror-thriller 'The Sixth Sense', M. Night Shyamalan, an expert of suspense and supernatural twists, appeared to have a promising career ahead of him. Following his triumph with 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs', Shyamalan sorely met a downward trajectory in his career with a long string of cinematic duds that failed to demonstrate the firm potential of his filmmaking talent. After the vast disappointment of 2013's 'After Earth', movie fans everywhere grew pessimistic about his career ever resurfacing. His career finally saw a small shade of heavenly light when he directed the 2015 found-footage thriller 'The Visit' which marked a moderate comeback. This psychological thriller however, shows Shyamalan returning to the supernatural genre in his most valuable form with psychological twists and mind-bending thrills. Echoing his notable works, this film strolls audiences through a dark, mysterious vehicle where expectations are challenged and minds of viewers are effectively played with. This film follows three teenage girls: best friends Claire (played by Haley Ru Richardson) and Marcia (played by Jessica Sula), and social awkward outsider Casey (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) who are abducted and trapped inside a basement cellar by the hands of a psychopath (played by James McAvoy). He isn't no ordinary psychopath however, he is a man who suffers from dissociative identity disorder (meaning he carries 23 different personalities). The girls must outsmart him in attempt to escape before suffering by the hands his 24th and his most vicious personality yet -- The Beast.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan is veteran for crafting smart, spine-tingling vehicles that challenge the minds of viewers and spear them with twist endings that that are nearly impossible to see on the horizon. That is until his long string of cinematic debacles began trailing on his career. Here, Shyamalan has made a triumphant return and mingled in a superbly crafted plot with a solid assortment of spellbinding thrills and engaging cinematography that echoes Mike Gioulakis's work in 'It Follows'. The story cuts back and worth between James McAvoy's chilling interaction with the girls, and his relationship with his therapist (played by Betty Buckley) who plays a vital role throughout the story. The former however, easily marks the story's high points. The cutthroat atmosphere is enticingly generated by a chilling performance by James McAvoy who drastically alternates between a long series of multiple personalities with pinches of both dark humor and cynicism, and the battle of the minds between his character and the three teen girls rolls with plenty of startling twists. As part his trademark style, Shyamalan is a director in favor of not repetitive jump scares or drenching the atmosphere in relentless blood and gore, but instead using a thoughtful narrative to toy with the minds of viewers. And his methods greatly pay from the start to the climatic final act when the suspense and thrills goes on full throttle, to an ending that will raise some eyebrows. If this film has any blemishes, it may be the underdevelopment of the female characters portrayed by Haley Ru Richardson and Jessica Sula as opposed to Anya Taylor-Joy's character is the only one of the trio assembled in a three-dimensional state. And there are some occasional instances of dialogue that comes off rather cheesy. Overall, M. Night Shyalaman crafts for a superb experience where these flaws can be effortlessly overlooked.<br/><br/>Split is provocative, spine-chilling psychological thrill piece that not only scores for an engrossing experience, but also marks a triumphant return for director M. Night Shyamalan in his career. In a large pile of January-released duds, this film truly stands out among them. Needless to say, it proves that 2015's 'The Visit' wasn't a just a fluke."
"geraldohanna","8","1","9","30 January 2017"," Split
","Alfred Hitchcock has being cited today as the ""Master of Suspense"". A creative genius and tour de force within Hollywood. With a 50-year legacy under his belt, he inadvertently pioneered the way for filmmakers like M. Night Shyamalan - Although imagine if ""Split"" was released in 1960, the year of another classic ""twist"", the year of ""Psycho"".<br/><br/>See, during the release of ""Psycho"", Hitchcock made a lot of shocking requests - forcing his crew, and actors into secrecy, creating faking promotional posters citing ""heart attacks"" upon watching, he even went as far as instructing theater owners not to let people in after the film began, which was strongly enforced. If ""Split"" had this marketing behind it, it could have potentially become the year's most talked about film, perhaps decade. Although I feel I must say ""Split"" is truly one of Shyamalan's best in a long time, and certainly movie fans and critics alike will leave the theater ""Split"" - Pun intended.<br/><br/>Three girls (Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, and Jessica Sula) are kidnapped by a man named Kevin (James McAvoy) with dissociative identity disorder, who has 23 prominent personalities, each with peculiar or dangerous idiosyncrasies, who intends to prepare the girls for the arrival of ""The Beast"".<br/><br/>Anya Taylor-Joy (""The Witch"") plays Casey Cooke. Once again captivating in a role that doesn't require much of her. Now I should be honest and say, unlike the other two victims, Casey is strong willed and smart with the choices she makes. But her overall arc is something of a mystery until the final act. Stoic and timid, for the first two acts of the film, her eyes speak volumes, holding her own against McAvoy's Kevin. A creative choice on Shyamalan's part, as Anya plays her with caution, allowing you to perhaps doubt her intentions in the end game.<br/><br/>Haley Lu Richardson (""The Edge of Seventeen"" and Jessica Sula (""Recovery Road"") portray Claire and Marcia, who unlike Casey, impulsively plot their escape within each scene. Both actresses are fine in their respected roles but like ""Marion Crane"" in ""Psycho"", Shyamalan chooses not to flesh them out or focus the story on them.<br/><br/>Betty Buckley (""The Happening"") returning for another go-around with Shyamalan playing Dr. Karen Fletcher, a psychologist who attempts to help Kevin. Her devotion and love to her patients, Kevin, in particular, is earnest and loving, as she truly wants nothing more than to help and understand (D.I.D.).<br/><br/>James McAvoy (""X-Men: Apocalypse"") as Kevin is perhaps given the best role of his career (If you count ""Filth"", ""Atonement"", and ""Trance"") as the Scottish actor not only manipulates 23 different voices, four whom in particular are fully developed, he vigorously changes and manipulates his body - Distinguishing all 23 personalities, including the arrival of a ""24th personality"".<br/><br/>Shyamalan who wrote and directed has cited this as one of the hardest films to make in his career. With 2015's ""The Visit"", Shyamalan has expressed interest in focusing on movies he wants to make, with a smaller budget and shroud of secrecy Shyamalan may be back in his wheelhouse.<br/><br/>Despite the success of the film, it has received backlash and criticism for Shyamalan's beliefs in (D.I.D.) ""Split"" unlike his previous movies will raise intentional questions, forming more theories for Shyamalan to embrace over time."
"SpoilerAlertReviews","7","1","9","30 January 2017"," Shyamafans will love it, haters gonna hate it & non-fans will miss the point.
","M. Night Shyamalan has fast become one of those Marmite directors, dividing people into two camps of love him/hate him. Myself being a big fan of his earlier films like Unbreakable and Signs, yet I could appreciate the criticism The Sixth Sense received from people who figured it out. But what I really like about Shyamalan work is his love for his art, his passion reminding myself very much of my own. He's a fanboy who watched films as a child and wanted to do nothing else but make movies, and that admiration and influences can be clearly seen. So regardless whether you like his films or not, no one can question his dedication and the fact he is a very good, and well respected filmmaker. Yes, some of his recently catalogue is questionable with films like The Last Airbender, The Happening and After Earth, but still his understanding and use of the moving image has always be exceptional. I have yet to watch The Visit. <br/><br/>This time round, he could safely hide behind the outstanding performance of James McAvoy's multiple characters causing quite the stir among critics and viewers alike, you could almost forget you're watching a Shyamalan film until the very end, which might be lost on audiences not familiar with his films. It is interesting to know that Joaquin Phoenix was originally casted to play the multitude of characters, especially seeing the viewers reactions to McAvoy's impressive range. Makes anyone wonder how this portrayal might have been with Phoenix instead. <br/><br/>The film is about McAvoy's team of personalities, that abduct three teenage girls and hold them captive for reasons unclear. We get to meet a few of McAvoy's 23 characters each with their own agendas, mannerisms and behaviours. There's inner conflict and potential betrayal, some characters being under ""house"" arrest simply for not agreeing with the other personalities. It's truly astonishing to watch McAvoy and I don't think I could ever watch him again the same way. <br/><br/>It's good to see Anya Taylor-Joy so soon after Morgan and The Witch, wondering if she's go for something completely different like her co-star Haley Lu Richardson, who in last year's Edge Of Seventeen. It's Jessica Sula that doesn't quite sell it for me. Taylor-Joy is brilliant as the introverted, unpopular girl with something to hide. Betty Buckley reunites with Shyamalan and plays a superb Doctor who is possibly the closest thing McAvoy has as a friend, and instead of treating him, she's mostly encouraging him to explore his personalities. <br/><br/>I think Shyamalan missed a trick and I know audiences would be demanding answers if I did it my way, but maybe we would be better not knowing what happens to the girls, though the full reasons as to why is left totally unexplained. But instead of what I consider a cheap shot, I think a more intriguing hint would have been more effective. <br/><br/>West Dylan Thordson replaces Shyamalan's regular composer James Newton Howard and gives us something quite sinister and very different. Different, probably to try to emphasise the various characters of McAvoy, but the score does cover a board range, the looming, low hums being what I remember most. <br/><br/>Shyamalan has stated this to be his most challenging and longest film to date, and while it shows McAvoy's amazing talent, I wouldn't place this as this finest, it's not anticlimactic, but I was excepting something, stronger? More horrifying than what was presented. Still, fans should love the ending, haters gonna hate and non-fans unfamiliar with Shyamalan are going to wonder what all the fuss is about. <br/><br/>Running Time: 8 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 7 Creativity: 6 Soundtrack: 6 Job Description: 7 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 just for the surprise ending, I'm a fan so it worked on me. <br/><br/>73% 7/10"
"mfletch79","5","1","9","30 January 2017"," SPLIT decision. Good but not great
","Let me start by saying that UNBREAKABLE is one of my favorite films so it's good seeing MNS doing something near to his previous best and although i think that SPLIT is worth a watch unfortunately it's not as good as many on here have suggested.<br/><br/>For me it falls between two stools, it's not scary enough to be called a horror film or suspenseful enough to be called a psychological thriller.<br/><br/>Basically the plot revolves around Kevin (an excellent James MaCavoy) a man with 23 different personalities that range in different levels of threat, from 9 year Hedwig to the soon to arrive 24th personalty ""the BEAST"". Kevin kidnaps 3 teenage girls and keeps them captive in an unknown location, they must now try to escape before the BEAST finally manifests itself.<br/><br/>The stand out performances are James Macavoy is absolutely brilliant as Kevin, seamlessly slipping from one character to another and Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey, the only one of the three girls who actually realizes whats going on and using survival skills that she has learned from years of being abused tries to manipulate Kevin's friendlier personalities to help her escape.......I found Casey's back story more disturbing that the main story.<br/><br/>POSITIVES: Great performances, Interesting plot, Casey's back story.<br/><br/>NEGATIVES: Too long, too many scenes were the same, the David Dunn twist at the end just seemed desperate, and when the Beast did FINALLY arrive he just wasn't scary and it just felt like a rip-off of An American Werewolf In London (but not as good)<br/><br/>Definitely worth the price of a cinema ticket, just don't expect anything close to THE SIXTH SENSE or UNBREAKABLE. 6 out of 10 movie, 5 of those stars just for James Malavoy."
"ghatfield69","8","1","9","29 January 2017"," Tense Movie Well Acted!
","First off I really enjoyed this movie. James McAvoy was amazing at best. Cycling through several of his inner personalities he was funny and downright terrifying. The tense scenes were with the psychiatrist as she probed Kevin to see what personality was currently in the light. Anya Taylor –Joy was a perfect casting. She portrayed her damaged character very well. Her back story was very troubling and important to the story. As for the other 2 girls they had very little parts and did some dumb stuff to get the tension going. When Kevin is finally consumed by the final personality (The Beast) he gains super human strength. It is explained that people with several personalities may have different needs or abilities depending on which personality is currently active at the time. One personality needed insulin when the host did not. Not sure if this is factually true or just movie fluff. Once Kevin turns beast mode the movie turns more into a horror film. I didn't mind the switch up because the movie needed to peak at that point. After Kevin kills the others, he corners Casey in a cage and realizes that they are both damaged by past childhood events and spares her life. You notice on Casey's body she has permanent scars from child abuse. Kevin was beaten with a wire hanger as a child. Very deep, dark and sad. Once Casey is found the movie revels that she was captive underneath the Tiger cages at the Zoo. Seems Kevin absorbed his last personality from the tigers. As for the so called twist that everyone has their panties in a bunch, It just a reference to unbreakable not a twist! You see Bruce Willis in a diner answering a question about a name the news station gave to a person. ""Glass"" was the answer. It was an Unbreakable reference. Not a twist! Kevin is not found which opens up for another movie. I would give this movie a solid 8."

","spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers<br/><br/>Okay, that should be far enough ""spoilers"" where someone who has not seen the film cannot accidentally see this.<br/><br/>The thoughts I had after leaving the theater are as follows:<br/><br/>1) Both Kevin and Casey were victimized and had different ways of dealing with the abuse. Kevin was surrounded by personalities that tried to protect him from his abuse. For Casey cutting and isolation permitted her to keep living.<br/><br/>2) For Casey, both Kevin and Uncle John continue to live giving her more pain to live through.<br/><br/>3) For Kevin, the beast did not die leaving him brief moments of surfacing before another stronger personality gets off the chair forcing themselves in the light.<br/><br/>4) While Casey's entire existence appears bleak and tortured, she is in touch with her pain and does what she can to keep surviving. <br/><br/>5) Whenever Kevin surfaces he does not how much time has passed and what he his personalities have done while he is in the dark leaving him to consider suicide as the only way out.<br/><br/>6) During the diner scene when Mr. Glass is referenced and David Dunn answers the woman's question it was a hopefully a nod to another film with Mr. Glass, David Dunn and Kevin. <br/><br/>I am so tired of hearing about the Universal monster films being remade in a shared universe with characters being in each other's films. I wish Universal would have done what M. Night Shyamalan and Marvel films (e.g Nick Fury and Tony Stark meeting at the end of Iron Man) did and let us find out at the end of a film. Instead we have a fun concept with a many years of gestation. If M. Night Shyamalan does not do a shared universe movie with David Dunn, Mr. Glass and Kevin then I have just typed a paragraph that means nothing.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really liked the film and hope that you did as well."
"ctowyi","7","1","9","28 January 2017"," M. Night Shyamalan's one big step in the right direction
","M. Night Shyamalan is back! No, not the The Happening-Lady in the Water-The Last Airbender-After Earth toxic one. It's the Unbreakable-Signs-The Sixth Sense celebrated one. I wouldn't say Split is as great as his earlier films, but I can safely attest he has taken a giant step in the right direction. <br/><br/>Split is a psychological thriller built on a ""what if"" - what if a man with 23 personalities kidnaps three young girls and a 24th personality threatens to appear in the looming horizon. How will the game be played with the 24th? Will anyone survive? <br/><br/>Shyamalan's films always adhere to an over-used template in which the final twist of the knife is the whole selling point and he draws compelling characters and builds a grounded story to encompass it. If the film works, especially his early ones, the twist is the most memorable aspect that is seared into your brain. In his successful films, the twists always feel earned. With Split, Shyamalan doesn't quite tread the same path (some of you may think the final scene has a OMG-WTF twist, but I see it more as a clever coda with a link to an earlier film). The conceit of movies involving characters with multiple personality disorder is that the revelation of the mental illness is the eventual twist, with movies like Psycho (1960), Dressed to Kill (1980) and Identity (2003) coming to mind. Split wisely stayed clear of the well-trodden path and is able to give us a different type of monstrosity, holding my attention throughout. <br/><br/>All would be naught if not for James McAvoy's tour de force performance to sell the premise. He plays all his roles with chilling finesse. With a variance to his voice, mannerisms, facial expressions and body language, he sold every character with aplomb and then some. As I typed this out, 9-year-old Hedwig and matronly Patricia still send shivers down my spine. The three girls also gave excellent performances and their character traits efficiently differentiated for interesting group dynamics to happen in some kind of evil lair. But we are clearly persuaded to follow Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) whom I last saw in the outstanding The Witch (2015). In clever flashbacks we are given crucial context of how Casey's mind ticks and how she stands the best chance of escaping this terrifying ordeal. But will she? Finally, there is Betty Buckley who is sympathetic as the psychiatrist, but being a professional in her field some of her actions beg for scrutiny. Some of her expositional dialogue also drags the movie down at some spots. <br/><br/>The tension is neatly build up to a feverish climax with a whole suite of cinematic tricks thrown in for good measure. I was perched on my seat as the story closes on an impactful soul-searching note. It was a very satisfying ending for this reviewer with his wifey in equal agreement. Then, if that's not good enough, trust Shyamalan to lay one final moment on you that will make your jaw hang open in a mixture of geeky joy and pure shock. Oh yeah... make it happen pleaseeeeeee!"
"reznors_chick","7","1","9","27 January 2017"," watch it
","The acting really makes this movie. Much more so than the story itself. Granted the actors do have quite a good story to work with. Featuring 3 younger girls. 2 of them I barely remember. I don't know their actual names, or their character names and honestly don't care to. They were just there, and were so far out-shined by the other actors. The movie at times was very tense. It's pretty straight forward. No mystery to try to figure out. Not a lot of gore. Would not call this a horror movie. I would place it in the thriller genre. Not sure what genre it is actually being categorized as. M. Night really did good with this one. Even if you typically don't care for his movies I would still give this one a go. The last time I seen one of his films in theatres was The Village, so I did go in with a lot of hesitancy, but he proved that like anyone else, sometimes he does bad work, and sometimes he really gets it right. I daresay this will probably make my top 10 of the year."
"ThomasDrufke","6","1","9","27 January 2017"," The Broken Are the More Evolved
","It's fitting that a film released by one of the most divisive directors of all time is titled Split, seemingly welcoming 'split' opinions from audiences. And yes, I will consider myself one of those audience members who is 'split' on his views.<br/><br/>I've never went out of my way to see any of M. Night Shyamalan's films. There's something off-putting about knowing there's a twist coming rather than letting happen naturally in a film's plot. And with Shyamalan, you know there's a twist coming. It's virtually impossible to talk about this film without spoiling anything so here's your final chance to stop reading before this review goes off the rails.<br/><br/>So I guess this film is related to Unbreakable, one of Shyamalan's films I have yet to see. Or rather, can be considered an indirect sequel to the beloved 2000 superhero thriller. The uniquely disturbing lead character(s) from Split, played by James McAvoy appears to be yet another enhanced human in the Unbreakable universe. Having not seen that film yet, it was hard for me to get excited about this relation at first, especially if this was the ""twist"" everyone was freaking out about. With that said, the fact that Shyamalan was able to hide this from the general public up until the film's premiere, is impressive and unprecedented.<br/><br/>So aside from the divisive ending, I found the entire film to be just alright. McAvoy was always magnetic, even as the terrifying beast or the irritating Hedwig. The Visit was a nice return to form for Shyamalan and Split definitely proves he is capable of making of cohesive thriller once again. The one problem I've always had with his films is that they seem to depend too heavily on the big twists instead of making a film stand on its own. For something who hasn't seen Unbreakable, I'm not sure it does stand well on its own. I think I'll be able to have a better appreciation for Split once I see Unbreakable, but a film shouldn't be dependent on another to succeed. Even the best Marvel Universe films, which spans nearly a decade of world building, can stand on their own.<br/><br/>If I'm grading the film based on the powerhouse that is McAvoy, then I can give it my stamp of approval. But everything outside of his performance, is just average. I realize not having an actual opinion is unproductive in terms of a review, but I'm not going to pretend that I really enjoyed or really disliked the movie. So for now, the jury is still out on Split.<br/><br/>+McAvoy<br/><br/>+Shyamalan improves on thrills<br/><br/>-Twists & turns didn't have the biggest payoffs, for me<br/><br/>-Nothing too special<br/><br/>6.1/10"
"xoxo411","8","1","9","26 January 2017"," A Case of True Counter Transferance
","The split begins rather drastic from scene 1. There is no time to relax ever. There are 3 victims who are all teenage girls but one of them has had a tragic past and an ongoing tragedy. it is understood that this person ""S"" has many personalities and as it is always an intense disorder, the therapist tend to get over involved in true life situations as well. Here the Psychiatrist has already intense counter transference even after she was warned by her close colleague.The skillful director has kept the thrills and temperature of the movie rising higher and higher in a linear scale, without which we would have lost interest. At the end of the movie I felt fatigue and exhaustion and I mean that. This is the kind of physiological reaction I need in a thriller. You must also see it."
"danielharden","8","1","9","26 January 2017"," The Twenty Fourth Sense
","M. Night Shyamalan is a director who has had his fair share of ups and downs over his career. He was Oscar nominated for The Sixth Sense and was once predicted to be the next Steven Spielberg, but he's also suffered had one hell of a streak of bad movies, winning 4 Razzie awards for such films as; The Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender. Now off the back of the moderately well received film The Visit, Shyamalan is looking to propel his career back in the right direction as he releases his next film Split. Split stars James McAvoy as a man with 23 different personalities who kidnaps 3 teenage girls in preparation for the arrival for a 24th personality, the Beast. Split keeps Shyamalan on the right tracks and is itself a good psychological thriller.<br/><br/>The best bit of the film by far is James McAvoy. McAvoy is given a very difficult task of having to portray a total of 8 different personalities, but not only that, he sometimes must switch between each one within a single take. You can always tell who McAvoy is due to the slight facial expressions, mannerisms and tones of voice that he exhibits. He's scary, creepy and will make you laugh at the same time. It's mesmerising to watch and is a perfect performance, which I personally believe is a real Oscar snub.<br/><br/>Anya Taylor-Joy is also pretty good in this film, portraying the mysterious social outcast character who is pretty well explored in this film. The way Shyamalan deals with her character throughout the film is very well done, but due to the spoiler sensitive nature of psychological thrillers I'll leave it there.<br/><br/>Shyamalan's writing and directing are great as the film is very suspenseful and clever, like any good psychological thriller should be. Shyamalan also masterfully places moments of humour throughout that doesn't in anyway lessen the suspense of the film and actually adds to it. The film feels reminiscent of The Silence of the Lambs with its setting and tone, to which Shyamalan has obviously used as inspiration, but has done so brilliantly. Like most Shyamalan films, the ending is key. It either can either make or break the film, often due to Shyamalan's love of a twist ending. I will not confirm or deny the appearance of this Shyamalan trademark, but what I will say is that the ending makes sense and is pretty thought provoking, unlike some of Shyamalan's films *cough* Signs and The Happening *cough*.<br/><br/>Overall, with a faultless James McAvoy performance, solid script and direction, Split is a great psychological thriller that M. Night Shyamalan can be proud of. Shyamalan is back and he is out for redemption. Let's hope he's left the After Earth ""I like it but I think it might be bad."" days behind him once and for all. Fingers crossed."
"autisticreviewers","9","1","9","25 January 2017"," Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.
","""Three girls are kidnapped by a man with a diagnosed 23 distinct personalities, and must try and escape before the apparent emergence of a frightful new 24th."" M. Night Shyamalan is back again. We will admit we were never a fan of Shyamalan's recent movie ""The Visit."" It was too boring and the handi cam was just getting too old. But the movie ""Split""....now that's a whole different kettle of fish. This movie really keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time, and that's mostly because of James Mcavoy's amazing performance(s). Mcavoy was able to keep it serious, while at the same time not making it a laughable personality. Some of the personalities are just laughable but somehow Mcavoy makes it as realistic and believable as can be.<br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan doesn't bother wasting our time with character development...he gets straight to the point, and then bit by bit introducing us to the characters as the movie progresses. Anya Taylor Joy was almost as good as Mcavoy. Her character was the most calm, the most sensible and the most darkest. Normally (like the other 2 kidnapped victims) they tend to scream, make stupid decisions and are just asking for trouble, but the character Casey (played by Anya Taylor Joy) is really well developed and extremely well played.<br/><br/>The only complaint would be the pacing. The slow pace does eventually lead somewhere great, but it did take its time. Eventually leading us to the finale Personality known as ""The Beast"" it really is breathtaking to say the least. All in all...aside from the pacing M. Night Shyamalan really has made a huge improvement since ""The Visit."" This movie is highly recommended. See it in theaters if you can. Loved it. Definitely James Mcavoy's best Performance of his career. Sadly, he will miss out of Award nomination,s but it's still is best Performance ever put to screen. The Autistic Reviewers give this 4.5/5 stars. 9/10. Check us out on facebook!"

","M. Night is alive & kicking & has come out with a tense thriller with just a tad of horror added for good measure. James McAvoy was amazing playing a man, Kevin with 23 different personalities who kidnaps 3 young ladies & keeps them locked up. Most of his personalities appear to be harmless. One personality, Hedwig, is funny as hell & I was amazed at how effortlessly McAvoy transitioned from a funny 9 year old to a gay designed to a menacing control freak & was totally believable as every personality he portrayed.<br/><br/>Hayley Lu Richardson was great as one of the kidnapped girls & I especially loved the flashbacks showing her character as a small girl. Betty Buckley was terrific as Kevin's psychiatrist & her interactions with several of Kevin's personalities were well written & helped to clarify who was who in Kevin's mind.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, the tension builds to a crescendo when we find out that there is a possible 24th personality emerging in Kevin which brings the horror aspect of this film up front & center.<br/><br/>The ending is satisfying with a cool final scene with a totally different but very well known actor showing up.

That's what makes a great MNS film its the bits you just don't see coming , it cerebral horror not gruesome graphic gore.

"NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954","7","1","9","23 January 2017"," Find Out Why James McAvoy Has Done Awful Things to People, and Why He'll Do Awful Things to You in Split
","He's Coming For You<br/><br/>So the prime plot of the film is, Kevin has so many personalities and each passing day he has more and more trouble controlling his personalities. He abducts three teenage girls, and these teenage girls have no idea where they are. They wake up in a large dark basement, they are freaking the hell out, they don't know why they are there, and they are thinking well damn today I might actually die. These girls are introduced to Kevin's personalities. Not all 23, because that would be too long of a film. However, we do get to meet some very interesting split personalities/identity disorders. When these girls first come across Kevin, they think he is just a crazy man. Five minutes later Kevin comes back, only this time he is wearing a dress, wearing high heel shoes, and speaking in womanly voice. I love the expression the girls had on their face when they first see this. The look of, ""Did this man seriously kidnap us to show us his acting abilities? Are we at a dinner theater? Is this what they call improv?"" Not exactly, each personality has some plan for these girls. Some dangerous, some not so bad, but all very creepy. <br/><br/>I don't know if this makes much sense, but the real stars of the movie are Kevin's identity disorders/split personalities. You can actually feel James McAvoy having fun with all these characters on screen. This is the role of a lifetime for any actor that wants to show his or her acting strengths and range. Some of his personalities are really intimidating, and others not so much. For instance, we are introduced to a Barry. Barry is one of the 23 split personalities Kevin suffers with, and Barry is a fashion designer. Even though Barry comes off easy going at first, when his psychiatrist Dr. Fletcher has a long conversation with him, Barry slowly becomes unstable and has that awkward crazy stare. So in a way he has personality disorders within his personality disorders. <br/><br/>""My name is Hedwig. I have red socks.""<br/><br/>I know this film seems like it has many characters to balance out and sit through. However, we truly do feel a somewhat connection to these characters. Now a majority of people felt something for Hedwig. Hedwig is another personality we are introduced to. Hedwig is a nine year-old mentally challenged boy. Hedwig and Casey form a bond with each other. I thought it was funny and sweet when Hedwig asked to kiss Casey, and Hedwig said, ""You might be pregnant now."" Hedwig is supposed to be the one character that makes us feel sympathetic for Kevin. But honestly, Mr. McAvoy did such a great job of making all these personality traits feel crazy, it was hard for me to feel that emotional attachment to Hedwig. Really, most people in the theater seemed to love him, but I was sitting there saying to myself, ""I don't care if your name is Hedwig, you have red socks, you have a collection of Kanye West albums, you like to dance, and you want to kiss me. At the end of the day, you kidnapped me; you're crazy as all hell, so screw you!"" Maybe that's just me though.<br/><br/>Accordingly, Anya Taylor – Joy is easily starting to become one of my new favorite actresses. She has been doing very well, especially in the horror/thriller genre. I would like to see her become a future scream queen in this genre of film. I liked her in The Witch and Morgan, and I liked her character in this film as well. She has a backstory and flashbacks of her father, uncle, and hunting trips that connects to the audience emotionally, and adds to the story. It's her back story that leads her forming a relationship with Kevin. <br/><br/>My only problems with the film are some scenes do drag just a little bit and at times it is the typical fight for survival formula. So these are my Final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Split. I think this is movie filled with great tension, performances, and a beautiful welcome back for Mr. Shyamalan. Trust me the twist ending was really good! The audience members at the movie theater were all going bonkers, buck wild, and gaga. No one saw the twist coming. If I were you I would avoid spoilers, because it makes the ending that much better. I won't spoil the ending for you, I'll just say watch one of Mr. Shyamalan's previous films. Is this his best film? In my opinion no, but it has be intrigued to see his next project. I believe Split earns a<br/><br/>7 out of 10!"

","I have heard good buzz about this film and I wanted to see this film even though I am not a big fan of horror films. But I really enjoyed this film especially since it is actually a psychological thriller instead of a horror film. The premise of this film sees three young girls get kidnapped by a man who has 23 different personalities. James McAvoy plays the guy with the different personalities and he is absolutely amazing in this film, this is one of the most unique performances I have ever seen. He plays all these different personalities flawlessly, he has many different personalities he has to be and he gives different unique performances for each one and it proves he is one of the best actors around today. Anna Taylor joy plays the main girl in the film and she does a great job, you care about her situation and you want to see her survive the ordeal because she has a bit of edge to her and it makes her a pretty interesting character in this film. The other girls she is captured with are pretty good in the film too and I thought McAvoy's doctor was good in the film as well. The story has a great story seeing these girls especially the main one trying to survive this unique experience while trying to use some of McAvoy's nicer personalities against him. However, there are really pointless flashbacks used in this film about the main girl and they just don't do anything for the film and come across as pointless and just filler. Also I think too much time was spent with the doctor that could have meant more time with McAvoy and the girls which is more interesting. The script has great dialogue that especially McAvoy delivers superbly, there is allot of drama but subtle humour as well that does work. The style of the film is very slow paced but I thought it was interesting for the majority. Unfortunately there is just a few too many exposition scenes with the doctor that I didn't care for and the last 20 mins did feel more like a generic horror film that did upset me. Overall this film is a great watch if you like slower more intelligent thriller films then this is a must watch for you."

","Yes I gave the film a nine. I personally enjoyed it regardless of what anyone else thought. The story was unpredictable when it comes to character actions and their final destinations in the plot, for the most part. I don't care about being kept guessing but more on the authenticity of it. As the film goes on and you learn more about the main characters, you can understand each and every one of their actions(Why they do what they do). <br/><br/>The story jumps from modern day to Casey, the female lead's, childhood. It shows a troubled past, the same as the lead character played by James McAvoy. The story really plays off of child abuse and shows the difference between the two leads and how their abuse has affected them differently. For the sake of entertainment, James's character is of course more fun to watch but in reality, would be horrifying. <br/><br/>The acting is great all around. But, like most I assume, I was drawn to this by James McAvoy, and not because of x-men. I like films off the mainstream because they usually aren't messed with by studios much. One film I very much like with McAvoy in, is Filth. If you've seen Filth, you'll understand how his character in that movie has - well it's very eccentric anyways so clearly he has the will to do the Split characters. <br/><br/>Shyamalan was not in The Visit but he was in this. Because it's his official comeback? Hopefully. He wrote a twist that's not much of a twist to the story so much but to - well I don't know. The connection to Unbreakable was awesome in it's own way. When I heard ""fifteen years ago in a wheelchair"" I yelled out Mr. Glass a few times in my head (I didn't want to make anyone mad by yelling it out loud). Shyamalan always said if he made an Unbreakable 2 that it would be much different to the first one. So is Split kind of a sequel? And if so, is this technically a comic book movie in the way that Unbreakable was? Who knows, but if they leave this as it's own film but let it bring a full film crossover sequel to Unbreakable, then I'm on board. Just take your time!<br/><br/>I personally will view Split as it's own film because I think it's much better that way but again, I absolutely loved the ending and I did get very excited.<br/><br/>The negativeness about the film and how DID is read wrong is incredibly annoying. It's film.. My dramatic arts teacher taught me that when you write a script, just make sure it's not too real; people like the fantasy. Anyways I could get into the fact that there are plenty of films that expand on medical problems to make the films better, same with films based on true stories. But come on, it's a movie. <br/><br/>So all in all, McAvoy was a blast and all of his characters. The story was solid and creepy. I did laugh at his portrayal of his Hedwig character because he did it so well. It was funny to me because it's an adult acting as a child. As the character in the film however, it was creepy. <br/><br/>Shyamalan did a great job all around and I hope he puts this film up as an example to all future projects. Personally I think this film is a masterpiece. Must watch film!"
"thetobster","9","1","9","22 January 2017"," This movie is amazing
","For the most part I only have positive things to say about this movie. James McAvoy's performance in this movie is phenomenal. Every single character that he portrays in the movie feels like they're actually different actors.The only negative thing I can think of is that the two supporting female characters both act like cliché horror movie characters in that they only think about escaping McAvoy's character. I must address the elephant in the room, M. Knight Shymalan is famous for his twist endings and this movie is a little different. I'm not going to spoil it but all I can say is that if you're trying to figure out some sort of twist ending while watching this movie, don't because you'll miss half the movie. This movie is definitely not for everyone but I think if you pay attention to the movie while watching it, for these reasons ""Split"" deserves a 9 1/2 out of 10."
"kastenmeier-andreas","9","1","9","22 January 2017"," Good Old Shymalan
","It's hard to talk about this movie without spoilers, but i will do so. Don't expect big Twists at the end of this movie. Shymalan is finally smart enough to keep them away for consistency. This movie is his best work since Unbreakable. <br/><br/>The main two characters are fleshed out in a very nice way. Both McAvoy and Joy are showing very good performances. Especially James McAvoy shows a wide range and joy of playing. With subtle changes in facial expressions, body language and speaking he manages to handle all his personalities and their interchanging.<br/><br/>M. Night Shymalan also manages to tell the story in a compelling and interesting way. The only flaws are some performances of the supporting cast. Also some parts of the story will definitely be hard to buy into for some viewers. Nevertheless, i would recommend this movie to all people who like exciting thrillers."
"ruth-35131","9","1","9","22 January 2017"," More Scientifically Accurate than it Seems
","As a psychology major, I was super excited to see this film. As a fan of James McAvoy, I knew I had to see this movie. And it lived up to my expectations. There's so much we don't know about Dissociative Identity Disorder and so much to be learned. It was cool how this movie explored the disorder. According to what I've learned in school and the research I've done on this disorder, the movie is pretty accurate with science. Some of the movie is hard to believe, and I'm sure part of it was impossible, but people with DID can change the physical chemistry of their body, to some extent. It's true that they can have an allergy to something in one state of being, and not have that allergy in another state. People's adrenaline can make them stronger than they normally would be, so it's possible The Beast could be much stronger than the others. However, I'm not entirely convinced he'd be able to just magically climb walls like it's a rock-climbing wall. You don't just need strength for that, you need support and the wall of the room The Beast was climbing didn't look very climbable. Furthermore, most accounts of DID come from ongoing physical, emotional, or sexual trauma in their past, like with Kevin. Usually there's at least 3 personalities represented: the original, a child, and an angry, sometimes dangerous person. Kevin has all three represented in Kevin, Hedwig, and Dennis, in addition to the other 21 personalities. Sometimes the third personality is based on the patient's abuser. In this movie, however, I think The Beast was an exaggeration of how he saw his mother. She had the power and the strength to hurt him as a boy, represented by Hedwig, so his subconscious took on the role of The Beast. Now, he has the power. He has strength. James McAvoy did phenomenally with this role. The other actors were all right, too, but McAvoy was brilliant. All in all, great movie, but it really depressed me when Casey had to go back and live with her abusive uncle. I suppose that's pretty realistic, but I was really hoping this experience she went through would give her the courage to tell the cops or somebody about what was happening to her. Although, if they weren't listening to her cries for help during school, when she was acting out, perhaps she felt they wouldn't listen to her now."

","Before I state my thoughts on this movie I would just like to say that there is not way I can talk about this without spoiling the movie at least a little bit, so keep in mind that this contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The genre of movies that Shyamalan is known for is his additions to the thriller genre. While I haven't watched any of his previous films, I was going in blindly, although from the reviews I've seen of this movie, I was expecting something good and I wasn't disappointed. As stated in the synopsis, this movie is about a man with multiple personalities who kidnapped three girls in which they try to escape from their confinement.<br/><br/>I found the movie engaging from minute 1 to the end. I really liked the acting performances in this, especially with James McAvoy in which he had to act out multiple different people in a body, which results in interesting, bizarre and, on occasion, comical depending on who he's portraying.<br/><br/>Another aspect that I found interesting about the film is the flashback sequences that help flesh out Casey's character. It truly does help build her character and gives a fascinating look at it.<br/><br/>The intense moments like when the girls attempt to escape really help bring out the thrill, even with something like the build up to the conclusion brought out an adrenaline rush in me.<br/><br/>If there was one minus I had for this movie, it would be that the ending would be confusing to the people who haven't watched his other films, I know it confused me until I researched it and it's something that brought the film down for me, but even with that, I found the film intense, thrilling and it's something I recommend to those who enjoy horrors/thrillers."
"cruise01","7","1","9","21 January 2017"," Split exceeded my expectations and may see a comeback from director after several duds with his films.
","Split is one of M. Night Shyamalan's better work so far and he has been having a lot of duds with his previous films. He is a hit and a miss with his films. Split is an entertaining effective psychological thriller film that showcases James McAvoy's performance as a guy with 23 personalities and his mysterious 24th personality that would soon arrive. <br/><br/>Kevin (James McAvoy) kidnaps three girls Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula), and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy). He sticks them in an underground basement. Tries to take care of them, so they can meet the 24th personality known as ""the beast."" I will say the plot was very intriguing and it is best not to reveal too much. It is better seeing the film and being surprised by the twist. Sure, audience will again either like the end results or hate it. I will say it is not the best movie. It could have been a whole lot worst. <br/><br/>The concept was interesting with a guy having multiple personality disorder. And how every characteristics was prepping for the mystery 24th personality. The script does add some strong thematic situations that focuses on Casey and the flashbacks of her camping trip with her father and uncle. Yet again, cannot say much more. Her past will come into a factor during the climax. I did not find Split to be scary; I think it plays more as a thriller. The tension slowly builds up to the climax. Which the film can get slow and dull for a moment. During the second act, with the three girls trying to figure out how to escape and trying to understand Kevin's personalities. And maybe trying to outsmart one of them. Also, in this act, we have Barry (one of the personalities) that is constantly visiting psychologists Dr. Karen (Betty Buckley) for a quick therapy session, which she is trying to connect for his sudden behavior. Once, the 24th personality is revealed, the suspense is non-stop until the end. <br/><br/>James McAvoy gave an impressive performance, granted only portraying a few personalities on screen. If it was not for him, feel like the film would not have been as good. Anya Taylor-Joy gave an emotionless performance as Casey, who is haunted from her past and being kidnapped with her friends. She is an up and growing actress from films like The Witch and Morgan. <br/><br/>Split is an improvement for an M. Night Shyamalan film. Most of his films have been pretty boring or had a terrible ending like The Visit, The Happening, etc. But he does have some standing work like Signs. The ending in Split, may have the audience talking right after and discussing the possibility. I liked the direction he was taking Split and the concept idea. It is one of those films you need to see for yourself.. I ll recommend Split, if your looking for thrills or enjoy M. Night's mystery direction. Split is a pretty fair film that exceeded my expectations and I dislike most of his films."

Night Shyamalan, who has had some ups and downs as far as his movie successes have gone. He did good on this one. James plays a man with 23 distinct personalities and he does a great job portraying each one of them with unique, individual physical gestures and even facial movements. Betty plays his psychiatrist that is trying to help him cope with DID- Dissociative Identity Disorder-which used to be just called having multiple personalities. Along comes a 24th personality called the Beast that takes charge and makes James kidnap 3 teen-aged girls and seclude them in a basement. Anya happened to be at a party for Haley when James makes his move on his intended targets of Haley and her other friend so Anya is just at the wrong place at the wrong time. But, there is more to things than first thought, as to be expected in M.'s movies. The rest of the movie has the girls trying to escape while James visits Betty to try to straighten himself out before the Beast takes complete control. Oh yeah, M. makes a cameo appearance and there is a connection to one of M.'s other movies-it is better to be surprised than for me to give it away here. It's rated ""PG-13"" for behavior, violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD."

His acting is very amazing. He changes his voice for each character. Its outstanding how well he does this. I got very weirded out one point in the movie but the rest was very suspenseful.

"coreyjdenford","8","1","9","20 January 2017"," He could split any second
","This review of Split is spoiler free <br/><br/>**** (4/5) <br/><br/>Around the turn of the 21st century and even just before it, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan created a whole new genre with films such as the Oscar winning The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs: films with such intricate character studies with a deep paranormal vibe in even the littlest of characters, he even created a reverse spoof effect whereby (ghosts, superheroes and alien invaders) naturally through playing some tongue-in-cheek are sometimes presented in high seriousness, through intense sometimes scary, anguished central performances from even the most established male movie stars, and keeping the recurring theme of end of the reel twists which he associates through most of his films. He succeeded so well that there are even many signs of his success through some other director's films such as Joel Schumacher's Number 23, or Alex Proyas' Knowing both with Shyamalan-esque twists.<br/><br/>Perhaps as a deep response to his success at becoming an imitable brand and perhaps down to the muted (and sometimes peculiarly hostile) response to The Village, Lady In The Water and The Happening (two of them are interesting films), Shyamalan moved from the tight vice-like grab of his personal cinema to take a shot at fantasy (The Last Airbender), sci-fi (After Earth) and found footage shocker (The Visit) let's just forget about those. With Split, he returns to 'Night Classic' mode. We're back in Philadelphia where soft-spoken, well-heeled simple go quietly mad and a psycho thriller that evolves into something weirder on the boiling-a-frog principle of slowly adding bizarre, perhaps sometimes freakish elements to an extreme truth-telling case study of one person or in this case 23 people. This time, perhaps frustrated by the attention paid to the easily parodied habit, Shyamalan eagerly holds off on a twist in favour of a measured well-constructed development of a far-out premise, though there is an intensely fan-satisfying development that pops up near the end.<br/><br/>All the actors involved, James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy etc. want to play Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and McAvoy seizes some of his antics with obvious relish on the role of man named Kevin, with 23 different personalities then to be eventually usurped by a 24th which is more animal than man. His head is finely stubbled as his Professor X cut grows out, he only uses a few props been supplied to him such as a pair of glasses and a woolly hat, but he mostly conveys Kevin's alters - from a gay fashion designer, to an OCD caretaker, a sinister British matriarch and a tittering small child - with a change of expression and voice. Granted it's a show-off tour de force performance, but McAvoy plays it well, though we only get to see nine of the 23 personalities which he can change into very easily with just an eye twitch reflex, he plays every one of them with perfect clarity - he's funny, creepy, threatening, pathetic and monstrous by turns. Note especially through set-pieces like his perfectly uncoordinated, crazy demonstration of what a nine-year-old might think are radical dance moves, and the unsettling moment where one of Kevin's more controlled, yet sinister persona impersonates a more open, appealing to reassure his analyst (Betty Buckley) through some unorganized appointments that things aren't going south in his skull.<br/><br/>Though as often with Shyamalan, the actual as intricate as it may be is less important than the character studies. Even Kevin loses keen interest on two of his young captives, who get shoved into separate storerooms as misfit Casey (Taylor-Joy) emerges as the brave heroine, realizing she's most likely to survive by engaging with her captor rather than escaping by crawling ventilation ducts or relying on teen-princess karate lessons. It's fair to say that her life experience has prepared her for an ordeal such as this which is established in tactful, yet unsettling micro-flashbacks showing her traumatic life with some standout work from young actress Izzie Coffey, who's giant wide-eyes match Taylor-Joy's. It seems fair to say that after her performances in films such as The Witch and Morgan, Taylor-Joy is shaping up as the weird chick of her generation - but she has to work as hard as her brave character to find her proper screen-space here when her co-star is busily upstaging himself, as well as she is.<br/><br/>VERDICT: This is an engaging thriller that's sometimes terrifying, it's provocative and it's thoroughly entertaining with an awards-caliber performance from McAvoy. It's fair to say Shyamalan is back to his best and is presumably here to stay."

","I am an avid M Night Shyamalan fan and was pleasantly surprised by this comeback.

Granted, that is not to say it does not have its own flaws but overall it is a great film. It also felt a little different from his other movies but I am anxious to see what's in store next. <br/><br/>As with any M Night movie, there were parts that seemed slow, but still engaging. I felt this was a good buildup to the climax which had me GENUINELY SCARED. The tone was dark and there were many times where I just did not know what was going to happen next. <br/><br/>As for what I felt were some of the film's flaws, I would have liked to see more than just a handful of the 24 different personalities that were advertised. But this is also where I felt the film was incredible, and if James McAvoy does not win a ton of rewards for his performance we have another Leonardo DiCaprio Oscar situation on our hands. The ending was satisfactory but at the same time somewhat irking and will definitely leave you using Google as soon as the end credits roll."

"CinemaClown","Null","1","10","7 April 2017"," M. Night Shyamalan's Road To Recovery Continues With Yet Another Competently Crafted Horror
","From the writer-director of The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable & The Visit, Split is a small-scale psychological horror that marks another right step in M. Night Shyamalan's road to recovery and finds him making skillful use of his rediscovered creativity & passion to put up a simple structured, competently crafted & morbidly humoured chiller that's dark, mysterious & wickedly amusing.<br/><br/>The story of Split follows a trio of teenage girls who are abducted by a man diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder and who has manifested a total of 23 different personalities so far. With no one to rely on but each other, the girls try to compel one of his identities to help them escape and must do so before the emergence of a far sinister & frightful 24th persona.<br/><br/>Written & directed by M. Night Shyamalan whose filmmaking career has seen both soaring highs & crushing lows, Split is a more confidently executed feature from him that makes efficient use of all his trademarks, and keeps its tense vibe alive from beginning to end. The characters do lack flesh on their arcs and are thinly sketched but their predicament is still relatable to an extent.<br/><br/>Shot majorly in a single location, the isolated setting do bring a sense of unease into the story and it is further enhanced by its smooth handling, sharp focus & controlled movements of the camera. Editing briskly paces its 117 minutes narrative, few scenes are drawn out longer than expected and its eerie tone rarely goes away. The film keeps throwing surprises throughout its runtime and few of them manage to stick.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast consists of James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Betty Buckley & Haley Lu Richardson, with McAvoy & Taylor-Joy chipping in with commendable work. Not all the 23 identities appear but McAvoy does well with whichever ones make it to the final print. Taylor-Joy is just as good if not more and the moments between the two make up for the film's best segments, plus it only gets better as plot progresses.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Split is a well-directed, well-scripted & well-performed horror that may not be as memorable as the finest examples of its genre or even Shyamalan's best works but it definitely ranks as one of his better directional efforts. Enjoyable, entertaining & quite satisfying, Split is a thrilling ride that keeps the viewers engaged in its premise from start to finish and wraps itself up with a game-changing final twist that no one saw coming. And for that alone, it's worth a watch."
"don_juan","6","1","10","27 February 2017"," Had potential but......
","This movie had a lot of potential but I feel it was wasted. <br/><br/>*Spoilers*<br/><br/>Whilst the girls are in captivity, you do feel involved with them and you feel genuine feelings of hope/let down when they are about to escape/get captured.<br/><br/>Though you can't help actually getting annoyed with the female main character. She does certain things to make you think she's a smart survivor (for example telling one of the other girls to pee herself to avoid being sexually assaulted), but then other things she does makes you want to scream in her ear.<br/><br/>Firstly she seems to encourage the other girls to try to escape, but doesn't do anything to help. She sits there the majority of the time with a stunned mullet expression on her face. Examples: -When a total strangers sits in their car and begins to put a face mask on and spray her friends with a knock-out gas, she just sits there instead of opening her door running and screaming (she subtly tries to open the door but then stops when the car's warning chime comes on), then patiently waits for man to put his mask back on and spray her. -When one of the other girl's hits their abductor over the head with a chair, she just sits on her own chair without getting up and also beating him.<br/><br/>There are other major peeve moments in the film. For example, she sees a name written on a random piece of paper, but she somehow knows that this is the abductor's real name and he will become ""sane"" again when this name is called out loud. She had no way of knowing this.<br/><br/>Another example, is right at the end when a woman in a diner is watching the news story, and says something like ""That's like that other guy 15 years ago"" *cue the Bruce Willis cameo mentioning that the man's name was Mr Glass. This case is nothing like the Mr Glass case. This is the abduction of girls by someone with split personalities, whereas Mr Glass was basically a terrorist.<br/><br/>The ending is lack luster too, the main lead seems like she's ready to go back living with her abusive uncle. There's some BS Midnight Shyamalan 'twist' where they turn out to have been kept under a zoo.<br/><br/>The portrayal of the bad guy was done well, and well acted. However, it is very hard to feel scared by him. I constantly felt that if all 3 girls ganged up on him, they could have easily beaten him up (especially when in his female or child personality)."

This has come to an end with Split, an intriguing psychological thriller that taps into the world of multiple personality disorders and unlocks the potential that this condition has for a thriller. While signs (or Signs!) of his Sixth Sense promise do shine through, it's still all a pretty hit and miss affair with some major flaws.<br/><br/>In what's at the very least a challenging performance, James McAvoy has to portray twenty three different characters inhabiting one body and mind, and yes, as others have noted, he does do a pretty brilliant job, especially with such a heavy workload on him. Although the character's motives for the multiple kidnappings or his ability to carry them out with such an affliction does make you wonder, before it builds up to a nonsensical ending where he's turned into some werewolf type thing, that messy, self indulgent and overly labourious.<br/><br/>Although it's just slightly above rather than below average, to be honest 2003's Identity took this concept of a psychotic multiple personality and worked it to much better effect, and in half the time of Shyamalan's skin of the teeth comeback. ***"

For the most part, you can see where this film is going but its still ""jump in your seat"" terrifying, when the moment of real horror, finally arrives. <br/><br/>I think a special mention needs to be made of the performance by James McAvoy. He's simply exceptional in the role of Kevin, a man who appears, on the surface, to have multiple personalities, when in fact its clear something far more awful is going on. <br/><br/>Perhaps, my only criticism here, is the handling of the end of this film. Personally I felt, the physicality of the final scenes of this film, would have best been cast aside in favour of a ""less is more"", approach.Seeing the victims reaction to an unseen horror, they are finally confronted with, would have offered, I believe, far more emotional impact. Not to mention being more in keeping with M. Night Shyamalan's typical approach to direction.<br/><br/>That said, this remains an excellent film, that's really quite special. Nine out of ten from me."

","Heard about this in Uni via a friend of mine, though when I looked it up it was more a thriller than a Horror, though it's branded & is a Horror with a Psychological Theme laced into it! It was actually really good, though I honestly don't think it's the best I've seen it was a good watch!<br/><br/>The film is about a man who has a mental health illness, his name is Dennis & he has 23 different personalities with the 24th being the most deadliest out of them all! He kidnaps 3 young teenage girls & locks them up in a cell together. Throughout the film, he switches from at least 10-15 personalities in the space of roughly over 30- 40mins of the film. The girls have to not only how to escape their incarceration, but to escape Dennis & his f**ked mine & personalities by over coming & winning over each before the 24th & most deadliest comes!<br/><br/>It's not bad considering the It's an M Night Shayaman Film! The guy who produced Devil in 2010 & also made The Visit in 2015 it was a good film, definitely above average, though not really good enough for me to buy it on DVD in 3-4 months time! But it was good! The female actresses were gorgeous honeys too & I especially liked Anya Taylor-Joy! She was great & adorable in it! Shes drop dead gorgeous generally! James McAvoy does a good job in this flick also!<br/><br/>It wasn't bloody, though it did have some violent scenes in it. So at least that was something. I would say it was too psychological for my tastes as I myself like gory, bloody in you face horrors with more obvious concepts!<br/><br/>I give this an average rating of 7/10, it was a good watch, though not the best I've seen.

"bryank-04844","7","1","10","23 January 2017"," M. Night Shyamlan is quite excellent.
","M. Night Shyamalan has sure given us some wonderful and unforgettable films over the years. Somewhere along the way, Shyamalan lost his way as a filmmaker. So much so, that the studios would leave his name off all advertisements for the movie. It wasn't until 'The Visit' when Shyamalan came into the good graces of his fans again. Perhaps this is because he only had a very small budget to work with and got creative control without a ton of studio interference to do his own creative work. Now we have a new small budget film from Shyamalan called 'Split', and is yet another step forward for the filmmaker in the third part of his career, which seems to drop the Spielberg aspect and go straight for the B-Movie genre.<br/><br/>This is where Shyamalan succeeds where so many others have failed. He's made a B- Movie with elegance and class that makes you think outside the box and keeps a high amount of suspense from start to finish. Sure, there are aspects to this film that are silly, over-the-top, and downright laughable at times, but it is more of a nervous, uneasy laugh, as we see where Shyamalan takes us. The film is simple enough, as we see three teenage girls kidnapped, (the main one being Anya Taylor-Joy from 'The Witch'),and brought to an underground basement somewhere by the likes of a man with split personality (James McAvoy), or shall I say 24 different personalities. We don't know why he has taken these three girls really, but he does reveal some sinister clues as to perhaps why they were chosen.<br/><br/>His different personalities range from manly scholars, to endearing women, to an 8- year old kid, to artsy yuppies, and more. And McAvoy plays each of them perfectly, as he mixes their personalities with a certain kind of gentle yet horrifying way. As time passes, we see each split personality give clues as of what's to come, yet the burn and suspense is so high that you will be on the edge of your seat through the whole film with sweat pouring down your forehead. Shyamalan is not afraid to go to some certain dark places here either, as we see in some flashback sequences, and I applaud him for that, even more so for keeping the film with a PG-13 rating, but still managing to show enough to get the point across.<br/><br/>Again, there are some fairly silly moments here, but they do serve a purpose in the overall story that makes this one big success for Shyamalan. Now for the moment of Shyamalan's calling card – a twist ending. Well folks, there isn't one. You read that right. There isn't one. It's a straight and narrow approach, but an effective approach. 'Split' is a very suspenseful B-Movie that achieves its goal from square one, which is to entertain and put you on edge, and keep you guessing until the very end. Shyamalan has sure found his calling card in the third act of his career and I hope he sticks with it.<br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

","Mysterious man with many distinct personalities (James McAvoy) kidnaps three girls and holds them without much explanations. What is going on and do they have a chance to get free again?<br/><br/>Even once-biggest fans of M. Night Shyamalan such as myself have to admit that, as a filmmaker, he is not nearly as good as he used to be. <br/><br/>The breakout hit ""The Sixth Sense"" is still my favorite but his zenith came with 2002's ""Signs"". After that, the good going just, er, stopped. The same can be said, by the way, about Mel Gibson's acting career, who starred in ""Signs"".<br/><br/>So what happened? Shyamalan just suddenly lost his steam. Every later project I've seen has been artistically limp, pompous and/or bit weird in a bad way. True, I have skipped ""Wayward Pines"" and ""The Visit"", so maybe they are the exceptions.<br/><br/>M. has always known a thing or three about creating dark gripping atmosphere and characters we can root for but I think he is seldom good at moving the story along and making it compact. <br/><br/>Thus, many bits or scenes in his movies are strong and/or fresh but the whole thing gets kind of tiring as it progresses. <br/><br/>This is also exactly how I'd sum up ""Split"". Pure Shyamalan, with all his usual strengths and weaknesses. It has lot of good stuff going on. I like everything here separately... but the whole thing just does not come together.<br/><br/>""Split"", too, goes to three different directions at once. None of them is really effective and satisfying – although could be if given more room and care – which is the main problem bogging the result down.<br/><br/>By far the best part is to watch James McAvoy playfully juggle different personalities, managing to move effortlessly from horrifying to funny to pathetic to kind of cool. <br/><br/>It has to be the most interesting acting work anybody has ever had a chance of doing in Shyamalan movies which are known for one-note lead characters (not necessarily a bad thing but still). Although i don't understand the point of having 24 personas if we only get to see 8 of them. Were the others put on hold for the possible sequels?<br/><br/>So. ""Split"" is better than expected – although almost anything would be after Shyamalan's double death punch of early 2010's (""The Last Airbender"", ""After Earth""). And it has the second-best ending we have ever had in a Shymalan move.<br/><br/>Is it enough to give Shy another chance? Yes. But I'd still approach his future project with caution. The man has a long way to go back to the top. <br/><br/>In the world full of me-too horror and thriller movies, usually relying on cheap scares (such as sudden sound effects), he could be one of the true auteurs. But he can't do it alone. He needs someone who will help to put all his ideas in tight compact packages."

","""Split"" is a 2016 thriller directed by M. Night Shyamalan starring James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy. It has been quiet around the infamous Indian-American director Shyamalan, who landed some surprise hits at the end of the millennium, such as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" and that granted him fame as a great Hollywood writer-director before creating one flop after another (there are countless, but remember ""The Last Airbender"" and ""After Earth"") in the following fifteen years or something. People believed he simply forgot to make decent films and that he would never really make it to the big screen again. That's why nobody really expected it that he would come back roaring with a banger like this feature. There's almost nothing about it that's worth criticising. James McAvoy hands down delivered a masterful performance that has never existed like this before. The way he portrays six different personalities, switching within minutes is just mental. It really gave me the feeling that I was spectating six different actors and had to remind myself multiple times that it's just this one Scottish genius. He definitely steals the show from everyone else involved, but Taylor-Joy gave a brilliant performance as well. The way she presented her shyness was somewhat sweet and how she showed both restraint and yet acted actively in every situation was superb and an proof of how versatile her acting range actually is. Both protagonists showed extreme raw emotions that fit well into the tense atmosphere. Furthermore, the story was intelligent and extremely interesting as it has created a character that has so much potential to become iconic. I was sitting there with unmeasurable fascination for this insane lunatic and followed every second in awe. I think it's also notable how the story combines an original and ingenious idea with a subliminal reminder that mental illness and trauma are problems in our society. Also, how the film combines metaphors (long hallways with cables and pipes) and visual symbolism (most shots are literally split in half and extremely dark!) was genuinely exciting. Additionally, the Predator-And-Prey allegory gave it an extremely sad undertone that gave both characters a whole new dimension to them and actually made me feel bad not only for Casey, but also for Kevin. Until the end I couldn't tell what is going to happen next and this made it so horrifyingly packing. It's also and advantage that the violence in this flick is not all too graphic and mostly takes place in the viewer's head. All in all, I'd say that MNS celebrated a magnificent comeback with this crazy thriller that should've granted McAvoy at least one Oscar nom. I'm actually stoked for the apparent prequel and the badly received sequel. To this point, I'd say that the director is back and that deservedly. Hopefully, he doesn't destroy what he has built up with this..."

"angelsim","9","0","1","3 November 2019"," A Quick Review
","Two word: 'James McAvoy'
While Shyamalan obviously had a very interesting idea for the movie, going deep into human psychology, James McAvoy is the person who carried the whole movie.
What an amazing performance! When he was supposed to represent another one of Kevin's personalities his whole appearance even changed! Instantly not only his voice and expressions switched, but his whole body gained a seemingly different physique and posture! Even with him not saying a word you could tell that he is playing a different role all of a sudden.
What took me out of the experience is the child actors who just were not believable at all and to the people that are going to defend them saying that this is due to them being young I'll just say this: Haley Joel Osment in 'The Sixth Sense' - he was much younger than them and yet gave an amazing performance! So I simply cannot accept age as an excuse in such a high level production.<br/><br/>I would definitely love to see more of that type of movies that dive into human psychology as it is something that I feel like is not explored enough in movies, even though it can lead to some masterpieces that touch the viewer in so many ways..."
"nch-35770","2","0","5","28 October 2019"," Overhyped
","Yes McAvoy's acting is good, but we all know he's Scottish and can do 60 accents so that's nothing new.

I hope the two other girls in the movie didn't quit their day jobs..."
"plucsenecal","7","0","1","24 October 2019"," Stellar acting can't save everything
","I remember a few years back, when the film garnered important media attention, namely because of McAvoy's supposedly outstanding performance. In my mind, this somehow placed the movie in the ""good flicks"" category, and I've been eager to watch it ever since.<br/><br/>First off, yes, McAvoy is stellar. The virtuosity required to switch so smoothly from a character to another is astounding. His voice work, his perfectly controlled mimics and quirks... This is great acting in the making. And yet, the movie is not great. A good entertainment, sure, but not great.<br/><br/>An hour in, the writing starts feeling clunky, increasing the film's overall lack of focus. What is this movie about? Is it about MacAvoy's DID condition? Is it about Anya Taylor-Joy's childhood trauma? Her fantastic acting can't hide what might be an unfortunately shallow part and uninspired directing/staging. Betty Buckley feels very much like a tool of the plot, only present for some ""exposition writing"". Same for the 2 other girls, that were close to useless. The hunting scenes in the wood/animal metaphor was too loosely connected, making the reveal of the location more surprising than shocking. Too many things felt forced, and the whole mystery and excitement surrounding the film was shot down by details and explanations that should have been dropped out.<br/><br/>Compared to what I consider to be better movies (ex. 10th Cloverfield Lane, Identity), the film is too spread out. The scenario dilutes the actors' awesome performance and characters potential, and gives a movie that could have been so much more with so much less."

"Cineanalyst","4","0","3","7 October 2019"," 24 Frames of Mind
","Although some critics and fans--backed up by box-office receipts--claimed this as writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's comeback, ""Split"" is nevertheless an exploitative, derivative and incongruent horror movie. Like some of Shyamalan's other post-""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) debacles, one can see how it could've been a better picture had the project not been of such an errant mind--straying all over the place--and, ultimately, relying upon a series of clichÃ©s--most blatant of which is the filmmaker's trademark twist endings.<br/><br/>There's a lot of trash here: it's yet another movie about a psycho abducting, holding captive and terrorizing people--usually young women or teenage girls. Dissociative identity disorder is exploited for the fear of people with mental illness (although, I suppose, it's good that filmmakers seem to have finally learned that schizophrenia has nothing to do with multiple personalities--good riddance ""Sybil"" (1976)). Sexual abuse is exploited for some screwy, Nietzschian moralizing regarding that which doesn't kill you only making you stronger. Both the mental illness and the child abuse are tied into Shyamalan's usual pseudo-religious supernaturalism. And, perhaps worst of all, the supernatural here extends to one of the most flagrantly contrived and tacked-on surprise endings when ""Split"" is tied-in to a shared universe with ""Unbreakable"" (2000), via a cameo from Bruce Willis in an utterly stilted scene, and setting up the subsequent cap to the trilogy, ""Glass"" (2019). The coda of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" (2016), another movie about a young woman trapped with a nutcase, almost seems organic by comparison. Perhaps only ""The Mummy"" (2017), in failing to launch the Dark Universe, has done so poorly in recent memory to establish a shared cinematic universe and been such an excruciating example of MCU piggybacking.<br/><br/>Of all the divergent threads here, the one I think was promising was the potential self-reflexive allusion to cinema. ""Unbreakable"" succeeded in this respect by reference to comic books, and ""Glass"" extends this further cinematically. Several elements for something similar are presented in ""Split""--beginning with the actor/spectator dichotomy established at the outset with the well-made abduction scene. Although the main girl, Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), is first seen as an object to be viewed, as the other two girls and one of their dads look on, the abduction scene places her firmly as the watcher, or the surrogate spectator for us movie-goers. The other two girls are oblivious nitwits throughout. A series of car mirror shots and obscured views from Casey's point-of-view support this. James McAvoy's madman is the actor in both senses: that his actions tend to advance the plot and that his split personalities form a performance for Casey to observe--whether to see his reinterpretation of Norman Bates from ""Psycho"" (1960) through a crack in a door or to watch him dance by invitation.<br/><br/>He also makes webcam movies of his various personalities, which Casey views. In fact, this is what helps set her free. Yorgos Lanthimos made this self-reflexive connection much better in ""Dogtooth"" (2009), another and far-more-disturbing and intelligently-made film about captivity and perversity. In ""Dogtooth,"" the captivity of the characters became a metaphor for the spectator's illusion of being held captive by the film itself. In ""Split,"" however, one wonders whether Shyamalan even meant to do anything that wasn't entirely superficial. For instance, I doubt the reason McAvoy's character has 24 personalities has anything to do with classic film having been photographed at 24 frames per second--especially given how far removed movies are from such standards (like most movies nowadays, ""Split"" is all digital), and, besides, we only see McAvoy portray six of those characters. One could just as well read in an equally pointless exercise in numerology that 24 refers to the number of hours in a day.<br/><br/>Additionally, the Beast personality hinted at the promise of ""King Kong"" (1933)-like self-referentiality--where the monster's attack from a stage after being captured by filmmakers suggests his being analogous to cinema. Thus, it might have been intriguing had Casey emerged from beneath a movie theatre instead of--of all things--from a zoo. (They're all held captive--get it?) On second thought, for a movie and script that is this crowded and unfocused--like a zoo, as the idiom goes--that may be the most appropriate setting."

"bob the moo","Null","0","1","22 September 2019"," Feels like a first draft, albeit one with strong performances and decent premise
","It was the recent release of Glass that made me decide to watch this film, despite its so-so reviews; I wanted to watch the former, and it didn't feel right to skip right to it. The film opens with a creepy setup, and gradually plays out the multiple personalities of the main characters, while at the same time increasing the tension through the peril of the young women trapped somewhere. In terms of stakes and tension, it mostly does it well, with an escalation as the film goes, but the film is not tight enough to be event driven, and at two hours there is lots of material which seemed intended to do something, but mostly doesn't deliver.<br/><br/>It is an odd film in this way, because there is a lot here to work with, but too much of it is superficial. It plays very much like a first or second draft; so for example there are elements so undercooked that it feels like the type of material that would have been taken out later down the road to try to make more space for other elements, or just recognizing that it adds time but not value. Casey's flashbacks add almost nothing - not because they are a bad idea, but because they are not worked through enough; the film would have lost almost nothing by removing them. Likewise, the battle within the main character doesn't have a sense of struggle really; it could have been much more, and thus the conclusion could have been more impacting, but it doesn't have much in the way of weight or emotion behind it. Again, there was much more writing and refining to be done here.<br/><br/>It is a shame, because the cast deserve more than they have to work with. McAvoy is great as he slips between characters totally convincingly; he throws himself into this and almost singlehandedly makes the film worth seeing. Taylor-Joy is almost as good because of how she plays her fear; while the film doesn't help the viewer connect to her 5-year old self, the actresses seems to have found it, and there is more in her performance than the film lets us see. Probably the blame should be laid at the feet of Shyamalan; he wrote and directed this, and it is very his type of weakness - he wants the concept and idea to be the thing, but the depth etc he is not often able to find. The film running long and having too much in it is probably down to him too - editor Ciarrocchi seems to have his career thanks to Shyamalan, so he is unlikely to be tough in the edit.<br/><br/>Split squanders a lot - a couple of very good performances, and a generally interesting concept and through-line mostly. It lays out its plot in semi-cooked chunks and then serves them up like an early draft - some of it needed chucking, and the rest needed improving; but it doesn't do either."

"araperasjose","9","0","1","20 May 2019"," This was so good.
","I must mention James McAvoy's supporting performance as The Horde. His portrayal of a man with 24 unique personas is frightening, hilarious, and shocking. His sudden jumps between multiple characters even within the span of a single scene is beyond impressive. His seamless transitions and subtle shifts in his physicality and gait are interesting unto themselves. When all McAvoy's choices are combined into his depiction of Kevin Wendell Crumb is daunting to endure his genuinely intimidating stature and acting. He really gave each personality unique voices, stances, movements, and clothing to establish them as separate characters for his portrayal as well as differentiating them for the audience. Split is a stage for McAvoy's brilliant acting!"
"cliftonofun","6","0","2","18 May 2019"," Same old Shyamalan
","The issue with recent Shyamalan movies has never been style or execution. Unfortunatey, though, his solid (and often gorgeous) film making often hides a fundamentally flawed story - desperate attempts at his trademark twist, shoddy character development, giant plot holes. Sometimes he nails it, but sometimes he misses badly. Since this one did well at the box office, I assumed it was a return to form. Kind of? I mean, there were some really interesting suspense and horror moments. The central characters were mostly developed well. But the resolution (like many of his films since - well - Sixth Sense) tried a little too hard. It was solidly entertaining, but not one I will think about much after this."

","The movie's first two acts are great, thrilling and incredibly set up by M. night unfortunately it gets a bit convoluted at the end, BUT that's not what my review is about. It's about the acting in this film because good lord, James McAvoy delivers one of the best performances possibly ever. I don't see how anyone I could argue that.

","With the hyped up release of 'Glass', I decided to watch 'Unbreakable' and 'Split' to see what all the commation was about. I enjoyed both films prefusely, bit I do favor Split over Unbreakable. I'm a huge horror movie fan, and not that much into superhero or action movies so call me biased if you please.<br/><br/>The acting was phenomenal, especially from James McAvoy, and Anya Taylor-Joy. Though not all the characters were developed, Kevin, Casey, and Dr. Fletcher felt very fleshed out. Sounds great right? Well... Every other character (Including Casey's two friends - who were also kidnapped) feels bland and forgettable. Another problem is; despite having 24 personalities, we only see about 10 of Kevin's idienities, and, though seeing the movie 3 times, can only remember 4...

The major trick up the M.

"sonybhuvanendran","10","0","3","4 February 2019"," Master of screenplay is back with his unusual, a spectacular thriller
","Split is a new movie from an Indian-Born Hollywood filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan. Outrageous, deliciously thrilling and simply brilliant are some of the ways we can describe this artistic visual aura.<br/><br/>Story opens with a bravura opening shot of three young girls Casey, Claire, and Marcia getting kidnapped by Kevin who suffers from dissociative identity disorder right in front of you. Kevin is the main character played with great perfection by James McAvoy as he has many characters in the movie namely Dennis, Patricia, Hedwig, Barry and the ultimate Beast, the 24th character. Dr. Fletcher is the psychiatrist in charge of Kevin's case. On the other hand, among the three kidnapped girls, Casey played by Anya Taylor Joy with a traumatic childhood is the perfect foil. Intricate twists and turns keeps the viewers engrossed to the screen. Lots of scenes juxtaposes in and out leading to an unusual twisted ending leading to the revelation behind the dissociation of Kevin's 23 characters. Thordson's music gives necessary support. Mike Gioulakis' cinematography is another asset as most of the movie is indoors. This is homage to auteur of world cinema director the great Mr. De Palma and cineaste the great Mr. Polanski.<br/><br/>This is a sort of cinematic triumph for Mr. Shyamalan and a great comeback since ""the sixth sense, Unbreakable, and the village. This movie is truly worth watching. But, there is this hitch. Anyone who watches this movie should be able to answer the following three questions. A) Why Anya Taylor Joy is shown as coming out of the zoo during the ending part? B) Who brings her out from the zoo? And finally C) Why Bruce Willis is shown in the last scene and what is his relation to the story overall? If nothing you could relate in your mind to the above three, I would suggest a fine retuning of your brain is a necessity to watch this kind of a movie and ""Split"" is for serious movie lovers not for the graphical gizmo kind."
"shalabodov-32997","9","0","2","4 February 2019"," Shyamalan's third best
","Split was the biggest surprise of 2017 for me, partly because M. Night Shyamalan can make movie on both sides of the spectrum, some are masterpieces(Sixth Sense, Unbreakable), some are bottomless pits of garbage(Last Airbender, After Earth, The Happening). When I found out this was a low budget thriller, I was immediately hooked, because it's a style Shyamalan utilized before with The Visit. Having to work with very little money, especially comparing to his other work, Shyamalan was able to construct a subtle, intense, brilliantly acted, and incredibly shot film with the one of the best performances from James McAvoy and a slow study of a character with DID on steroids. The ending is Shyamalan's second best. It's pointless not spoiling it, Glass just came out, so let me say that I was shocked beyond comprehension. It got a bit over-the-top with the beast being real and crawling on walls, taking bullets, and crushing people's bodies but the twist fixed everything. Since this is a supervillain origin story, all of the over-the-top aspects of the film became automatically fixed and more appreciated. Watch this one, guys."

"lythis-love","1","0","7","28 January 2019"," Mental health problems should never entertain. A movie that brings modern psychiatric work into disrepute
","Wanted to watch the Movie as I just viewed ""Glass"" the other day, did not know it was a Triology.
First the movie itself: Multiple Personalities always sound fascinating - why not make a(nother) movie out of it. The Plot was quite clear within minutes into the film. It went on and on... like those teenager movies where they go camping in a haunted forest and one after another vanishes.
James McAvoy showed a superb performance with him changing personalities every other minute. He was the whole movie! He carried everything. The Girls and the Psychologists where forgettable.
Kidnapping movie, showing sexualized teenagers are stupid. Only Casey, who was abused herself, had some special abilities. And this must the real plot of the whole movie:
The ones who have suffered gain strength out it and develop some new powers. Casey staying calm and clever, Kevin becoming some super cross fit guy without training and knowing how. Mr. Dunn - nearly getting drowned by school bullying and now has visions what people are up to at the moment.
I don´t know if I can go with that... needing a Trauma to become especially powerful? Obviously here even getting criminal.
I work in psychiatric hospital for children on a closed ward .. and I am more then sure they would rather be normal, renounce the superpower and have not been traumatized???!
Anyway with movies like this, where someone with a mental illness(rare or not) does criminal things, brings modern psychiatric work into disrepute. In 2016 it should not entertain, it should educate that mental illness is as normal as breaking you leg and no one should be scared of them. I also urge the director, for gods sake, to even research those illnesses first and not bring in false information about DID. Shyamalan took a disease and invited it completely new, for dramatic reasons and in the end it just makes people with mental health problems look dangerous, evil and possibly criminal. Bad job!
Another plot whole that made me rage:
Cayses Story was shown with rape flashbacks all the movie along. How on earth could she stay calm through the whole film, being again in situation that might end up rape? Just at the end she showed some panic attack, which I believed her. I feel she, as a character, was really bad written."

"daniele-iannarelli","6","0","1","26 January 2019"," Dubious story, sloppy writing, great (McAvoy) acting
","I'll start by qualifying my rating...<br/><br/>The basic movie, I feel, deserves probably a 5 out of 10, but McAvoy's impressive acting has convinced me to elevate that to a 6.<br/><br/>The original 5/10 I'd considered is primarily due to how it spontaneously decelerated into a rapid slow down in its latter half. As a rule, a good indication/symptom of such a surprising turning point is when the viewer starts getting fidgety. Well, I got fidgety.<br/><br/>Although the storyline did contain some minor flaws in rationale in its first half, the major turning point, for me, came when Dr Fletcher - on visiting the nutter (Kevin) - realised something was seriously wrong and decided to investigate for herself. This was the film starting to get ridiculous.<br/><br/>Now any intelligent person, especially a woman (naturally/generally less robust, and therefore more vulnerable, than a man), and an elderly one at that, would keep calm, leave the place as was obviously able to easily do... and call the police, citing her qualification as a psychologist. But no, the character had to go and investigate for herself, thus risking her own safety and the consequent safety of any others she suspected of being incarcerated there. So, what happens? Yes, she gets killed... and this type of scenario has become a film cliché now.<br/><br/>Another ridiculous scene was the girl undoing a bolt on the outside of her door by using a length of weak coat-hanger wire... weak mainly because it was unfolded into a single strand!<br/><br/>The film left many key points unanswered. What happened to Claire's father? Where were the girls' families in all this? There was a (possible) 'suggestion' that Casey turned her uncle (who, it's depicted, imposed a litany of ongoing sexual abuse on her from a very young age) in at the end of the movie, having now found her epiphany and awoken from her personal guilt, self doubt and denial... but it wasn't made clear.<br/><br/>One of the major flaws was that there was no clarity as to what this film was. Was it supernatural? Was 'The Beast' reference to the Devil? The indication, at the end, was that Kevin took on the 'personae' of the predator zoo animals. Okay, so if it wasn't supernatural, how could Kevin have performed the superhuman/superhero acts that he did, like jumping barefoot off the roof of a train, running faster than a Cheetah, scurrying along a tunnel ceiling and easily clambering up vertical walls like SpiderMan or a fly or... something supernatural...?<br/><br/>Carey's epiphany was - I suppose - nicely highlighted towards the end when she was rescued/found in the cage. As she was helped out, the sun shone in from the window above and lit up the scene. This seemed to comply with both her epiphany and the ""light"" that Kevin discussed numerous times with his shrink... Dr Fletcher.<br/><br/>As for eating the girls... well, unless (as a non-supernatural ""Beast"") he had jaws and the appropriate animal teeth, this would've been virtually impossible, and yet he seemed to have eaten Marcia (without chopping her up) and at least some of Claire while still alive. Did she survive? Something else the writing didn't clarify, although we can probably assume she had been sufficiently devoured.<br/><br/>My scoring for this movie was elevated from a probable 5-6/10 to 7/10 thanks to McAvoy's excellent performance in the portrayal of a multitude of different personalities.<br/><br/>Although I'm not particularly keen on McAvoy, I do respect him as a very fine actor, and I think he did brilliantly in this. However, although his brilliance elevated the movie somewhat, it couldn't fully excuse the sloppiness of the story and the dubious writing (particularly later in the film).<br/><br/>The closest I've seen to McAvoy's superb psychological performance is a similar (but less personalities) portrayal of multiple personality disorder by Jonathan Banks in an episode or two of Hill St Blues in the 1980s. Although Banks did a helluva great job, I'm not sure he received the accolade he - in my opinion - deserved.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film did captivate my interest for the first half, but like so many films these days, it became both boring and somewhat ridiculous in its latter half.<br/><br/>I could be wrong, but was there a similarity to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" at the end of the movie, with Bruce Willis seated on a bar-stool, suggesting that the story is not yet ended and that the true monster of the story is Willis as ""Dr Glass""... just as Lecter was the true monster in SotL (particularly poignantly so at the end)...?<br/><br/>The film - I'd say - is worth seeing... if for nothing else, then at least for McAvoy's performance."
"the_sacrosanct","5","0","2","24 January 2019"," Middle of the trilogy and middle of the road.
","To be honest the trailer didn't impress me at all, so I wasn't going to watch it until I found out that it's the middle film in a trilogy starting with Unbreakable, which was a fantastic film.<br/><br/>McAvoy was undoubtedly the highlight of the main film, that said I think most serious actors would probably come out well in a role that demands they play multiple personalities. It's sort of what acting is all about, so this alone isn't worthy of the 10/10 plaudits that his performance seems to be garnering from some people here.<br/><br/>The rest of the film shifts between ""meh"" and *cringe* throughout. The ""kidnapped girl"" characters are hardly developed further than ""kidnapped girl"", with the aside of a cheap abuse backstory involving - you guessed it - an uncle. The psychiatrist is equally 2 dimensional, her only purpose throughout the film being to exposit McAvoy's character, which felt like a huge wasted opportunity considering Buckley's acting chops.<br/><br/>Anyway, I sat through all of that blah to be rewarded in the last two minutes by a blast of the still utterly chilling Unbreakable soundtrack and a very clumsy bit of scriptwriting hinting at Glass, which I have higher hopes for."

"jaredpahl","4","0","2","22 January 2019"," My Reaction to Shyamalan's Latest?... Split.
","You won't find me talking of the Shyamalannaissance anytime soon. Partly because I don't think the worst of the infamous director's catalog were that bad to begin with, and partly because his second ""comeback"" film (After 2015's surprisingly effective, The Visit), is not that good.<br/><br/>Split is a return to psychological horror for Shyamalan. It stars James McAvoy as a disturbed mental patient with 23 unique personalities, who kidnaps three girls in a mall parking lot, and keeps them locked away in an underground bunker. Their bid for escape provides most of Split's plot. The hook here is the multiple personalities. The film asks, what would it be like to be at the mercy of a man who can be anyone? One minute he is a calculated assassin, the next he is a loving nanny in women's clothing. Ok, interesting. Coupled with Shyamalan's skill with claustrophobic tension, there's a real winner buried in this story. Unfortunately, the movie we got doesn't work.<br/><br/>Split has been praised by many for James McAvoy's performance(s) as the diverse personalities. I guess this is my biggest issue with the film. I don't think McAvoy's acting is brilliant. In fact, I think it's a mediocre performance. His character represents a kind of acting exercise you might give budding thespians. Take a handful of wildly different people and make them distinct. On that level, McAvoy does just fine. But that's an acting exercise. A movie character, a good one anyway, needs more. It needs a spark that not anybody can provide. McAvoy's interpretations are simplistic and obvious. There's nothing under the surface. No juice to these people. They are written as cliches, sure (excitable young boy, effeminate fashion designer, etc.), but McAvoy simply mimics these cliches, rather than raise them to a higher level.<br/><br/>But it's not totally James McAvoy's fault the movie didn't grab me. M. Night Shyamalan turns in a script that is far below his talents. In addition to the girls' escape plans, the plot devotes a good portion of time to ""The Beast"", a personality of McAvoy's that is said to be supernaturally gifted physically. People talk about The Beast, warn of his arrival, and perform various other superficial tension-building dialogue. It all leads to an underwhelming climax that culminates in a Shyamalan twist that has no impact now that it has been revealed to the world. There's also the problem that Split is not very scary. The moments that are supposed to shock, are well-directed (Horror is where Shyamalan has always had a keen eye), but once again, there is a bridge they don't cross. I could sit back and remark at the craft of the tense scenes, but they never really grabbed me.<br/><br/>Split is not a bad movie, but it blows its opportunity to be good. There is an interesting idea, and a good horror concept at work in the script, but it needs another run or two through the typewriter. As it stands, it is not worthy of a recommendation from me.<br/><br/>51/100"

So will the girls be able to escape from this madman(Kevin) and his alter ego beast?<br/><br/>Overall this film is slightly disturbing in a way as we get to see Kevin as different people - both male and female and we also get to see him pay a visit to psychology nurse who deals with mental patients.<br/><br/>The reason I watched this was because I heard a lot of people saying it was good and that it's actually a sequel to the Bruce Willis flick unbreakable which came out in 2000 and there is a sequel to both this and Split called Glass.<br/><br/>
If your a fan of M Night Shaylan than check it out.<br/><br/>I found it not bad but I wouldn't watch it again ."
"nitzanhavoc","7","0","1","4 January 2019"," Definitely recommended, just bare in mind this could have been a solid 10 film. Unfortunate.
","I'd like to start off by saying that most of what this review is about to be is a statement of the obvious. Therefore, it starts with me stating the obvious and recommending that while you do take what myself and others have to say to your attention (as it's obviously of some interest to you or wouldn't have been reading this now) you shouldn't let any review, be it negative or positive, deter you from giving Split a fair chance. I'm about to dish out some criticism which might even exceed the compliments, and I still urge you to watch it. It's worth that if not more.<br/><br/>So first of all, like previous titles (namely 6 Souls / Shelter, which is pretty decent by its own right and also worth watching) Split not only fails in offering an even remotely accurate account of Dissociative Identity Disorder (NOT the same as Split Personality, by the way) - but obviously doesn't even try. Not to mention it's another one of these films in which the actual fear factor staying with the viewers weeks after is their ignorance of mental illnesses and their fear of the unfamiliar sadly translated to stigma. I am far from being a ""woke"" activist, but come on, at least try to get with the times, or at least not to make things worse for those battling psychological disorders.<br/><br/>Second, directly related to the aforementioned is the blunt use of pseudo-science (and I use the term loosely as there is hardly anything scientific about the portrayal of DID in the film). Using ignorance in order to present disinformation that ends up being perceived as disturbing and even terrifying only on account of said ignorance is not ""cheating"", it's simply a little cheap. And speaking of cheap - how could I ignore the plot twist and ending? Imagine somebody is asked to prepare a meat dinner. The guests arrive, the aroma surrounding the dining area is exquisite, and the host presents their creation - hamburgers. The ending of Split is equivalent to that scenario, in which the agreed upon rules have not been broken per se - only taken too literally and used to exploit an obvious loophole of which the decent thing would have been to ignore or at least overlook. The shift in definitions in order to fake a twist and the 10 seconds guest appearance in order to justify it are just like a hamburger diner - undoubtedly satisfying, even good, but cheap.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the acting. If anyone wasn't yet aware that antagonist James McAvoy is a superb actor, for instance if they missed on out on all the newer X-Men films, Split is absolutely a good way to become informed. He's professional, authentic and by all means a delight and the best feature of the film. Which is exactly the problem. Acting the role of different personalities (and operatively different people) residing inside the mind (and to all relevant extents body) of the same individual is really having to act the role of different characters, at times one after the other or even having a conversation with each other. McAvoy does that exquisitely, but simply not enough so. His impressive acting abilities only serve to emphasize this shortcoming, as it feels he's doing everything right yet still getting it wrong. I personally felt very aware that I was watching an act and completely lost all hopes of immersion (perhaps the most important component of a worthy viewing experience when it comes to Psychological Thrillers accidentally tagged by some as Horror). It didn't feel like different personalities in certain times, it felt like an actor failing to adopt the proper minute variations of body language, facial expressions and speech intonation. Very frustrating considering that after watching McAvoy's profound skills I simply feel this mission cannot be accomplished (I would be overjoyed to be proven wrong).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, while not nearly as impressive as McAvoy, have also performed in a level worthy of commending, and still wanting. The incredible Anna Taylor-Joy who had been excellent in The VVitch was great in Split, delivering a very relatable portray of a teenager dealing with severe childhood trauma. And yet, while most ""teenage girls"" stereotypic characters tend to be stereotypically and quite annoyingly overdramatic - Casey is under-dramatic to a fault. I do believe direction to blame, but still, you can't show her obviously terrified and yet so preposterously calm. As for Betty Buckley as the conflicted psychiatrist - again, impressive, but not nearly charismatic enough to confidingly deliver the character of an experienced professional. Again, I can only blame direction for these two cases of botched acting, as the cast seemed more than capable to deliver a better performance by far.<br/><br/>Having said all that - none of this criticism is experienced over the surface while watching. Split is suspenseful, entertaining and smart and I personally had a great time watching it, as I would have a great time feasting on that hamburger dinner. The reason that I unfortunately had so much criticism was that Split could have, should have and would have been a masterpiece with better direction and just a little more effort by Master M. Night. It makes me personally sad to see such wasted potential and such a mediocre utilization of God given talent. And yet, I've enjoyed watching it and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to just about anyone.<br/><br/>This has unintentionally been my longest review as of yet. If you've read this far, thank you!"

"colombam","2","0","3","19 December 2018"," Snooze fest. Same old horror movie synopsis
","Let me first state that I am not a big movie buff. I am just an average person who likes to be entertained by movies from time to time. So the people who have given this movie higher reviews may have a more deeper affinity for cinema than I do.
That being said, I become easily bored when movies take on the same, played out plot. The fact that three teenage girls are the ones that are kidnapped, and shown as stereotypically weak and defenseless, and a bit unnecessarily over-sexualized, made this movie cringe worthy. It may be acceptable in India to show off your male-dominated, pedophilic tendencies, but if M. Night Shyamalan is looking to have a prodominantly American audience, then he needs to keep up with the times. Show me a movie where the female characters are portrayed as something more than useless, and completely defenseless, little pieces of meat, then maybe that will better hold my attention, and I will show the director more respect for the message he/she is trying to portray in the film.<br/><br/>The only reason why I gave this movie two stars, instead of one, is because I felt that James McAvoy portrayed the different personalities very well."
"Snootz","5","0","2","6 December 2018"," Shock schlock
","First let me say that UNBREAKABLE was one of my favorite all time films. At the same time LADY IN THE WATER was one of my least favorite. M is a writer/director that tends to run the gamut from genius to ridiculous. In this film he accomplishes neither, winding up with a mediocre presentation that could have been so very much better if he hadn't decided to jump the shark several times.<br/><br/>Many claim this movie deserves 8-10 stars and I can understand why. It has all the wrapped-in-a-box elements for a thriller-shocker, including a twist on the main premise-- that of a man with multiple personality disorder.<br/><br/>However if we step back and view this film objectively we see marks of what have made many of Shyamalan's movies box office flops. While many applaud McAvoy's acting in this, from a professional point of view any decent actor could have pulled off the varied-but-2-dimensional cliche personalities portrayed. None of the personalities were individually all that deep, nor did they require any significant acting chops to pull off nuances.<br/><br/>Sometimes a single expression on an actors face or a phrase uttered a specific way immortalizes both character and actor. We really see none of this here. What we find instead are very-straight-forward portrayals of very-defined personalities, without the subtleties that could have made this film great.<br/><br/>One of the chief flaws in the film is Shy's decision to push the edges of the theme into near-supernatural instead of keeping it within the realm of believability. This ""jump the shark"" tendency has ruined more than one of his films. In this case, keeping the story grounded in plausible reality would have made it far more believable, and far more interesting.<br/><br/>MILD SPOILER ALERT. Stop here if you haven't seen the movie or read other reviews here-- because pretty much everyone knows about this by now.<br/><br/>It would have been believable if the ""beast"" character was super-strong because of the personality's boosting his adrenaline system. But changing his actual genetic code? That took this from the previously-interesting premise into just more of M's ""doesn't know when to not cross the line"" writing.<br/><br/>But it was the cringe-worthy gratuitous gore scenes at the end that spoiled the movie for me. Put simply: they were not essential to the plot, did not make the movie better, were not necessary. The movie might have even been better if Shy had decided on some other method of revealing the evil of the character rather than choosing cannibalism. If that choice wasn't bad enough, to be graphically clear the guy must have had his head half deep in his victims-- but then later showed pretty much no trace of blood on his body. This was simply unrealistic, since such as presented in the movie would have literally covered him in gore. Not only were those scenes unnecessary to the advancement of the plot (a poor choice thrown in just as shock schlock)-- they weren't realistic. That throws in bad directing on top of the existing insult.<br/><br/>Was the film interesting? Exciting? Hold the audience's attention all the way through? Yes. Was it cliche, predictable, unrealistic and ""too much""? Yes. It was a blend of potential brilliance marred by ""Well, we can certainly see what's coming next"" all the way through it.<br/><br/>As such this is not one of M's better movies. I found it disappointingly mundane, a story with great potential but filled with little to distinguish it from other movies of this genre. Subjectively it may appeal to some individuals. Objectively... it's simply not very good film making."

There are so many ridiculous moments in the movie i couldn't count. I will start with the beginning.
Where is the dad? He put him to sleep with this magic spray(which works in one second) but than he was gone? 
It gets always worse. The girls do nothing to the child version of him ??? Why??? They don't attack him or any other logic form of escaping.
Now okay maybe they are scared and stupid but the acting of all the girls ? It shows that anybody can be an actor. Thanks girls!
And really are you a psychologist lady? You make therapy sessions in your house? Like where are we? And which psychologists goes in the midnight to their clients house? Are you totally out of your mind??? 
Now the last part.. and very very frustrating.<br/><br/>He got shot with this huge gun, twice, one in the chest? And cause he is the beast he cannot be dmaaged or anything can kill him. Are you kidding me? And the philosophical qoutes hahahahaha really LOL. I'm sorry but it is very funny. <br/><br/>And my last point to this is that the scenes with the perverse uncle were totally unnecessary.

(Not even the girls themselves noticed at first!?!?). We know he had mental disorders, but what was the motive for the abduction? Why did he spent so much time and effort in securing the victims' environment if he had no plans for them? I understand he had multiple personalities, but it was just impossible for him to also change outfits so quickly when another personality took over. Spoiler alert!: why were the victims killed off-screen? I rooted for them, for goodness sake, but we don't even know what really happened to them. What does the ending mean? What was the whole purpose? I have to give the story a 5/10, but 10/10 to James McAvoy as the antagonist. He is simply BRILLIANT, and in my opinion carried the movie!!"

There was nothing much sexual, barely in language, and enough suspense and action to really pull you in with maybe a younger sibling.
The thing I didn't like in this film was some of the scenes and how disturbing it was. I also didn't like how only a handful of personalities were introduced.

Every personality is very different from the rest, and just with the way he talks or looks at someone, you can tell which personality is. Anya Taylor-Joy as the main girl was very good, this actress is getting better with each film that she is in. 
Another thing that makes this film so great is the way is shot, the cinematography here is beautiful. That together with the lighting and the amazing score, makes this film very claustrophobic. You do feel like you are in this space with them. 
This film is very well directed and the way they handle the score, you don't even know when the score will be introducing a very tensioned scene. And that the best thrillers do.
The ending of this film, is breath taking. I can't talk about it because this is a spoiler free review, but the way this movie ends, is just so good that OMG, in my opinion, this is my favorite ending of the year (2017).<br/><br/>If we talks about flaws in this movie, there is some expositional scenes that are kind of boring. The other two girls that were also captured by one the personalities of McAvoy, their performances were not that great and im some scenes, there are kind of annoying. But, this flaws didn't bother me in any way now that i watched it for a second time. Once you accept the story that is in front of you, this movie gets even better.<br/><br/>I love this movie guys, is more than recomendable, is one the best movies of the year and i would love to see a sequel of this movie. And thats why i'm going to give it a 10/10."

","'Split' refers to James McAvoy's split personalities - or dissociative identity disorder (DID) - of which he has 23. He plays Barry, Hedwig, Kevin, Dennis, Patricia and a few others you get to see. The film wastes no time, with him abducting Casey (Taylor-Joy), Claire (Richardson) and Marcia (Sula) and they all wake up in a strange room. You're then introduced to a few of his personalities - Dennis is mostly in charge - and they're not all malevolent.<br/><br/>He also visits Dr Fletcher (Buckley), who genuinely tries to help him and slowly figures out it's not Barry she's been talking to, but Dennis. The girls try to escape, but are thwarted, as it becomes a race against time before ""the beast"" arrives. This ominous arrival drives the momentum and plot. It's a little slow in parts, but keeps your interest throughout.<br/><br/>McAvoy is excellent, with his ability to change expressions, accents and mannerisms fantastic, and Taylor-Joy shows good depth too (Casey's childhood is slowly revealed to give background). The final 20min is frenetic and the ending is both scary, creepy and well-handled - except perhaps for the final minute cameo. Good to see Shyamalan back."

","I wanted to give my thoughts on this film because I recently re-watched it and I thought why not do an IMDB review for it?<br/><br/>First of all, I am a fan of M. Night's works like Sixth Sense, Signs, Unbreakable <br/><br/>I haven't seen some of his later films that got extremely reactions but I do know about them and I could understand where the hate for him was coming from back then when he made films like Happening and Avatar<br/><br/>However, his more recent work on The Visit was considerably better than his terrible films <br/><br/>And then came SPLIT, a film with a really interestingconcept<br/><br/>A man with multiple identities, not just a couple but, 20+ identities kidnaps 3 young girls and he has some plans for them, that's all I'm going to say because I can't dive further without spoilers<br/><br/>From the opening, the film does a decent job of getting your attention, you get hooked into seeing where it goes<br/><br/>The main protagonist played really well by Anya Taylor Joy is one of the young girls who get kidnapped and the way they slowly peel back layers of her character and you get to learn about her, you begin to see where she's coming from and you feel like rooting for her<br/><br/>This review can't be finished without talking about James McAvoy's amazing performance. He was absolutely fantastic in this film, he has shown a lot of range as an actor here, there was a lot of contrast between these personalities and McAvoy did a really good job of playing this character without being over the top. Almost all of his personalities are written and handled very well by Shyamalan and on top of that, they are complimented by McAvoy's performance<br/><br/>There's something about this film; it's the kind of film that needs you to be patient because as it progresses, you will find yourself questioning some things that happen and when all of it is explained, and you ""GET"" it, you are going to be pretty satisfied and it makes you see the film in an entirely different light <br/><br/>A small negative is that the film plays with the same old cliches of the kidnapping thriller genres while a positive would be that it mixes those cliches with an interesting new take on this kind of thriller story<br/><br/>Another thing is that the film can be slow paced at some parts, that is why I said, you would have to be patient<br/><br/>Some of the dialogue might feel like exposition-ery and a bit clunky, but it's kind of necessary, and the certain things that are resolved maybe could've been handled better<br/><br/>There are a lot of cool subtle details that you will notice if you pay attention and I noticed a lot of them on my second viewing after many months of the first time I watched it and I enjoyed it even more on my second viewing<br/><br/>The writing is very well detailed and quite decent though it isn't perfect or even that good<br/><br/>Let's talk about the twist, there isn't a big twist/turn in the traditional sense of a twist but there is something MAJOR happening here<br/><br/>I'm not gonna spoil it. But here's the weird thing, there's a certain factor that plays into the twist of the film and if you check that box, you will understand the implications of the twist and you will GET what it implies. But if you don't check that box, if you don't understand what it means, you might not like it and I get it, that's fine, that might be a bit unfair to you and you may even dislike the twist but I can see where you are coming from<br/><br/>But for those who do know what it means and what it's implying, you are going to feel rewarded and your jaw will drop with shock and awe <br/><br/>Split isn't a perfect film, but it puts a well executed new spin on the thriller-horror-kidnapping sub genre and it's a must see for Shyamalan fans because he is back with a bang! :)"

"CinematicInceptions","8","0","2","9 December 2017"," Pretty good with a few flaws.
","Thankfully, I did not have my opinion of this movie tainted by the disgraced reputation of M. Night Shyamalan. I like the Sixth Sense, and despite the scorn people regard the Last Airbender with, I did enjoy it as an eleven-year-old seeing it in theaters. Split seemed pretty good from the trailers, and thankfully it was as good as I had hoped it would be. There were areas that it definitely could have improved in, but on the whole I liked it a lot more than I didn't. It was notable and good that the movie didn't feel like it had to fit itself to much into one genre or another, rather coexisting within a few genres.<br/><br/>There was good suspense and progression of gradually showing the audience the nature of Kevin's condition and what it meant for his three captives. Even though the premise is laid out pretty clearly in the trailer, there are a lot of important things that it didn't address about the way that Kevin's personalities interacted with each other. I was surprised when it was revealed that Kevin's personalities were fully aware that they all shared control of his body. The movie was also jarringly dark for a PG-13 movie, which I really liked.<br/><br/>The three teenage girls weren't exactly written in the most realistic or flattering way. Nothing they did made them seem overly dumb, but Claire and Marcia were unrealistically naïve in just about everything that they said and did after being captured. Fortunately, the audience gets a breath of fresh air with Casey, who, while she is not any more realistic of a character than her two companions, is at least an active character who is interesting to watch. Even though she wasn't that deep of a character, I thought it was sort of clever how Shyamalan allowed the audience to think that she was just weird at first and then gradually revealed the way that her past experiences were allowing her to deal with the situation she is stuck in.<br/><br/>The most noteworthy aspect of the movie of course is James McAvoy's performance. Yes, the role is clearly written to show off acting talent, but it was still impressive to see him go from one personality to another. It was sort of okay that each of the personalities were clichés in themselves because they all served a larger character. I would have been interested to see one or two more of these personalities make an appearance, but maybe that would have bogged things down a little. The whole theme of those who have suffered being superior to those who haven't wasn't as consistent as it probably should have, but it is somewhat interesting in itself. The movie at least lives by that theme in making Casey survive as a result of her suffering and Kevin making himself more powerful by channeling the pain that he has experienced.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend that most people see this. It's more of a thriller than anything else, but it can cater to people who favor many different genres. I was definitely entertained and engaged throughout the whole thing. There are some cheesy and annoying things about it, but I found there to be enough things to enjoy that I was able to forgive the annoyances. Overall Rating: 8.1/10."

","The film delivers. The movie is a classic Shyamalan thriller and a surprise return to form from his previous dull deviations with films like the Unbreakable and The Last Airbender. When this movie came out, I was quite reluctant to watch it but after hearing so much about it I finally gave it a shot. James McAvoy's brilliance combined together with the distinct characters and an exceptional script made the movie run out of time for me. I would have glided through two more hours of watching the countless troubled souls that the film juggled with. The only thing that kept me from rating it a complete 10/10 is how the movie in some ways glamorizes an actual mental disorder. Nonetheless, Split is an amazing movie to watch and perhaps the best psychological thriller that came out in the last decade or so. I would recommend anyone to watch the movie if they are looking for some real thrills."
"Floated2","8","0","3","25 November 2017"," M. Night Shyamalan returns to his roots
","Split is the most recent release from M. Night Shyamalan, as well as his more polished and well put together film in a long while. What works from this film is mainly the acting and performance of lead James McAvoy, as we see him in his most disturbed and fate defying role of his career, portraying a various of different chatterers. As the film passes, we get a sense and become more attached and somewhat rooting for his turn. as well as the performance from his lead girl Casey held hostage. Split is intense, has thrills and is most of all very enjoyable. <br/><br/>With another twist ending that has been praised for its connecting act, it most definitely leaves audiences in some sort of shock. Which was neither predictable or forced, and as of now we are anticipating the next directorial effort from Shyamalan. The opening two scenes set the tone for the entire film and from there it becomes a great experience. Highly recommend for those of fans of these somewhat type of films."
"michaelbozas","9","0","2","20 November 2017"," Oh good God lord he's back!!!
","I am so glad to say that I loved this movie. It was really, really good. It was actually Shyamalan's best film since Signs. The only movie that I really liked after Signs was the the Village, which is one of his most underrated movies. But this was just great. Where should I start? With James Macavoy's incredible performance(s). He is excellent in portraying multiple personalities in just one movie. But he certainly is not the only capable actor in this flick. Anya Taylor- Joy and Betty Buckley are also terrific. Especially Anya- Taylor Joy really impressed be. Not so impressive where the other two girls that were abducted with her (one of which was in The Edge of Seventeen). If they gave better performances and Shyamalan didn't do some of his old-fashioned shots (that weren't too distracting) I would have given the film a perfect score. Something I should also mention is that as I've heard Shyamalan hired the director of photography from it follows and it shows as this film is hot beautifully. I will not give away the ending as I suggest you check it out yourselves. If this is where Shyamalan is heading , I hope that he will be consider a great director among film-buffs once again."
"Mike_Devine","7","0","1","19 November 2017"," Shyamalan strikes back with a psychological scarefest
","After a string of box office and critical disasters, it appears M. Night Shyamalan has got his groove back. In 2017, the notorious horror/suspense director from Pennsylvania brought audiences 'Split' - a deeply disturbing psychological thriller that focuses on the human mind - and experience- rather than aliens, ghosts or killer trees.<br/><br/>'Split' revolves around a kidnapping of three teenage girls by a creepy young man who is revealed to suffer from dissociative identity disorder (DID). In fact, 23 personalities reside within the mind of McAvoy's character. It's fair to say an alternative title for 'Split' could be 'The James McAvoy Show,' as the actor demonstrates his breadth in this role. Not every actor could play this role, as he brings out eight of his personalities in their entirety and never misses a beat.<br/><br/>Because his performance is so strong, it's easy to overlook the job done by Anya Taylor-Joy, who is handed the tough task of playing the girl who must remain calm when everything in her being tells her to react differently. However, the audience soon learns to understand why she is the way she is - through a slow reveal of a traumatic childhood experience. This backstory gives her character even more of a reason to succeed in this challenge.<br/><br/>While the cast is the main attraction in 'Split,' it's also worth noting that Shyamalan's signature filming style is back. From unique camera angles to the use of foreshadowing as a technique, it's good to see the director who won over so many fans nearly two decades ago can still deliver. While the film is not scary in a traditional sense, it is incredibly unsettling and hits a nerve with many.<br/><br/>'Split' is not the greatest film out of the Shyamalan collection, but it signals the director is back in the saddle."
"TxMike","Null","0","1","8 November 2017"," Night Shyamalan creation, hit-N-miss drama with a long running time.
","I watched this at home on BluRay from my local library. <br/><br/>As several reviewers have already written Night Shyamalan, who started out so well, in fact ""Unbreakable"" is one of my favorite movies, made some real stinkers after a few early hits. So ""Split"" is a return to form, sort of. <br/><br/>I didn't count the number of personalities, they say it is 23, but James McAvoy is really, really good as the several distinctly different split personalities. As the movie begins one dad is giving a ride home for his daughter and two friends and, as he finishes loading the trunk of the car someone comes up, drugs him, and drives away with the three girls. It is one of those many personalities.<br/><br/>I liked the first 20 minutes or so, and I liked the last 20 minutes or so. The vast hour+ middle has a lot of talking, either the abductor with his psychiatrist or the abductor with his captives. Some things do happen but the great middle of the movie moves very deliberately.<br/><br/>Who would really like this movie? Those who like a good character study above all. Shyamalan likes ""twists"" and there are some but mostly unnecessary to the core story of a man fighting with his demons and three young girls trying to regain their freedom.<br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the young actress Anya Taylor-Joy as one of the girls, Casey. Not so much for her acting, which was fine, but she has these wide-set eyes and lips so perfect that they look like they were carved by an artist. Just a totally unique look.<br/><br/>Plus I am a fan of Haley Lu Richardson who was one of the girls, Claire. I have seen her in several movies and she is simply a very good actress.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: In the end we find that the girls had been held in an underground maintenance area in the Philadelphia zoo, someone found them and the survivors were freed."

","I have never been a big M Night fan. I watched because I'm a fan of story lines involving multiple personality disorder. This film pleasantly surprised me in that, the depiction of the complexities of the disorder was so well written, directed and played. The casting of James McAvoy was the perfect choice. He played the role to perfection. As you become familiar with the various personalities inside Kevin, James is so good at portraying them that you can tell when he changes simply by his facial expression. It's impressive! And the characters of the psychiatrist, and Kevin's victim Casey, are also well written and played. You get a true feel for the characters and what has shaped them to the point where the story of the kidnapping begins. I wasn't as shocked at the end as some people have written they were. I pretty much expected it. I think that was because, I did get such a good feel for the characters that I could figure out how the story would play out. It was a very fun watch!!!

The way Kevin has exhibited 23 personalities and how Betty Bluckey, his psychiatrist, helps him to materialise and manage all of it makes you think about the mental problems and how common they are. Split has a plot well written and a marvellous soundtrack, which can gives you some clues about the scene atmosphere and what probably will happen.

","M. Night Shyamalan is back, baby!!! Yes, you read that right. ""Split"" is a return to form for Shyamalan, this is another brilliant thriller from him that harks back to early days as a filmmaker. It's suspenseful, it's eerie, and it's a blast to watch.<br/><br/>This film has some of Shyamalan's strongest writing and focus. The characters, dialogue, and exposition all serve a purpose for the plot. His camera work is tight and meticulously constructed to keep the audience guessing as to what is going to happen. And the music adds to the suspense and gets you absorbed into the movie.<br/><br/>The actors do a wonderful job and really let you sense their fears, discomfort, and pain. However, the real highlight of the film is James McAvoy, who gives an award caliber performance. Not only does he juggles several distinct personalities with their own mannerisms, way of speech, and facial expressions, but he transitions between them at the flip of a coin so effortlessly. It's quite amusing and terrifyingly disturbing.<br/><br/>Overall ""Split"" is a wonderful movie that has a lot of great moments of suspense and wonderful performances, especially by the brilliant McAvoy. It's a film that's filled with deeper meanings of abuse and pain, while also being a welcome comeback for M. Night Shyamalan. The ending of the film is such a pleasant surprise that I'm giving this movie an extra half point. I give it 4.5/5"
"MovieSoup","6","0","2","10 September 2017"," A return to form
","Shyamalan has made some abortions in film recently such as The Happening and Signs, however Split is a return to what made him a great writer/director in the first place. Split is a competent horror/thriller film which has a decent plot, is well shot and has great actors in it. The story is simple enough to follow with some quite intriguing scenes, like when we are first introduced to the different personalities that Kevin has. Some of the best scenes in the movie are when you see Kevin's different personalities coming to the surface and interacting with each other. For instance it's really interesting to watch Dennis and Patricia work together in the same body. <br/><br/>The plot has no twist scenes at the end like a lot of Shyamalan's other work which is a departure from the norm but not so much as it leaves the audience wanting more or confused about anything. As well thought out as the plot is there are some moments that are too formulaic for me personally. For instance Casey is an abused by her uncle and is a ""weird kid"" in school that only gets invited to parties out of sympathy. This kind of character has been done so many times that it does not wow me anymore when I'm watching (no matter how ""cute"" the child actor playing young Casey is! I just don't give a shi*). <br/><br/>Casey's two friends have little character development in the film. They are only in there to get naked and die off screen, which is as deep as their characters go. Nothing more to be said. The woman therapist is at least more interesting than the two victims. She is trying to understand these people with multiple personalities and what they can do but unfortunately gets captured and killed by Kevin or Dennis or Patricia or ""the Beast"". Whichever one. <br/><br/>James McAvoy is brilliant in this film and he is what makes this film. The plot helps out but what brings it up a notch is McAvoy's performance. He does a great job of giving depth to all of the multiple personalities he plays and the sense of suspense and violence when he is playing ""the beast"" is really well done. In this movie he cries on command too which I always think is the mark of a great actor. If you can't cry on command you are a sh*t actor in my opinion!!<br/><br/>There are not too many jump scares in this ""horror/thriller"" which is a good thing as jump scares are just cheap ways of scaring the audience and are only in awful horror films ,this film is actually competent and doesn't do that thank god. Instead it has a character that is unpredictable and that is where the fear for this film comes from. Kevin has all of these personalities that are unique with some being safe and some personalities being dangerous and you never know which one is ""in the light"". <br/><br/>The sound is competently done with no out of place music and suspenseful score music when there is a suspenseful scene. It did not WOW me in the way that other movies used sound but it wasn't done badly at all. The sound is just competentthat's all. The use of colour in this film is also competent but nothing too shout about. Because it is a thriller the colour of this movie is turned down so even the colourful bits of the movie look darker. I wish they had done something different as this is done in most horror movies and something different would have been nice but oh well can't have anything in life. <br/><br/>Overall after the fuc**ng dog sh*t that was The Happening, Avatar, After Earth, The Village, Lady in the Water and Signs it is great to get a decent movie from M. Knight. This film does not break new ground and is formulaic in most parts with character development being quite low. However McAvoy lends his talents to this film. The pacing is competent so as you are not at all bored whilst watching and the story is interesting with no glaring plot holes like Signs. M. Knight is returning to form after a run of bulls**t movies and I will actually go and see his next film in the cinema..and Signs Fu**ing sucked!!!!!"

Kevin played by James Mcavoy plays a person with 24 distinct personality disorders living inside of him and the characters played by Mcavoy is a very strong depiction of a person having psychological problems.<br/><br/>The best thing on this film is it's dark and atmosphere nature giving a claustrophobic experience to the viewers through dark and cinematic style unique to M.

I have enjoyed his movies since The Sixth Sense and I was a little kid during those years, but still my family rented or bought his movies and we all watched them. At the time, I actually thought The Sixth Sense was a horror movie, which it clearly is not. I love his work and he is probably my favorite writer/director out there.

","I can't help but be such a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan for his early works. There's absolutely no doubt that he's a talented filmmaker, and even during his set backs, I still pay tribute to those first few films. With that said, ""SPLIT"" is a welcome return for his talent as a storyteller. The success of this film is found in Shyamalan rediscovering the roots that put him on the map. A lot of trust is given to James McAvoy as the lead, and he carries the film on his shoulders in an incredibly difficult role. Tension, humor, and shock are woven within this intriguing thriller. I'm still rooting for your epic comeback, M. Night. For now, this will do just fine. #split"

","Before I say anything, I have to underline that James McAvoy did a very good acting here; a 10/10 performance. He is the centralized character, so, it'd be unfair to compare with others, but, the leading girl might have been better.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around a carefully planned and original story with proper detail level, however, there seems to be a few flaws in the plot. The most critical might be the one that other two girls were not trying to escape while James is chasing the Karate girl, for they were on escape mindset when this is happening.<br/><br/>Some parts are slow paced and might be boring, but, that is due to the disclosure of details (regarding past lives of characters). You have to be a little bit careful while listening to conversations, because there are a lot of details mentioned once. Overally, it's thrilling."

","The much needed break for the director Shyamalan. It has been over a decade since the last time he was lauded like this for his work.

I have seen his lots of films, but if I had to choose only one of his great, that's would be easily this one. A straightforward story, no complication to understand, or needed to explain everything it revolves. Then suddenly the final act turned into a different mode. With a twist, all comes to end.<br/><br/>The three teenage girls have been kidnapped at the beginning. Following that, the victims do not know the situation, but makes a couple of bad moves, except one girl. As the film progress, many secrets revealed to us, particularly about the kidnapper. It all developed to lead in one direction where an unimaginable thing going to happen. How and what result it brings told in the following parts.<br/><br/>The perspective of the story was not really a thing in this. That means it does not take sides, but gives you the option to choose. And most of the viewers would root for the weird girl. It was Anya, and she's having a wonderful career in early stage. Could becomes one of the best if she contributed all her performances in the same pace and intensity. The music was equally awesome. Created the perfect atmosphere along with the visuals.

What it impresses the most when talking about this film, is by far the amazing performance of James McAvoy which simply shines. I even dare to say that it is his best act in his career so far, thus making this movie a must see only judging by this aspect alone. It also leaves plenty of room for a sequel, fact which can only make me happy. What I must point though, as a downside, is that the finale felt a bit rushed, lacking something deep to keep it on par with the rest of the movie.

","This is M. Night Shyamalan's best film since the sixth sense. The acting is superb. James McAvoy gives the best acting performance I have seen for several years. Anya Taylor-Joy also gives an incredible performance of a damaged yet strong young teen. The exploration of multiple personality disorder as villain is obviously controversial, considering the times that we live in and the stigma of mental illness. However, we need to look beyond that, as it advances the plot of a great film. If you are overly sensitive to these issues, then this film is not for you. The end of this film offers a different kind of twist than we are used to from Shyamalan. Its only slightly startling, but hopefully it will bring another movie to establish what I think is a long delayed connection."

"eagandersongil","7","0","4","9 June 2017"," The claustrophobic freedom and Shyamalan's fate killing the third act.
","After 12 years of unsuccessful work, M. night shyamalan, returns to his best field, the psychological suspense, even if the script is lost, we have a very technically very good film and with good performances, ""Fragmentado"" is a film about The imprisonment imposed on our lives and the attempt to be free. The screenplay tells the story of Kevin (James McAvoy), a man who has 23 personalities who kidnaps 3 young people to prepare them to receive a nebulous, brutal and savage twenty-fourth personality, the script of the movie 'could follow a completely different path , From the third act to where the element of the supernatural is introduced (not always Shyamalan's twists are good), the viewer completely disconnects from the film, and the script that until then was frightening, claustrophobic and uncomfortable, becomes a Sc-fi poorly explained, even grasping with all strength the brush of rational explanation that the film exposes, becomes disconnected and invariably weak. We have a legal moral dealt with in the film, there is a questioning about freedom, not physical, but the psychological, in Kevin's view, all those who have already experienced freedom, have already enjoyed the pleasures and sins of life which makes them impure, is A radical vision that becomes interesting when Kevin begins to use his dominant personalities to create an environment and a personality that will be able to apply this concept, and this personality is exactly one inspired by ferocious animals (Kevin lived in a zoo) precisely the personality that In thesis is irrational because it is an animal, this is a parallel and a criticism, because only such animalistic personality could impose such an absurd concept of freedom in practice, in the middle of all this, his other personalities ask for help. Technically the film is very well finished, with a cold photograph, a soundtrack that appears at the right moments, a good mix and great editions and editing that create one of the best things of the film that is the rhythm, the rhythm is very well, Does not sin, even in scenes that repeat, is always progressive and loves to instigate the viewer, always maintaining a great aura of suspense in the air. James McAvoy is great, making faces, he really knows how to give different tones to each character, and anya taylor-joy is also very good, inclusive, his entire narrative arc works in perfect sync with James, something difficult to achieve in a movie. Finally, ""Fragmentado"" is a good movie that replaces M. night shyamalan as one of the biggest names in the industry, the film has its mistakes, it's true, but its 2 first acts are exquisite."
"cmtrisket","7","0","4","7 June 2017"," Split, Honest Review
","OK, so I was bored and didn't know what to watch. In all honesty, I hadn't heard of this movie or anything to do with it. I know M. Night Shyamalan has been renowned as a great director to many for his work on the movie ""The Sixth Sense."" I know he has been criticized for his other films because they can't live up to that pinnacle. Anyways, I was looking for something to watch and this ended up being it. A total shot in the dark. I could have loved it or hated it, I really didn't know.<br/><br/>A quick summary, minus spoilers, to get things started is in order. There are three girls that get kidnapped by a man with 23 different identities, and of course 23 different names ha ha. He is played by James McAvoy. The lead girl is Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), followed by Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), and lastly Marcia (Jessica Sula). These girls are held hostage by this man, and all of his identities. Throughout the whole movie the girls are trying to figure out a way to escape. They aren't entirely what the captor's motives are, or why they were kidnapped, seemingly at random. James McAvoy's character visits a psychologist, named Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), throughout the movie. He specialty seems to be working with this identity disorder. He comes to her for help, yet can never get his termoils across to her in a meaningful way. It is up to Dr. Fletcher to read him and figure out who he is most times. The story continues and things increasingly get worse and worse for James McAvoy's character, until something major happens. From there you don't know what is about to happen! I'll leave it at that. Dastardly, I know. ðŸ˜€ I must give huge props to James McAvoy. He plays this role amazingly. You may recognize him from his other works like: Various X-Men movies as young Professor X, The lead in ""Wanted"" with Angelina Jolie, or ""Filth"" as a bipolar cop. This is one of those roles, where no matter how you feel about the actor you have to respect what he was able to accomplish with the role. Honestly, he makes the movie what it is. The story line of the main female character isn't developed enough for me. I mean Anya Taylor-Joy does a great job as playing a weird outcast, That maybe shouldn't have been in the position she was, but her story line could have gone into more detail for me personally. The movie is 117 minutes long, and stays in that sweet spot. The pace is good for the genre, but I must say that I wouldn't agree that it is a full fledge horror film. Thriller sure, horror meh, possibly. Another thing I have to mention is that the way the camera cuts and changes frequently must have been hard. Usually when James McAvoy's indentiy changes you have a slight or hard cut to/from something else. Most other movies don't have that. That is something that they had to remain aware of throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>There are a few things I found that had some deeper meaning to them in the movie. Just under the surface. Hmm, how can I say this without giving anything away? There is a theme about how people perceive others that carries through the whole movie. You will see it in the beginning and end of the movie. That is about all I can say without giving too much away.<br/><br/>In summary, of my summary, the movie was well paced, had a stupendous lead actor, a good supporting cast. It wasn't too long or too short. It is a movie that takes on something culturally that most movies wouldn't, at least not in that detail. I don't think it justifies a main genre of horror, and I think there should have been a more in depth story line for Anya Taylor-Joy's character. Over all I enjoyed the movie. I would watch it again, just for James McAvoy! Give this movie a watch, it will keep you thinking and keep you wanting more.<br/><br/>I personally give this movie a 7/10"

A twist or some big mystery that was revealed would have made it more interesting since it was close to two hours and it had enough time for this. <br/><br/>The link to the film Unbreakable was subtle and well done as we see Bruce Willis's character refer to his nemesis Mr Glass and the link between Glass and The Horde.

","I had high hopes for this movie, but it really fell apart in the end. Possible spoilers. <br/><br/>The best thing about Split was James McAvoy. He played his character(s) impeccably. His mannerisms changed in almost imperceptible ways, so you could always see what personality was in control. Because of him, it's not a bad movie. <br/><br/>The plot wasn't half bad. The suspense worked. The issue was it kept reaching points where the conflict in the film should have resolved, but it continued to play out until it became ridiculous. <br/><br/>There are characters who die who did not need to die for a good story. They died at the wrong time for it to make sense. There was no satisfactory resolution, and there could have been. What ended up happening was several people died for shock value, without adding value to the story. And the shock value wasn't high enough because by that point the story was devolving into no longer being believable.<br/><br/>There were also some really weird scenes where the teenage characters were sexualised for no particular reason. They spent half the movie in their underwear without much of an explanation in the plot. <br/><br/>There were lots of well executed parts, for sure, and it's far from a terrible movie. But when a movie makes you think ""okay, this should end in five minutes"" multiple times while just getting more pointlessly dark, and finally doesn't pay off the audience's expectations of more than one of the cast surviving, and doesn't even give half a happy ending to the remaining characters, it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. <br/><br/>Sure it's horror, so that's how it should be expected to play out, but they set up what seemed like rich characters that might grow and learn, and abandoned the most intelligent aspects of the film in the resolution."

","I'm an IT expert, as a student I worked for a local production company that was shooting (as a 3rd party) a lot of Hollywood movies. So I saw a lot of these, how they're made. But I'm not a movies fan or wannabe reviewer.<br/><br/>So, what made me write my first ever review ?<br/><br/>Emotions. This movie got to my soul, with it's interesting story, unusual acting, looks. Bad stuff got me emotional because it ruined a good story and brave try out of usual Hollywood clichÃ©.<br/><br/>Like many US movies, this one also follows the path of artificial looks of people, especially women, artificial scenography. If we are going to dive into weird reality of crazy multi person kidnapper - and you expect us to believe you - than you cannot make victims to look like Barby dolls. With perfect makeup, perfect clean clothes, even dough they are crying imprisoned for days. Same goes for the shrink. Photography and scenery follows the same logic, it's a world and aesthetics for itself, without respecting the story or trying to help us to believe in your script and insanity of main character. <br/><br/>It's just like asking us to believe McDonald's burgers are 100% natural, and McDonald's workers love doing their job. No one believes it. It all looks FAKE FAKE FAKE.<br/><br/>I saw this happen a lot in movie making, you got directors dying for details, and they just do not see, the movie is dying while they're setting up ""perfect"" lightning, scenery, makeup, ETC.<br/><br/>Story, you ""killed"" all other characters except main 3, so it becomes absolutely obvious what is going to happen. Too obvious. Main character uncontrollably goes into beast, without any options and questions. Missed opportunities for intense sessions at shrink. Along with one girl left.<br/><br/>Ruined story.

I left the theater feeling frustrated, knowing I missed something vital in importance in the last scene. It made me wish I had done some research on what the twist was so I could properly prepare and do my homework so I could be involved in it. I like to go into my movies blind and without spoilers, and in this case, that led to disappointment. This movie was not meant for me, I guess.<br/><br/>But besides that, the acting was excellent from the girls and of course McAvoy. Each personality was very distinct and you could totally see him switching between them before your eyes. It was thrilling in parts and sad in others, so it was entertaining. I think it will appeal to not just horror fans, but really most anyone.<br/><br/>However, I think the subject matter is irresponsible. I'm sick of seeing people turned ""monstrous"" by mental illness in films. There is a lot of debate ever whether or not DID exists as a real disorder or if it's created by therapists, but that does not mean that there are not people whose lives are constantly affected by DID. Mental illness does not make people monsters. Media portrayals of mental illness affect how the mentally ill are treated in real life. I wish this film would have done more than just turn someone with a mental illness into an actual literal monster who wants to eat people. Shame on you, Shyamalan, for continuing to support the stigma against the mentally ill."

","The first two (three?) scenes are absolutely horrible. Like, I was ready to leave the theater bad. The movie still continued to prove itself as contender for the Worst Director Ever award until James McAvoy's second appearance on screen. Honestly, the slim cast could have been even slimmer with just him, Anya Taylor-Joy and Betty Buckley and I would have been just fine. Whether the others suffered from bad acting or just bad directing I'm not sure, but their performances were intolerable at points, as was the attempts at first person POV in the cinematography. Many of the camera choices I was hoping would be revealed at the end, but they just seemed random.<br/><br/>Shyamalan brought back his use of a main character as the narrator, but this time it was so heavy handed it didn't even feel natural. I felt like entire plot was extremely obvious, although perhaps not because there were a lot of confused people once the movie was over. <br/><br/>All that said, James McAvoy did such an amazing job in that film that I forgave many of its other offenses. His character's story was interesting, if not poorly written and I wasn't even mad that none of his personalities were Scottish. Okay, I was a little mad. But, really, it's worth watching just for him. Whether or not it's worth paying for is another subject. Unless you're worried about spoilers, this is one that can easily wait for DVD/Netflix."
