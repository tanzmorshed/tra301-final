","Don't be fooled by the title. Make sure you know what you're getting yourself into when you watch this film. Bridge of Spies is literally about the Cold War Bridge of Spies, where Soviet/US spies were exchanged through negotiations. This is nothing like ""The Americans"" (FX TV drama - for some high unrealistic and over-sexualized espionage action - redirect here) and the most action-packed scene you will see is Francis Gary Powers getting shot out of his U2 plane during his mission. <br/><br/>Bridge of Spies is really a historical/legal drama. And based on my preliminary research, they seem to be getting most of their facts right. Obviously a little bit embellished for Hollywood's sake, Bridge of Spies does a fine job as a historical docudrama. There is a lot of talking, but it's meaningful talking. At times, the film can be a little slow {opening scene, especially}, but give it a chance and you might enjoy it. History buffs like myself will definitely enjoy it. But thrill-seekers, you're better off to see the new James Bond movie instead."
"subxerogravity","9","157","209","18 October 2015"," A very good, very Spielberg motion picture, starring Tom Hanks.
","This movie hit me really strangely.<br/><br/>I was expecting a political drama about the cold war, and while indeed it was that, I was not expecting to have so much fun and for Bridge of Spies to be so humorous. <br/><br/>The Coen brothers writing a movie Steven Spielberg would direct just sounds like a winning combination and it really was. Sealing the deal, was a great performance by Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks does what he does best, by playing an everyday man in an average life. James Donovan was just an insurance lawyer who gets caught up in the middle of the Cold War. Bridge of Spies, starts him off so normal and then turns his life into quite an adventure.<br/><br/>And I do mean adventure. In the hands of Spielberg, the movie's visuals were large and epic. I was expecting this movie to feel more like his last flick, Lincoln. Instead it feels more like Indiana Jones, as James Donovan travels to Berlin at the time when the wall was being completed. <br/><br/>Watching Hanks play Donovan who is just swept into an overwhelming situation and just keeps his cool and his charm is just highly enjoyable. <br/><br/>Totally loved Bridge of Spies, It's one of the best team ups between Hanks and Spielberg and even though Lincoln was a great movie, Bridge of Spies is everything Spielberg is capable of. So entertaining."

","There are combinations of film makers that make you confident, as you pay your ticket price, that you are not going to be terribly disappointed: Steven Spielberg directing; Tom Hanks taking the lead; Janusz Kaminski behind the camera; Michael Kahn editing and a Coen brothers script (with Matt Charmon (Suite Française)). And Bridge of Spies doesn't disappoint, particularly for someone of my more advanced years (I was born the year following the film's climatic events) who remembers well the terror of potential nuclear catastrophe that hung over the world through the 60's and 70's.<br/><br/>In a story based on true events, Hanks plays James Donovan (diverging somewhat from reality here) as an insurance lawyer dragged by his firm into defending Rudolf Abel, the accused Soviet spy played exquisitely by British stage acting legend Mark Rylance. Against this backdrop, the international blue touch paper is about to be lit by the shooting down over Russia of Gary Powers (Austin Stowell from ""Whiplash"") in his U-2 spy plane (sorry – ""article""). Donovan becomes instrumental in unofficially negotiating on behalf of the US government the release of Powers in East Berlin. The deal is jeopardized by his boy-scout tendencies to also want to help another US captive Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers).<br/><br/>I've read some negative reviews of this film in the papers that made me quite cross, describing it as ""yawnsome"" and ""sanctimoniously dull"". For me, nothing could be further from the truth and the packed Saturday night audience I saw this with seemed equally gripped from beginning to end, silent save for the odd laugh where some appropriate humor is weaved into the story.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is solid and believable as the fish-out-of-water lawyer, albeit that the role is played with a large spoonful of patriotic American sugar as Donovan trumpets about the importance of the constitution over the lynch-mob mentality of the general public. Alan Alda – great to see again on the big screen – channels his best Hawkeye-style exasperation as Donovan's boss, looking for a clean and quick conviction.<br/><br/>But it is Mark Rylance – an irregular player in movies, and due to appear again in next year's ""BFG"" – who shines out as the acting star of the film. His salubrious and calm turn as the cornered spy just reeks of class and if he isn't nominated for a Best Supporting Actor nomination for this then there is no justice. (A special 'casting recognition award' to my wife Sue for spotting that the actress playing Judge Byer's wife – Le Clanché du Rand – was Meg Ryan's mother in Sleepless in Seattle 22 years ago!) <br/><br/>The cinematography is superb with some gorgeous tracking shots and framed scenes. Most outstanding of all is the scene depicting the traumatic construction of the Berlin wall – long tracking shots in greys and blues delivering a truly breathtaking piece of cinema. In general I'd give a big shout-out to both the art department and the special effects team in making the desolation of East Berlin feel so real. It makes the similar scenes, that I commented positively on in the recent ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" seem like an amateur school production.<br/><br/>The special effects team also contribute in making the shooting down of the U-2 a thrilling piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Music is sparingly and effectively used by Thomas Newman, and it can be no greater complement to the composer than that I was wondering until the end titles as to whether it was another Spielberg/ John Williams collaboration or not.<br/><br/>A great film, one of my favorites this year. Highly recommended, especially if you are over 50. You should also get out to a cinema to see this one – it will be far more effective on the big screen than the small one.<br/><br/>(Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

"nsharath009","8","166","232","6 October 2015"," An unshowy Steven Spielberg does a master's job with Cold War tensions, honoring a real-life attorney's victory over fear.
","A feel-good Cold War melodrama, Bridge of Spies is an absorbing true-life espionage tale very smoothly handled by old pros who know what they're doing. In its grown-up seriousness and basis in historical conflict, Steven Spielberg's first feature since Lincoln three years ago joins the list of the director's half-dozen previous ""war"" films, but in its honoring of an American civilian who pulled off a smooth prisoner exchange between the East and West during a very tense period, the film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does now. Spielberg's fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, which world- premiered at the New York Film Festival and opens commercially on October 16, looks to generate stout box-office returns for Disney through the autumn season. For people of Spielberg's generation, the early years of the nuclear era and the stand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union represents a significant part of the fabric of childhood. With the passage of time, it's possible to tell stories of the time without furnishing them with overt propagandistic overlays, and for Westerners there is the added built-in appeal of the ""we won"" factor and the perception that dealing with adversaries was so much simpler then than it is now. As their focus in this impeccably rendered recreation of a moment in history, most palpably represented by the building of the Berlin Wall, Spielberg and screenwriters Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen have chosen a sort-of Atticus Finch of the north, a principled, American Everyman insurance attorney unexpectedly paged to represent a high-level Soviet spy caught in New York. There is no question that Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is guilty, but James B. Donovan (Hanks), a proper and decent family man with a professional dedication to his client and an abiding loyalty to the principles of the U.S. Constitution, has a quick and intuitive read of any legal situation and shrewdly stays at least one step ahead of the game in almost any situation."
"MrDHWong","9","103","141","28 October 2015"," One of Spielberg's best most recent movies
","Bridge Of Spies is a historical drama film starring Tom Hanks, co-written by the Coen brothers, and directed by Steven Spielberg. Even though its subject matter of the Cold War is something I know very little about, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am now more interested than ever to learn more about it. I rank it among the best of Spielberg's most recent movies.<br/><br/>In 1957, tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War are at their peak. Spies from both the American CIA and Soviet KGB are a major threat to the security of both world powers and each side often resorts to hasty measures to stop any classified information from being leaked. In Brooklyn, New York, Rudolf Abel is arrested under the suspicion of being a spy. James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is assigned as Abel's defence lawyer. However the idea of defending a potential Soviet spy proves to be an unpopular and difficult task for Donovan. Meanwhile, over in the Soviet Union, an American spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers is shot down and captured by the KGB. As a means to ease tension between the two warring countries, Donovan proposes a swap between the two prisoners of war, Abel for Powers.<br/><br/>Despite containing barely any action scenes and being almost entirely made up of talking, the film never feels boring or slow paced. This is most likely due to the Coen brothers' clever screenplay and Steven Spielberg's creative direction. There were many suspenseful moments where it felt like the prisoner negotiations would go horribly wrong and that kept me on the edge of my seat. Tom Hanks also gives another memorable performance as James B. Donovan, once again proving his versatility as an actor.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10."
"jdesando","Null","65","98","19 October 2015"," Spielberg and Hanks--fry to find a better duo than that for a great film.
","""Everyone deserves a defense. Everyone matters."" James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks)<br/><br/>In Bridge of Spies, Steven Spielberg once again masterfully goes to the historical drama with a righteous man's theme (think Schindler and Lincoln for starters). This time lawyer James B. Donovan is asked to defend an accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Able (Mark Rylance, superb), in order to show the world the American justice system is democratic. <br/><br/>The story is ""inspired by true events"" with the outline of the exchange of Able for U-2 downed pilot Gary Powers historically accurate. As usual, Spielberg recreates the times with the atmosphere, cars, and film noir aspect of a spy thriller in the figurative and literal Cold War. He said, ""I always wanted to tell the stories that really interested me in my personal life—which are stories about things that actually happened.""<br/><br/>Hanks is central to Spielberg's vision of the lone hero defying the odds and supporting the highest ideals of the American Constitution and the individually virtuous man. Never does Hanks overplay the good-guy card; he's just very adept at playing an everyman not always right but always righteous. <br/><br/>The dialogue is crisp, a no fooling around typical of Spielberg and Hanks but a charming bad guy as well: James Donovan: ""Aren't you worried?"" Rudolf Abel: ""Would it help?"" As producer Kristie Macosko Krieger commented about Spielberg, ""He's got a childlike sense of wonder. He never gets tired of hearing stories . . . . "" Bridge of Spies is vintage Spielberg with a Lincoln-like atmosphere, righteous hero, and intriguing multi-plot, an entertaining spy story brimming with humanity. <br/><br/>As the director says, ""This is more about very smart people in conversation with each other, and the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads is that, if they make the wrong decisions, it's the end of the world."""
"teddyryan","6","108","187","19 October 2015"," Turkey Without The Gravy
","I am biased in my review of BRIDGE OF SPIES. The Cold War is my thing, always has been my thing. I am dazzled by that time in history: surveillance, the cars, CIA, Eisenhower, and the mystique of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. <br/><br/>From the trailer of this film, I expected a delicious plate of Cold War atmosphere, intrigue, and commentary. Like a gleeful child, I sprinted to the movie theatre – expecting a non-pretentious high octane version of Mad Men. I anticipated my favorite era in history being served up like LET ME IN (a piece of 1980s period perfection elegantly directed by Matt Reeves).<br/><br/>I held close the trailer as I landed my perfect middle seat in the theatre. The clips of a U2 Surveillance jet spiraling at 70,000 feet, children overflowing in tears as they watch a thermonuclear film strip, and Tom Hanks' face plastered to a subway window as we see guards firing at bystanders trying to climb over the Berlin Wall. <br/><br/>Then you add Steven Spielberg to the mix – the master of the period piece – modern cinema - the evoker of our deepest emotions. One of my favorite Spielberg films is Munich. Munich captures the violence of the Middle East 70s with revere, respect, and revelation. This is what I wanted from Bridge Of Spies. I wanted a dark, harrowing portrait of the Cold War, I wanted this tense era exposed in Spielbergian fashion, and I wanted to have 1957-1961 ruminating in my heart, mind, and belly. Bridge of Spies, however, met none of my desired expectations. <br/><br/>Diluted by a PG-13 rating, filled with comedic moments (clearly due to the Coen Brothers having written or participated in this script) that don't tickle my fancy, and an avoidance of Cold War atmosphere – Bridge Of Spies hit me like a tennis ball on the head. <br/><br/>It's taught, adequately plotted, and the hero is smart, likable, and witty. It's garnered rave reviews. But, for anyone that likes substance, don't look here. Spielberg's story is a moral tale – of courage and standing up for one's ideals – the universal plot which Steven devours like a hungry child. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, there's no stakes. Hanks follows his journey and does what he does best – but his universe is given little context. You'll want turkey and you'll get turkey – but you're not getting any gravy. <br/><br/>**Possible Spoilers – Things that bugged me about the film was plethora of wasted opportunities. When you have Spielberg at the helm, you know what could have been – <br/><br/>1. The relationship between the Lawyer (Hanks) and the Soviet Captive (Mark Rylance) is an unbalanced paper weight. We get a glimpse into the Lawyer's character, the archetypal Tom Hanks - fair, honest, moral, etc. We get very little info on the Captive. He is quiet, dignified, and keeps responding to Hanks wondering if he is aware of his dire situation, ""Would it help?"" Rylance is the typical Spielbergian ""caught in the middle guy"" – much like Ben Kingsley in Schindler's List. Physically weak, trapped and powerless - yet stoic and unafraid. That being said, what are his motives? He is a spy but what drives him – where is the monologue where he explains his background, what formed and shaped him and what forms the basis of his lifelong goals?<br/><br/>2. What I love about Mad Men is its strong focus on the media and culture of the era. Except for the end of Bridge of Spies (where we get a clip of Pierre Salinger informing the news of the spy swap) and an early scene of a teenage girl watching a late night story, there's not much to nibble on – Spielberg wastes a huge opportunity in a class room scene where kids are watching a nuclear bomb film strip. Lifting the film strip like a YouTube Clip and then showing a few generic shots of kids watching it and one girl crying - the master of modern cinema stumbles and falls into shallow surf. In this instance, I wanted to yell at the editor – build this up, let it seep in, give us some Wonder Years or Let Me In flavor. There's none to be had – <br/><br/>3. Not only do we get a vapid Francis Gary Powers – due to lackluster character development and the miscasting (in my opinion), but the U2 Surveillance storyline is about 12 minutes. Give me at least 25, Steven!! When the U2 is shot out of the sky, we get about a minute of action – give us three. In addition, because Francis Gary Powers has no character development, I don't sympathize with him or even care if he comes home. <br/><br/>4. The PhD student who is included in the Prisoner Swap is devoid of character – another guy that I could care less if he makes it home. Both guys appeared to have a lackluster indifferent time over the in the USSR. The Soviets dowsed Powers with water and German soldiers rip up the PHD students thesis paper – oh no!<br/><br/>5. There is no discussion of the disastrous political implications of the U2 being shot down over the Soviet Union. Reluctant to authorize the mission, Eisenhower was smeared by its failure and left office of the President on a black cloud. However, we don't hear Eisenhower's name mentioned once in the story. <br/><br/>All and all, Spielberg delivers a cup of vanilla ice cream with fudge – most audiences are going to love Hanks and the Soviet spy. <br/><br/>In the final analysis, it's a buddy film with some period costumes and a somewhat poignant conclusion. That being said, those that want a stirring pot of fear, sadness, and elation – I suggest you wait for this on HBO and watch Munich instead. <br/><br/>Ted's Personal Enjoyment: C+"
"Quinoa1984","9","97","167","8 October 2015"," carries a spirit of all-American-ism without being too preachy, keeping a wit about it and Tom Hanks
","One of the surprising things about Bridge of Spies is not really that Steven Spielberg directed this story, which tracks the trial and then trade of a Russian spy in 1957 (an exchange for an American pilot, and someone else who I'll get to shortly). It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script.<br/><br/>It's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress).<br/><br/>The Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance.<br/><br/>In a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice (""Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters"" echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now.<br/><br/>Two little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling. Thomas Newman isn't bad at his work, but it's unremarkable, and doesn't give certain scenes that do need a little extra punch or kick that 'Spielberg' type of music. It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax.<br/><br/>Aside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical."

Bridge of Spies tells the true story of a Cold War spy swap, during the height of tension between the U.S. and Russia. The time period was so tense that when films can capture that tone it's usually special, that being said the film doesn't quite capture that tone, but it comes close. Tom Hanks performance, and Spielberg's seasoned direction manage to save the film. When the film could have been slow, they save it by using either humor, or great acting, Acting that will most likely get Hanks an Oscar nomination.

"Turfseer","5","39","64","3 November 2015"," Good acting can't save true-life lugubrious Cold War tale that lacks suspense
","What motivated Steven Spielberg to go ahead and take on a project such as ""Bridge of Spies?"" I've read that it was simply his nostalgia for the Cold War era, firmly ensconced in his childhood memories. Unfortunately, the vehicle to tell that story—the combined tale of the capture and trial of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel and swap for the downed US pilot Gary Powers on Russian soil—packs little punch due to its obvious lack of suspense.<br/><br/>The ""Bridge of Spies"" narrative can be easily summarized in a short paragraph: the US government unofficially conscripts insurance lawyer James Donovan to defend Soviet spy Abel after he's captured by the Feds in Brooklyn. The trial is a foregone conclusion but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence Abel to prison instead of death since he could be used in a prisoner exchange in the future. Sure enough, after Gary Powers is shot down in his U2 spy plane, Donovan is again called upon to negotiate a prisoner swap with the Russians. A wrench is thrown into the negotiations when a US graduate student is arrested as a spy by the East Germans. Donovan deftly negotiates the swap of Abel for both Powers and the American student, and the exchange is facilitated with little incident.<br/><br/>As historical incidents related to the Cold War go, the Abel-Powers narrative is hardly one of high drama. A major problem is that Donovan has no single, strong antagonist to play off of. The negotiations with his Soviet counterpart, a KGB agent masquerading as a diplomat, are a forgone conclusion. We know of course that the spy swap will be successful, so where is the suspense? The ""heart-pounding"" moment is hardly heart pounding at all—as Abel and Powers are about to exchange places, there is a slight delay before the East Germans deliver the American student to complete their part of the bargain.<br/><br/>Yes of course I understand that Donovan dramatically threatened the East Germans, as they could have been blamed by the Russians for sabotaging the spy swap. But their decision was really a forgone conclusion too, as the East Germans were always under the yoke of the Russians, and were in no position to act independently (balking at giving up the student of course was their way of ""saving face"").<br/><br/>With all this lack of suspense, it was incumbent upon Mr. Spielberg's screenwriters (including ""luminaries"" Joel and Ethan Coen) to manufacture a series of fictional events to spice up a ""thriller"" that hardly thrills at all! Here a few examples: spectators at Abel's sentencing did not loudly object to the no death penalty sentence; Donovan and family were not victims of a drive-by shooting; Donovan's coat was not stolen by a gang in East Berlin (in reality, Donovan merely observed a gang nearby) and Donovan never personally observed people being killed as they attempted to climb over the Berlin Wall.<br/><br/>Spielberg's attempt to recreate the era is rife with numerous gaffes. Early on Donovan is seen riding in a in a NYC R-32 subway car that first went into service in 1964 (the scene is set in 1961). That wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that the interior of the car appears to be from the 70s and beyond, and not 1961. The gaffes, which include anachronisms, character error, continuity, errors in geography, factual errors, plot holes, revealing mistakes and miscellaneous errors are all detailed under the Bridge of Spies ""Goofs"" section on IMDb.<br/><br/>""Bridge of Spies"" is not a complete loss as the film features some excellent acting by Tom Hanks as Donovan and Mark Rylance as the Soviet spy Abel. With its 40 million dollar budget and decided lack of suspense, I wonder why the film was made in the first place. It of course gives Spielberg an opportunity to peddle a rather simplistic and obvious message: there were some bad people on the other side of the Iron Curtain (faceless soldiers shooting people trying to escape over the Berlin War) but also individuals such as master spy Abel, who end up displaying unexpected glimpses of humanity."
"Prolecenter","1","45","75","13 August 2016"," Cold War Propaganda
","A new film set in the Cold War era of the 1950's was released a few weeks ago and is apparently a big hit. The plot revolves around James B. Donovan, a simple lawyer who is chosen to defend Colonel Rudolf Abel, a captured Soviet spy, in the midst of an atmosphere of anti-communist hysteria sweeping the US. Later in the movie Mr. Donovan is recruited by CIA to negotiate the release of captured American spies in exchange for Colonel Abel, including U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers who was captured by the Soviets after his spy plane was shot down in Soviet airspace. The tortured tagline of the film sums up the propaganda point to be driven home: ""In the shadow of war, one man showed the world what we stand for."" What we (the US) stand for is supposedly a just and humane society where everyone, even a communist spy, is entitled to a fair trial. This is set against the supposed tyranny and cruelty of communist states.<br/><br/>However, the version of events presented in this film and the case it attempts to make in favor of an American system of ""fair play"" can easily be disproved. Many relevant details have been distorted or conveniently left out of the narrative. Also, some facts have been included but presented out of any historical context. Unfortunately, most Americans will passively accept this false narrative without question or without doing any further study of their own. They will accept the movie as being a true recounting of historical events. I could now spend a lot of time discussing every single propaganda element within the film such as the dark and gloomy atmosphere in East Berlin; the scowling faces of the East German border guards; the menacing and hostile demeanor of various communist officials or scenes of torture, but I have decided to take a different approach. I will simply tell the truth of the historical incident that this film is supposedly based on; and I will do it using the memoirs of the two primary American participants in these events - James Donovan and Francis Powers.<br/><br/>Let's start by comparing the details and outcomes of the Abel trial in the US with that of Powers' trial in the Soviet Union. Both spies were caught red-handed and so there could be no doubt as to their guilt in both cases. Therefore, the purpose of the trials should have been simply to gather all the facts available in an effort to come up with a suitable punishment to fit the crime. Below, I have included a table that shows the results of each trial.<br/><br/>Powers (Soviet trial) Abel (US trial) Held Incommunicado 4 weeks 3 weeks Phys. or Psych. Abuse No Yes Max. Poss. Sentence Death (rare cases) Death (very common) Actual Sentence 10 years 30 years<br/><br/>Powers stated in his autobiography, written a decade after his return to the US, that he did not suffer any abuse during his captivity in the Soviet Union. Abel, however, said that during his interrogation he was struck in the face by one of the FBI agents who grew frustrated at his silence and refusal to cooperate.<br/><br/>Powers was told by the Soviets that execution for espionage was rare in the USSR, but Abel was informed that the death penalty was very likely to be his fate. In fact, just a few years prior to Abel's trial in 1957, the Rosenbergs had been sent to the electric chair for stealing atomic secrets for the Soviet Union. Finally, in the sentences that were eventually handed down, Powers received a relatively light 10 years imprisonment while Abel was given 30 years.<br/><br/>The Soviets were accused of subjecting Powers to a ""show trial,"" but this is exactly what the Americans did with Rudolf Abel. As it turns out, despite all the blather about the high ideals of the American legal system, Donovan and his co-conspirators were really just concerned with promoting the idea of superior values of American ""fair play,"" without any regard for the substance behind such claims. Furthermore, the real reason Mr. Donovan argued to save Abel's life was in order to hold him as a bargaining chip in the inevitable event of a spy swap with the Soviets down the road.<br/><br/>Mr. Donovan, the humble lawyer, was actually a high-ranking career spy. He admits in his memoirs that at the time he was supposed to be impartially defending Colonel Abel, he was at that moment still a spook! In his own words he reveals that he ""still held a commission as a commander in Naval Intelligence."" Prior to that he had worked as head legal counsel in the OSS (precursor to the CIA) for several years and had helped to organize the CIA after WWII! However, from the insane viewpoint of American exceptionalism nothing here is out of place, but if this film had been done from the Soviet perspective (taking into account the undeniable facts of the incident), the plot might go like this:<br/><br/>The US violates Soviet airspace repeatedly until one of their spy planes is finally shot down. The pilot, despite his refusal to denounce the criminal activity of his government, receives a very light sentence in comparison to America's treatment of captured Soviet agents. Some time later, a CIA spymaster shows up in East Berlin demanding the release of three American spies in exchange for one Soviet spy. Although this naturally strikes the Soviets as unfair, due to their good nature they agree. Colonel Abel returns home to a hero's welcome while Francis Powers is received with suspicion, denounced by the media and much of the American public as a traitor, and is held incommunicado by the CIA for ""debriefing"" for nearly a month.

","Spielberg knows what he did, but I have a few thoughts. Let's start with the title - You know, there's only one ""spy"" per se, who matters anyway. But it makes it sound like some thriller-diller, eh?<br/><br/>Now Tom Hanks - uh, what's with that incredibly furrowed, knit brow all through the story. Makeup Oscar time? Did they borrow it from a Klingon?<br/><br/>The woman who plays Donovan's wife? I know she's supposed to be convincingly all 1950s square - but really, heels and full lipstick all the time? Smiling at everything? At least they didn't plug in Jessica Chastain, that would not have been credible opposite Donovan's shlubby character. A performance as flat as one of those pancakes in the big American breakfast he never ate.<br/><br/>The youth are not at this movie, they're all out to see the latest vampire/zombie/Tom Cruise dreck. So the boomers out to see an ennobling patriotic drama have lived through all this, including ""duck and cover"" and the Missile Crisis. Do those of us who actually were terrorized and traumatized by all that really need pedantic little lessons about the bombs and the sirens, delivered by Donovan's delusional little genius son? I found it insulting.<br/><br/>Of course, all the Russians are scene-chewing geeky monsters, sometimes in such close-up we can see the beet-bits in their teeth.<br/><br/>Gosh, it was cold in that Cold War! So we have to see everyone blowing and wiping their noses, boogers hanging, in order to get the idea?<br/><br/>Exception: Mark Rylance, the only great thing about the movie. I've been watching Rylance in ""Wolf Hall,"" and it's very impressive how he can create such a level of charismatic tension by hardly doing anything at all. He's all stillness, posture, little eye movements and gazes, all restrained, all coiled in. Amazing.<br/><br/>Back to the thriller at hand. So in the big spectacle scene where the U2 gets shot down, did Spielberg really need to show off, proving ""Oh, I can do 'Gravity,' I can do 'The Walk'"" just for bragging cred? And is it actually historically true that Powers gripped on to edge of his crumbling cockpit and just failed to hit the destruct button before his tether broke? (OH! is that a sneaky symbolic allusion to 'aborting' a mission?)<br/><br/>This whole thing could have been done as a 15-minute documentary (not that I'd like seeing another documentary) rather than puffed up into a dry and predictable ""drama. When we see Hanks' character lying face down on his bed at home because he's so beat, I suppose if I were him I'd be concerned to hide my face for having accepted another such stereotypical heroic individual little man role.<br/><br/>Do nasty CIA agents really skip into the air in peevish excitement like an 11-year old when they get frustrated? (Oh, they probably do.)<br/><br/>It might have been more exciting to get into a row with the dopey woman in the seats behind us who kept aggravating my wife by kneeing and bumping the back of her seat - but ""Would it help?""<br/><br/>So the Coen brothers helped write this. I guess Spielberg thought it might be more tasty to shmear some funky mustard on this baloney sandwich, but ""Would it help?"" My fantasy is that the Coens were often snickering up their sleeves."
"dierregi","1","48","81","31 December 2015"," The real title should be ""Tom Hanks is a hero, once more""
","If you expect to see much spying or bridges in this movie you will be sorely disappointed. The plot is about ace lawyer Tom Hanks (his screen name does not really matter, since the movie is just star performance) who is going to prove how good he is, both to the Russians and the East-Germans.<br/><br/>A rather puffy-faced Hanks is in most scenes, playing a smug and arrogant lawyer, who always gets the last word and whatever he wants. His performance as a the lawyer is rather overbearing and even slightly unpleasant, but the public still liked him a lot and laughed at all his one-liners (again, star performance, rather than good plot or script).<br/><br/>The spies or would-be spies featured in the movie are: 1) a sour little man, who speaks with what sounded to me an Irish accents and who was supposed to be funny with his unflappability. He repeats ""Would it help if I worry?"" countless times, every time getting a laugh 2) a rather dumb American pilot and 3) another sort of heroic American student, getting mixed up with foreign politics, when he'd better stayed at home. They all seem to be just props to give Hanks a chance to shine.<br/><br/>The moral of the story should be that all countries should be better off minding their own business. However, this sound unrealistic, so the moral is that American heroes (especially Tom Hanks) always save the day. Mind the overbearing soundtrack that seems to come straight out ""Saving private Ryan"""

Cars and costumes were fine but the spirit and the people of the era was absent. I don't understand why, when I think of ""Munich"" or ""Schindler's List"", when there are so many novels to consult for the atmosphere and so many memoirs to consult for the facts. Why was Powers pictured with such unkind shallowness? Why were CIA men and DDR functionaries such caricatures? No matter how great Mark Rylance was, where was the motivation and the ideology of the Soviet spy? Where were the political leaders of the two superpowers? How did the little lawyer from the Bronx become such a cool operative behind the lines, from one day to the other, without experiencing any fear or trepidation?<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with high morals or nostalgia in cinema but when a film tries to portray an episode from a complex political and ideological conflict serving only these ingredients, then I can only be disappointed at the waste of means and opportunities.

","BRIDGE of SPIES, Spielberg // Starring Tom Hanks in Lukewarm Coldwar drama.<br/><br/>Summary: Uninspired Spielberg Mountain from Molehill with pitiful Hanks in Pain throughout. Viewed at Colisée cinema, Marrakesh, Friday Dec. 4, 2015. By Alex Deleon. With so many intriguing Cold War subjects up for grabs one wonders what made Steven Spielberg choose this relatively minor Cold War incident as the subject matter of his latest directorial effort. <br/><br/>The background: In the summer of 1960 an American high altitude spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union and pilot Gary Powers who bailed out and survived was interned by the Russians. At about the same time a big time Russian spy with US citizenship was arrested and put on trail for treason in the USA. Idealistic New York attorney James Donovan (Hanks) defends him in court and is then recruited by the CIA to facilitate an exchange of this spy for captured U2 spy plane pilot Powers in Berlin. The exchange took place in divided Berlin on Feb. 20, 1962 at the height of the Kennedy administration six months prior to the Cuban Missiles crisis. <br/><br/>The foreground: The result: a big disappointment with a heavy handed script by the Coen Brothers and some very bad acting in a long tedious dragged out attempt to elevate this subject to the level of Greek tragedy with Tom Hanks pulling slightly different variations of a pained face in every scene he's in, which is most of the picture. Greek tragedy this is not, although we are compelled to feel a little sorry for Hanks when his steadfast defense of the American Constitution is met with hate, derision, and even death threats from his fellow Americans, and then he has to hide his dangerous spy exchange trip from his own family when he volunteers to go to Berlin on a thankless top secret mission to ease cold war tensions and save an American college student stranded in East Berlin into the bargain. En somme:to sum up --<br/><br/>From The combination Spielberg/Hanks and the setting in Berlin, a city I know so well, I expected much more. This turned out to be a routine, almost soppy Hanks performance and a very routine uninspired turn by Spielberg at the helm. First of all I remember the era of the film very well and it did not seem to me at the time to be nearly the momentous event it is built up to be in this film. If lawyer Donavan (Hanks) was in the news for a while it certainly wasn't a very big while, and the spy exchange at the bridge was merely seen as a minor event in much more momentous cold war Events of the time such as the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1962 and The Cuban missile crisis in October 1962. I remember thinking at the time that it was nice for our side to admit for once that We also Spy and thought that might be the ball Spielberg would run with. But the mawky family drama we are given, and the overall talkiness with little backup action, plus the building up of the the exchange on the Berlin bridge in freezing winter weather to an event of Superbowl proportions simply does not have the drama we are supposed to think it had. Overall, a dud that fails to go off in a stagy unrecognizable Berlin. Recommended only for die-hard Tom Hankniks who sympathize with Mr. next-door America, no matter what he does. As for the Cold War political background -- Google tells it much better. (Google, Gary Powers, U2 incident) Alex, Marrakesh.<br/><br/>:"

"AlienByChoice","4","39","67","22 October 2015"," Disappointingly shallow and poorly acted out
","Hanks, Alda, Spielberg, the Coen brothers. What can go wrong? Apparently, quite a lot.<br/><br/>Strengths first: the meticulous recreation of the 60's across two countries is breathtaking. The streets look 60's, the people look and talk 60's, the atmosphere is 60's. It's immersing and awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>Now the weaknesses: 1) Lots and lots of exposition. I understand that the millenials are expected to not know the history from 50 years ago, but come on - if someone doesn't know/love history they aren't going to see this movie in the first place. Stop wasting our time with exposition. 2) Poor acting. This must be the weakest performance from Tom Hanks I've seen in years. The guy is sleep-walking through the role, and everyone else is wooden and not worth mentioning, except for Alan Alda who steals every scene he's in. Amy Ryan is just awful I'm sorry to say. 3) Too long. Way too long. Should've ended with the exchange taking place. We don't need the ""happy end"" through vindication - it's completely implausible too. 4) Not focused. The pilot's story is completely surplus to requirements and insignificant - it doesn't add anything to the narrative. We don't really need to see the pilot until his first scene in captivity. Instead, the time should be spent on character development of which there is absolutely none. 5) Predictable. Yes, the story is well known and we all know how it ends, but this means that the unpredictability needs to be in the nuances. The little things that aren't part of the written history. But everything is predictable, nothing is captivating. 6) The treatment of the story. The script is by the Coen brothers but it has John Le Carre written all over it. It's a classic Le Carre-like spy thriller (thriller, not action). There have been fantastic film adaptations of Le Carre, so we know it can be done. Sadly, on this occasion Spielberg fails to deliver.<br/><br/>4/10"

","It was opening night, the theater was packed and I was expecting greatness. After all, this story is right in Spielberg's wheelhouse. The time period, cold war, Tom Hanks, the stars were aligned. I will start with this notion, Spielberg's movies are always well acted, always well shot and always beautifully scored. Bridge of Spies does not fail this standard. There are clearly some remarkable acting performances. It wouldn't be a surprise to see some trophies handed out for this work. The director got what he needed, superb acting. The actors did not get what they need, superb story telling. It is the only thing missing here but it's a biggie. <br/><br/>If you know anything about the real life story of James Donovan you could easily imagine a truly exciting movie. The opening credit sequence included this line...Based on Real Events. This disclaimer gives license to the director to ""Hollywood up"" the story. So basically there are no excuses. In Munich, the director pealed your sole with great story telling, tension and acting. Bridge of Spies had that potential, at least, that's what I was expecting. Tension was left out of this movie for some reason. I theorize Spielberg did this intensionally. Why? Somebody should ask him."

","How Steven Spielberg went from the king of summer thrills to the most boring director in Hollywood is a problem that's perplexed me since I pried my eyes open through Lincoln.<br/><br/>We all know the man can make a great movie. Most of us grew up on a diet of E.T., Jaws and Indiana Jones: spectacular event films with all the entertainment oomph of a theme park roller coaster.<br/><br/>Then, Spielberg hit middle age and wanted to make important films for grown-ups. He made Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and Munich, but he also made Minority Report, A.I and War of the Worlds – pretty decent action films with big star power.<br/><br/>It looked like Spielberg had come of age with a sharpened skill set and a slightly deeper world view, but the more high-brow Spielberg gets, the duller his movies become...<br/><br/>Inspired by real life events, and apparently a footnote in a JFK biography, Bridge of Spies tells the story of an insurance attorney named James Donovan. A mild-mannered family man plucked from a Norman Rockwell painting, Donovan is as American as the flag itself – and it's a trait he waves at every opportunity, from gratuitous speeches about the American Constitution to his acceptance of a case he is destined to lose.<br/><br/>In the opening act, we watch an older man (Mark Rylance) take his easel on the subway, sit in the park and paint, and very carefully remove a fake nickel from the underside of a park bench. The nickel is hollow, and written on a tiny piece of paper within, is a series of codes.<br/><br/>The man's name is Rudolf Abel, and he's arrested for treason and espionage just a few moments later. Given the year is 1957, Abel's fate looks bleak. The Rosenbergs were executed just four years earlier after being convicted of similar charges, and Abel refuses to cooperate with the CIA, making him delectably disposable.<br/><br/>These days, he'd probably just disappear, but back then, America still believed its own propaganda and the notion of due process. It must appear as if Abel is getting a fair and just trial, which is where James Donovan comes in... It feels a little like a greatest hits album, but the scenes with Mark Rylance have real pop. The two men have an interesting dynamic as ideological warriors who landed on different sides of the battlefield, and it's the only part of the film that has any real traction because everyone else is locked in a freezer of Cold War archetype.<br/><br/>Spielberg capitalizes on the common ground, offering up timely and inspirational rhetoric concerning the importance of due process, Constitutional rights and freedoms, and the American way, but like Lincoln, the big speeches have all the subtlety of a Broadway musical...<br/><br/>Abridged from Ex.Press.com"

","This movie is long, stagy, pretentious and boring. The acting is hammy, and the characters are drab and inspire little interest. The tension should have been gripping. Instead it is absent. The ending of movie is already known and is anti-climatic. The movie seems to suggest that Abel was not treated fairly and downplays the seriousness of his crimes and the sinister nature of his work. The treatment of Francis Gary Powers is completely superficial, which makes the story even weaker. For an audience not familiar with the history surrounding Abel and Powers, this movie will not make any sense at all. This movie contains no heroes, heroines, no damsels in distress, none of the stock characters and situations usually employed to give a story some substance. Instead, the movie just plods along to its foregone conclusion. Why would any movie maker find such bland characters worthy of a movie? The real story is how the Soviets managed to shoot down an American spy plane flying at 70,000 feet. How the Soviets were able to detect and target a U2 flying at that altitude is not explained, nor is the huge political fallout caused by the Powers debacle even mentioned. Indeed, the names of Eisenhower and Khrushchev are absent, yet in the actual event they were the key players, and by leaving them out, there's no story."

","Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance lead the way here and give superlative performances in this cerebral and powerful Cold War drama. Another masterful movie from director Steven Spielberg, with a most solid screenplay from Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel.<br/><br/>The films all centers around the initial defense of accused Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance) by attorney James B.Donovan (Hanks), which made Donovan a most unpopular man in America, especially when he appealed Abel's conviction all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the conviction by a 5-4 vote.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in 1960, a U.S. U-2 pilot, Francis Gary Powers was captured by the Soviets, after his spy plane was shot down over Soviet territory. Subsequently, the American State Dept. would ask Donovan to possibly negotiate an exchange of Abel and Powers, since Donovan had been contacted by the Soviets through the East Germans that this might be possible.<br/><br/>Based on true events, there's plenty of intrigue here as Donovan, through intense and difficult negotiations, tries to acquire the release of the two prisoners, along with a third prisoner the American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), being held on ""spy"" charges by the East Germans. It will all culminate in some amazing and tense scenes on the German Glienicke Bridge.<br/><br/>All in all, I found this to be a first class movie, that despite it's length of 2 hrs. and 21 min., had me absorbed throughout."

","""Bridge of Spies"" from 2015 is about the Francis Gary Powers incident in the 1960s. As usual, with the exception of the Lincoln assassination, I remember it. This time, though, only vaguely.<br/><br/>The U.S. arrested a Russian spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and chose James Donovan (Tom Hanks) who had some experience in military cases, to defend him. Abel is found guilty but Donovan is able to convince the Judge to commute his sentence to life in case the U.S. needs him later - for instance, if we should want to exchange him for one of our own.<br/><br/>That situation happens when Francis Gary Powers, taking aerial photographs for the CIA, is shot down and taken prisoner. Donovan is then sent to negotiate the exchange.<br/><br/>For many people, this will be a slow, talky drama, with one big action scene, Powers being shot down, and one scene of tension (if you don't know the outcome).<br/><br/>It is, however, a very good drama with Hanks giving a strong and sometimes humorous performance as Donovan, thrust into the world of international spies and negotiations. He takes it upon himself to also work for the freedom of an American student, Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) who was arrested for being at the wrong place at the wrong time. <br/><br/>That student is the only person involved in the case who is alive today, at 83, and praised the film but thought they ""took a lot of liberties with it."" Well, that's Hollywood.<br/><br/>The main reason, other than historical interest, to watch this film is the performance of Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel. A winner of three Tony awards, two Olivier awards, and a BAFTA, Rylance is a highly regarded stage actor, known as the best of his generation. He's made very few films but he's about to make more and take the film industry by storm.<br/><br/>As Abel, Rylance creates a human being, portraying him as a quiet, unassuming older man sent to do a job. He bonds with Donovan, but he tells him that he's not afraid to die. He spends his time in prison drawing. It is a remarkable performance which has earned him an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Strangely, many people involved in this incident didn't live too long after -- Abel, who returned to the Soviet Union and to his family, lectured for 10 years and died in 1971; Donovan died in 1970; and Powers died in a helicopter crash while working for a TV station in 1977.<br/><br/>I hope the film will encourage some people to read up on this case - of course, I always hope that. Maybe some time somebody will do it rather than posting the question someone did about Gandhi -- was this a fictional character."

","I don't know what it is about 2015, but I think this year has been full of films that don't entirely meet your expectations. I don't necessarily mean that those films are bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it seems like film after film end up making me feel a bit letdown. Bridge of Spies is the new Steven Spielberg directed film based on true events during the cold war. It focuses on James B. Donovan, played by Tom Hanks, who is thrust into representing a supposed Soviet spy in court and Donovan's further involvement in executing an exchange of prisoners with Russia.<br/><br/>Much like Crimson Peak, this film is not really what the trailers make it out to be. The trailers heavily focused on the relationship between Donovan and his client, Rudolf Abel. The film gives us maybe 20 minutes between them in the beginning, but really that's all. To me, their relationship and the scenes between Hanks and Mark Rylance, who plays Abel, are easily the best the film has to offer. Even though it's never truly clear as to why Donovan backs this man so much and his motivations behind continuing the negotiations, I really bought into their dynamic. In fact, it's the only true payoff you get in the end is their relationship and its outcome.<br/><br/>By no means is Bridge of Spies a bad film, it's not. It doesn't help that it's directed by perhaps the greatest director of all time, in Steven Spielberg. Expectations are sometimes far too high for his films. But I think the problem here is that there's just not a ton of meat to this story and it's one of Spielberg's weaker films in recent memory, but really he doesn't make any bad films. Some things did bother me about his directing here though. For example, there is a character introduced within the first 10 minutes as Donovan's associate and partner. He attends Donovan's family dinner and seems to be set up as help to Donovan and a slight possible romance is hinted at with this character and Donovan's daughter. Well, after one scene we don't see this character ever again.<br/><br/>Amy Ryan plays Donovan's wife, who I absolutely adore as an actress, is also incredibly underused. I guess what I'm trying to get across here is that there is no flow to the movie. Or rather, no arc. It's very predictable, being a true story, but the tension isn't there either. It's a slow moving picture with a great climax but not a ton of build to get to that great climax. Surprisingly, this could be contributed to Spielberg. Spielberg does do a great job of taking us to the time of the Cold War. He certainly gives us the feeling that at any moment war could have been truly started by either side. The performances are all really good. Mark Rylance who plays Abel does a magnificent job in his limited screen-time and rightfully never gives one way or another in terms of his innocence. Tom Hanks is, well, Tom Hanks. And Thomas Newman replaces John Williams as the composer and does a wonderful job as he always does. There's a lot to really like about Bridge of Spies, more than not. But for me, it was just a bit of a letdown in its lack of intensity and pay off. I wouldn't have known it was the Coen Bros script and Spielberg's directing if it wasn't for the trailers and marketing.<br/><br/>+Rylance & Hanks together<br/><br/>+Spielberg transports you to the Cold War<br/><br/>+Newman's score<br/><br/>+Climax<br/><br/>-Lack of intensity<br/><br/>-Didn't get enough of Donovan and Abel together<br/><br/>7.0/10"

The problem is that each time he comes across an obstacle turns out all he has to do is simply ask someone to remove it for him! And for some reason they do it for him! Every single time! He does this over and over again throughout the film. It's ridiculous. If he can simply ask for whatever wants then there is nothing at stake.

It has all the ingredients Spielberg is known for, the hope in humanity, the believe in the mans power to change the course of history for the good, the true selfless, and so on. <br/><br/>The cast is beyond perfect, and everyone gives amazing performances, but of course Tom Hanks steals the show, he gives one of his most likable performances, in the end the character helps a lot. Its just a bigger than life character which fits like a glove in Tom Hanks. The other characters are also amazing, but the one that stands the most to me, even if hes not the one to appear the most, is the Russian spy (Mark Rylance) hes just one of those characters that his so unique and likable that is amazing.<br/><br/>The production values are just top notch as one would expect from a Spielberg film. The visuals are hauntingly beautiful and perfectly illustrate the feel of the cold war. The film is amazingly shot, there's a scene with an aircraft that is breathtaking. The special effects are perfect. The production design is bound to be nominated for an Oscar, special attention to the Berlin settings. The score is another hit for Thomas Newman, though the film has this amazing atmosphere were there's very little score and the one there is is mainly in the final minutes. This gives a very authentic and realistic feeling to the film, its like you are really rgere. Thats why i was surprised that the length of the score is almost 50 minutes! <br/><br/>Overall the film has a lot in common with Lincoln, its really the perfect follower to that amazing picture. This is one of those films where you just get lost in the story, it's a very immersive film, a true masterpiece thats bound to get a ton of nominations from the academy."

","Bridge of spies is not your typical movie, it almost seems like it would be boring, except it isn't. This film is like a tree that you drive by on your way to work. Nothing special, quite ordinary; and then one day you see it from a different angle, and the way the dew glistening off of its leaves catches the sunlight, just takes your breath away. <br/><br/>As I mentioned before, bridge of spies is different, it doesn't have a particularly memorable score, or poetic dialogue, every character is portrayed as a ""regular guy/gal"". The credit must go to the Coen brothers here. The actors lines, particularly the exchanges between Hanks' and Rylance's characters are stirring in their simplicity. The story unfolds similarly, everything sort of just happens, and at the end, it all fits together perfectly.<br/><br/>Nobody knows, what makes Spielberg so great, is it his groundbreaking camera work? or perhaps his implementation of cutting edge visual effects? In my humble opinion it is his enigmatic ability to take what would likely be dull and uninteresting in the hands of any other director, and turn it into a thing of wonder. This movie plays out naturally, with moments of subtle heroism, and true human emotion, it is so very downplayed, that one simply cannot pull their eyes away. Bridge of Spies is truly an Organic Wonder."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","4","5","27 February 2016"," A solid and effective piece of filmmaking through and through
","Following ""War Horse"" and ""Lincoln,"" ""Bridge of Spies"" rounds out Steven Spielberg's trilogy of histories in the 2010s, each film earning a Best Picture nomination for being a superb piece of craft — and having Spielberg's name attached.<br/><br/>None of these are bad, but they are extremely traditional films evoking the prestige dramas of the '90s and not necessarily offering anything new. As such, ""Bridge of Spies"" doesn't shed new light on Cold War history, but it does tell a small story with of inspirational characters with a lot of heart.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan, an insurance attorney asked to represent a recently detained Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). A proud Constitutionalist of sorts, Donovan decides it's his honor and duty to give one of America's most hated men his right to a defense. Then, when a U.S. pilot is captured in Soviet territory, the CIA recruits Donovan to negotiate a swap. <br/><br/>""Bridge of Spies"" echoes ""Lincoln"" in its portrayal of a morally tenacious man who stood firm in the face of opposition. Putting an actor as likable Hanks in the role of someone as upstanding and charming as Donovan is almost unfair. The script, treated by Mark Charman and also the Coen brothers, builds clever scenes for Hanks to navigate through with total ease. The story doesn't push or challenge the veteran, but it does frame everything that's happening with the appropriate weight, enough so that we can connect with everything Donovan is going through and respect the decisions he makes and Hanks helps communicate those stakes. The Cold War was an ugly time; it might seem that what Donovan did and how he approached his responsibilities was a moral no-brainer, but it was actually quite complicated and extremely unpopular.<br/><br/>Rylance as well is a an excellent stroke of casting genius. More known for his stage work, the veteran creates a portrait of a man so self-assured it's frightening. It's the kind of nuanced supporting role that is easy to overlook when most award-winning supporting turns are flashy scene-stealers.<br/><br/>Spielberg and longtime director of photography Janusz Kaminski give ""Bridge of Spies"" such richness. This is a film driven by plot and acting, but the picture is pristine. In particular, the way they capture East Berlin during the negotiations scenes is feels haunting in a way few films taking place in that similar time and place have. Also, the visual symbolism of reflections and different perspectives is something Spielberg plays with subtly but enough so to put some artistic flourishes on his film. Most importantly, the climactic bridge sequence works on every level, and that alone proves Spielberg, cast and crew all did their job.<br/><br/>When Spielberg is done directing, ""Bridge of Spies"" will probably not make anyone's list of his top films, but it shows that just about any corner of history can make for an excellent film in capable hands.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"jeustace7","9","25","49","8 October 2015"," Subtle, Focused- Hanx a lot, Spielberg!
","I know that a portion of my positive experience in viewing this film came from the fact that I was privileged enough to see an advance screening attended by the Secretary of the Air Force, Francis Gary Powers Jr. (son of the U2 pilot downed in the USSR), and an AF Colonel who flew the U2 for the making of this film. All three spoke before the film and they had many warm words for Steven Spielberg's professionalism and his appreciation for uniformed service-members. Apparently Spielberg's father visited Russia during the Cold War and served as a radio operator in the military at some point- giving Spielberg a personal reason to ""get things right"" in the movie. <br/><br/>I thought the film's strongest point was its edifying, anti-xenophobic message. Tom Hanks plays a kind of Atticus Finch in the face of McCarthy-style anti-Russian public sentiment. The (french?) recurring epithet for Hank's Character's resolve ""stoique majete"" (sp?) reminded me of the yiddish concept of a ""mensch."" And that's not too surprising seeing as the Coen Brothers co-wrote the script. <br/><br/>Though there was no spiritual theme to the movie, I couldn't help but thinking of 1 Peter 5:6 ""Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time."" This would apply to Tom Hank's unassuming character who is elevated to more and more influential positions simply because he is faithful in the tasks he is given. Very refreshing to see a ""reluctant hero"" as realistic as this. Just a man willing to do the right thing even when it's unpopular. Definitely echoes of Oscar Schindler, one of Spielberg's previous protagonists. Also had a couple scenes that reminded me of Munich, though this film is much more enjoyable. <br/><br/>Last thing I'll say is that I enjoyed a number of the casting decisions. Don't know that I could name any of the actors outside of Hanks, but it made the film so much more fun to have a strong actor in the role of the Russian spy (the relationship that develops between Hanks and the spy is really fun to watch). Hank's character's wife plays a small part but does a great job of portraying stern, loving concern without becoming grating. Honestly thought Powers (the downed pilot) could have been a little more two-dimensional, but the movie is clearly ""not about him"" so the movie didn't suffer and he had enough aw-shucks-young-american-in-the-60's to make him likable. Hank's one line to him is priceless. Such a relief to have a summary of the film's themes delivered in such an effortless way. <br/><br/>Great film! And it got a thumbs-up from the downed-pilot's son in terms of historical accuracy (obviously some details changed for screenplay's sake). Enjoy!"

Those brought up on John Le Carré might perhaps expect from this moral equivalence, shabby compromise and exhausted futility.

","Beside the good acting of Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, there isn't many good things about this movie. Tom Hanks appears as a symbol of 'great' America, doing the right things one after another, even though the authorities are against it (like it is possible for him to act so independent) to symbolize how 'great' is the US.<br/><br/>On the other hand Soviets are the evils as usual. Tortures against American soldier/spy, hostile military officers even against their own spy ( while American soldier does the exact opposite), scared children that got education at school about nuclear war (ironically with the footage of nuclear experiments that US did) and many other things that show how evil the Soviet was. But the American side had right causes to act unjust (not evil, just unjust) because they are patriots which is a good thing.<br/><br/>To summarize, it is all about taking necessary dosage of American propaganda with some good acting."

Yes, you read that correctly. There was really nothing moving about the movie and the over saturated directing made it even worse. The main few events were played over and over so much that the end of the story felt blaise. Great material and wonderful that it is a true story but it was the most shallow slow moving boring docudrama and I love history but I would not recommend or waste any money on this movie.

If this was the intent, then even a yeoman effort from Hanks fails to make this character connect with the viewer, to resonate. In spite of it all, he comes across as a wildcard pick in a game which he never really understood.<br/><br/>And if the events of the last few years are any indication -- this written in 2015 -- it was a game the rest of us never understood either."

You know a movie is not captivating if you are looking for product placement or movie cars.<br/><br/>A couple of good performances make this bearable. There is a scene near the end where the kids call their mother into the room to watch the news story. Seems odd that they knew what was coming and laughable they would call in their parents.<br/><br/>The Janusz Kaminski Cinematography looks good on the big screen.

It's not. Spielberg and Coen don't avoid controversial issues. The movie-goer is jarred with a few thought-provoking comparisons and some gentle reminders of the difficulties of life and hypocrisies of that era. Much of the movie deals with the legal issues involved. Donovan, originally an insurance litigator, is the lawyer for the Russian spy.<br/><br/>I have to give this movie 9/10 because I can't think of a single thing wrong with it.

Given the accolades, I was hoping for something more suited for an adult audience. Rylance is a good actor, but that doesn't make it a good film, just watchable when he is in the scene. And those poor kids of Hank's - subject to such hatred because big daddy stood up for justice and the American flag. It isn't even interesting from the historic recreation of New York - just a demonstration of how much money can be spent on a movie that really doesn't tell much of a story.

It's a Spielberg film, so outstanding cinematography is a given.<br/><br/>The plot isn't 100% historically accurate (as are most, if not all ""based on a true story"" films), but it is still very good. Every American, every citizen of the former East Germany and West Germany, every citizen of Russia or any former republic of the Soviet Union, such as Lithuania, Kyrgyzstan, Estonia; every citizen of a former Warsaw Pact country such as Romania, Poland, the former Czechoslovakia, Albania; MUST SEE this movie, especially those who weren't old enough during the Cold War. Life in our countries was very different during the Cold War. Many people, young and old alike, didn't live long enough to see the end of the Cold War, or the demolition of the Berlin Wall, because they were killed. Many families were separated or forced to relocate during the Cold War. Some of us served in the armed forces then and are known as ""Cold Warriors"". Some of these people might've been your relatives or friends of your family.<br/><br/>The film depicts a part of the life and the negotiations of an American attorney during the Cold War and how tense things used to be.

","This film, based on the true events surrounding the exchange of U2 Spy Plane pilot Francis Powers and the Soviet spy Rudolf Able, in 1960s Berlin, is disappointing.<br/><br/>What condemns this film is its total lack of suspense or realism. The film miserably fails to show what must have been a very tense build up to the exchange.<br/><br/>And it's this lack of realism, so vital in espionage movies, that really grates on one.<br/><br/>The director of Bridge of Spies, Stephen Spielberg, is known for his uncynicism in his film making and that he tries to portray decency and moral courage even in 'worlds'' where the facts might speak otherwise. Many critics have welcomed this view of the spy world as filmed by Spielberg.<br/><br/>But the world of spies and spy catchers is not a nice or honourable world; it's a murky world of lies and betrayal, dog-eat-dog, where Innocent people, as well as betrayed agents, are captured, tortured and murdered. To portray traitor Abel as an honourable man, as does Spielberg, is nonsense. <br/><br/>The idea that one-time insurance claims lawyer and Nuremburg participant Donovan (played by Tom Hanks) and Able (played by Mark Rylance) would dictate to the Soviets/East Germans, not to mention the CIA, that the student Pryor must cross Check Point Charlie before Able crosses the bridge into east Germany, is pure fantasy; nonsensical romanticism. One of many corny scenes in the film.<br/><br/>Donovan, who represented Able at his trial, is also seen to be arranging for the release of Pryor off his own bat, against the wishes of his CIA handlers; again, pure fantasy and another sign that the film's makers are not interested in facts or the film taking a realistic look at what would actually have been allowed to have taken place.<br/><br/>By-the-by, Tom Hanks' monologues on the American Constitution and how glorious and wonderful is justice in America, were boringly predictable. Then there are the other corny scenes which one can barely believe Spielberg directed. There's the infantile symbolism of Donovan witnessing kids climbing and jumping over walls and fences from his commuter train into Manhattan. And at the same time he has a flashback of the last time he was on a train - one travelling through Berlin when he saw people being shot dead as they tried to scale the Berlin Wall. How trite is that? Then there's another flashback- train- scene when one moment Donovan remembers getting hateful looks for defending Abel but once back home, in the present, after 'rescuing' Powers, the self-same commuters are looking at him in awe. Again, how corny and trite is that?<br/><br/>Then there's the final scene when Donovan arrives home to be greeted on the steps by his wife. She thinks he's been on a business trip to England but within seconds of his arrival a man on the telly, with perfect timing, is revealing that Donovan had in fact been in East Germany helping get Powers released. Again, how corny and trite is that? In fact it gets worse, so the less said of the scenes the better, save to say that I have seen more cutting edge directing and story telling in The Waltons.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies, as a spy thriller, as it was marketed as and not a drama, or even a docu/drama, is not in the same league as the film version of John le Carre's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, and its British TV version; and one of the all time great spy movies, also written by le Carre, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.<br/><br/>Spielberg's softly, softly approach to the murky world of spies doesn't wash; the hard - nosed, cynical approach by le Carre, a one-time MI6 officer, most certainly does."

","There are theories that the Francis Gary Powers shoot down by USSR had something to do with JFK's eventual death. This movie stays away from that and instead the focus is on how the US made a deal to get Powers back. Based on a true story this movie tries to recreate the drama behind all these events.<br/><br/>It does so without sinking to the depths of action sequences which director Spielberg often directs. He is proving to be a capable drama director as Lincoln proved that just a short time ago. Somehow he brought the Coen's in to write this drama along with Matt Charman. The result is a quite functional drama replete with the feeling of the cold war.<br/><br/>The history lesson here is of value and this film is done totally from the US perspective. This makes sense as the other side was not consulted on this one. The film might even be a little too careful on how it is presented. Tom Hanks is always good though in this film there is not a lot of character development other than Hanks and the Russian Spy (Mark Rylance) Rudolph Abel who is excellent. Hanks wife gets little bits of stuff but not much and even Hank's assistant Doug - Billy Magnussen gets but one or two scenes. <br/><br/>This film is a 2 figure drama, and the main draw back is while they explain how great this accomplishment was, there is very little of why the reasons the negotiations were so successful. This is a timely reminder about a Cold War which is now often forgotten, now that there are hot wars going in several countries today.<br/><br/>This is when diplomacy was practiced and refined so as to achieve positive results.

"zardoz-13","10","12","25","26 October 2015"," Triumph of Spies!!!
","Historians have chronicled the events during the intervening fifty-three years in director Steven Spielberg's gripping Cold War thriller ""Bridge of Spies,"" so little comes as a complete surprise. Despite the conspicuous absence of suspense, this lavishly produced, persuasively acted, and thoroughly engrossing film remains utterly captivating. Working from a screenplay by Matt Charman, rewritten by Joel and Ethan Cohen of ""Fargo"" fame, Spielberg makes largely minor departures from the actual occurrences as they unfolded and recreates history with atmospheric spontaneity. Tom Hanks plays the congenial central character in this literate chess game of international espionage that opens with the arrest of a Soviet spy in America and culminates on a lonely Berlin bridge at dawn with rival world superpowers swapping the spy for captured U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers. Spielberg doesn't squander a second in this literate narrative and shoehorns a plethora of action into 135 minutes without resorting to glamorous heroics and gratuitous pyrotechnics. Everybody always raves about the magnitude of story above all else, and ""Bridge of Spies"" exemplifies why a good, solid story—even one that has been well-documented in the international press at the time—can still yield an immensely entertaining film. Each character stands out dramatically, and each has been etched with sympathy so we are concerned about their situation. At the heart of the matter, ""Bridge of Spies"" emerges as a realistic, bona fide ""Mission Impossible"" outing when you consider all the variables that the unseen hand of fate brought to the table. What makes it doubly interesting is that only a singular incident like this could have ushered these individuals into each other's company.<br/><br/>""Bridge of Spies"" unfolds with the FBI arresting Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance of ""Prospero's Books"") in Brooklyn during 1957. Abel had maintained a low-profile as one of the top Soviet spies in America. Masquerading as an artist, he collected sensitive information without calling attention to himself. The Soviets relied on what are known as dead letter mail boxes. Information could be stashed and retrieved, without it being apparent to most people, in innocuous places. Abel sat on a bench one day to paint a picture of a bridge. As he adjusted his easel, he felt under the bench and found a hollowed coin containing a coded message. Later, after the Feds raided his studio apartment, Abel destroyed the message under their noses while they ransacked his premises for incriminating evidence. At this point, Brooklyn insurance claims attorney James Donovan (Tom Hanks of ""Forrest Gump"") enters the arena. The corporate law firm where he is a partner informs him that the New York Bar Association wants him to serve as Abel's pro-bono counsel so nobody can impugn American justice. Mind you, everybody but Donovan considers Abel's conviction a foregone conclusion. Of course, he concedes he has been chosen to defend the most hated man in America. ""Everyone will hate me,"" Donovan laments, ""but at least I'll lose."" Neither Donovan's wife, Mary (Amy Ryan of ""Capote""), nor his children share his principles. Nevertheless, Donovan goes into court swinging with everything that he has, and he discovers the deck has been stacked against him. Judge Byers (Dakin Matthews of ""Thirteen Days"") refuses to grant Donovan adequate time to prepare Abel's defense. Later, when Donovan advises Byers that the FBI had no search warrant so all the evidence should be banned, the judge ignores him. Inevitably, despite his noble efforts, Donovan cannot clear Abel. Later, Donovan visits the judge at his honor's residence and persuades the crusty old jurist to display some compassion and sentence the Soviet to prison rather than the electric chair. Byers heeds Donovan's advice despite frenzied public opinion after he delivers his verdict.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the CIA recruits U.S.A.F. pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell of ""Whiplash"") to fly a high altitude jet to conduct aerial reconnaissance over the U.S.S.R. A Soviet SA-2 surface-to-air missile cripples Power's plane. He bails out, but fails to obliterate his U2 plane. Of course, the Soviet capture Powers, convict him as a spy, and sentence him to prison. Not long afterward, Donovan receives a letter from the Soviets and finds himself flying to Berlin as a private citizen to negotiate a prisoner exchange: Abel for Powers. Donovan gets the royal runaround between the Soviets as well as the East Berlin authorities. Nonetheless, he proves himself to be a shrewd man with a bargain, and he pits the Soviets against East Berlin. Ultimately, he never gives ground during these complicated negotiations. The catch is he must negotiate between the superpowers as a private individual rather than an official American envoy. Read Donovan's insightful memoir ""Strangers on the Bridge,"" and you'll acquire a new appreciation for this crafty attorney.<br/><br/>Hanks brings a jovial, 'aw shucks' Jimmy Stewart charm to his portrayal of Donovan. Literally, ""Bridge of Spies"" could be seen as ""Mr. Smith Goes to Berlin."" Hanks looks like a paunchy, unassuming figure without a clue, but he emerges as the sharpest tack in the box. Donovan's history is pretty amazing when you think about what he accomplished. Meantime, Mark Rylance distinguishes himself as Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and he overshadows Hanks with a 'less is more' performance. Repeatedly, Donovan makes comments about Abel's apparent lack of anxiety. Facing certain death, the imperturbable Abel refuses to let the pressure affect him. ""Would it help?"" he queries Donovan to worry about his fate. Austin Stowell reminded me of cub reporter Jimmy Olsen from the 1950s' ""Superman"" TV show. He embodies the wholesome, clean-cut, but ambitious American who refuses to commit suicide and struggles to make the best of a dreadful predicament.<br/><br/>Spielberg does an exceptional job of condensing and cross-cutting these events. Budgeted at $40 million, ""Bridge of Spies"" looks authentic with its multiple locations in American and Europe. Indisputably, ""Bridge of Spies"" couldn't have been produced during the Cold War because objectivity would have been harshly compromised. Spielberg's historical reenactment is relevant because contemporary American democracy faces similar challenges."

","What is it about Spielberg? He has turned into the King of the Banal. Or perhaps he was always thus? Except for Jaws maybe?<br/><br/>But let's start with the GOOD stuff first. First off, I'm okay watching a Spielberg movie because I know he's not going to be using HAND- HELD throughout the movie. I seriously appreciate the camera work of people like Spielberg or Wes Anderson because I know I don't have to take Dramamine to watch their stuff.<br/><br/>Secondly, Rylance probably deserved his Oscar. He's so mysterious. You always want to know what is going on with that guy! I just loved his fake befuddlement near the beginning of the movie when the CIA bust in on him. Great stuff.<br/><br/>Third - Hanks. Tom Hanks does a bang up job giving this character real humanity. He turns him into a real person...as much as he can, since there is not much of a real person in the way the character was written. Another one of Spielberg's stalwart heroes. Dull as dishwater - except for the fact that Hanks wrestles the human being out of the flat script.<br/><br/>So now onto the stuff that bugs me - let's start with the ending. Seriously, this movie could have ended 10 minutes earlier. Why oh why does S.S. have to always put those crappy endings on his movies? Hero comes home to wide-eyed adoring wife and/or children. And I'm a bit tired of these cypher-like, no-personality wives in these stupid movies.<br/><br/>Was the wife really part of the story? No, so it is not necessary to cram that character in there being all 50s wife-ish and yelling about what it's all DOING TO THE FAMILY and all that other trite crap. Since no women were actually involved in this story - historically - it's OKAY to not try to shoehorn a female character into it. We women won't get all offended! We'd much prefer you just leave out the doting wife crap altogether. And leave the precocious interactions with the son out too, please. Why is this stuff always in an S.S. movie? Every. Damn. Time.<br/><br/>Was there a point to having Alan Alda show up for 5 minutes to be a dick? And why set up this whole thing with the young man who was going to assist Donovan with the case and then the character just...disappears. Could S.S. cast someone even REMOTELY interesting to play Powers? And was all of New York really all reading the same newspaper and staring Donovan down on the subway? I really hate these dumb, made-up movie scenarios. Finally, nobody ever shot up Donovan's house. You really lose your credibility when you spice up the truth with bull-dooky incidents.<br/><br/>(As long as we are on that vein...did people in the late 50s/early 60s watch as much television as the family in this movie does? Wouldn't the little ones be outside playing stickball? Wouldn't the teen girl be up in her room playing 45s?)<br/><br/>It wasn't torturous to watch this movie. But it was just a movie. What it mostly did was spur you onto the internet to read about the real people and the real incidents. But as you are sitting and watching and getting curious about ""the real story"" you will find yourself rolling your eyes a lot."

The entire story, script, screenplay and dialogs were so well fed and uttered with skillful craftiness by Hanks and the soviet convict spy played by Rylance, which made viable sense and were bred with the thrill that ensures the viewer to stick to the end. <br/><br/>It is a must see spy thriller for mature audience taking them back in time to all those moments of glory unfold from enigmatic and suggestively nerve raking espionage taking place in the classic world of late 50s. Well done Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance for superb characterization of their respective roles, skillful film editing by Michael Kahn and top of the line direction by the old timer - Steven Spielberg."

","Bridge of Spies (2015) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Attorney James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is given the thankless job of defending suspected Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Donovan accepts the job but soon finds himself defending his client a bit too good for some, which leads to him being the main negotiator between America and Russia when it comes time for a prisoner swap.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's BRIDGE OF SPIES isn't one of the director's greatest works but it's certainly a very well-made film that manages to hold your attention throughout the rather long running time. I must admit that the trailer for the film really left me cold so I wasn't sure what to expect from the film but overall it's another good movie from the director, although the ending falls into that cringe-worthy, over-sentimental stuff that the director does quite often.<br/><br/>With that said, there's no doubt that there's a highly good story being told here that grabs your attention and doesn't let it go. The screenplay by Joel & Ethan Coen and Matt Charman does a very good job at capturing the spirit of the period and even if you're not familiar with the Cold War the film does a nice job at bringing you up to speed on the various fears. Spielberg perfectly handles the material and milks it for some nice drama as well as some political points that are certainly meant to be taken into consideration on some current issues.<br/><br/>Hanks, as you'd expect, turns in an excellent performance and is certainly believable in the role of the attorney who finds his life spinning out of control from not only his wife but strangers who feels he is helping a spy. Hanks is such a calm grace that it really was entertaining just seeing him negotiate. Rylance also deserves a lot of credit for the way he played this character and I really loved the laid back approach to where the character never tips his cap in regards to what and who he really is. Technically speaking the film is quite good and of high standards.<br/><br/>BRIDGE OF SPIES could have been a bit tougher on the political aspects but it's goal was to aim for the mainstream and in the end it's an entertaining film."
"moviexclusive","8","11","23","15 October 2015"," Easily one of Steven Spielberg's best films in recent years, this Cold War-era feel-good drama is a masterclass in old-fashioned Hollywood craftsmanship
","Steven Spielberg's latest Cold War-era thriller begins with a near- wordless cat-and-mouse overture that reminds us how much of a craftsman he is. In that brilliant opening, we watch transfixed as FBI agents trail a suspected Soviet agent named Rudolf Abel through subways, sidewalks and parks of Brooklyn before finally raiding his apartment and arresting him on charges of treason and espionage. As much as you'd expect Spielberg to follow that up with screw- tightening suspense, he confounds that expectation just as quickly with a droll introduction to his lead protagonist named James Donovan, a New York insurance claims attorney arguing why the accident in which the client he is currently representing had hit a car with five people should not be referred to as ""five things"" but just ""one thing"".<br/><br/>Sure enough, Spielberg doesn't try to do a Tom Clancy with this real-life story of how Donovan came to be appointed by the Bar to represent Abel and subsequently negotiated a tricky exchange of Soviet and American spies; instead, working with a brilliantly written script by Joel and Ethan Coen with Matt Charman that adapts freely from the historical record, Spielberg mounts a handsomely old-fashioned story of righteous underdog triumph. It is a feel-good drama in every sense of the word, one that not only celebrates Donovan's achievements but also honours the man for the principles of the U.S. Constitution for which he stood resolutely for, no matter how much others had already made up their mind about how the so-called American enemy should be treated.<br/><br/>Unfolding in two quite distinct halves, the first sees Donovan giving Abel a stout defence despite the CIA's interference and presenting a compelling argument to the judge why his client should not be put to death, while setting up the circumstances by which Donovan will in fact be proved right. At what seems narratively the same time as the trial itself, the U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), selected as part of an elite group to take part in a top-secret mission to take highly detailed photographs of military installations within the Soviet Union, is captured by the Russians after his plane is shot down. It is not long after that the Berlin wall will be erected, which an American economics student named Richard Pryor (Will Rogers) finds himself on the wrong side of and detained by the East Germans.<br/><br/>And so, in the second half, Donovan is recruited by the CIA to cut a deal with the Soviets that will see the former trade Abel for Powers' return – though Donovan decides on his own initiative to get two American men back for one Soviet spy. In contrast to the preceding half, this one is pretty much anchored through and through by Tom Hanks' Donovan, who makes multiple trips by himself across the Berlin Wall to negotiate separate deals with a top KGB agent on the return of Powers as well as a very Western East German lawyer named Vogel (Sebastian Koch) on Pryor's return. Donovan plays it cool in front of both the Soviets and the East Germans (what other choice does he have, really), but a scene where he is played by Vogel to be detained overnight by the East German police and another in which he watches East German refugees attempting to scale the wall being gunned down reinforces the peril within his lone-man mission as well as the complex geopolitical realities at play.<br/><br/>There is no secret whether Donovan manages to navigate the potentially treacherous waters (pun intended) to secure both Powers' and Pryor's releases – yes, the history books will already have you know that it all culminates at the Glienicke Bridge linking West Berlin with Potsdam, from which the movie takes its name. Rather than playing up the facts of the case, Spielberg opts instead to focus on the unlikely American hero with the modesty, high principles and simple fairness who would – as a post-script informs – be called upon to play yet another instrumental role in the subsequent negotiation with Fidel Castro for the 'Bay of Pigs' invasion. Yet Spielberg doesn't over-emphasise these ideals to make Donovan any sort of an icon; rather, Donovan just does the right thing from moment to moment, with an uncanny ability of ""feeling"" the person at the other end of the negotiation.<br/><br/>It is the sort of role that is perfectly suited for Hanks' Everyman charm, and the actor, here in his fourth collaboration with Spielberg, gets it down pat. Removing any hint of sanctimoniousness, Hanks puts on, on top of a warm and generous performance, an extra air of humanity to play the rookie who, though way out of his depth in the rough and murky waters of espionage, follows a clear conscience and abiding values to emerge as an admirable hero. Hanks makes it all seem so natural, but lest we take it for granted, it does require a formidable actor to play the ordinary Capra-esque hero with a dry humour and much intellect to bear. And at least for a good third of the film, Hanks is well-matched with veteran stage actor Rylance, whose understated performance as Abel is a masterclass in itself.<br/><br/>Indeed, there is never any doubt at any point in the film that we are amongst seasoned pros – besides Hanks and Spielberg, the latter's long-time collaborator Janusz Kaminski on camera who achieves a thick and luxurious atmosphere with his choice of shots and colour palette. This is as assured and confident Hollywood filmmaking as it gets, whether as a gripping fact-based docudrama or as a detailed character study or even as a sober lesson on tradecraft, political ideals and personal values. It is also Spielberg's best film in years, one that should and would see some deserved Oscar attention come next year."

","OK, Bridge Of Spies. Long (141 mins) and boring spy thriller with the usual performance from Tom Hanks (James Donovan) who's face throughout the middle of the movie looks like a carrot due to the the bad makeup and in the other half has the usual-suspect- grimace if he is having a poo because of too much effort trying to convince us with his tricks in a particular scene. The story is ...hm ""based on a true story"" which can't save it from superficiality. Mark Rylance who plays Rudolf Abel is much more interesting/convincing as an actor but also struggle in the adapted screenplay so whoever did it better not do it again.The Iron Curtain/Berlin Wall is very much Hollywood and you have seen it in many other movies so you are already prepared for it and will not surprise you.

I have to finally give a thumbs up to Spielberg for making a family friendly film (with the exception of some curse words which can be bleeped out).<br/><br/>This is a must see movie! It's gripping and wonderful. I love how Spielberg portrays the Cold War era without making it to risky for those who still remember it. Tom Hanks does a wonderful job in the lead role.

"bryank-04844","5","11","24","14 October 2015"," 'Bridge of Spies' with Hanks, Spielberg, and the Coen Bros. is solid, yet forgettable, & that's unfortunate!
","The year 2015 gives us yet another Tom Hanks/Steven Spielberg movie called 'Bridge of Spies' with an added bonus of the Coen Bros. serving as co-writers. Now with a cast and crew like this, I expect something that would live on forever and win all the awards come award season. That's not really the case here though, as Spielberg's recent directorial efforts have been lacking a bit. I'm not saying they're bad, I'm just saying that 'War Horse' and 'Lincoln' were long, slow, dreary period pieces with no real momentum, despite some awards and critical acclaim.<br/><br/>That being said, I bet any of you a hundred king-size Snicker's bars that you haven't watch or even thought of those two films since they were released. This all could be said about 'Bridge of Spies', which is of course, well made, interesting, fun, and well-acted, but really only worth one viewing and no more. Once it ends, you'll immediately forget about it and start thinking of Spielberg's next project, which a return to the sci-fi arena with 'Ready Player One'. I'm of the mindset that all of Spielberg's movies are worthy of unlimited viewings, no matter what time of day or night it is.<br/><br/>It's just unfortunate that 'Bridge of Spies' is not one of those instances. All that being said, 'Bridge of Spies' is technically top notch with Tom Hanks giving another good performance. Set during the height of the Cold War, a soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is caught in New York City and put to trial unjustly. Meanwhile, the US sent some new U-2 spy planes do to take some images of Mother Russia, where one plane was shot down over the Soviet Union, where the pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) survived the crash and was captured and put in prison.<br/><br/>Back in Brooklyn, lawyer James B. Donovan (Hanks) was forced to defend the Russian spy they caught and make sure he had a fair trial, but with the new information, he is tasked to try and make a deal to release the spies back into their country's custody. A trade off if you will. From here, Donovan has to weave in and out of high level Russian buildings, as he tries to broker a deal, which if not executed correctly, could have started a major war. There are plenty of Spielberg-ian moments to be had, which is always nice to see and Hanks's performance again is solid, however not on par with some of his previous work.<br/><br/>The script is tight and to the point, but there isn't really any guts or memorable moments in this film. It plays for a good two and a half hours, all of which are mildly entertaining, but in the end, it's completely forgettable, which is unfortunate, because you have Spielberg, Hanks, and the Coen Bros. here.<br/><br/>Worth a Look!"
"Troy_Campbell","6","7","14","26 October 2015"," Solid Cold War thriller, but a bit disappointing.
","Spielberg, Hanks, Coen Brothers. Rarely have there been so many members of the Hollywood royal family working together on a single motion picture. With this calibre of talent involved the expectations are unsurprisingly sky high; unfortunately this Cold War true story lands in the 'good, but not good enough' category and subsequently feels like a missed opportunity. At first it's difficult to pinpoint why the spark is missing as all the ingredients for an old-school espionage yarn are present, but after careful contemplation it seems to me that Spielberg may be going through the motions. His direction is purposely understated to be sure, although there is a distinct lack of oomph in his narrative propulsion that is strangely un-Spielbergian. There's also never any real sense of Hanks' American attorney being in danger, despite spending large chunks of time in war-torn Berlin liaising with shadowy Russian diplomats and volatile German soldiers. Nevertheless, this thriller predominantly satisfies thanks to another heartfelt performance from main man Hanks. His put upon lawyer is righteous but grounded, intelligent but humble, fearful but optimistic, all with a welcome dash of wit. In fact it's the Brooklyn-set first act that proves the most entertaining, when it's mostly a two-hander between Hanks and Mark Rylance's dryly-humorous Russian spy, the latter damn near stealing the show right from under Hanks' nose. With regular Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski on hand as director of photography, the movie looks utterly spectacular too, the glowing courtrooms of New York just as impressive as the snowy streets of a war-ravaged Germany. Bridge of Spies is a solid Cold War thriller with a compelling protagonist, yet with the Tinseltown heavyweights involved I can't help but think it's also somewhat of a disappointment."
"jaimegonzales210","3","11","25","12 January 2016"," Seems a bit one-sided
","I guess the point of the movie was to demonstrate that Americans are over-reactive, unfair and hateful. From childhood, apparently, Americans learn to be bad people who grow up to be worse people. Any enemies we have must be good people. Never mind that there were Russian spies in America, they are portrayed as the ""good guys"" here. Americans were bad for a.) catching Russian spies and b.) engaging in the same espionage Russia was engaging in.<br/><br/>A common theme among Hollywood stories seems to be that everyone but Americans are the good guys, yet Hollywood still has not relocated to the Palestine territories. Curious. It seems somewhat ironic to me that they benefit from capitalism while making movies about how actually evil capitalists are, then give themselves awards for half a year. Nobody I know makes $42 million for 24 days of filming, but somehow the person that does is more virtuous than my neighbor, who retired from law enforcement. He thinks America is a great place to live."
"classicalsteve","10","5","9","22 November 2015"," Cold-War Chess Match as Suspenseful as Any Thriller in Spielberg/Cohen Broithers Masterpiece
","For over a half-century after the Second World War, from circa 1945 to 1990, the United States was involved in a ""war"" of sorts with the USSR we call the ""Cold War"". Barring the USSR's military engagements, such as in Afghanistan and other border countries, few died on other side as a result of this Cold War (and spy thriller novelists made a fortune). The Cold War was a continual chess match of adversarial confrontation and tension between the two world super-powers and their respective allies, notably the USSR and their eastern bloc allies of the Warsaw Pact and the United States and their NATO Allies of the North Atlantic Treaty. Non-violent conflicts were nearly never-ending, their chess pieces involving spies, intelligence, and espionage, each side trying desperately to gain the upper hand over their respective adversary, constantly moving their pieces to different areas of the board. When the two sides came to secret negotiating tables, they engaged the game like poker players, holding their cards close to their chests, neither side revealing any more about their hands than absolutely necessary. ""Bridge of Spies"" written by the Cohen Brothers with Matt Charman and directed by Steven Spielberg, chronicles one such as ""game"".<br/><br/>Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance, in an Academy-Award caliber performance), a.k.a. Vilyam ""Willie"" Genrikhovich Fisher, was an older unassuming man in a small Brooklyn apartment appearing to engage in painting projects. While under the guise of a painter, Abel was passing military secrets to Soviet agents. His cover was blown in 1957 when CIA agents raided his apartment and arrested him on charges of espionage and spying for the USSR. The US government appeals to Abel for help in their intelligence gathering in exchange for his release, but Abel declines.<br/><br/>James Donovan (Tom Hanks), a former Nuremberg Trial associate prosecutor, is working as an insurance-claim lawyer in a New York firm. His firm asks him to defend Abel as a publicity gesture to prove the US engages in fair trails, even for those who are charged with the highest-level crimes against the United States. (The film makes it seem like he was an associate attorney forced by his firm to take the case, although at the time, Donovan was in fact a senior partner of his firm Watters and Donovan.) Donovan reluctant agrees to take the case.<br/><br/>The respective lawyers, prosecutor and defender, meet with the trail judge who explains the trail is only for ""show"" to publicly send a message to the USSR and the world at large that the US Justice Department treats all defendants fairly and impartially, even with those accused of the most heinous of crimes against the state. However, behind closed doors, the judge indicates the verdict is a foregone conclusion. Donovan, who desires to be true to his case and his client disagrees, stating the trial should be taken seriously and not act only as a kind of international publicity stunt. Donovan then meets with his client where a mutual understanding is exchanged in which Abel makes clear he has no intention of cooperating with US intelligence authorities. <br/><br/>At first Donovan is perturbed at his client's reluctance to aid the CIA as it could mean the death penalty for Abel. However, as their attorney-client relationship evolves, Donovan begins to have respect for Abel. Abel was engaging in activities which other men in service to the United States are doing to the other side. In a profound statement, Abel says to Donovan that he hopes an American spy caught on the other side will also not be mistreated. In the only part of the film which was a bit weak, details of the actual trial are glossed over before Abel's inevitable conviction. In a surprising turn, the judge does not give Abel the death penalty but rather sentences him to a long prison term.<br/><br/>In a different storyline, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is a US fighter pilot recruited by the CIA to engage in intelligence gathering. Scenes between the Abel case and Powers interweave and we learn about the recruitment and training process for pilots who have been drafted into the Cold War conflict. They are now expendable chess pieces in the larger game. They learn about their equipment and their undercover tasks which is so secret they are forbidden even to tell All-Mighty God about their endeavors. At first, Powers' story seems to have little to do with the Abel case, except Powers and Abel are both intelligence-gatherers for the different sides of the Cold War. However, as events play out, the two men's destinies will become intertwined. Eventually, Donovan will be traveling to Berlin where he'll see first-hand the creation of the infamous Berlin Wall.<br/><br/>An absolutely riveting and edge-of-your seat Cold War story. While there are no car chases and no gun-fire exchanges, the story is as compelling and suspenseful as any by Spielberg and the Cohen brothers. They are masters of the well-paced scene in which we the audience are never sure how the events will resolve. Even during the final climactic event of the film, which is largely understated, not much actually happens, but our anticipation of what might and might not occur keeps us glued to every gesture and expression. This is one of the best directorial offerings by Spielberg since ""Lincoln"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the most riveting by the Cohen Brothers since ""No Country for Old Men"". Not to be missed, but it should be noted if you're looking for an action and suspense film similar to a Bond or Le Carre offering, ""Bridge of Spies"" is not that kind of story."

"RforFilm","10","5","9","27 October 2015"," Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks strikes again with the fantastic political-legal thriller, Bridge of Spies
","As a child who grew up during the late nineties through the mid 2000's, I was part of the first generation to be raised in an era where there wasn't a second great power on Earth. Being born in 1987, I was living within the Cold War for only a few years, during the last moments of an interesting generation for America; a generation that once thought that a third World War with the Soviets was possible and that any day could be the last before the bomb was dropped. It was the last of an era were today's movie perfectly says was a war of information.<br/><br/>Given how many WWII movies are out there, I'm surprised that nostalgia and our obsession with history has not produced more movies about the Cold War. Though there are plenty before the Soviet Union was dissolved (Including Dr. Strangelove, Rocky IV and my favorite of the bunch, WarGames), you'd think that more stories about the era would have opened up allowing for plenty of entertaining options. Steven Spielberg is a director that has tackled WWII plenty of times (1941, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), so Bridge of Spies should seem like a literal and figurative bridge to connect that transition. <br/><br/>In 1957 Brooklyn, a middle-aged painter Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance) is seen picking up a secret message and reads it before FBI agents burst into his apartment. He's arrested and prosecuted as a Soviet spy, sparking a media and public demand for his death. As per rule by the court, Rudolf is given a lawyer for his defense, which turns out to be James B. Donovan (played by Tom Hanks). The interesting thing is that James is an insurance lawyer with little experience in criminal law, but takes the case anyway to show that he's loyal to his profession.<br/><br/>James receive hate mail and accusations from people, his own children and even get's approached by the CIA, but stands on his ground that he's simply doing his job, helping the soviet spy. Though Rudolf is found guilty, James convinces the judge the give a jail sentence rather then death in case of needed collateral. That moment comes soon enough when CIA agent Francis Gary Powers is shot down and jailed by the Soviets. Both governments agree to an exchange, but not only does James actually have to go to East Germany to negotiate the deal, but when another American is jailed, he tries to get a two for one prisoner.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has a track record that's easy to rely to when defending his movies, yet I wasn't sure how I'd respond to the political-legal thriller that Bridge of Spies is. I'm proud to say that it s engaging in a most unexpected way. While the subject doesn't seem too remarkable, once you get to know both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance's (who I hope gets an awards nomination for his portrayal) character, you get a good idea of what both sides are hoping to achieve, both as a stance on what it means to be loyal to your country and doing what's right.<br/><br/>Aside from being a strong character piece, Bridge of Spies has a different look then you might expect from the more whimsical Spielberg. This fits right along his darker material as most of the movie is shown is greyer tones and surprisingly gets greyer once the story shifts to East Germany. With that said, the recreation of a Cold War Berlin looks great, especially when you see Tom Hanks riding the train to the other side where the wall shows what the difference is in one moment (which I won't give away).<br/><br/>I'll give this ten cold war posters out of ten. Bridge of Spies is guaranteed one of my favorite movies of 2015 and deserves at least one watch from not just cold war fanatics or even history fanatics, but from the mainstream crowd. Bridge of Spies will get least start one conversation going once the end credits roll."

","(Rating: ☆☆☆☆ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is highly recommended. <br/><br/>In brief: A riveting docudrama with Spielberg and Hanks at the top of their game<br/><br/>GRADE: A-<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies is a true Cold War tale about the espionage business, its unethical surveillance methods, and the ongoing political war games orchestrated between powerful nations. The film does shamelessly manipulate the emotions of its audience and, at times, lets the nostalgia wash over its subject matter depicting more innocent times than in actuality, but, in the capable hands of Steven Spielberg, this is superb filmmaking and one of the year's best. ￼ <br/><br/>The director's masterful handling of this complex story impresses in its concise storytelling and richly drawn characters. The screenplay by Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers builds its narrative convincingly and clearly lays its background exposition through its compelling dialog that not only establishes the characters and their motives but moves the action at a steady pace.<br/><br/>The year is 1957 when the United States and Russia were major enemies and spies worked undercover in search of oneupmanship. (Some things never change.) Back then, the world was splintering into different political factions, the military industrial complex was expanding, the threat of nuclear retaliation was a common practice, and the Berlin Wall became a reality. (A few do.)<br/><br/>￼Into this quagmire is yet another political incident involving a convicted Russian spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and an imprisoned American, Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), a pilot caught behind enemy lines. One man, a lawyer named James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is asked to act as a go-between and secretly negotiate their exchange. The film chronicles these events with authenticity and high drama.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent and the film is very well cast. Mr. Hanks has played the similarly upright decent common man role before but he continually impresses with his restraint and understatement of a man with a moral code that will not waiver. The actor never allows his character to overplay the righteousness and make Donovan more complicated by his subtle acting choices. Mr. Rylance has the more showier role as Abel and he brings a sly and layered portrait of a man who seems to enjoy being the pawn in this chess match. Other standouts include Alan Alda as one of Donavan's associates, Dakin Matthews as a very biased judge, Jon Curry and Michael Gaston as determined CIA agents, Will Rogers as as idealistic college student caught in the cloak-and-dagger web of intrigue, and Amy Ryan as Donovan's loving 50's wife, white pearl necklace included.<br/><br/>￼Production values are top notch. Janusz Kaminski's lovely muted photography, wonderful art direction designed by Adam Stockhausen, Kasia Walicka-Malmone's nuanced period costumes, and a subtle and haunting music score by the talented Thomas Newman all work to enhance this film. <br/><br/>But it is Mr. Spielberg's vision that resonates. His love of period Americana and the late fifties era create powerful vignettes (e.g.: spectators in a courtroom rise segueing into students reciting the Pledge of Allegiance leading to a school lecture on the effects of radiation poisoning to highly impressionable children, desperate people trying to escape over the Berlin Wall and, moments later, seeing typical children playing and climbing over wire fences, reporters scurrying over broken discarded flashbulbs from old fashioned cameras that litter a courthouse corridor, a frightening aerial escape as a plane spins out of control. Special kudos to Michael Kahn for his skillful editing as well.) Spielberg's willingness to establish period details of pop culture images defines the film brilliantly.<br/><br/>￼Bridge of Spies is a triumph and one of Mr. Spielberg's finest cinematic projects to date.<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

","It's always a bit dangerous to do historical drama, especially when things are within the memories of living people. This is the story of a prisoner exchange involving a Russian spy and U2 pilot Francis Gary Powers, whose spy plane was shot down by said Russians. Instead of a series of scenes of weapons fire and close calls, this is a very cerebral movie. Tom Hanks, in sort of an Atticus Finch mode, puts aside the furor of the nation and potential threats to his family, to follow the course of justice. He finds himself dealing with those who must cater to their nations positions in world politics. He also must act without sanction from his own country. Next to Hanks, Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel steals much of the movie. I'm sure some liberties were taken with facts along the way to make it more Hollywood, but this did nothing to diminish a real view of what the Cold War was like.

","One of the most prolific directors in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg, returns to the silver screen with his new period thriller ""Bridge of Spies"" starring two-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks. It features competent and solid filmmaking from its director, writers, and crafts team however, the film doesn't quite ignite passion and excitement from its standard storytelling. What really manages to standout is the impeccable and sensational performance of Emmy Award nominee Mark Rylance, who steals and owns every scene he's present.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of James Donovan (Hanks), an American lawyer that is recruited by the CIA during the Cold War to help rescue a pilot (Austin Stowell) detained in the Soviet Union. It all begins with the discovery of a probable spy on our own soil Rudolf Abel (Rylance), who tests Donovan's profession and safety net.<br/><br/>Academy Award winner Steven Spielberg brings many of his signature techniques to the spy tale. Tugging at the emotional heartstrings is an Olympic event at this juncture in his career, although not exactly hitting the mark the way it was intended. He frames his scenes with the same familiar authority that we've grown to love about Spielberg, and it definitely exceeds some of his lesser works like ""War Horse"" and ""The Terminal."" What the film truly lacks is a daring approach to its source material. Unfamiliar with the story and real life individuals, Spielberg, and the writers, Joel & Ethan Coen and Matt Charman, don't enter the grit and horror of two countries at a feud, literally on the brink of a real devastating war.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks brings his natural charisma and wit that we've loved about him for decades. His James Donovan is caring, engaging, and reminiscent of Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" His devotion to his family and the human condition is truly admirable, all clear and on display thanks to Hanks. As Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance is just a joy to behold, filling in the gaps of the film's shortcomings with charm and seasoned acting ability. It's a brilliant turn by a brilliant actor. It's one of the year's best supporting turns and a contender for the Oscar statue.<br/><br/>As James' wife Mary, Amy Ryan is relegated to just a few scenes but great nonetheless. Also brief are the works of Billy Magnussen and Alan Alda, who have good, solid one scenes to chew on.<br/><br/>Technically the film does present qualms. Janusz Kaminski's camera work is distracting in parts, shining bright lights through windows, and keeping a one note camera style all throughout its 135 minute run time. Thomas Newman's score isn't put to its best use, as it swells in inopportune moments, even managing to overwhelm a key and fantastic scene by Rylance. Michael Kahn cuts the film to a bloated expansive run time but manages to keep you involved enough to make it through. The film really shines in its Production Design by Adam Stockhausen and its Costume work by Kasia Walicka-Maimone.<br/><br/>""Bridge of Spies"" may find lovers in mass audiences. What it does well is ignite a curiosity and power to look at the history of its subject. Spielberg succeeds at introducing the world to James Donovan and what else he contributed to society, along with the supporting players at hand. We do wish that a better, more dynamic treatment had hit the screens. From an awards standpoint, it's going to appeal to a great deal. Perhaps a second viewing will open up more possibilities."

Tom Hanks is as always brilliant but watch out for Mark Rylance, who will leave you mesmerized with his very real performance of Rudolf Abel. Spielberg treats each frame with such care that you are just amazed at the authenticity and reality of it!

"imdb-45","6","5","10","29 November 2015"," Watchable, forgettable, Hollywood caramelized drama
","With all the power names in this film it has all the potential to be one of the greatest. And sadly, this watchable and reasonably entertaining film falls incredibly flat on many accounts if you're someone who uses your brain. When a film relies upon a character study and doesn't have lots of action, there needs to be a proper foundation to justify why characters act the way they do - and that clearly wasn't the case here. And the film's attempt to be clever outsmarts itself.<br/><br/>In summary, Hanks plays an insurance defense lawyer. He's recruited to be the face of a defense for an alleged Russian spy. The full details of the spy are unfortunately just left for the viewers imagination. There is a complete lack of developing the character other than ""a dispassionate old guy who likes to paint and look like a nice old man"" that Tom Hanks finds his heart bleeding after a meeting. There seems no question that the man is guilty. But Tom Hanks decides to go all the way to defend this man and beyond, in spite of being demonized in public as the defender of a traitor. Things get complicated when a US pilot is captured in Russia and an innocent American student as well in Germany.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent. There is some witty dialogue and some character study, unquestionably the unrivaled abilities of the Coen brothers. I found the first 1/3 of the film to be the most engaging, by far.<br/><br/>But as much as I admire their work, this film has Spielberg shmaltz draped all over it. And this ultimately is what makes this film (a) totally predictable; and (b) overly dramatic to the point of groaning multiple times. I found myself drawn completely outside of the movie when it was clear that these actors were just caricatures and very shallow, cardboard cutouts. The film was cardboard, mostly telling a noble series of events without knowing very much at all about all of the players. There is precious little to understand the true motives of any of the characters. And then there will be repeated one-liners for laughs (I thought the characters would wink at the screen) and moments where you could practically hear the director call for the camera to pan out and admire the actor, transfixed in his expression which makes a bold, iconic statement. (Yeah, I'm guessing it all went down just like that, a dramatic artistic moment.) <br/><br/>It's an entertaining film but make no mistake before you decided to go -- this has Hollywood draped all over what you would not expect from a Coen Brothers script. If you can shut down your brain and cheer for American patriotism, you'll very much enjoy the film. But if you're a thinking person who picks up on subtle cues, you may find this a very contrived and predictable work."
"kgprophet","6","5","10","23 October 2015"," A ""Lincoln""-like Examination of an Historical Event
","Although this is an exceptional story that enjoys examining the minutia of the period, the story arc as a whole does not really offer anything new. This leaves the performances as the primary appeal for the film. Tom Hanks has proved himself as the Average Joe of this generation. Then again, I never felt he was really in peril at any point in the film, perhaps because of his role in Captain Phillips or even Saving Private Ryan. In those films he was an Average Joe who nevertheless had the courage to face violence when necessary. One of my favourite films with Tom Hanks starring is Road To Perdition. Because that was also a period piece, sometimes I felt I was watching the mafia character he portrayed. The most standout performance is Mark Rylance playing Abel, the Soviet spy caught in the U.S. He certainly could get an Oscar nod for a supporting actor.<br/><br/>The story rolls along well enough, the longer length of the film comes from the fact that two stories are told. First is the capture and conviction of Abel in America. The second story follows the downing of Francis Powers and the setup of the exchange. I think some places to condense the exchange story could have brought the film back closer to a more appropriate two hours. Why? Well, I forgave Spielberg for the longer running time in Lincoln, because that film also had such a large cast to flesh out, and most of those characters were the real attraction in that film. Here, time is spent with Hanks visiting many East German characters that aren't particularly noteworthy, along with a few side trips that ultimately slow the momentum.<br/><br/>One thing that has become annoying is the one-note style of cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. As usual, every scene has a washed out backlight. Spielberg is known for incorporating longer single-take shots that are well choreographed, traveling along with the momentum of the scene. Oddly, he is too constrained with that style, where I was hoping some dynamic camera-work would provide a unique perspective of some interesting locations. I can't say I totally disagree with that decision, other than when a dynamic shot occurs, such as one showing the sentencing of Francis Powers, it seems it is the only time the films shows any real visual energy. The music hits the right beats, but again, does not try to stand out in any way.<br/><br/>I doubt general movie goers will embrace this movie. The subject matter will not really connect with anyone beyond those who enjoy period pieces like this. Hanks' character, unfortunately, has no Oscar moments to emote. The climax of the film also doesn't have any fireworks in the normal sense. I would recommend this film as a chance to get a glimpse of a piece of history you probably never knew before. But I would not really not call it one of the best films of the year, or a highlight of either Spielberg's or Hanks' career."
"leplatypus","4","3","5","31 December 2016"," A bridge too far (paytv)
","The 1st thing I noticed is that even Spielberg has turned into this blue/orange grading so that's the proof that things have really turn bad! But his Kaminsky knows at least to compose with lights and for some really brief moments, I thought I was back into the X-files! Next, this movie is clearly divided into 2 parts: the one in US about the trial of the soviet spy and the other in Berlin about the exchange. The 1st one is the best as in Munich, Amistad and Lincoln, Spielberg defends justice for all and punches the security pretext! However, the 2nd part is just awful, filled with candid sugar (Hanks is also responsible) and totally unbelievable! In addition, the movie is much too long because of a lot of useless scenes (U2 mission, the detention, ). At the end, Spielberg is really far of his best: he proves one more time that he is very fragile on political movies but at least, he did them and he has found a great old actor with the soviet spy."
"pelhamc","3","3","5","14 August 2016"," It's an Actual Bridge They Take Two Hours to Build To
","Tom Hanks. Dreamworks Entertainment. Need I say more? This picture was corny. <br/><br/>Bridge of Spies follows the true story of a Cold War era insurance lawyer called upon by his country to first defend and then later negotiate the exchange of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel, who looks and sounds weirdly like Sean Connery. Hanks (Mr. Mom, Sully) reprises his reluctant hero role from the Dan Brown series as Jim Donovan, an ordinary man thrust into extraordinary circumstances. It had that True Lies if-they-only-knew element to it. <br/><br/>The KGB character was played sympathetically, replete with his own catch phrase (was that really necessary?). The closest thing this film has to an antagonist is Donovan's CIA handler. He's ""mean,"" because he doesn't abuse the trust placed in him the way Donovan does, changing mission prerogatives on a personal whim because believes he knows better. The object is an American student being held for sedition by the East Germans. Hanks wants to take him back. The Americans don't value him. So, Hanks hijacks his own hostage swap to make the kid part of the deal. Patriotism is one of the themes, along with loyalty and reputation. <br/><br/>This film could have used more spycraft and intrigue. They could have done a lot more with the story. Suspense and courtroom drama were missing. The plot focuses on the character's personal life, without fleshing it out. Amy Ryan (Gone Baby Gone, Birdman) shines as the wife, but it's a bit part. Donovan's family bares the brunt of public scorn for his defense of an infamous foreign operative. Donovan seems to be stating nonverbally that they'll get over it, it's for the greater good, without bothering to even say as much, against the backdrop of 20th Century nuclear fear. He's sacrificing in strong silence. Or whatever.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies wants to be a ""message movie"" but the didactic is fuzzy, at best. In defense of Abel, Hanks cites the US Constitution. This raises the question as to how the Constitution applies to the case at hand? I must have missed the part dealing with the rights of foreign nationals to spy on America. Donovan avoids the question by simply circulating back to the Constitution itself. It is because it is. Logic is not met with logic. Donovan is not a fighter for critical thinking. <br/><br/>Someone recently called Matt Damon the ""Jimmy Stewart of the generation."" I would nominate Tom Hanks for that dubious honor. Methinks Mr. Spielberg should get with the times. The classic formula is less relevant in today's marketplace of media and devoid of creativity. It's cheese with a side of schmaltz."
"petra_ste","7","3","5","5 April 2016"," Solid Spielberg
","This Cold War thriller confirms two things about director Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>First: he is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of cinema. It's amazing how he makes every sequence visually interesting, fluid and well-paced, from dialogue scenes (which represent the bulk of Bridge of Spies) to action set-pieces (here just a brief plane crash). He gets strong performances from his actors, here Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, the latter in an Award-winning turn as a mild-mannered Soviet spy. The director's efficiency on set is legendary: Bridge of Spies looks great in spite of a slim (for Hollywood standards!) forty millions budget. Spielberg was just born to narrate stories...<br/><br/>... and that's why his films, even the few I don't particularly like, as a general rule still have *something* worth recommending.<br/><br/>Second: Spielberg's movies have diabetes. Sugar is sprinkled everywhere, peaking with sappy endings. Bridge of Spies would be greatly improved by radically altering or excising the last ten minutes... much like War of the Worlds, AI, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Minority Report. Looking back, it's surprising Spielberg delivered in Raiders of the Lost Ark one of the most memorably ironic epilogues ever.<br/><br/>... and that's why I prefer Spielberg's more lighthearted films, like Jaws or Jurassic Park; in serious movies his fluffy endings feel more grating and inappropriate.<br/><br/>Overall, Bridge of Spies is solid. The Coen brothers co-wrote the script, their touch shining through in several absurdist, humorous moments.<br/><br/>7,5/10"
"nathanaward","5","3","5","22 March 2016"," A Stately Treatment
","I put off seeing this film since I knew the true story too well and expected to be annoyed by various changes made necessary to get the whole spy saga into two hours. <br/><br/>The movie, for instance, begins with Col. Abel's arrest, thus skipping over what people like me go to a spy movie for--tense scenes of espionage and spy craft. The character of Abel is made to be world weary, but without evidence of his cleverness as a spy it's less interesting as a Cold War tale.<br/><br/>I learned a lot about the Colonel writing a NY Times story about his life posing in Brooklyn as an artist, and then I requested his interrogation transcripts from the FBI, which they sent me in several boxes running to 3,000 pages. None of this was available to previous authors. <br/><br/>If fans of the movie would like further background on Col. Abel's double life in America, I have written a Kindle ebook, THE AMATEUR: The Cold War Life of Rudolf Abel, Artist & KGB Spy."
"rusoviet","5","3","5","13 March 2016"," It reminded me of a 'Hallmark Classic' then again most of....
","...Spielberg's films do.<br/><br/>Even allowing for the time (1957/62) difference (2014), the scenes reminded me of a 'stage set' - faux walls, sky etc.. In addition the award to Rylance wasn't warranted. His script was nearly a monotone and always let Spielberg make a bolshevik/red 'human'.<br/><br/>The historic accuracy re. the second 'captive' 'Pryor', was false - another 'trick' by Spielberg to 'add' some human/family hook.<br/><br/>A far better script would have added after successfully negotiating the exchange for Francis Gary Powers, Donovan's negotiated the freedom of initially 1,103 but expanded to 9,703 Cuban anti-Castro men women and children.<br/><br/>With Spielberg, as with all Hollywood leftists, there is always the kid glove treatment of the horror of the reds, even allowing for the callous machine gunning of the fleeing East Germans over the wall. In Schindler's List, Spielberg made sure he got his anti-gun message in the final scene when the Jews are surrounded by the German SS guards and tell them (the Germans) to go. In the movie no one has firearms in reality the Jews did and had them pointed at the Germans."
"ElMaruecan82","9","3","5","17 February 2016"," The Bridge over the Torn Curtain...
","In the midst of the Cold War paranoia, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks) a lawyer specialized in insurance settlement is assigned to defend KGB spy Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance in a performance that will deserve a few words. This is less a trial than a tactic to prevent the Soviet Union to politically exploit Abel's arrest: Abel's case must show the world that USA treated him democratically. But that's only a cover, what Donovan ignores. Like so many characters who populated Hanks' filmography, Donovan is a decent man and much more, a professional. He takes his job seriously and when he discovers that much of the evidence was found without search warrants, he even wants to call a vice of form.<br/><br/>So, what we get is a highly respected lawyer, with an Irish name, a respectable family, and a 'Red' who might have pulled a Rozenberg in his actions and be the cause of New York's imminent nuking, in the minds of millions of Americans or kids, constantly brainwashed by these Nuclear mushroom images (you know these 'duck and cover' programs). Naturally, Abel's public image inevitably spills over Donovan who worries everyone from his family to his colleagues, from the prosecutors to the judge, and his zeal doesn't help. That, alone, would have been the premise of a terrific movie, the contradiction of a man who does his job, out of decency and patriotism and is almost treated like a traitor. To think that there were supposed to counter-attack the Russian propaganda is one of these film's many subtle delights and it doesn't come as a surprise, that within this whole paranoid craze, you have these two men who seem to speak the same language.<br/><br/>It is not a friendship in the cinematic sense of the word, but it's a story of respect between two men who know the context they live in, their duty, their limitations, but still, find a 'bridge' of communication, through such simple matters as honor, principles and humanity. Rylance's performance looks like a one-note one, but don't get mislead, this is a man who was trained not to show any emotions, to keep a low-profile, so it's only through his eye-language, and a few words, that you can get to the core of his feelings. He says he's not afraid of the electric chair, but his stoicism is later counterbalanced by the 'although it wouldn't be my first choice'. This is not some robotic spy, this is a human being who's also caught in the requirements of his job. And his attitude, if not the public's, earns him Donovan's everlasting sympathy.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, as usual, doesn't need to speak loudly his emotions, we can see that from the way he exchanges looks with Rylance, and after Abel's sentence, he pleads to Supreme Court arguing that there's no way, the USA should treat dishonorably a man who's only following a fighter's code the same way that America wished his men would follow the Constitution. There has to be a reciprocity of actions and treatments, not just in the weapon department. And what could have been a terrific climactic speech is only the precursor of the second act of the movie. Of course, there was no way, Abel would be found innocent, he wasn't anyway, so the film had to move to higher levels, and it does.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Donovan worked in insurance, this is a man who made a living out of predicting odds, and in 1957, it didn't take the highest insurance exec to guess one American spy might be arrested once, and Abel could be used as a bargaining chip. His eloquence convinces the judge and Abel escapes from the Rozenberg treatment, and of course, it pays off, as a spy pilot, Gary Michael Powers, is shut down while traveling above the Soviet territory on U-21 plane. Donovan is then entrusted to negotiate the exchange of prisoners, which would've been a formality if it wasn't for a little twist: the arrest of an American student in Berlin while attempting to get his girlfriend to the West Side. When Donovan learns about this arrest, he can't imagine going back to America with only one person. The film turns into a very interesting chess game where Donovan must hit two birds with one stone, he must convince the Soviet and the East-German representatives, understand their motives, express his, and make the timing his ally, rather than an obstacle. It's a heart-pounding race against the clock.<br/><br/>Although Steven Spielberg isn't renowned for being the most subtle director when it comes to emotions, his recent ""Lincoln"" was a signal that the tone of his movies abandoned their usual sentimentalism to some more mature material. Lincoln was less the noble-hearted hero than a positively Machiavellian tactician, and this is what Donovan is. And he plays the diplomatic game perfectly, learning how to be mild-mannered or firmly resolved, in the middle of a Cold War that wasn't just symbolically cold. This leads to a wonderful climax, whose first element of surprise is to reveal that the film's title wasn't just a metaphor.<br/><br/>Now, I read many comments accusing the film of being another propaganda movie. I would say it's more of Capra-like movie in its spirit. Besides, wasn't Abel the most fascinating character of the movie, and a hero to some extent? Weren't the Americans as eager to hang Abel as a Western mob to lynch a cattle thief, and didn't one of the CIA guys even care of the American student? In fact, ""Bridge of Spies"" is beyond these considerations, it is less a thriller with two antagonistic sides, than a great character study with two similar men united by their patriotism and their sense of duty. And no matter how different the lifestyles are, two systems making such men possible can't be that bad."

I really enjoyed this film because of that aspect; that it really happened. It was such an eye opening film to a true story I never really knew about it. Hanks was an extremely powerful and convincing lawyer and it was very interesting to see how his mind worked when it came to dealing with the character Rudolf Abel, played by Mark Rylance.

"scottshak_111","8","3","5","19 October 2015"," An exquisite political biopic!
","Steven Spielberg comes up with a biography of a guy caught up in the jaws of political torture as he endeavours to negotiate the rescuing of two people in a cold war struck world. However, the movie isn't limited to that. There are melodramatic bits strewn all across in the gravy of one helluva screenplay which is brilliantly topped by a stellar cast.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies is an exceptional movie that has been helmed slowly, delicately and powerfully. There was a war going on, a colder one: a constant mental war of superiority between the two superpowers on the globe. In a twisted world like that, Rudolf Abel, a Soviet spy ends up becoming a victim to the US-Russia distress claws. To save his ass, a lawyer by profession, James B. Donovan, played marvellously by Tom Hanks, is hired with hopes of giving a fair trial yet a subdued one to cover up the hoopla. What ignites as an unfair trial gradually tangles him up further into an even bigger commotion wherein CIA approaches Donovan to make a barter of Abel for a fellow American spy pilot caught in Russia.<br/><br/>Scaling back a bit further, the thing that might strike you as a pleasant surprise is its beginning. We witness an old guy painting himself with the aid of a mirror. His acts are quite mundane, natural and harmless. Spielberg spends enough time on the character for us to relate to him, a normal guy who loves to paint, who is calm and couldn't possibly mean trouble. On the contrary, we see a troupe of psyched CIA crowd bent on catching him. They bag him at an odd hour and bring chaos to his house, breaking all hell lose, without a search warrant. That's where Donovan comes in with his propositions. But unfortunately chaos swallows him up. It becomes James v/s America, as every guy starts hating him for fighting a case for the Russian spy.<br/><br/>What was also great to watch was how people change their perspective. At one point it was manifested how the world leered at James when he was defending Abel, but then at a later stage when he saves two Americans, all that hatred ends up metamorphosing into sheer love. <br/><br/>Mark Rylance is outstanding as Rudolf Abel. At times his expressionless face belies his indifference towards the political muck he ends up in. Even when he is aware of an imminent danger, serenity rarely leaves him. He carries his knack for painting and wears it even at direst moments. For example, he calmly answers, ""Would it help?"" when asked ""Are you not worried?"" One of the most brilliant scenes in the movie is when Abel compares Donovan to 'The Standing Man' in his story. The music grows suddenly and imparts extra gravity to the bit.<br/><br/>It is always a delight to watch Tom Hanks act. His face carries the right kind of emotions. Always lost in thought, he makes Bridge of Spies a dramatic hoot. There are top-notch dramatic frames that Spielberg slides in for emphasis. Like the one where Donovan's son gets influenced by a war video, and fills up his tub with water for safety. It is a sad reflection of how war changes everything. Also, at one point Donovan had the misfortune of witnessing people being fired at whilst trying to sneak through the border. At a later stage, James sees children leaping over fences, which reminds him of the same troubled scene which then again throws him into the pits of gloom.<br/><br/>What is a tad sad is how long the movie runs. The movie could have survived some cuts. There are frames that we could have lived without. However, it is comprehensible and justified to show crucial bits of the horror and mental torture Donovan had to go through in order to get the job done. When he returns home in the end, he dozes off at once owing to exhaustion whilst in the backdrop his family gets to know his greatness. Quite endearing to watch actually!<br/><br/>A highly recommended movie."

The first 30 minutes or so seemed pointless. They make good use of period cars but that was about it. Anticipated Schindler's List, but got 1941, not great.

Where Bridge of Spies might rank among the bearded hat wearing gurus career however can only be decided by time but there's little doubt this cold war thriller is an absolute treat of cinematic produce.<br/><br/>Tense, taut and most tellingly, meticulously shot and edited, Spies is quite possibly Spielberg's finest film in a decade.<br/><br/>Working with his usual and trusted production crew including D.O.P Janusz Kaminski and editor Michael Kahn (sadly John Williams doesn't score Spies, perhaps he was busy in a galaxy far far away?), Spies really does see Spielberg achieve fantastic overall results, especially from his team up with writers Joel and Ethan Coen who were bought in to touch up Matt Charman's original script.<br/><br/>While it's not got the heart of Spielberg's most revered films like E.T, Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan or the pure spectacle of ventures like Jaws or Minority Report, it's still clear Spielberg had a blast creating this thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat almost entirely through its scripting and construction. Spies in many ways feels cut from the same cloth as Spielberg's Munich, just much more tightly focused.<br/><br/>In recent times Spielberg may've achieved good if not stunning outcomes in tales like Lincoln and War Horse but Spies is just a purely unbridled joy led by yet another great Spielberg directed performance of Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>Himself experiencing good not incredible films of recent times, Spies allows Hanks to once more display the everyman American that's driven his career and his hardworking lawyer that really just wants a good night's sleep, James B. Donovan, will here go down as one of his all times best.<br/><br/>His the star of the ensemble, Spielberg allowing him a showing in almost every scene and Hanks nails it. Delivering just like the film around him does, seemingly with the ease of the ticking of a clocks second hand.<br/><br/>Put simply, a near faultless production that lacks ever so slightly some true emotional punches or set pieces that would've made it a 5 star masterpiece, Bridge of Spies is yet again further reminder to all as to why Spielberg is the true movie making king and this is a film that will likely see him and his crew seriously contend at the next Oscar ceremony.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies is without question a definite much watch for all cinema lovers.<br/><br/>4 ½ American breakfast's out of 5"
"vsks","9","4","8","26 October 2015"," Riveting Story, Superb Cast, Solid Filmmaking on All Counts
","Stephen Spielberg's riveting new film portrays the real-life events and personalities that led to a historic U.S.-Soviet-East German prisoner exchange in the frozen depths of the Cold War. In 1962, in a divided Berlin, an accused Soviet spy is to be traded for two Americans, if all goes well. An off-the-books U.S. negotiator has led the Soviets and the East Germans separately to the brink of agreeing the exchange, but hostilities are strong, motives are complex, and success is far from guaranteed. Based on the 2010 Giles Whittell book of the same name, the story centers around the intertwined fates of William Fisher, born Rudolf Abel, a British-born KGB agent whom the FBI arrested in New York; Francis Gary Powers, U.S. pilot of a super-secret U-2 spy plane shot down while flying over Russia; and Frederic Pryor, an American graduate student who finds himself on the wrong side of the new Berlin Wall and in the hands of the Stasi, East Germany's notorious secret police. Spielberg tells these men's stories, but centers on the role of U.S. insurance attorney James Donovan in the negotiations. Donovan's role initially is to defend Abel in his trial on espionage charges. He takes on this thankless task, even though everyone in the country, including the judge in the case, believes Abel is guilty. However, American legal processes need to be followed, if only to show the world that every prisoner receives a fair trial (an ironic punctiliousness half a century later). Inevitably, Abel is convicted, but at least Donovan persuades the judge not to invoke the death penalty. It's a controversial choice for Donovan to decide to appeal the verdict, and one that puts himself—and perhaps his family and career—in some danger. When Powers's plane is shot down, the possibility of a prisoner swap is immediately seized upon by the CIA. They want Powers back. He knows too much. Donovan is asked to negotiate an Abel-Powers trade, unofficially. What he encounters on all sides in Berlin is stubborn resistance salted with suffocating paranoia. He also hears about the unlucky American student and insists he be part of the deal, which the CIA rejects. They're not interested. The acting is terrific, especially Tom Hanks as Donovan and Mark Rylance as Abel. In smaller roles, the CIA agents and Soviet and East German negotiators are suitably opaque and blustering. Amy Ryan, Donovan's wife, is always excellent. They have the benefit of working from a strong script by Matt Charman, Ethan Coen, and Joel Coen. I particularly liked how, whenever Donovan asks Abel if he is worried about some particular outcome, Abel responds, ""Would it help?"" The look of the film is exactly right—cold, forbidding—and the Glienicke Bridge, site of the hoped-for exchange is a desolate place. Spielberg's handling of Donovan as ""the standing man,"" underscoring a metaphor introduced by Abel, works. If only he'd resisted a few message-heavy Hollywood touches (East Germans versus U.S. children scrambling over a wall, for example), it would have been perfect."

Steven Spielberg directs this cold war story about a Soviet spy captured on American soil, Mark, who is arrested and asked to move into one of our fine prison establishments, or maybe even be executed for treason. Tom plays a New York lawyer that is convinced by the C.I.A. to represent Mark-they think they should show the world that even a dirty Soviet spy deserves a good defense. Alan plays Tom's boss and agrees with the C.I.A. and tells Tom to go ahead and take the job. Around this same time, an American pilot, Francis Gary Powers, is shot down over Soviet air space, while taking reconnaissance pictures from a U2 spy plane at 70,000 feet. The C.I.A. wants Tom to negotiate a prisoner exchange with Mark for the pilot. Since Tom has to go to Germany for the talks, and it is as the wall is being built in Berlin so it is dangerous, Tom tells his wife, Amy, that he is going on a fishing trip-he doesn't want her to worry. The exchange of prisoners is to take place on a bridge between East Berlin and West Berlin, so that is where the title of the movie, Bridge of Spies, comes from. It is a good story-what else do you expect from a Steven Spielberg movie?-but light on action. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing was fine-but it would be a good rental."

","I've been a huge fan of Spielberg for ages. Jaws, Close Encounters, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, Minority Report etc. But the last few films haven't really done much for me. Crystal Skull really killed my enthusiasm for his films, and with the exception of Tintin, I haven't seen anything since that matches his best. But Bridge of Spies is a true return to form. Unlike Lincoln, which I thought was dull Oscar bait, Spies is a taut, exciting cold war thriller. John Williams provides another great score, the cinematography is excellent, and the film really captures the cold war paranoia and fear of those turbulent times. Parallels can be made between this film and the Bush administration, and at the same time not get bogged down in politics (Unlike the dry Amistad). This is a film that reminds people that the most exciting words on a movie poster are ""A Film by Steven Spielberg""."

","Based on the 1960 U-2 incident & set during the Cold War, 'Bridge of Spies' is a Brilliant true-story, told Brilliantly. Director Steven Spielberg delivers his finest film in years, while Tom Hanks & Mark Rylance deliver solid performances. <br/><br/>'Bridge of Spies' Synopsis: An American lawyer is recruited by the CIA during the Cold War to help rescue a pilot detained in the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>'Bridge of Spies' tells the story of a man, who won, despite the violence & political pressure around him. James B. Donovan's fight to get back the ones who belong home & also send the one to his place, without ever disgracing anyone, is engrossing. Its such a powerful, riveting true-story, that I was left amazed. <br/><br/>Matt Charman, Ethan Coen & Joel Coen's Screenplay is excellent. It never slows down & the way this story progresses, is awe-inspiring. The Writing remains super-strong at all times! Spielberg's Direction is flawless. The Master Filmmaker has handled this historical dramatic thriller, without one single fault. Janusz Kamiński's Cinematography is picture-perfect. Michael Kahn's Editing is razor-crisp. Thomas Newman's Score is superb (Although its strange not to hear John Williams's musical genius here, since he's a Spielberg regular). Art & Costume Design are efficient.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan, is commanding, as ever. The Screen Legend ignites the proceedings, with magnetic energy. Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel, is the scene-stealer. He enacts the spy in question, magnificently. And the on-screen chemistry between Hanks & Rylance, is enviable. Amy Ryan as Mary McKenna Donovan, does well. Alan Alda as Thomas Watters, is impeccable, as always. Austin Stowell as Francis Gary Powers, leaves a mark. Others lend perfect support.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Bridge of Spies' is Cinema At Its Best! Don't Miss It!"

","Pretty much historically accurate movie about a lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) who is hired to defend captured KGB agent Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) in a court trial and ends up organizing an exchange for two captured Americas Powers and Pryor in exchange for Abel. (Bad plot description, sorry).
This is a great and very well-done movie. Spielberg does another awesome job with this movie. It has great themes and is thought-provoking at times. It has a great message about standing up for what is right, even if/when everyone else hates you for doing it.
This is Tom Hanks best role (that I've seen so far, anyway). He does a fantastic job as Donovan and literally embodies in every sense who the real Donovan was. Everyone does an awesome job, really. Their acting is very believable.
Definitely watch this!"

"nyutkamarko","4","2","3","25 December 2018"," Not historically accurate
","No mention of Donovan being a spy himself. Half of the movie we listen lots of speeches about democracy values and justice as an explanation of Abel's great luck of staying alive. Meanwhile, if you compare the final sentences - 30 years for Abel and 10 for Powers - you'd be a bit confused. If you ever notice that of course, because Soviet court scene is shown quite brief, loud and weird. I haven't even heard what judge had said there first time I watched the scene.
They switched the way how Abel and Powers were treated as prisoners (Abel wrote that he was hit once, while Powers mentioned he stayed in a comfy cell and was treated well)
East Germany was shown as it was straight after Berlin surrender in 1945 (gloomy, with tanks, army, dirt, 100% bombed buildings + blue colour filter). It looked much better in 60s, just google it. Look at the pictures of Elvis visit for example. Soviets put loads of money there (as well as USA - to West Germany) to keep up with the race, it was their ""shopfront"" back then. And of course it could not be bloody snowing there in summer!
Abel was considered a hero after the exchange and officially was praised as a great spy. (They lied about it in the final afterstory credits)<br/><br/>I think if you take real events as a base for your movie, it's not fair to twist all the details like this. Even if you're dying to show countries and events stereotypically, please check the sources first, your movie only wins after that."
"Evan_Wheatley","9","2","3","11 April 2017"," ""Bridge of Spies"" breathes new life into historical films
","When the director of ""Jaws,"" the star of ""Forrest Gump"" and the writers of ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" come together to make a film, you know you're in for a treat.<br/><br/>""Bridge of Spies"" is set in 1957 during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is arrested by the FBI and charged with being a Soviet spy. Insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is asked by his partners to defend Abel in the impending trial. <br/><br/>Donovan is ridiculed and scorned by his fellow Americans for representing and defending Abel, as many of them would rather see him hanging from a rope. However, Donovan's success in keeping Abel away from the death penalty proves vital in negotiating with the Soviets after they capture an American spy. <br/><br/>Whenever I watch Tom Hanks, seldom do I see Tom Hanks. Whether it's Forrest Gump, Captain John H. Miller or Woody from ""Toy Story,"" Hanks consistently excels at becoming the characters he portrays, and he delivers a dynamic performance as James Donovan. The character is decent and kind, but firm in upholding the law and his personal values. <br/><br/>Mark Rylance's portrayal of Rudolf Abel is Oscar-worthy. Abel is an awkward, mild-mannered and unusually calm elderly man, the last person you would suspect as a Soviet spy. In the face of potential execution following a guilty verdict, Abel remains cool and collected. Blown away by his lack of alarm or concern, Donovan questions, ""Are you not worried?"" to which Abel responds, ""Would it help?"" <br/><br/>Ethan and Joel Coen's script dishes out the perfect comedic, dramatic and thrilling elements that make ""Bridge of Spies"" great. Its dialogue drives the story, and while this may turn off certain audiences, I found it enthralling. Fundamental themes of integrity, perseverance and standing up for what's right are broadcast clearly and effectively through the actions and words of the story's protagonists. <br/><br/>Like most of his films, Steven Spielberg's touch is evident from the first shot. There are several scenes throughout the film in which two or more people are simply exchanging dialogue in a room. While on paper this may come across as dull, Spielberg keeps you engaged by positioning his characters in different places during a scene. Through this he is able to portray a variety of shot types and angles and simulate the effect of cuts that aren't actually there.<br/><br/>Spielberg's narrative direction is as captivating as his visual storytelling. ""Bridge of Spies"" is based on a true story, and very little is altered or fabricated for the sake of entertainment. Aside from a few minor plot points and inconsistencies of the spies' time in captivity, Spielberg and the Coen brothers stay true to the intriguing story of how an insurance lawyer from Brooklyn saved the lives of two Americans and a Soviet spy.<br/><br/>Novelty in today's cinema is a hallowed treasure. Unique scripts are replaced with unnecessary sequels and reboots, and dialogue-driven stories dwell in the shadow of the next Marvel blockbuster. Despite Hollywood's ever-growing lack of originality, directors like Spielberg continually restore my faith in filmmaking. ""Bridge of Spies"" breathes new life into historical thrillers, and is a must-see for lovers of the genre."

What will make me wonder for a while is how on earth did Mark Rylance win an Oscar as an actor in supporting role for this particular movie, and Tom Hanks was not even nominated? Yet again, to date I don't understand how Emily Blunt was not nominated as a best actress for The Girl on the Train... I will never understand how the Globes and Oscars committee work to give the credits. Bridge of Spies was a bit slow at the beginning but it elevated to an action packed, emotional second half bringing it to a satisfactory truthful ending.

"leonblackwood","5","2","3","30 August 2016"," Pretty boring in places! 5/10
","Review: It's not very often that I can say a bad word about a Spielberg/Hanks collaboration but in this case, I have to say that I found this movie pretty boring. Although the subject matter was deep and emotional, I found the pace of the film, extremely slow and it just seemed to be going round in circles most of the time. Tom Hanks (James B. Donovan) and Mark Rylance (Rudolf Abel) played there roles extremely well and they made the movie slightly watchable but I still struggled to keep my eyes open, through the negotiating scenes between Hanks, the Germans and the Russians. On the plus side, the whole look and feel of the film is top class and the period was filmed well by one of the best directors of all time but after the disappointing movie, War Horse, I was expecting more from this movie. The whole ""Russian Spy"" concept wasn't really shocking, even though it was based on true events, and the outcome of Donovan's actions was more interesting than the film. The fact that Abel was actually a spy, seemed to be overlooked and you don't get to see what problems his actions had caused in the past. Anyway, although the movie looked top class, I didn't really find it that entertaining and I won't be rushing to watch the movie again. Average! <br/><br/>Round-Up: Steven Spielberg, 69, is one of those directors that people will flock to the cinemas to watch his movies, and when he teams up with Hanks, in movies like the Terminal, Saving Private Ryan and Catch Me If You Can, the collaboration usually works. To date, Spielbergs new movie, the BFG, has made $153million but it cost $140million to make so it has just about broken even. Its been a long time since this brilliant director has pulled off anything amazing but he will always be remembered for movies like Jaws, Close Encounters, the Indiana franchise, E.T., the Colour Purple, Jurassic Park etc. With another Indiana Jones and West Side Story, rumoured to be his next projects, I still find it quite surprising that he has only won 3 Oscars, 2 for Schindler's List and one for Saving Private Ryan but I'm sure he will get a lifetime achievement award for his contribution to cinema. His vision and amazing storytelling skills are truly unique but this film definitely wasn't one of his best. Tom Hanks has also gone a bit downhill lately but that is mostly due to the movies that he has chosen, and not his superb acting skills. Anyway, although I found this movie pretty boring, I'm sure that there is a market for this subject matter and it must have touched many hearts. <br/><br/>Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $165million <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/history/thrillers, starring Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Domenick Lombardozzi, Brian Hutchison, Alan Alda and Amy Ryan. 5/10"
"rjwilton","4","2","3","26 August 2016"," Extraordinary true story becomes ordinary
","Steven Spielberg is getting awfully stately. He's always been family-friendly, but there used to be an energy, a bit of sass about him. Now the challenge to authority is no more than Tom Hanks being a bit smarter than the Government men, and the whole thing is played at an unchanging ceremonial pace at least as reverential as Lincoln.<br/><br/>This is Cold War thriller become costume drama. Despite the genuinely tense storyline, and some normally bullet-proof anxiety scenes (crossing the wall! waiting on the bridge!), not once does the pulse get above what you'd get from watching the documentary.<br/><br/>It's an extraordinary true story with the extraordinary taken out. And the interesting: there's some potentially really thoughtful stuff about Hank's relationship with Rylance, and where patriotism might be when American interests clash with American values, and what he's inflicting on his family by his stubbornness - but none of it comes to anything.

","It's 1957 Brooklyn. Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is arrested for being a Soviet spy. Insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is pushed to defend him. Despite popular pressure, Donovan fights to prevent Abel's execution. When U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers is shoot down over the Soviet Union, CIA director Allen Dulles recruits Donovan to test out the prisoner exchange idea as a private citizen. American student Frederic Pryor gets imprisoned on the wrong side of the Berlin wall. Donovan decides to hold out for both Americans' release.<br/><br/>Director Steven Spielberg delivers a well-made movie. However, there is a lack of tension for most of the movie. Spielberg needs to ramp up the danger to Donovan. He needs to gin up more danger to his job and to his family. The shooting into his house is fine. I expected a scene of his wife getting confronted. Having said that, other scenes seem too heavy-handed especially the last few scenes back home. Spielberg is also putting in too much of a glare which gives the movie a dreamy quality. Instead, it needs a darker, harsher, and scarier tone. Tom Hanks is a bit too calm. He needs to be scared in more times. The time he's confronted by the street youths in East Berlin is a prime example. It needs to be shocking and it needs to come out of nowhere. Instead, it's laid out before it happens and it's a source of comedy afterward. The tension is never too high. It could have been a darker, scarier scene."
"nclka1990","8","2","3","4 February 2016"," Solid Cold War Suspense
","Steven Spielberg does not make bad films. Okay, admitted there might be one or two exceptions (I'm looking at you Crystal Skull!). However, he has not made a really good film since Munich in 2005. With Bridge of Spies he returns to a well-known arena for him with a story centred around the defense trial of a Soviet spy caught in Cold War America and the subsequent prisoner exchange with the Soviet Union and German Democratic Republic. Teaming up with the Coen Brothers as the film's writers, masterful composer Thomas Newman and regular cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg has probably made his best film in 10 years!<br/><br/>The story is divided in two: the first half centred around the trial of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and the second half focusing on the proposed prisoner exchange with the USSR and GDR. The first half is small-scale courtroom drama where we get to see the political idealism and propaganda originally behind the American defense of the most hated man on US soil. The courtroom scenes and portrayal of the actual trial might be the film's weakest asset feeling rushed and unimportant. The real drama in this first part lies in the chemistry and increasing relation between Rudolf Abel and Tom Hanks' lawyer James B. Donovan and the study of the personal consequences of this for Donovan's private life. <br/><br/>Especially the chemistry between Tom Hanks and the impeccable Mark Rylance as Abel is a joy to behold. Highly acclaimed stage actor Rylance's performance is one of the best supporting roles I have seen in years. He underacts Abel perfectly and he becomes the image of the hopelessness that were everywhere in these times. Donovan keeps asking Abel if he never worries and before Rylance can say 'Would it help?' we already know that this is Abel's view on it; he is way past that point. Hanks also delivers his best performance in years as the idealistic yet vulnerable Donovan and especially in the scenes with his family he shows that he is one of the best to portray the ordinary man. <br/><br/>Roughly half way through the film, though, we leave the small-scale setting of the courtrooms, the prison cells and the living room as Donovan is sent on a secret mission to East Berlin to negotiate the exchange of Abel for by-the-soviets-captured American soldier Francis Gary Powers. The story of Powers prior to his capture feels weirdly out of place, but as the story unfolds this actually makes sense. In this exchange drama (that suddenly includes an American student held by GDR too btw) the persons captured does not matter in the bigger picture. It is all about showing the public that you do not leave people behind - the return of Powers is to become the symbol of the American power in the cold war! The most interesting asset of the film's second part is its portrayal of the very dawn of a physically divided Berlin. This is the dawn of the Wall, the dawn of 'us' and 'them'! Spielberg portrays the small-scale horrors and the grand scale political drama of this situation with such respect that it is close to becoming predictable.<br/><br/>What ultimately saves the day for Spielberg (apart from tremendous performances from Hanks and Rylance) is sheer sense and amount of quality. The cinematography of Kaminski is grand when it needs to be and hauntingly gruesome in its simplicity when showing the horrors of Eastern Berlin. (Here, a certain train ride is in particular touching!). The score from Thomas Newman is classic and without surprises but as with the rest of the machinery it is simply just of the highest quality and fits perfectly in every scene. Finally, the script by Ethan and Joel Coen balances perfectly between the little drama, the grand thriller and some refreshing comedic scenes and pieces of dialogue. <br/><br/>The film is a showpiece of how you construct a well-working film. It lacks the final surprise or courage to become a masterpiece like Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan, but if everything in Hollywood were to collapse this film stands as an example of why Spielberg will always get back up and be the standing man."
"drqshadow-reviews","7","2","3","1 February 2016"," Tense, Fresh, Even-Handed Perspective on Cold War Negotiations
","Hanks and Spielberg tackle a Cold War spy-exchange against the backdrop of a freshly-constructed Berlin Wall. As one might expect from these old masters, it's expertly-crafted and loaded with gravitas; a warm, motivated take on a surprisingly under-explored chapter of recent history. It does a great job of delicately re-evaluating popular sentiment and the bullish nature of post-war international relations, too, painting heroes and victims on both sides of the dispute. The plot is very linear, though, moving on a predictable set of rails from start to finish, and that can make it feel preachy when a few of the more heavy-handed themes briefly overstay their welcome. A foundationally-strong, workmanlike offering, it's 50% desperately-uphill legal drama and 50% high stakes poker with a set of captive American souls as the ante."

As presume, the direction is spectacular, Steven Spielberg once again proves to be one of the best. With the help of Janusz Kaminski, movie cinematographer, they manage capture the minutiae and subtleties in each scene, making the picture having an amazing aesthetic, besides the setting and scenery being very well-constructed and provide a higher truthfulness to the movie. Considering the portrayed event and troubled time that happened, the film could have brought a higher tension, the lack is mostly felt around Tom Hanks' character, James B. Donovan, as he's doing something so outrageous in the Americans' perspective. The hostility is there,it's perceptible but it's not high as it might be. A aspect which could help fulfill this need is the soundtrack, which didn't show up as expected, instead was restrained and discreet. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks is the highlight among the cast, he delivers a great performance. The character is fantastic, his power of rhetoric and persuasion are astonishing as a result his speeches are just jaw-dropping. Another good acting was Mark Rylance being Rudolf Abel.

Mark Rylance gives a quiet, understated performance as the spy.

Although some of the scenes in East Berlin verge slightly on absurd, a hint of the Coen brothers influence as screenwriters for the film.<br/><br/>Amy Ryan is largely wasted as Donovan's wife while the early scenes detailing Abels court case feel a bit short and underdeveloped.

But ultimately movie new comer Mark Ryalnce stole this movie and deservedly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for it he has amazing chemistry with Hanks. Ryalnce just brings a likability and vulnerability to him and his ""Standing Man"" scene will go down as one of the great movie scenes in a Spielberg movie. The courtroom scenes in this movie really gave you a sense of how people were during this time and gives you a chance to see what Donovan and Abel were facing for what they were trying to do. The flaws from this film though come from its second half the plot to free Powers just wasn't neither as compelling as the plot to free Abel and I would have personally would have portrayed his character more like James Ryan from another Spielberg film ""Saving Private Ryan"" it just would have made us more excited to finally see him and would have made for a more compelling story arc.<br/><br/>But in the end I like Bridge of Spies much more than I ever thought I would it has fantastic dialogue, characters and performances making for one of the finest films of 2015. 88%-A-"

It's useful to compare them with the pretentious, nonfunctional, so- called innovative jump cuts of Goddard's. Hitchcock once explained that cutting ""should be called assembly.  Montage means the assembly of pieces of film which, moved in rapid succession before the eye, create an idea.""

For instance, there is a seemingly tranquil sequence, where Donovan is meeting the spy in confinement, preceded by an aggressively disruptive sequence - following the sentence being declared in the courtroom - and proceeding to a the scene where Donovan's house is being shot. This reminds me of the contrast characteristic of montage once explained by Hitchcock.<br/><br/>The movie is also loaded with dark, fiendish ironies (again, reminiscent of 'Catch Me If You Can' to an extent) delicately embodied by Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>The picture is full of good deeds, being done by the typecast Hanks, and some kind of patriotism which is so recurrent in Spielberg's works. Such extent of these characteristics are not appealing to me. Nonetheless, they've done their works so appropriately and elaborately that I can't help enjoying them! I get filled with the tremendous, yet not corny, melodramatic atmosphere the director builds up. One remarkable reason why it doesn't feel corny is that he demonstrates even the (so-to-say) villain in a perceptive manner. It is notable, as a recurrent element - and therefore a privilege from the auteurism point of view - that his typical protagonist is neither a hero nor a villain but he's somewhere in the middle. It should be also wisely noticed that such middle state is not caused by the character's (or indeed filmmakers') inability to possess a clear status but by his absolutely firm and self-assured status which isn't predominantly accepted. Take for instance Hanks's role as a purely professional lawyer in this movie, his role as an arguably hardboiled cop – albeit not the protagonist - in 'Catch Me If You Can', Lincoln firmly believing in one simple principle in 'Lincoln' and Schindler as a mere industrialist in 'Schindler's List'. From a more detailed point of view, what matters to his protagonists is not the right or wrong but is (their) principles. For instance, Donovan, in this picture, believes in his job - and its principles - to such extent that even the Soviet spy, being defended by him, cautions ""Jim ... you should be careful. Careful!"" <br/><br/>Another privilege of Spielberg's over these contemporary, pretentious directors is his precise perception and elaborate fulfillment of complication and complexity. This picture, as an excellent example, features tens of instances of complication, in situations and interactions, which are likely to capture an audience's mind to such extent that it would reinforce the narrative and convey the suspense and thrill to the audience much more effectively. Such mature director is completely in contrast to the directors aforementioned. Take the highly cherished director, Nolan, for example. He's used to complicating his works so much that not only he, but perhaps anyone, can do. However, what he – and that anyone naturally – is unable to do is finishing up the narrative with any given degree of complication it's loaded with. He just abandons the narrative in a nondescript point. <br/><br/>There are two narratives constituting the story which, interestingly enough, while interacting with each other, gradually build up the political condition of the day too. It just caught my undivided attention how a cold fight, magnificently representing the Cold War, was demonstrated throughout the last sequences of the film – not to mention it's there throughout the movie with varying degrees. Throughout those final sequences, Donovan is involved in an outrageous fight where everyone is fully attempting to prove their power. It is literally a cold fight. It employs no muscle but is absolutely detrimental and nerve-wrecking. <br/><br/>The Cold War, naturally, had a cold side to it, signifying you couldn't know what's to come for sure. However, it was extraordinarily hot. Living in the day, while bombarded by propagandas suggesting a horrible war could begin at any time, one would be overwhelmed, distressed and, in all, superfluously confident. Such state of tremendously firm presumptions regarding war, enemy and stuff like that is fabulously suggested by the blinding lights throughout the movie. In most cases, light is dreadfully dark in this movie, making it arguably a groundbreaking neo-noir. Such lighting suggests the sense of assurance in the confinement and incarceration scenes too; this time implying Donovan and the spy being assured of their professional principles, which is what's common between them, as the glamorous gleam in their background is. His employment of technology, unlike most of Hollywood directors' exploitation of technology, actively induces my analytic enjoyment.<br/><br/>Finally, the amphiboly in the title of the picture caught my eyes. Bridge has two meanings here. Its second meaning, medium/facilitator, is Donovan himself who, at the peak of the movie, ends up at a bridge (the first meaning) bridging the spies. And you see a final touch in the end of the sequence where everyone leaves the situation rapidly and all the lights are turned off but Donovan stays. And ultimately, the aerial long shot – featuring only Donovan and the bridge – implies the amphiboly in the title, 'Bridge of Spies'. <br/><br/>So far as I've watched Spielberg's works, along with 'Catch Me If You Can', this one of his have best appealed to me.<br/><br/>PS. Spielberg-Hanks, undoubtedly, is one the functionally greatest duo in filmmaking."

","The film is a historical drama set in 1957, the period of the Cold War. It was a time where spies were used extensively by US and the Soviets. Though I don't claim to be an expert about the Cold War and it's history, I thought that the story is presented with utmost honesty. This is one of those films which would inspire one to learn more about such historical events. The film turns out to be quite a thriller.<br/><br/>Rudolf Abel is arrested by FBI on charges of being a Soviet Spy. A lawyer is provided, in order to ensure that justice is seen to be done. The lawyer, James Donovan, ignoring the fact that he was employed just for a formality, works with utmost sincerity in presenting Abel's case. He faces a lot of heat from public, family and his own firm. After some time, Francis Gary Powers who is a US pilot is captured by soviets. CIA, afraid that Powers might leak secrets, employees Donovan in helping them trade Powers with Abel. At the same time. Frederic Pryor, an American Student is unjustly held by Germans in suspicion of being a US spy. It turns into quite an adventure for Donovan as he tries to get both Pryer and Power for Abel.<br/><br/>The story is quite close to the true course of events. Powerful performances by Tom Hank and Mark Rylance are some of the main features of this film. Spielberg does a wonderful job in presenting the characters. For a plot so rich and dense, I thought the film moves a bit slow and covers less ground. Having said that, the film is successful in binding audience's attention and is kept interesting throughout."

","Bridge of Spies is a stellar movie with a very well developed plot and a magnificent cast. We are almost immediately taken in to the drama and intensity of this true story from the very beginning, as we follow an insurance lawyer who is tasked with defending a Soviet spy who has betrayed his country. We manage to gain support from the spy as we see his point of view, beautifully captured by the great Steven Spielberg. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I did feel that it did not give us enough insight on the seriousness of the Cold War. There is a scene where Donovan views a bunch of people being shot down while travelling on a train, I would like to to have seen more of this, to emphasise the struggles this movie is dealing with. <br/><br/>The performances are the highlight of it all, Tom Hanks is breathtaking as the lead role, James Donovan, perfectly conveying the transformation of an everyday lawyer turned hero, and Mark Rylance delivers a well deserved Oscar win as Rudolf Abel, a flawed, conflicted character who we can not help but support as a result of Rylance's charm. Terrificly acted, superb direction and a great script, Bridge of Spies is certainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good drama. <br/><br/>An insurance lawyer is tasked with defending a Soviet spy, a job that ends up stretching far beyond the courtroom. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Tom Hanks / Worst Performance: Alan Alda"
"rmax304823","7","1","1","1 July 2016"," Two For One.
","In the early 50s, the quiet, middle-aged amateur artist, Walter Abel is arrested. He's a Soviet spy. Tom Hanks is appointed to defend him but it's all supposed to be pro forma. Hanks is supposed to wave the fourth amendment, mention due process and protection from search and seizure, then sit down and shut up. But he takes his job as defense counsel seriously and nobody likes it. He can't possibly get Abel off but still he's defending a Russky espionage agent. Everyone is anxious to see this guy get the chair. <br/><br/>It was disheartening to see that the director has Hanks sitting on a subway at this point while all the strap hangers are reading about the trial in the newspapers and glare at him. The reason it's disheartening is that such a scene surely never happened in real life. Who the hell knows what Abel's defense attorney looked like -- or if they had seen photos of him, would recognize the innocent Hanks sitting on a subway train. And another reason that it's disheartening is that the director doesn't trust the audience to know what's already been made clear -- Hanks is ill thought of because he's defending a hated enemy. Really, earlier scenes in court and at Hanks' home have made that very clear.<br/><br/>The judge is eager to hang Abel too, but Hanks, an insurance lawyer, visits the judge at home and points out that if Abel is put in prison instead of the graveyard, the U. S. will have a little something in its back pocket to trade in case something similar happens to one of our agents in Moscow. Just in case, you know, kind of like an insurance policy. The judge is convinced and Abel gets thirty years, much to the anger of the public at large. While the two sit quietly in the visiting room listening to Shostakovitch, Able remarks, not unkindly, that Hanks ""should be careful"", and in fact a couple of bullets are fired through the windows of his home. When he loses his appeal to the Supreme Court, it's back to the insurance business for Hanks. He's summarily snubbed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, however, there has been a parallel story. The CIA has developed the super-secret U-2, a spy plane whose service altitude is 70,000 feet. That's pretty high up, out of the range of known Soviet missiles. But then, as Leo Strauss has pointed out, there are ""unknown unknowns"" and one of them is that Soviet missiles can bring down an airplane at 70,000 feet, which they duly do. The pilot, Francis Gary Powers, has been instructed to destroy both himself and the airplane if it should be brought down in Russian territory but he's unable to do either. The Soviets get both prizes and make the most of their exploit in the media, embarrassing president Dwight D. Eisenhower who at first claimed no knowledge of the spying. (This detail isn't in the movie.) Powers is tried and given ten years in a Soviet prison. Ugh.<br/><br/>Hanks is given the job of arranging a prisoner exchange in East Berlin, all on his own. His mission is to trade Abel for Powers and another guy, Pryor, a graduate student from Yale who was detained for no particular reason. Again, it's not mentioned in the movie but John F. Kennedy was president at the time and Hanks' character had his full backing except that Kennedy, a Harvard man, said he ""wouldn't bust his *** getting a Yale man out."" <br/><br/>The CIA cares nothing at all about Pryor. They only want to get Powers back, although they all hate him for having survived. The fact that Powers has suffered in an East German prison and kept awake for extended periods to squeeze information out of him means nothing to the CIA. In the end, due to Hanks' determination, the swap is accomplished after much bureaucratic haggling, and both Americans are released, while Abel is sent back to his family.<br/><br/>Good stuff. Nice photography and visual f/x. The scene of Powers' U-2 being shot down is thrilling. Tom Hanks brings an unusual edginess to the role of the central figure. He's jumpy, nervous, speaks rapidly, paces. Think of Gregory Peck. Now think of the opposite, except for the concordant confidence. As James B. Donovan, Hanks has a wife and two lovely kiddies. The kids are a little cute, but Hanks' wife, Amy Ryan, is just about right. She's pretty without being Hollywood gorgeous. And she doesn't provide unconditional support, nor does she nag. Nice job of writing. <br/><br/>The standout performance is by Mary Rylance as Rudolf Abel. Rylance gives us a wimpy little spy, wily, artistic, unflappable. He's taciturn and when he speaks it's with a Scottish accent and what he says is keenly perceptive. It's never slow because with the exception of Abel, all the character speak quickly, as in a thirty-second TV commercial. At time it felt as if the camera were undercranked.<br/><br/>The director, Spielberg, could easily have ruined the film by turning Hanks into a brave and resolute hero instead of a guy who insists on playing by the rules, who is anxious to get home and go to bed, who is frightened when cornered by some German kids who demand his warm coat in the middle of winter. Abel could have been turned into a stereotypical Russian spy, bald, ugly, and snarling defiantly. Instead of being snubbed after his return, Francis Gary Powers might have been hailed as a proud representative of Uncle Sam and given a ticker tape parade. And so on until we're not watching an adult movie but a children's cartoon."

","So this is a talking movie, with a LOT of talking going around without much action. Actually there is almost no action at all. So if you are looking forward to watching a action movie with spies going on espionage and trying to assassinate people, this isn't that kind of movie. When it comes to talking movies, the story, the dialogue and the performances has to take center stage. And this movie has all three of those elements without it going to a very convoluted and overly political direction. So most mainstream audiences will understand what is going on, on screen. However for me, what made this movie really work is Steven Spielberg classic direction. Where the premise is uplifting while having a sense of humanity. The cinematography really does have the tenacity to keep audiences like me focused for the most part. This is a historical film that is based on a true story. So the plot is about James B. Donovan played by Tom Hanks who is a lawyer that takes on the task of defending a soviet spy. And the negotiation and what goes behind the scenes of the American and Soviet politics. It delves into humanity and the will power to stand up for what is right, although a lot of people will resent you for it.

","But it's either a very big gap or a very big bridge (or maybe both). So to some this may feel too long. What it definitely is true, is the fact that the movie takes its time to tell the (true) story behind it all. While Spielberg probably took some liberties (as almost every filmmaker does when they tackle a true life story/incident), this is very interesting and tense stuff.<br/><br/>Though you wouldn't know when looking at the main character (besides the one Tom Hanks is playing), because of him underplaying everything. Was the real person like that? Haven't read much about that, but the movie may take a couple of people to take a look into that. And for that, the movie achieved what it wanted: Putting a spotlight on something not many are aware of. Spielberg and Kaminsky always deliver when it comes to settings/camera of course, acting is great too, so it's kind of a ""no-brainer"""

"emdeecee15","Null","4","9","17 October 2015"," Classic Spielberg sensibilities
","Steven Spielberg needs no introductions, as he is arguably the most prolific director in film history and one of the few representations of classic Hollywood still working today. ""Bridge of Spies,"" Spielberg's latest, is evidence of that. It has classic sensibilities that are all but dead in today's market; sensibilities that Spielberg helped establish in the first place. <br/><br/>""Bridge of Spies"" follows the true story of James Donovan (played by Tom Hanks), a life insurance lawyer who gets recruited by the government during the Cold War to defend Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance) in court, and then later negotiate the exchange of the spy for one of America's own, Francis Gary Powers (played by Austin Stowell). <br/><br/>I had my reservations going into this film because the trailers made it seem like the whole story was just an exercise in jingoism. Without context, many of the lines used in the marketing campaign came off as platitudinous cliché's about how America is the best because we have the Constitution and it makes us the most just of any country in the world. Or, at least, that's the impression I had going in. <br/><br/>In reality, my initial assumptions couldn't be farther from the truth. What I thought would be an endless stream of patriotic generalizations about Cold War America ended up being an intelligent critique of our own ethnocentrism. Donovan is hated by the public for much of the movie because he's the man appointed to defend Abel, who was viewed as some sort of devil. But Donovan understands that this man is just that: a man, like any other. He was merely doing the job he was assigned to do and deserves as fair a trial as anyone. Naturally, America doesn't sympathize with Donovan's quest for justice.<br/><br/>Spielberg's critique of American society during the Cold War, and in general, is based on this conflict. Donovan's philosophy essentially boils down to treat others as you would treat yourself, an ideology that America hasn't always abided by throughout history. This is what makes the film so thoroughly engaging. Aside from being a taut, humble historical drama, it also forces America in front of the mirror, giving us a look at our past in a light not often used. <br/><br/>Virtues aside, ""Bridge of Spies"" also functions incredibly on the technical side of things. Spielberg is known for his subtle long takes, and this film is no different. He eliminates the need for cuts by moving the camera around his actors in a way that allows for close-ups and wide shots to flow seamlessly, which often leads to takes running for several minutes. This allows the audience to fully immerse in each scene without even realizing what's going on, giving the illusion of reality that much more credence. <br/><br/>This technical competence runs all the way back to the script, which is concise and engaging at every turn. Donovan is written incredibly well, which is only emphasized by the fact that Hanks, America's sweetheart, plays the character with his trademark precision. It goes without saying that you're on Donovan's side from his first appearance on screen, but it's his classic sense of wit that really locks you in. As is appropriate for an insurance lawyer from Brooklyn who finds himself under such absurd circumstances, Donovan greets every escalation in the stakes with a sort of professional sarcasm that keeps the tone light without breaking that valued sense of realism. <br/><br/>Spielberg and success pretty much go hand-in-hand at this point, and it's good to see that the founder of the blockbuster still keeps his classic style close to his heart. ""Bridge of Spies"" probably isn't going to knock the socks off of anyone in the younger generations, but for the mature, patient moviegoer, this film is one of the most satisfying of the year."

Most of the concerns that I had during the movie were left unanswered and, once again, Spielberg's inability to omit moments of crass emotion or signpost future scenes (watch out for thugs on the streets etc.) were galling. <br/><br/>The cast should be excellent but only Tom Hank's character seems to benefit from any real development. Even then I wanted to give him a damned good shake; talk with your wife for Pete's sake, why would your colleagues put you into this position, don't walk so close to the wall, your family has just been shot at!<br/><br/>All of the opportunities to develop the sub plots are ham-fisted, bordering on stereotyping. But then that is what Spielberg usually gives you. In a movie this long the pieces should feel like they are supporting the whole but they feel oddly disjointed.<br/><br/>The final scenes do give a good reflection of the paranoia of those days (to which we seem to be returning). But at the end I was left asking ""is that it?""<br/><br/>In conclusion, Bridge of Spies is a watchable movie with excellent period feel which is enjoyable as long as you watch it rather than think about it."

I do not think this is one of Spielberg's greatest films (It's kind of hard to become of those), however I do believer this film is surely high on the list. Bridge of Spies brings light on the Cold War, an event that most audiences do not know much about. The Cold War did not have much action associated with it and neither does Bridge of Spies. Nonetheless, this film was highly entertaining and had me glued to my seat. Everything flowed together perfectly. These days actors are perform at a high level and most films have moving performances from everyone they cast. Bridges of Spies was no exception to this. Tom Hanks has yet to let me down in a film and Mark Rylance looks like he needs to be cast in a lot more films. The only thing negative I have to say about the film is that it is very predictable.

I have a natural distrust of Spielberg, most recently from the fictional War Horse, for being overly manipulative with his audiences. I have checked the basic facts behind this movie and they appear legit. If the movie was confirmed on a few other points I would give this a 10 without reservation. Sorry, for me historical movies (and particularly Biblical movies) need to be accurate - subtle deviations from the truth can (to me) create false impressions. As it is Hanks and Rylance (as Abel) are just superb, Hanks seems made for Spielberg's sort of movies. The period work is very impressive and cinematography superb.

Donovan's insistence on being the best possible lawyer for the enemy nation's spy, makes him come under fire from the American government & press.

This movie is even better than Spielberg's other biopics like, Lincoln(2012) & Schindler's List(1993). Lincoln(2012) is great, but it is slow. Schindler's List(1993) is a classic but, it is a bit slow as well. However, Spielberg has successfully pulled it off with this film. Bridge of Spies is primarily a drama but, it is extremely thrilling. You just don't know what's going to happen next, even in the final minutes of the film. I would have given this film a ten if it was say, 10 minutes shorter. Then, it would have been even more gripping. The suffering in Berlin during the time of the Berlin Wall, has been accurately depicted & is heartbreaking. Apart from Spielberg's brilliant direction, the performances are another highlight of the movie. Tom Hanks is outstanding as James B. Donovan. Hanks is charming, adds humor to the serious proceedings & can also be intense when the script needs him to be. Mark Rylance is amazing as Rudolf Abel. Amy Ryan is great as Mary Donovan.

Mikhail Gorevoy & Sebastian Koch are superb as Ivan Schischkin & Wolfgang Vogel respectively.

I had to check out Bridge of Spies because, while I am no expert on the cold war there was something inherently thought provoking about the very minimal trailers that were being shown. <br/><br/>The story centres around Jim Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer who has been recruited by the CIA to handle the case of a suspected Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance). I won't reveal anymore, I refuse to.<br/><br/>While there is not much action in this film, it is incredibly sleek, and mysterious. It gave me strong impressions of both excellent espionage and noir cinema. Kudos to frequent Spielberg collaborator and top notch cinematographer Janusz Kaminski who weaves a beautiful display of icy, shadow-fueled photography. Truly gorgeous to watch.<br/><br/>The writing is snappy, and ultimately superb. Can't expect much less from the Coen brothers who always seem to surprise me with their intelligent and clever scripts.<br/><br/>Hanks is a brilliant lead, who almost seems like a fish out of water, but ultimately a man who sticks to his guns, and never backs down. His scenes with outstanding stage actor Mark Rylance are the best parts of the film. These two heavyweights go blow for blow with each other despite their scenes being considerably calm and talky. <br/><br/>Spielberg very rarely lacks punch in his storytelling and this is another fine example of why he is considered as one of the all-time greats. This intelligent picture lacks a certain bravado of his earlier works, but that by no mean hinders from the films success. He is a tight, concise, and clever filmmaker who has yet again done wonders with an even more wonderful team of artists."

","'Bridge Of Spies' is a really cool drama movie with intriguing screenplay.Bridge of Spies tells the true story of a Cold War spy swap, during the height of tension between the U.S. and Russia.The movie is very realistic. Spielberg directed it so well and it may lead him to Oscars for his direction. The writers Matt and coen brothers was really did a splendid job. Tom Hanks nailed his role as James.B.Donovan. He literally lived in the character and made it alive on the screen. The way Mark Rylance portray Rudolf Able is commendable. Background score is good. Rest of the actors played their role well. It is unlike to see such kind of spy cold war drama movie."
"swilliky","6","3","6","19 October 2015"," A Spielberg History Lesson
","I prepared myself for the slow and steady spy-craft of Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies and got to watch another strong performance from Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>I was not familiar with this piece of history but apparently this insurance lawyer, James B. Donovan, had quite an effect on U.S. foreign negotiations during the Cold War. I can't help thinking there were some other stories to tell and should do some research on why Spielberg chose this particular story to adapt into a motion picture. There was certainly historical significance to the events depicted and I alway like to be made to think and to learn. <br/><br/>It looked beautiful, shots, scenery, costumes, but I did notice it was just a bunch of white guys for the most part and a few minor roles for woman. I have been reading Hollywood has a problem with that but it's not like this movie set out to change that and I guess they were just displaying the times. <br/><br/>There were also some great supporting performances by Mark Rylance, as Russian spy Rudolf Abel, and Amy Ryan, who played Donovan's wife and was also the mother in the recent Goosebumps movie. Someone should give her a leading role. I liked her all the way back in The Wire. Scott Shepherd was also good as a CIA agent.<br/><br/>This movie hinges on Hanks performance and I had no doubt he would deliver. He especially excels in the final climactic scenes. I liked this movie but it was also a bit slow and doesn't necessarily need to be seen in theaters. This is the fourth collaboration between Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg after Saving Private Ryan (one of the greatest war movies ever), The Terminal (forgettable), and Catch Me If You Can (another great movie).

"virek213","10","3","6","19 October 2015"," Spielberg And The Cold War
","The forty-five year period between 1945 and 1990 is one that the whole world knew as the Cold War. During that time, there was a huge struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union for control of how much of the planet should be free or under the yoke of the atheistic system that was Communism; and at several points, that war almost went from cold to hot. In the main, it was primarily a war of intelligence gathering; and the possibility of spies being captured on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain was always a possibility. Such an event is the subject of director Steven Spielberg's 2015 Cold War suspense thriller BRIDGE OF SPIES, the 27th film in this legendary director's career.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, who has made it his business of playing an Everyman, portrays the role of James Donovan, a New York insurance lawyer who, in 1957, was thrown into the breach of the Cold War by being forced to defend a KGB agent named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) on three counts related to espionage activity. Although Hanks loses that case in court, Rylance is spared the electric chair because, as Hanks admonishes those in high places, the day may very well come when the Soviet Union might capture one of our spies behind their lines, and that a prisoner exchange might well be necessary.<br/><br/>Three years later, in 1960, that very possibility comes to the fore when Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), a U-2 pilot working for the CIA, is captured by the Soviet Union after one of their missiles downs his aircraft. Hanks sees a huge opportunity for both countries (neither Rylance nor Stowell have divulged anything to their captors); but this potential boon is tainted by the capture of an American graduate student named Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) on the wrong side of the newly-completed Berlin Wall in the winter of 1961. Hanks then gets a hard lesson in the bizarre nature of Cold War politics, as Rogers is being held by East German officials, and both they and the Soviets are on different pages when it comes to the Communist political playbook.<br/><br/>With the help of some fairly cagey maneuvering on his part, though it is severely looked down by his fellow Americans in general, and his own wife (Amy Ryan) in particular, as coddling an enemy agent, he manages to set up the moment of truth for all three men on the Glienicke Bridge (the actual bridge that is known as the Bridge Of Spies) that separates Berlin from Potsdam, all of this without any shots being fired in anger.<br/><br/>Given that these events happened half a century in the past, and that an entire generation has grown up not knowing what the Cold War actually was, almost any other filmmaker might have had a very difficult time making the story clear. But then Spielberg has never been just any other filmmaker, and, being part of that generation that did know the fear that life as they knew it could end in a matter of hours, he knew that this was a story with huge implications, both political and humanistic. BRIDGE OF SPIES is a masterpiece of tension and suspense, with Spielberg continuing to show the influence of Alfred Hitchcock in his work; and Hanks basically does a role not dissimilar to James Stewart in several of Hitchcock's classic films. The depiction of the Cold War is magnified in the way Spielberg depicts the way the Berlin Wall cut off both the eastern and western parts of that city, and how Soviet soldiers cut down those who tried to jump over the wall (not unlike similar scenes involving the Nazi death camps in the director's 1993 masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST. Rylance gives a superb low-key performance as Abel, a man resigned to his fate whatever it is but willing to accept what comes from it, gaining a lot of respect from Hanks in the process. Spielberg also superbly recreates that horribly tense period of the late 1950s and early 1960s where America was at risk, probably less from its fears of the bomb than its own anti-Soviet paranoia.<br/><br/>Because John Williams, Spielberg's long-time collaborator, was unavailable due to health issues, Thomas Newman, part of Hollywood's illustrious film scoring dynasty, stepped in to do the score for BRIDGE OF SPIES; and while it may not have the typical verve of Williams, Newman's score has a lot to recommend it, including the influences of both Shostakovich and Copland, avoiding the easy and (in some ways) expected patriotic cues. Sober and serious much of the time, but with the added wit and gravitas of Hanks' and Rylance's performances to keep the story from getting too grim, BRIDGE OF SPIES is another masterpiece in a long line of masterpieces for Spielberg, especially in his collaborations with Hanks; and it is a film that reminds us that the Cold War, though a part of history now, is also still an important part of that history."
"aharmas","10","3","6","18 October 2015"," The Perfect Diplomat
","It has become customary to expect the best from Steven Spielberg, the man behind so many classics in American cinema, and he keeps growing as an artist, always availing himself of the best team, and working along with them to give us the finest quality in the art of cinema. IN ""Bridge of Spies"" he has directed an old fashioned film which shows in precise detail how the art of diplomacy might not have been invented but fine tuned, with grace and good intentions. With the help of Tom Hanks, a great choice for the lead character, Spielberg takes on a trip to the past, to show us the world of politics and the Cold War in the 1950's. <br/><br/>It's a time of fear and paranoia, a world that expects the worst and chases its own tail in order to find a solution that might not exist. Both Russia and the United States are expecting the worst. Regular people live in constant fear that today might be their last day. Kids receive training in school to get them ready for the moment the world will be destroyed, with everyone living in a cloud of atomic waste.<br/><br/>One day a ""spy"" is detained by the FBI, and Hanks is hired to defend him, though it's just a charade since everyone knows the result before the case even goes to court. Somehow, Hanks predicts there are possibilities to allowing the prisoner to remain in jail. This sets off acts of violence against the defender for his anti patriotism. <br/><br/>Without giving much away, he finds himself in the middle of international deals, with two partners going at each other when one feels the other is either outsmarting or slighting each other. Egos are bruised and soothed, and lives are in danger because arrangements are not that easy to make.<br/><br/>Eventually, everything is resolved, not without last minute twists that could undo every bit of work. This is the time when Hank shines, by portraying that everyman persona that makes him so endearing and popular. He wins us over with his intelligence and his big heart. James Stewart was very good at playing this type, and his match is Hanks, a very talented actor who once again proves that with the help of a great team behind him, he has found his niche again, and we are given movie gold.<br/><br/>""Spies"" brings back a world lone gone, with extreme detail going into his production and much care at the heart of the script. With every performer giving his best in order to fully realize a vision. The result is a classic, a film that makes us think and satisfies us."
"kislaykaushal22","6","3","6","18 October 2015"," Appreciated but not loved!
","Set in the Cold War era, in Brooklyn, Bridge of Spies is a story about a successful insurance prosecutor, James B Donovan (Tom Hanks) who is given a case to defend a Russian spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). A true nationalist and yet an idealist lawyer, James draw a lot of flak from his men for his earnest and professional efforts in the case. But soon, his ideology leads him to a precarious task of rescuing an American pilot, a task gravely sensitive for the two conflicting nations. The movie is not a nail biting thriller which the title or the trailer or Saving Private Ryan might have suggested. This is a very evenly paced drama, predictable for most of the time but boasts of meticulous details, a hallmark of Mr Spielberg. The story is inherently a little weak, yet Mr Spielberg manages to spin off a decent movie out of it. James and Rudolf really hit it off and it is fun to watch them together. Tom Hanks is at his usual best and Mark Rylance befits the character of an extraordinarily wise, artistic and resolute Russian soldier. Other characters are not of much significance and a couple of them actually seem needless. The movie follows a depiction of the event as it happened and doesn't display any deliberate dramatization. Consequently, it doesn't evoke any strong emotions while watching which some people might actually prefer. Personally, I believe a better connect and impact would have made this movie far more memorable. This definitely is a decent, American film which scores completely on actors, cinematography (involving 1960 Brooklyn) and direction. But considering what Mr Spielberg and Mr Hanks have done before, I had stomach for more."

","History comes alive with Bridge of Spies. Mark Rylance is excellently cast as Rudolph Able, by all appearances, a kindly man who just wishes to be alone with his paint set. Appearances are deceiving, as we learn he is actually a Russian spy. Playing out as a secondary story, we watch as Francis Gary Powers is selected to fly a US plane in order to gather intelligence on Russia. Given a poison to take should he be captured, Powers realizes how dangerous a mission he was about to undertake.<br/><br/>James Donovan is charged with the task of providing Able a suitable defense, not unlike John Adams had been called to do nearly two hundred years before with the Red Coats who fired into the crowd at Boston. Donovan loses in court, but is able to spare Able's life, citing that killing him would only incite hostilities against the US by Russia.<br/><br/>Powers' mission is a failure as he is shot down, and tortured by the Russians. To add to the events, the Berlin Wall is going up in Germany, causing strife in that country as well. Fredric Pryor, an American college student studying abroad, is taken prisoner. Sent under orders to do an even change, Able for Powers, Donovan doesn't like the idea of leaving an American behind.<br/><br/>To the dismay of the US Government, Donovan begins to set negations to get both Pryor and Powers, telling the Russians that they won't get Able if the US doesn't get both of their citizens back. The drama intensifies as it appears Germany may balk at the suggestion of giving up Pryor.<br/><br/>The events come to ahead on a snowy bridge, as Able and Powers stand on opposite sides of the bridge, not knowing if they would step foot on the homeland again. At the last second, the Germans show up at Checkpoint Charlie with Pryor, and the exchange is made, and Donovan is happy with his success, yet worried about Able's fate, as the two have become friends amongst the madness of world politics.<br/><br/>The brisk pace of the movie, as well as the engaging characters make this a must see movie. Alan Alda proves he still has it, even though he appears briefly in the film. Both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance both forth such amazing performances, that both should be considered Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>It's next to impossible to make a suspenseful film about a historical event of which you already know the outcome. Yet Spielberg is able to do just that. This is a true must see film! 10 out of 10."

","The film ""Bridge of Spies"" set during the cold war is a collection of banalities including a predictable plot, mediocre acting and dull music. The screenplay could have been much more thrilling if the writers would have followed the main events in a more historically accurate way.<br/><br/>The real life of James B. Donovan was much more exciting than the one depicted in the film. He was a lawyer at the Nuremberg trials and was already a well-known lawyer when he took the Rudolf Abel case. Donovan did not see Berlin wall escapees being shot; the shootings, which were the most similar to the ones depicted were those associated with the killing of Peter Fechter that happened the summer after the Powers/Abel exchange on the Glienicke Bridge.<br/><br/>The real life stories of the spies of that period offer rich material for a writer, however the Coen brothers took the most uninteresting segment of the espionage story. The characters are bland and forgettable. This is an example of a politically correct propaganda film showing the good work of the intelligence services.<br/><br/>The film ""Bridge of Spies"" is boring and disappointing – a naïve film made for a naïve audience.

"thegirlwhosellsyoupopcorn","10","4","10","13 November 2015"," Could not stop talking about it.
","Tom Hanks has always been excellent at bringing to life, unique, interesting, and inspiring characters. From his early days as a kid who magically grows up and has to deal with the adult world in Big and as a disabled young man in Forest Gump, Hanks has consistently charmed audiences with his strong performances and acting style. In his latest movie, Bridge of Spies, he does it again, promising and delivering yet another powerful performance of a completely different character. He plays an insurance lawyer who is chosen to defend an accused Russian spy during the Cold War. Hanks' performance shows off his remarkable talent as he shows viewers the many sides of his well rounded character. He is a father, a lawyer, an American, and in the end a friend to his client, as he works to bring a strong legal defense to and save the life of the accused man. He eventually works to be able to negotiate to return the prisoner to his family. With heartbreaking moments, fascinating political commentary, and compelling and true story this movie this movie will keep you talking long after the credits roll. Without giving anything away the scene near the end set on the bridge is especially powerful.<br/><br/>The part of the story I found most interesting was the intense debate over what rights, if any, an accused person person who was not born in the United States should receive. As I watched the erosion of the rights of the accused I was reminded of a recent trial that, at least partially, revolved around a similar theme. What was important during the Cold War remains a concern as we face a shifting future of international politics and complicated international situations. Bridge of Spies is strong and powerful and is sure to be a crowd pleaser. My personal rating is ten out of ten. Please note that this is a reflection of my personal opinion, not paid for or influenced by any company affiliated with the movie Bridge of Spies and that, while I am a proud employee of a national movie theater chain the views and opinions expressed in this review are mine and not necessarily a reflection of the company where I work.

"statuskuo","9","4","10","18 October 2015"," We're Going To Miss Spielberg
","We're going to really miss Spielberg when he retires. IF he retires. This is craft to the highest form. And the attention to every detail is sorely lacking in movies. Craft is IMPOSSIBLE to relate to movie makers today, because it's when talent meets instinct. And we lack instinct.<br/><br/>The story is of Tom Hanks who plays defense attorney James Donovan, that deals with insurance policies. As we're introduced in the beginning, he does what every defense attorney does, he spins the truth to meet his client's point. It's a little scheisty, but he's clearly effective. This gathers the attention of his boss, who assigns him the duty to defend an alleged Soviet spy. I don't even believe in due process, unless I'm bustedof course, but he is entitled to a ""fair"" trial. If that is even possible. The United States is under high alert in light of the Cold War (Muslims anyone?) and Germany is rebuildingsort of. With the freeze out of the Russians who've gone deep into secrecy. Were we ever friends? So, now we got a captured Ruskiewhat happens? Well, don't want to give away too much. But he is exactly how we imagine someone captured should act who comes from the Eastern Block. Cold, detached and resigned to their fate.<br/><br/>So, now as advertised, we get a spy exchange. But who does it? The C.I.A. washes their hands of the issue. The State Department don't want to be involved? Well, they wrangle Donovan into the mission. Except, it's not a mission. Because if caught or killed Donovan is on his own. Because of the freeze out (literally) of Berlin, and the historical split to East and West, they aren't playing games.<br/><br/>The movie isn't the most exciting. Espionage, in the truest sense, would most likely be a lot of waiting. But this moves at a really nice clip and because of craftyou watch every beautiful frame with anticipation of the next visual (beautifully shot on film by Janusz Kaminski).<br/><br/>This is a movie that only professionals put together. The minute you watch, you know the people who made it are skilled. There is an easiness, practically effortless (looks like) storytelling. They let the moments between the family develop. The intricacies of our diplomacy made simple despite the thick fog of friends and enemies. A classy sophisticated movie. It's high art."

","Greetings again from the darkness. For a director, true power in the movie industry means you can obtain the financing and assemble the cast and crew you need to make the films that have meaning to you. With his 40 year career of unmatched combined box office and critical success, Steven Spielberg is the epitome of film power and the master of bringing us dramatized versions of historical characters and events. In his fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, Spielberg tells the story of James B Donovan.<br/><br/>You say you aren't familiar with Mr. Donovan? In the late 1950's and early 1960's, the CIA (Allen Dulles was director at the time) persuaded James Donovan to provide a bit of Cold War legal service. Mr. Donovan was by trade an Insurance attorney, but after others in his profession passed on the ""opportunity"", his commitment to justice and human rights drove him to accept the challenge of defending suspected Russian spy named Rudolph Abel. In the face of an angry populace and government, Donovan took the case all the way to the Supreme Court – and his exact words are spoken in the movie by Hanks.<br/><br/>Not long after, Francis Powers (played by Austin Stowell) was piloting a CIA U-2 spy plane when he was shot down over Russia and taken captive. This sequence in the film is breathtaking to watch. Enter James Donovan again  this time to negotiate an exchange of prisoners: Rudolph Abel for Francis Powers. It's these negotiations that provide the element of suspense in the story. Mr. Donovan was a family man, but he was also very confident in his ability to negotiate on the biggest stage and under the brightest spotlight (or darkest backroom).<br/><br/>The movie is exactly what you would expect from a master filmmaker. Spielberg re-creates the era through sets, locations, and costumes. He utilizes his remarkable eye behind the camera, an interesting use of lighting, and the score from Thomas Newman. Nope, that's not a misprint. It's the first Spielberg movie in 30 years not scored by John Williams (who was unable to work on the project). Of course, the cast is stellar and it all starts with Tom Hanks. He just makes everything look so darn easy! Whether he is talking to his wife (Amy Ryan), his kids (including Bono's daughter Eve Hewson), his law partner (Alan Alda), or agents from the U.S. or Russia  Hanks manages to make each scene real and believable.<br/><br/>It's the scenes between Donovan and Rudolph Abel that are the most fascinating to watch. Mark Rylance plays Abel, and to see these two men grow to respect each other for ""doing their job"" is a true acting and screen writing clinic. We find ourselves anxious for the next Rudolph Abel scene during an extended span where the focus is on Donovan's negotiations. When the two finally reunite, it's a quietly affecting moment where much is said with few words.<br/><br/>Spielberg utilized many of the locations where the actual events took place, and this includes Berlin and the Glienicke Bridge where the real exchange took place in 1962. While missing the labyrinth of twists and turns of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, it's knowing that these are real people in real situations that make this historic drama so thrilling and riveting to watch. Film lovers will also get a kick out of the fact that the script was co-written by the Coen Brothers, and history lovers will enjoy seeing some of the details provided by the written words of those involved, as well as their surviving family members. It's an era that seems so long ago, yet the topics are so pertinent to what's happening in the world today. Beyond all of that, it's a story of a man standing up for what's right at a time when that was not the easy or popular way."
"sriramanadvocate","8","3","7","26 October 2015"," The Masterly Spielberg
","Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. I need not say more. I entered the theatre with expectations. Two other things that made me more excited for the film was the casting of remarkable Mark Rylance (stage actor) to the big screen. I first saw him this year in BBC's Wolf Hall and was floored by the man. Al Pacino is quoted as saying "" he( Mark Rylance) speaks Shakespeare as if it was written for him the night before"" and also fact that Coen Brothers has co written the movie. The story essentially is a cold war espionage drama. The film does not have any pounding music, eye popping CGI, no 3D, no mind bending plot twist nor any thrilling/heart pounding scenes. Yet it is a timely drama reminding everyone of how the civilized society is supposed to function as per the rule of law and also about what it is to be human. Bridge of spies is vintage cinema. Every scene of the movie is so well done by the master craftsman Steven Spielberg that even some times the camera just narrates the story instead of dialogues. Coen brothers were very evident in the screenplay with their trademark subtle humour present throughout. Tom Hanks portrayed the role of James Donovan to perfection with ease and it was a real treat to watch the artist perform. Mark Rylance lived up to his reputation with a masterly subtle performance. The Cinematography, Editing & Direction reminded me of how inspiring and captivating the art of cinema can be. There has been some criticism that the movie does not have suspense enough but i think the movie is more a drama than a thriller or to quote Mr.Spielberg ""Character Thriller"". Any fan of cinema will walk out of the movie with a sense of satisfaction and so did i."

","Loved this film!<br/><br/>The title is actually literal! It's all revealed in the last sequences of the film. Wonderful impact! But watch carefully seeds are planted at the very beginning of the film to guide your mind into the end. The pace of the film is perfect – no time for boredom, and enough time for exposition to understand what's going on and keep the suspense. Some apparent loose strings come together at the end—it all makes sense and it's wonderful.<br/><br/>The world building is realistic: Spielberg shows us the destruction of East Germany, the horrors of the wall, and the economic and social devastation. Of course Spielberg is a superstar in this territory—he's done war masterpiece films before. He knows how to compose images that stir curiosity and deep emotions. <br/><br/>The writers did a superb job with a sequence of scenes that makes us (the audience) care very much for Jim (Tom Hanks) and his missions. We understand him. We want him to succeed: he's a man of altruism, honor, generosity, and justice. He's a warm and kind husband, father, and citizen. He sacrifices his reputation. And he's so smart! He uses his knowledge in probabilistic insurance models to make decisions on his spy negotiations. Brilliant.<br/><br/>When Jim says that the Russian spy should be given incarceration and not electric chair because he could be used for an exchange, in case the Russians get an American spy this gave me the hint of what was coming later. Even though there's some predictability, the whole situation of an American lawyer in treacherous enemy territory to hold negotiations is incredibly suspenseful.<br/><br/>I was on the edge of my seat I laughed with Tom Hanks mannerisms and sense of humor (his trademark shouts and gestures) in rough times. I got teary in the last sequence of the exchange, and how Jim's kindness won the Russian's spy's heart.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is the master of showing emotional engagement and astute acting. He is a delight to watch on the big screen. The rest of the cast does a fine job and thanks to them the best and the worst of Jim's character shows up on the screen. Conflict and suspense are part of every minute of this film! Jim took measured risks—for the sake of doing the right thing—and he succeeded. Wonderful 2 hours! Loved it!<br/><br/>I was super surprised to see the energetic sequence of the airplane taken down by a Russian missile! An unexpected exciting moment of action and thrill! Because of this event, at midpoint in the film things flip upside down for Jim – he has to go to East Berlin to negotiate 1 for 1 exchange, but while he is there, he learns there's a student that happened to be at the wrong time and got captured and he makes it a 2 for 1which becomes an incredible difficult and dangerous task <br/><br/>This is a masterpiece to be absorbed and relived many times. Cheers."

","The first crisis of the cold war is hardly remembered as both The Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis have eclipsed the debacle of captured U2 pilot Gary Powers and Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. Bridge of Spies, aptly named is Steven Spielberg's moving, and entertaining, big-screen correction of, perhaps, the mostly forgotten story of the first major diplomacy between the superpowers in the avoiding thermo-nuclear war.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a somewhat obscure attorney and great American (at least prior to the events depicted) James Donovan. A brittle serendipitous stage of events, uniquely, fell into place as ""the sum of all fears"" began to reach a fever-pitch from which an unlikely chain of events thrust insurance attorney Donovan into the spotlight. It was not an enviable spotlight for Donovan as his only purpose was to avert any possibility of Rudolf Abel not being professionally represented in what could be an international incident.<br/><br/>It was believed a swift and certain verdict of guilty with the death penalty would be reached justly. The message would be the U.S.A. is fair and just, but unwavering in intent. There was only one thing, Donovan was nobody's lackey.<br/><br/>To James Donovan being a red-blooded American meant first and foremost upholding the constitution because it is what separated America from all other nations. Donovan believed any accused human, citizen or not, gets the rights guaranteed by the constitution in a U.S. court of law. While he didn't wholly succeed at first he set a series of events in motion that ended up defining post World War II détente. <br/><br/>Spielberg masterly brings this story of a man who steps forward to embody something greater than himself at great cost. Fighting for something larger,he not only defines himself, but who we are as a nation. In the interim, before the righteousness the man stands on is actually embraced he may just be labeled a pariah, there's no doubt Donovan was being the target of many death threats. And without the lack of support from his family and employer. Slowly though his moral wisdom rises to save two men from prison and a nation from greater threat of nuclear war. This is a piece of American history very deserving to be retold, sure for entertainment, but also for our inspection. A real defining moment in history whose good set a precedent. <br/><br/>This is, another of Tom Hank's finest moments. He captures the essence of a man whose time to become something more curiously fell into place. This, combined with the impeccable period sets and concisely powerful writing, make Bridge of Spies a very important movie that celebrates a lesser known historical event; an event which still defines how two mortal enemies can achieve a kind of peaceful outcome. I give this movie my highest recommendation and could care less even if there is slight artistic freedom interwoven; it gets the big things right and makes me proud. We need more men like James Donovan...maybe more than ever."

","Bridge of Spies centers a lawyer who gets involved on defending a Soviet spy during the Cold War, meanwhile an American pilot was captured from the Soviet Union after a failed infiltration mission; having both sides even. This can be called a war movie, except it takes place in another side of the war; where we see people making decisions, having negotiations and such; might be recalling Spielberg's last film, Lincoln. Though some people may not be fond of the similarity, Bridge of Spies however manages to bring more humor and excitement within this journey. The plot remains rigorous, yet finds some real humanity, anyway. There are many reasons to get hooked into this film; from the story to the craft, whether it's big or small, the entirety is just excellent.<br/><br/>The opening is already impressive, having a wordless prologue showing what this Soviet spy does in his job, hidden behind his innocent mannerism and appearance. It's simple, but tense and catches your attention, filling you with intriguing questions about this man's work. And then we cut to James Donovan, played by Tom Hanks, who is supposed to help this spy who was just captured and becomes a notorious man for defending an enemy of the nation. But things get tougher when he gets on an espionage, and then there's more. Despite the plot goes through a lot of directions, it never gets tedious and that might be because it's brought with some levity and sharp writing. But of course, the movie is on point with its theme. Basically acknowledging that no one is particularly good or bad in this war, both nations are having the same struggle, except Donovan strives to represent his country better by not only defending their spy, but also defending his own nation's integrity.<br/><br/>And ironically, the Soviet spy happens to have more empathy in this film compared to the American spy. He can still be a threat for handling information, but he is actually a quiet old man who isn't afraid of anything. And his small moments with Donovan are instantly winning, mostly by its profoundness. In the midst of people arguing how to retrieve back their spies as safely as possible, the viewers shouldn't be worried by a stick-in-the-mud plotting, because the film hints with subtle humor. But of course, there is some suspense to be seen, as well. The opening is just the most interesting for its sense of mystery; the rest of the set pieces are just tension of people probably getting into trouble.<br/><br/>And these scenes won't be as effective if it weren't for Steven Spielberg himself. The smaller scenes are obviously gripping and given warmth when they needed to, while the larger ones have brimming spectacle. The overall imagery always look great due to its stunning cinematography. The Coen Brothers, as the co-writers of this film, can obviously be noticed by the film's levity and some subtlety, as well. The acting is all predictable, with Tom Hanks being terribly engaging as James Donovan, but the more notable actor, Mark Rylance, brings a less showy performance, yet given something more to his moments.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies is stellar, simply by its craft and how it straightforwardly retells this story. It doesn't necessarily try to heighten the stakes beyond than what's necessary, in which some viewers can be disappointed, but the movie offers something more earnest and riveting. There is still a fine dose of suspense, though it actually handles a variety of tones: there are moments of coldness, but there are also moments that lighten itself up; making each account quite affecting and most importantly, entertaining, in this case of these men finding better justice for saving each other's spies, during one of the toughest times in history. And it's all done much you would expect from these filmmaking and acting talents."
"Screen_Blitz","8","3","7","19 October 2015"," Enthralling Cold War espionage thriller by Steven Spielberg
","Director Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks collaborate once again this espionage thriller set in the 1950s in the height of the Cold War, a period of political tensions between many nations across the globe and a time when the United States facing threats of communism from the Soviet Union that ravaged on until the early 1990s following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Based on the true events, Tom Hanks play James Donovan, an American lawyer who takes on a daunting court case to defend Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance), who is suspected of being a Russian spy, much to the outrage of the public as well as his wife and children. When CIA U-2 Spy-plane pilot Francis Scott Powers (played by Austin Stowell) is shot down and captured by the Soviets, Donovan is assigned into a negotiation with Germany to exchange Abel for Powers who is held hostage by German officers. This film marks Steven Spielberg's first collaboration with the Coen Brothers who produced this film, though the lack of humor typical for the directorial duo make it difficult to tell.<br/><br/>This film does a pleasant job with highlighting the key points of the Cold War conflicts. It accurately portrays the atmosphere and the paranoia of nuclear war that America dealt with during this period. After all, it is Steven Spielberg behind the camera, and his director appears to carry polished knowledge on American history as demonstrated in some his previous outlets. One of the Cold War's most crucial elements of paranoia is best demonstrated in a scene for an example where Donovan's young daughter is in school and her class is watching an instructional video on seeking shelter for when a nuclear explosion occurs, and you see clips of cities getting wiped out by nuclear explosions. It genuinely shows the emotions people felt when the United States was in conflict against the Soviet Union, and how the threat of nuclear exchange was dangerously high. The Coen Brothers' screenplay and the direction are very well accomplished here, at least for the majority. Spielberg ambitiously maintains intriguing story as it follows the perilous journey of the main character and his attempt to make a deal with the Soviet Union, a deal that can carry catastrophic consequences if gone wrong. And with a crafty hand like Spielberg, he manages to keep the plot moving at a fairly solid pace, even when the film gets a bit too talky at certain points. Though the story doesn't quite offer many elements of surprise or even emotional depth (especially for a Spielberg flick), Spielberg fuels in plenty of substance to sustain the plot on an intriguing scale. The biggest disappointment in the narrative department however, may lie in the anti- climatic (though nicely shot by Janusz Kaminski) ending as the story concludes in a fading light fashion rather than with a bang, but there are some fair goodies in terms of the acting. Tom Hanks leads a terrific performance as his character James Donovan who is written beautifully without feeling very lionized with heroism. Mark Rylance does a pretty swell job as Rudolf Abel, the antagonist character who is portrayed very humanly without falling victim to contrived villainous characterization. <br/><br/>Bridge of Spies is one of the best film of the year and is definitely a must see. While it certainly isn't as memorable as Steven Spielberg's other works, its still very satisfying. This is also probably the best film you will see centered on the Cold War."
"griffolyon12","9","3","7","19 October 2015"," A Fantastic History Lesson
","Director Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have teamed up for the fourth time in their illustrious careers to make their latest film, Bridge of Spies. Few filmmakers could literally direct in their sleep, and Spielberg probably could do that, the same with Tom Hanks in regards to acting, thankfully both of them give it their all here and make Bridge of Spies a very polished film that, while is neither of their best work, is still well worth your time.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies tells the story of James B. Donovan (Hanks), a Brooklyn-based insurance lawyer in the late-1950s who took on the case of accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (a likable Mark Rylance). Donovan was seen as a pariah for doing his best to defend Abel to the letter of the law, but he was then recognized as a hero when U-2 pilot, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), was shot down over Soviet Russia, and Donovan was tasked by the CIA to travel to East Berlin to negotiate a swap - Abel for Powers.<br/><br/>Spielberg works from a script that was written by Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers, and the Coen influence is very evident throughout the script. There are scenes of high tension one second (all exquisitely milked by Spielberg), and then moments that disarm the tension with humor the very next (a place where Tom Hanks excels at), which is very reminiscent of Coen films like Blood Simple or No Country for Old Men. This five-way collaboration between Spielberg, Hanks, Charman, and the Coens, finds each of these exceptional filmmakers all pooling their collective talents together to make a film that plays to all of their strengths, and that is the main reason that Bridge of Spies is a cut above most films in current release. The fact that the movie may have too high expectations upon it, purely because of the prior resumes of all involved, does not detract from the fact that this is still a remarkable film that captures a moment in history where too few films have gone.<br/><br/>The history of film is full of movies about World War II, but when it comes to the Cold War, it's been an area that has been vastly unexplored by Hollywood. This film accurately recreates the period when Cold War paranoia was at its height in the States, making this a fantastic history lesson as well as fantastic entertainment. The production is designed with exquisite detail, with Berlin in particular looking as if it leapt off the pages of history books, and it really reinforces how bad things really were during that period. In just the background characters alone, Spielberg could have probably made three or four other movies, all of which would be equally as fascinating, that is how insane this moment in history was, and it's why it should never be forgotten. <br/><br/>On the technical side of things, Bridge of Spies is another Spielberg, Janusz Kaminski collaboration with stunning cinematography. The film uses muted colors, with lots of grays, blacks, and navy blues on display in the sets and costumes, while the cinematographer, Kaminski, utilizes a lot of wide angle lenses to mimic the looks of many Hollywood films from the Fifties. This film simply looks as slick and stylish as anything that Spielberg has ever made, and yet it very affectionately feels like a throwback to the movies of the era in which is this film is set. The feel of movies like Judgment at Nuremberg is very evident in many moments. Of course, while the movie is a technical marvel and a well recreated history lesson, what makes Bridge of Spies stick with you after seeing it is the character of Donovan himself.<br/><br/>James B. Donovan was a very fascinating man. He defended Abel because he believed that if we just sentenced him to death for being a spy without any due process, how does that make us any different from our enemy? If we see ourselves as Americans as being the better men, then should we not show the world that we are? This kind of straight arrow character is a rarity in film nowadays, with Hanks really mirroring the likes of Jimmy Stewart and Gregory Peck in his performance, it's just that kind of role and he does it perfectly. Then there is Rylance as Abel, who plays him in a very quiet, controlled manner that really paints Abel in a poetic light. He was simply a patriot, who believed in his country and on top of that, was just an unassuming, nice man who actually befriends Donovan in an interesting way. It really goes to show that the bogeyman is not always the monster we make him out to be, and I think that was one of the main ideas Spielberg was wanting show with this film, and I believe he does so brilliantly.<br/><br/>I give Bridge of Spies a 9 out of 10!"
"nurktwin-45352","2","4","11","29 January 2016"," What are we supposed to think
","*** First review so maybe I got some spoilers in here*** I went into this with high hopes and excitement after the positive reviews. Once I started getting into the story the film was trying to tell, I began getting the palpable sense that Spielberg & company were making this spy for the communist regimes into a sympathetic guy (while at the same time making the same amount of effort in reverse to make all the Germans and Americans - except for our intrepid hero Tom Hanks, of course, look like idiots). My question throughout the movie as it progressed was, Why? Why exactly was I supposed to like and sympathize with this spy? And I never got it: He served and was loyal to a brutal, oppressive regime, the USSR. Reading up on him after to see if I'd maybe missed something, I simply found out that he was one obviously was at odds with our American /Western values and our country at that time, and in his very profession and actions doing his part to undermine America by bringing her secrets to our enemy. Spielberg seems to go out of his way to make him seem so nice and relate-able. But that running gag line about ""Would/will it help?"" got tired real fast - after the second time he uttered it. On the other hand, he invests the same effort at making the (East) Germans loathsome. But weren't they along with Abel serving the same overlord, the USSR? I never bought it that Abel was in the remotest sense likable or even misunderstood. He was in real life a communist ideologue and stooge of a corrupt oppressive system under Stalin that had murdered or starved to death tens of millions - yes, TENS of millions of their own people or those of Soviet satellite republics. This then isn't movie-making so much as Hollywood revisionism. The two stars all go to Tom Hanks."
"rcreekmur","10","4","11","17 October 2015"," Spielberg is Back - Not that He Ever Went Away
","It's easy to get caught up in the magnificent acting performances of this film's phenomenal international cast. Of course you expect Tom Hanks to put his usual Oscar-worthy skills on display, and he does in scene after scene. But everyone in the supporting cast is equally as memorable, not to mention Mark Rylance, who is one of the most talented actors many people may not recognize or even be familiar with. It's also easy to get caught up in the beautiful, period cinematography, locations and sets in Bridge of Spies. The look and feel of both early 1960's America plus the depressing starkness of East Berlin during the escalation of the Cold War are depicted perfectly.<br/><br/>But what came through to me more than any of these individual pieces is the unsurpassed storytelling skills of Steven Spielberg. Not only does he get one of the best performances out of Hanks in his entire career, but his attention to detail and nuance is utterly amazing. When Hanks is confused, Spielberg makes sure you are as well. When he's feeling anxious or paranoid, the director makes you equally as apprehensive. But he does this with visual cues, glances, hints and a marvelous musical score.<br/><br/>This is cinema at its purest and its best. Dialog is less important than the visuals, but the script is tight, crisp and taught. Nothing is wasted. In a season when there have been a great many outstanding films to hit the screen (Mr. Holmes, Black Mass, Everest) Bridge of Spies is a must-see for anyone who loves a well-told story that will make you wonder how two hours can fly by so quickly."
"dave-mcclain","9","4","11","16 October 2015"," In ""Bridge of Spies"", Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks bring us a 1st Class historical drama.
","A friend of mine recently posted on Facebook that his daughter had asked him who played the character called Hawkeye. ""Alan Alda,"" was my friend's reply, thinking of the surgeon on TV's ""M*A*S*H"". But my friend's daughter was asking about the Marvel Comics character in the ""Avengers"" films (played by Jeremy Renner). Besides amusing me, that little story got me thinking about how I was going to write my review of Steven Spielberg's historical drama ""Bridge of Spies"" (PG-13, 2:21). If I'm going to discuss a movie in which ""The U-2 Incident"" plays such a big part, it might be a good idea to point out that this reference has nothing to do with ticket scalping at a rock concert or anything of the sort. In fact, to better appreciate this review and, more importantly, Spielberg's film, you might want to do what I just did – reinforce and add to your historical knowledge of the aforementioned Cold War crisis, the Hollow Nickel Case and Rudolf Abel, Francis Gary Powers and James Donovan. Or you could just read my review and then go to the film, not just for a great cinematic history lesson but to see one terrific movie.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan, a New York insurance lawyer in the 1950s. Donovan is smart, honest, hard-working and, most importantly, he has principles and integrity – especially when it comes to the law. He has also served his country in uniform and assisted in the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the post-World War II Nuremberg Trials. Donovan's law firm's senior partner (played, coincidentally, by the same Alan Alda mentioned in my previous paragraph) asks him to accept the thankless task of defending accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (multiple Tony Award winner Mark Rylance).<br/><br/>Donovan is understandably less than enthusiastic about all of this, but his sincere belief that ""everyone deserves a defense"" leads him to take the case. In spite of (and because of) his patriotism, he represents this obviously guilty spy as zealously and ethically as he represents all his clients. In the vehement and almost universal anti-communism of 1950s America, Donovan runs down every ground ball, making him one of the most hated men in America – and even endangering his family. His wife (Amy Ryan) supports him throughout the case, but she has some trouble understanding the lengths that he goes to for Abel.<br/><br/>Fast-forward a few years. Abel is still in prison, and Donovan brings him a letter supposedly from his wife in the U.S.S.R. The letter amounts to a back-channel proposal from the Soviets to discuss trading Abel for recently captured U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). C.I.A. director Allen Dulles personally asks Donovan to negotiate the swap – but as a private citizen, NOT as a representative of the U.S. government. Telling his wife he's going on a business trip to London, Donovan heads to East Berlin, just as the politically divided city is being physically divided by the construction of the Berlin Wall.<br/><br/>With a C.I.A. employee (Scott Shepherd) briefing and supporting him, but needing to otherwise keep his distance, Donovan begins his dangerous mission. Navigating check points and a street gang, he walks alone from West to East Berlin for an appointment inside the Soviet embassy. He meets unofficially with another man to, as Donovan says, ""have the conversation that our governments can't"". Further complicating an already tenuous negotiation is Donovan's personal decision to insist that the prisoner swap include an innocent American university student recently detained by East German authorities. Clearly, it's going to take every ounce of Donovan's intelligence, skill and nerve to accomplish his objectives, not the least of which is avoiding getting shot or even detained and put on trial himself.<br/><br/>""Bridge of Spies"" is that rare movie that can make history come to life and give it the immediacy of a first-class cinematic drama/thriller. Of course, there are those (as two people behind me in the theater seemed to do) who will walk out of a movie if it isn't very quickly filled with explosions, murders or at least a good chase scene, but short-sighted individuals like that miss an opportunity to enjoy the artistry of well-crafted stories that, sadly, are not as common as they used to be. This entire cast is exceptional, especially Hanks, who is as at the top of his game in full-on thinking man's ""boy scout"" mode, and Mark Rylance who deserves significant awards season recognition and, of course, the always impressive Ryan.<br/><br/>I should mention that the Cold War intrigue highlighted in the film's trailers is all in the second half of the film, but the script, co-written by Matt Charman and none other than Ethan and Joel Coen, is smart and compelling throughout. That story, coupled with Spielberg's expert touch, impressively recalls a time and tone that few Americans still remember, while giving us the twin dramas of a Soviet spy in the U.S. and a downed U.S. pilot in the Soviet Union. These two tales are seamlessly woven together and perfectly edited. The film also reminds us that what makes all of us Americans are not the political or religious beliefs we hold, but the principles we all stand for. ""Bridge of Spies"" is as American as apple pie and about as rewarding an experience as anyone, regardless of nationality, could hope a film to be. ""A"""

","The missus asked me what I wanna see this week and I replied: ""what else, the Spielberg-Hanks one"". This collaboration has always been a marriage made in film-heaven. Yes, I even adore The Terminal. But I don't know about this latest one. My wife dozed off a few times and the dude sitting next to me slept through most of it.<br/><br/>The story is based on the true-life tale of James Donovan (Hanks); a lawyer who was pushed headfirst into the Cold War during the 1960s when he had to negotiate for the release of downed U2 spy plane pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) after the airman was shot down over Russia.<br/><br/>The title refers to the popular Cold War nickname for what's now the Glienicke Bridge connecting East and West Germany at the time the film is set. Its official name then was the Bridge of Unity, but it garnered its alternate moniker due to its notoriety as a prisoner exchange point for Western and Soviet powers.<br/><br/>This Cold War story is certainly ripe for a rip-roaring cross-country yarn but Spielberg went for a sweet classical tone instead. There is a certain elegant sheen to the proceedings and the film poses deep ponderous questions like what makes us citizens of our countries. Hanks' nobility shines off like a light from a candle in a dark room as he takes up the job that nobody wants. The spycraft is captivating and absorbing, and when I say spycraft I don't mean Bourne or Bond. Dead drops are meticulous affairs. Gadgets are giant cameras installed on the bottom of light-weight aircrafts and hollow coins with a poisoned pin for instant death inflicted on oneself by oneself. It is all good and fine but the film couldn't engage me totally with its lack of severity and tension.<br/><br/>For me, the film worked best when James Donovan (Tom Hanks) and Rudolf Abel (Michael Rylance) are sharing a scene together. Abel's face is impenetrable, yet it is filled with the weight of histories and subsumed patriotism. There is a scene in which he opens up to Donovan that is absolutely haunting. The moment the movie just focuses on Hanks it loses me. There is nothing wrong with Hanks. Hanks is just playing.... Hanks for the umpteenth time. You know which Hanks I am talking about... he is the cleverest man, the perfect man in the whole world. He bounces up from setbacks with a dusting off of his pants. You know he will save the day. Mind you, there's nothing wrong with that. But it didn't help the cause of the character when he is depicted as the noblest Saint of Earth and all others are evil, vile and dumb. Where are the cat and mouse games and the battle of wits between the Germans, Soviets and this lone American knight in a shiny armor? Nobody stood a chance against Hanks, and to really drum it into you Donovan's Messiah powers, every American looks to him like he is the enemy of the state and the scum of the earth. I don't appreciate being manipulated like this, especially by a movie.<br/><br/>Still, this is a handsomely made film with some superbly crafted scenes that will remain in my memory for a long time, like the building of the Berlin Wall scene. Spielberg's typical musical cues are a little too in-my-face for my liking, forcing me to feel a certain way. The narrative circles and probes, but it didn't manage to percolate. Usually Spielberg's magic envelopes me and makes me a believer, just not in the case of Bridge of Spies. The film resonates and beats with the sweet energy of a full orchestra with Spielberg-Hanks as the maestro, but like Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool's new manager, sometimes I prefer Heavy Metal."
"justinraphaelm","6","2","4","23 May 2017"," Not as good as advertised
","I just finished watching Bridge of Spies. Before I tell you what I think I just want to say that despite my perceptions, I still think the movie was a decent movie. The acting, cinematography, directing, and script were all superb, and I cannot say enough about Tom Hanks, he truly is one of the best actors in Hollywood. All that aside, the movie was boring. While the acting and directing were well done, there was nothing interesting about what was happening. Just another spy movie - without the action - with a pretty predictable ending. There was no action, no twists, no interesting commentary or argumentative dialogue surrounding the particular political atmosphere at the time. Just a pretty straight forward storyline with nothing to capture, or retain, interest (in terms of the storyline). With that in mind, I don't want to say it was a bad movie because it wasn't. I suppose I just expected more. With that in mind, I would still recommend the movie, so long as one isn't expecting any fireworks...and has had plenty of coffee in advance."
"seanwilson-556","9","2","4","16 December 2016"," One of the most fascinating Cold War thrillers you'll ever see
","Steven Spielberg's vast body of work has been hit-and-miss for me. While he's always been a technically brilliant filmmaker, he sometimes falls too much into mainstream territory, directing films that undeniably entertain but fall short when seen from an artistic point of view. However, when he's on point, his films are absolutely breathtaking. Bridge of Spies certainly falls under this category, although I might be slightly biased simply because I'm a Cold War buff. Based on the real-life incident, we follow lawyer James Donovan, who ends up negotiating the exchange of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel for American pilot Francis Gary Powers in Berlin during the early 1960's.<br/><br/>Ever since reading Don DeLillo's incredible postmodern novel Libra, I've been fascinated by the U-2 spy planes and the capture of American pilot Francis Gary Powers. In a part of the novel, DeLillo describes, in disturbing political realism, the capture and interrogation of the pilot after his U-2 plane was shot down over Soviet territory. Now, in Bridge of Spies, Spielberg dramatises this important moment in history with terrifying realism. <br/><br/>While not overtly violent, the film manages to disturb the viewer through the impeccable set design, cinematography and Spielberg's typically brilliant direction. Soviet spies lived and spied on Western nations, most notably the USA and the UK, while American and British spies lived and spied on Soviet Russia, during a time of extreme political paranoia. With the world on the potential verge of World War III, James Donovan (Tom Hanks) uses his legal knowledge in order to prevent a massive wave of violence. Hanks gives a predictably strong, professional performance as Donovan while British actor Mark Rylance steals the screen for his supporting role as Rudolf Abel.<br/><br/>Spielberg is old-school Hollywood. His films feature the theatrical musical flourishes found in 40's and 50's Hollywood classics, American sentimentality and patriotism, and well-staged action and direction. His craftsmanship is undoubtedly excellent and this film shows why he's one of Hollywood's most successful and popular filmmakers, and Bridge of Spies is one of his best films. But we can't forget another filmmaking double, the Coen brothers, who co-wrote the film and deserve a mention for their well-written screenplay. It is a tense and exciting political thriller, and also a fascinating account of one of the most important, but also somehow forgotten, moments in Cold War history."

Abel is sentenced to 30 years in jail and Donovan's Supreme Court appeal fails. Just then Francis Gary Powers, the ""U-2 Spy"", is shot down over Russia and captured. Now Donovan becomes the negotiator in a potential prisoner swap...<br/><br/>Interesting story, especially as it is largely true and involves a very well-known historic event - the U-2 Spy. The negotiations and brinkmanship towards the end are quite intriguing.<br/><br/>However, feels clumsy, idealistic and, at times, contrived. The first part of the movie deals very heavy-handedly with Abel's trial. The character of Donovan also seems too goody-two-shoesy to be the real Donovan.<br/><br/>Certainly not Steven Spielberg's best direction - far from it. The movie seems to lack engagement and what there is is overly contrived and sentimental. Plus I quite quickly got irritated with his over- use of the last image of one scene being a segue to a new, unrelated, scene. Just felt very cheesy and amateurish.<br/><br/>Being a Steven Spielberg film, we have Tom Hanks in the lead role. He puts in a fairly solid performance. Mark Rylance got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Abel. Not sure why - he doesn't have that much dialogue and his screen time is fairly limited too."

","Who said that a thriller has to be violent to be considered as successful? Bridge of Spies is a smart movie about the Gary Powers affair, a dramatic event which could have become the spark of a destructive conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Despite what the title may suggest, Bridge of Spies is not a movie about espionage. Don't expect to see thrilling chases, firefights or anything we could see in James Bond or Mission Impossible. This movie is about the real story of the efforts of one man, Jim Donovan, a Brooklyn lawyer specialized in insurance issues, who became involved in spite of himself in the most sensitive crisis of that time and, by using his negotiating skills, is trying to settle peacefully the crisis by organizing an exchange between Powers and a Soviet spy who was arrested prior to the crash of the U2.<br/><br/>Once again, Tom Hanks is playing with perfection this role of a man who put his reputation, his life and his family's in line by defending a Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (played admirably by Mark Rylance) because he truly believes that anybody, whatever the charges are against him or her, deserves the right to be defended.<br/><br/>Mark Rylance is also perfect impersonating Rudolf Abel. His performance is very sober and I have some sympathy for the character. As Donovan says in the movie, Abel is just a loyal soldier of his country and he should not be branded as a traitor as many did back in that time.<br/><br/>But what gives to this movie all its credits is its sobriety and objectivity depicting the tension between the two sides back in that era, the hypocrisy of both judicial system including ours who wants the world to be considered as a model of justice but in reality are ready to deny the values of our country by violating the Constitution and depriving Abel of his basic right to defend himself.<br/><br/>There are some scenes who literally broke my heart. I had tears watching Jim's son filling the bathtub of water because in school he learned that the first basic needs which couldn't be able to be fulfilled in case of a nuclear bombardment will be electricity and water or when those two people got shot to death while trying to climb the Berlin wall and escape the oppressive Soviet regime. I looked up and it turned out that more than 200 people were gunned down trying to escape including women.<br/><br/>So yes maybe some would have preferred an action movie but for the ones who prefers a realistic recalling of the facts like myself will really appreciate this picture. We need more movies like Bridges of spies. Movies who can give you a realistic insight of what was going on. In that matter Bridge of spies is accomplishing its mission very perfectly."

","Name every aspect involving making a film and thumbs go up with this one.The master speaks, uses his skills to the sublime. No one doubts. Spielberg at his best. Right?<br/><br/>Yes, but...<br/><br/>1/3 courtroom, 2/3 cold war suspense. Thats a rough outline of the scrips structure. The latter would be deeply satisfying for it's exiting, sentimentally old- fashion, home- cooked cold-war-spy-movie grandeur. But it is not satisfying to me. Why? Because there is a 1/3 courtroom part that is so much more, so much more promising, so much more layered, with so many exiting set-ups, that i miss - i miss him more often these days - good old Clint Eatwood to bring all that complexity to a satisfying end. The first part is not about cold war, not about a spy and not about court. The fist part is about.....us. Us people in modern days turmoil , caught in the middle of international terrorist fear. In the middle of fear for Muslims, in the middle of fear for 'the other' human being, in the middle of group pressure, consensus, media hysteria, etc..... The first part is showing a hero who thinks for himself, who is not giving in to group- thinking, who dares to stand alone, who uses reason in the right way, who is a hero because he keeps his brain sound and clear, his private property, not owned by Apple, Google or God knows who..... All in the setting of the 50s. This 1/3 part promises a movie that uses a cold war concept to dig deeper into the psychology of group thinking and the harmful consequences of it.<br/><br/>Instead, we turn to a good old spy movie, Spielberg forgets his million-dollar worth set-ups, leaves us alone with the moral expectations we developed and gives us goodies and baddies....with a twist, sure, but......<br/><br/>Americans that think, act straight and...... Eurpoeans that act weird and confused.<br/><br/>Great movie to watch, because it is nothing more than great popcorn. My favorite is white ceddar cheese btw..."

Simply spellbinding, one of the best movie of the year.<br/><br/>I think this flick is for adults. There's no sex, no nudity, not even a single kiss or the bad language and zero violence, its fine for teens and kids can understand, but the story is what I meant that suits only for the grown ups.

It's completely a one man show and the end has been just like everybody wanted. I'm not surprised that it is nominated for the Oscars in the 6 categories including the best motion picture.

"cwyneken","8","2","4","25 January 2016"," Great performances and amazing dialogue.... But I didn't love it?
","Bridge of Spies is one big mystery for me. It felt like a love/hate relationship, like Bridge of Spies and I enjoy each other, but we secretly dislike each other too. I did enjoy this movie, but it's easily my least favorite of the best picture nominations for 2015/2016, even more shocking considering that it was directed by the great and mighty Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>Your premise is it's 1960, it's the Cold War, and your main character, played by the one and only Tom Hanks, is just an American attorney who is put into this situation of releasing a spy plane pilot for the United States, in exchange for a Soviet spy that the Americans have captured, and this is the story of how the trade went on and the trials and tribulations of getting this very difficult swap made.<br/><br/>Okay guys, before you watch this movie, be prepared for what this movie is: It's not an action movie... Despite the fact that this is pretty much is a war type of movie, for the most part not even a little bit. It's lots of negotiations and back and forth of trying find compromise of making this soldier swap happen. However, the lines that these actors deliver can be downright nail-biting and thrilling at times. The power and audacity in which many of these lines are delivered was very spine tingling at times, and I enjoyed that thoroughly. Unsurprisingly, Tom Hanks was the best at this, and his performance was outstanding. Oscar worthy? Possibly. I'd stick him up there maybe for a nomination, but definitely not the winner. Mark Rylance as the Soviet spy was a surprise standout performance that I really enjoyed in this movie, and occasionally brought a comedic spot to this movie.<br/><br/>But there was an issue with this movie that could be more to do with me than the movie, but there were many periods in the movie where I just got downright bored. I felt like in some moments that I was just waiting for the plot to continue on.... And it wasn't. This was a stab in the gut, because I was bored during quite a few parts of this movie. Like I said, I had a love hate relationship with this movie. I was either intrigued by the dialogue and the magnitude of some of the moments in this film, or I just got downright bored and almost irritated at times, waiting for something bigger to happen.<br/><br/>Never the less, this movie is directed exquisitely. Something this movie did was make me feel like I was in the time period, and submerged in this world, thanks in no small part to the excellent directing by Spielberg. It's a well shot and fundamentally sound movie that l's obviously well put together.<br/><br/>All and all, this was an entertaining movie for me. Don't get me wrong, I love period pieces and historical dramas/thriller, but for some reason, this movie didn't captivate me the way I was truly hoping it would.<br/><br/>7.75/10 on my Wynner Scale"
"eleagece","8","2","4","25 January 2016"," Spielberg being Spielberg, which is great
","When Spielberg is behind the cameras you know you're going to watch a movie which is at least correct. Luckily, Bridge of Spies is more than correct: it's a remarkable film from start to finish.<br/><br/>Its strenghts are the great staging, the dark and cold photography and the rock-solid acting. There is nothing more to be said about Tom Hanks, he is able to make crappy films like Da Vinci Code entertaining, so in a good movie like this one, it's obvious he nails it. I've loved the other main character, Mark Rylance as the Russian spy. He transmits composure no matter what is going around him. The ties that bind his character to Hanks' one trascend the main plot and send a bright message: people have essentially the same values, and if we are confronted is just because of the part of the board we started from when we were born.<br/><br/>Its weaknesses, well... no risks taken. The plot is predictable and based in values overused in cinema like friendship, loyalty and honesty. Even the cinematography: after so many movies Spielberg knows himself too well, and his way of managing the resources seems obvious. Don't get me wrong, that is great because with an interesting story we have an interesting movie, but far from that feeling of novelty that makes a film special. To be precise: there are shots which feel like copy-paste from other of his movies (those scenes with headlights in backlighting, those slow chases, those cars moving and braking to stop in front of the camera...) and the pace is sometimes quite slow (there are scenes in which Spielberg shows the exact same thing from different angles, adding really nothing to the movie but redundant information). But anyway, it's an enjoyable movie. In fact the best from Spielberg lately."
"gavin6942","7","2","4","24 January 2016"," The Constitution and the Cold War
","During the Cold War, an American lawyer (Tom Hanks) is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy (Mark Rylance) in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers.<br/><br/>The film is nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (for Rylance), Best Production Design and Best Original Screenplay. Let us address those in reverse order.<br/><br/>There is no doubt the screenplay is strong, and another feather in the caps of the Coen brothers. Whether or not you consider it to be ""best"" probably comes down to one thing: do you prefer a good story or do you prefer historical accuracy? If you prefer historical accuracy, you are going to have qualms with this picture because Donovan (Hanks) is very false. He is portrayed as an insurance attorney rather than the intelligence operative he was, and he is shown as the victim of multiple acts of violence, which he was not. So that will be an automatic hangup for some people who frown on dramatic exaggeration and poetic license.<br/><br/>If one looks at it a bit more forgivingly, though, it is an incredible script that covers the Constitution, the Cold War, the interaction of various governments and their agents... it tells the story of one attorney defending a despicable client because it is the right thing to do (a la ""To Kill a Mockingbird"") and the better-known tale of Gary Powers and the U-2 spy plane. Is it sensationalized? Somewhat. A little melodramatic with its patriotism? Yes. But still a darn fine story, and whether a winner or not, clearly a strong contender for best screenplay.<br/><br/>How about production design? This one is a bit of a challenge. The work that went into this film is incredible, bringing everything on screen back to the 1950s and 1960s. Every car, every outfit, and even the most inconsequential detail had to be touched. How you compare this to the futuristic sets of ""Mad Max"" or the science-driven world of ""The Martian"", who knows? It is like comparing apples and oranges. While ""Bridge of Spies"" will probably not carry this category, those who worked on securing all the necessary scenery deserve top honors.<br/><br/>The supporting actor category is where ""Bridge of Spies"" has its best chance of winning an award. Mark Rylance is not an actor whose work I am familiar with, because he has primarily distinguished himself on the stage. So it is hard to say how much he is going outside of his normal range here. But he gives us an interesting character. While ""best actors"" are often intense or pushed to their limits, Rylance is quite the opposite: subtle and understated. But it makes fora powerful, compelling nemesis you cannot help but like in some way. He would be deserving of the award.<br/><br/>Which leaves us with best picture. And the short answer is no, this is not a contender. The nomination makes sense, but the film never seems to hit all cylinders. Although nothing is lacking, it still feels somehow incomplete. ""Bridge of Spies"" is not the film of the year, nor is it among Spielberg's best."
"cdjhood-65924","8","2","4","7 January 2016"," Another Great a Effort By Spielberg
","Steven Spielberg is one of the best directors of all time with his massive and mostly amazing filmography this was one of my most anticipated movies of 2015 and it lived up to most expectations. Tom hanks is fantastic in this movie he is instantly likable as he is set up from the first scene as an honourable and hard working man. But my god Mark Rylance was outstanding in this movie, he stole every scene he was in and his ""Standing Man"" speech is one of the best monologues of the year. The era of the Cold War was very well done as it was clear how many people hated the soviets in this movie and also made for a lot of very intense moments and gave the impression that things could fall apart at any moment. Like most of Spielberg films Bridge of Spies is superbly directed with most of the scenes are long cuts, tracking shots and close ups. It could have been very easy in a dialogue driven film like to cut a lot but Spielberg doesn't fall for it. This film is not without its flaws, for one Powers' are in this movie was slow and honestly unnecessary as looking back at Savung Private Ryan the person they were trying to save in that movie didn't even make an appearance until 2/3 of the way through and that type of decision would also have worked very well for this movie. The film also suffers from a slow paced second half. With certain obstacles becoming a bit silly and drawn out and being a bit repetitive after a while. The ending however was just perfect for what it needed to be. Not without its flaws but still a great movie and another Spielberg classic. <br/><br/>8.5/10 A-"
"Robert_duder","7","2","4","9 December 2015"," A good story and good points but cumbersome to watch
","Bridge of Spies had two things going for it that I thought for sure would make it a hit in my books. You have Tom Hanks and you have Steven Spielberg. How can you go wrong? Probably one of the greatest actors known to us and one of the greatest directors. Bridge of Spies is a fascinating story, well acted, definitely saved from oblivion by the intense talent of the two aforementioned men. However, the pacing of the film is definitively off. It feels slow and it is slow. It is almost cumbersome to try and pay attention. There just feels like there is something missing that makes it more captivating and I think professional critics will agree with me and Bridge of Spies won't make a splash at all. Now all that said, there is no doubt you can see Spielberg's masterful eye and vision in many shots. The film is, at times, a cinematographic masterpiece. Visually amazing scenes of Berlin during the wall being put up and the horrifyingly powerful scene of Hanks watching people desperately trying to get over the wall. The bleak coldness of Berlin at the time (although apparently the wrong time of year for the real story - it worked well for dramatization purposes.) <br/><br/>Tom Hanks...the man, the legend...a living icon of Hollywood. He produces and writes and acts and gets awards and he has had an incredible career. He is just charismatic on screen and he becomes every character he portrays and this performance is no exception. His portrayal is passionate and the character well established. Hanks does what he does best. Mark Rylance is getting a lot of buzz for his performance as Russian spy Rudolf Abel and certainly he does a good job in a sort of understated and subtle way. His role isn't very big but it is effective and he and Hanks are great together. It's a very fascinating relationship. The supporting cast are all good but the film definitely focuses heavily on Hanks' character so they get small roles. Amy Ryan, Austin Stowell, Dakin Matthews, Sebastian Koch and Burghart Klaußner are a few of the better supporting performances in the film.<br/><br/>Saying anything about Steven Spielberg's direction is literally pointless. The man is a master and a visionary and as I mentioned you can definitely his expert mastery in the film. The only issue perhaps is that someone who is editing or producing his films might be reluctant to be honest about potential issues. Bridge of Spies goes on too long and stumbles in several respects and even misses some key things that could have made the story more interesting. Still, it has it's appeal but considering Hanks and Spielberg's involvement at the head it is forgettable in its genre and that's simply unfortunate. I sort of had high expectations for good reason it only delivered on a very slight level. Worth watching once but don't expect a Saving Private Ryan or a Schindler's List but poor man's version of either of those. 7/10"
"Marshymint98","8","2","4","29 November 2015"," Another classic for Tom Hanks - But lacking in pace at parts
","I expected this movie to be a somewhat familiar war thriller. In many ways it achieves this, yet there's something unique with this movie - I guess its background as a true story influences this. <br/><br/>The movie opens somewhat slowly: yet this feels necessary due to the ambiguous nature of what exactly is supposed to be happening. Once the roles of the key characters becomes established, the story really develops. The court case in the first act (accompanied with the development of battle planes) is the strongest aspect of this movie, with the stakes faced by the characters feeling largely reminiscent of the mood during the cold war. The acting of Mark Rylance also brings much unexpected humour to the movie, leading to an altogether strong opening. <br/><br/>The only major action sequence occurs mid-war through the movie, when a surveillance aircraft is shot down by Soviet forces. This scene is mostly exciting, and shows good direction from Spielburg. However, it inevitably feels familiar and forced due to the need for an American prisoner at this stage. It's also hugely unrealistic and I would assume blown out of proportion to the real story. Consequently, it appears more like a typical action scene - and loses grasp on the uniqueness built up at this stage. <br/><br/>Tension is built up positively however during a scene when James's house and family is attacked. This feels real, and really adds to the heightened 'cold war' atmosphere created. It also leads well into the third act, when James enters a war torn Germany for an exchange of prisoners. However, it is this stage of the movie where the pace is really lost, despite the great effort placed into the German post war set. Ultimately the endless negotiations becomes in- effective, and the movie begins to drag. It is this section that doesn't justify the length of the movie, and would benefit from being drastically reduced. <br/><br/>The climax is however satisfying, and is tense to watch. It's also warming to see the friendship that has developed between James and Rudolf, seeming different to the usual enemies that such characters are presented as. <br/><br/>Therefore, the acting is a strong point. Tom Hanks as usual doesn't disappoint, with the part seeming perfect for him. It really does add to his 'classic' line up of characters as well, especially the real life characters that he seems to be adopting more. Mark Rylance also stands out as Rudolf, becoming likable despite his cold role. Finally the music is perfect. I didn't know who the composer was going into the theatre, but new instantly that it was Thomas Newman, with his distinctive themes prevailing. He really brings emotion and atmospheres to his films with his scores, and this one was no different. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is good - but let down at parts by a tendency to revert to typical movie scenes, and occasional poor pacing. However, Spielburg has created another classic movie with good acting, and a charming plot, that is overall poignant and unique. I'd recommend it!"
"estebangonzalez10","7","2","4","27 October 2015"," Spielberg and Hanks deliver, but it's Rylance who steals the movie
","""This man, my father's friend, he was beaten. Every time they hit him, he stood back up again. They hit him harder, still he got back to his feet. I think because of this they let him live.""<br/><br/>Over the past few years Steven Spielberg has shied away from the big blockbuster productions and settled for historical dramas such as Lincoln, War Horse, and Munich. Now we can add Bridge of Spies to Spielberg's list of history lessons which counts on some outstanding and understated performances from an A list cast. This is the fourth collaboration between Spielberg and Tom Hanks, and although it doesn't rank amongst my favorite I still enjoyed the character he plays here. Hanks is James B. Donovan, an insurance attorney with a strong sense of justice who also happens to be a respectable family man. Hanks plays the character very subtly and in a way he reminded me of Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch because both characters seem to share a strong moral code and they put their sense of justice above what the community might think of them. Here Donovan is given the task to serve as a defense attorney for a KGB intelligence officer named Rudolf Abel (played masterfully by Mark Rylance) during the height of the Cold War. You can imagine how the public reacts when Donovan begins to take his role seriously and defends this spy. It takes a toll on his family as well, his wife is played here by Amy Ryan and his children by Jillian Lebling, Noah Schnapps, and Eve Hewson. They believe in him, but also seem to be going through a similar conflict. My complaint here is that Amy Ryan is sidelined and doesn't get to play an important role in the movie. <br/><br/>There is also a parallel story going on as several US pilots are being recruited on a special mission to secretly fly U2 planes over the Soviet Union to gather intel. One of these pilots is Francis Powers (Austin Stowell) who on his first mission is shot down and captured by the soviets. The two plots come together when Donovan is asked by US government officials to try to negotiate a deal to interchange their prisoners. Spielberg delivers a historical piece with precise attention to detail giving us once again another important lesson about humanity's unsung heroes. Donovan represents the ideal character here with strong moral values that are often forgotten or overlooked in today's movie. I couldn't think of a better actor to play such a character than the great Tom Hanks. However the standout for me was Mark Rylance as the soviet spy. It was a breath of fresh air to see a character like this portrayed in such a humane light. He is not the enemy here, he is a man who is doing his job and also seems to share a strong moral code. Rylance gives the film's best performance and I think he out shined everyone in this film. The great Alan Alda also gets to be on screen for a few minutes although he isn't playing against type or anything like that. <br/><br/>Political thrillers are rarely in my interest, but I couldn't let this film pass me by considering Steven Spielberg is the director who has made more of my favorite films than any other. Include a screenplay co-written with the Coen brothers and I was sold. The pacing of the film at times did seem to drag the movie down, but Spielberg treats the material with respect. Kaminski's cinematography captures the era perfectly and Newman's score adds to the emotional moments. The 50's are perfectly captured through the art direction and Spielberg managed to transport us back to Berlin during the construction of the wall. Overall I enjoyed my history lesson once again from Steven Spielberg, but I felt that the film could've benefited from more thrills and a better pacing. It's still a must see in my book. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"quincytheodore","8","2","4","26 October 2015"," Bond of men in the coldest of times
","Capturing the weight and gloom of an era, Bridge of Spies is equally a biopic and an unexpected light drama. There's a lingering intensity, especially concerning the world of secrecy, yet it's a fascinatingly accessible story with subtle refined humor. This is meant to inspire instead of evaluation of ideologies, showcasing that humanity still resides beyond the other side of border or wall.<br/><br/>Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is an alleged Soviet spy, he's caught and set for a trial. For his defense James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is unceremoniously selected, mainly for the purpose of procedure. After a while Donovan becomes invested on defending his client despite the unusual circumstance, it then takes him on a journey to help CIA save their own agent.<br/><br/>Despite the rather shady title, this is not the flamboyant gunslinger action ala James Bond or the intense operation like Argo. It is, strangely and also effectively, a light foray into the otherwise dark world of espionage. The pace is utterly calm, credit goes to Mark Rylance as Abel, who occasionally shows the pettiness of worrying.<br/><br/>He and Tom Hanks have incredible chemistry, both of the characters practically have nothing in common aside from the mutual respect towards each other. Donovan himself is avid negotiator, he pushes his objective with verbal aggression, yet the movie almost never resorts to violence and even on few occasions that it does venture to bleak territory, it does so with sophistication.<br/><br/>Rather than using typical war buildup, the movie gives faces to each party, thus humanizing them in incredibly identifiable way. It also deals with the issues of the era head-on while maintaining composure and suspending judgment. Lastly, it offers a soft touch of comedy along the way. The unexpected banters lighten the mood with timely cynical quip, it doesn't undermine the theme and still gives polished interaction between the supposed stoic personalities.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies is perhaps one of the most accessible depictions of a war. It might set in Cold War and showcase the grim reality of it, yet it never falters on presenting honor, duty and the best side of humanity in less than favorable time."

","Of course we know how great an actor Tom Hanks has been, with many Academy Award wins and nominations in his body of work. I think sometimes he makes it look so easy that he doesn't receive adequate credit for those roles. Sir Mark Rylance is more of a character actor, even though he has had lead roles also. He disappears into his characters. He was wonderful playing Thomas Cromwell in the tv series Wolf Hall. Boy, am I looking forward to the next series of that standout program. Oh, and by the way, he won the Academy Award for his work in this very film I am reviewing here. And of course it was directed by Steven Spielberg, a bit of a legend himself.<br/><br/>The plot to Bridge of Spies is not as layered and complex as many spy thrillers, but if anything, not having twists and turns dropping onto our head from nowhere allows the suspense to build out in plain sight. Interestingly, one of the key scenes was filmed on location where the event actually took place. I am leaving out the details in case are you haven't watched it yet."

","Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies is a Cold War drama set in the early 1960's. The movie is crowded with stories that all crash into each other. Sadly, they never generate any real drama. How could the man who made Jaws come to give us movies that have about as much drama as an election for President in Russia.<br/><br/>The movie starts by showing us a guy painting a self portrait. Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance, recently of Wolf Hall fame). is a very unlikely spy, seemingly a simple man engrossed in his work as a painter. When he is arrested, James Donovan (Tom Hanks), an insurance defense attorney, a 'common man' type who lives in Brooklyn with his wife and children, is picked by the Bar Association to represent the suspected Russian spy. Out of the blue so to speak, we are told the story of Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), the pilot of a US spy plan shot down while over the USSR. Powers is taken prisoner by the Soviets.<br/><br/>Gee, I wonder how these dots are going to get connected?<br/><br/>Donavan insists on giving Abel the best defense he can. In the process, he becomes as hated a figure as Abel. The trial judge, the newspapers, his friends and even his family, all try to convince him that he only has to go through the motions of representing Abel and no one expects him to get Abel acquitted because we all know he's guilty, right? Well, yes, we all do. The audience is shown from the start that Abel really is a spy so there is no suspense there. Abel's trial turns into a 'show trial' in spite of Donavan's efforts. Donavan's only success comes when he convinces the trial judge to sentence Abel to 30 years instead of the electric chair.<br/><br/>And this is where the plot connects the Powers spy plane story - the CIA wants to exchange Abel for Powers. It asks Donavan to act as negotiator because the US government does not want to get involved directly in the negotiations. Donavan accepts and heads to Berlin.<br/><br/>Now the movie could have just told us these stories and it would be a straight cold war drama - but no, its hero Donavan isn't going to just be a pawn for the CIA. So, enter a US student studying in Germany who is caught on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall on the day it is erected. It seems he is trying to save a girl he is in love with, or maybe it's just a friend - it doesn't matter because the student is just a plot device. He is arrested on charges of being a spy for a reason that will become clear.<br/><br/>Donavan, after a series of cat and mouse games with various agents of the Soviets secures the deal to release Powers, but he will not agree to it unless the student is also released. The CIA goes nuts - it wants Powers and doesn't care about the student. Donavan won't budge - he is a decent American and we all know that decent Americans are far better than their duly elected ghastly government. Pont made. Story of stupid American student understood - he is there to be rescued.<br/><br/>The screenplay was pieced together by more than one person - three or maybe two and a half - Joel and Ethan Coen were brought aboard to redo the original Matt Charman script. For this reason, the script is choppy and none of the characters is fully realized - except Donavan. What I hated about Mark Rylance in Wolf Hall was his stoical almost comatose attitude to everything that happened. In this movie, he is actually more deadpan, but his lack of concern about everything is used in the plot. On more than one tense occasion, Donavan asks his client if he is worried and Abel always answers, ""Would it help?"" It might help if Rylance moved an eyebrow once in awhile.<br/><br/>The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and could have been brought in less than 2 hours. There are lots of Spielberg 'mood shots'. The music is like listening to crème puffs oozing out their goo then exploding at the 'dramatic' points - John Williams was ill (probably indigestion listening to his own scores after Jaws) so Thomas Newman filled in as pastry conductor. There are a lot of appearances by fine actors (Alan Alda among them) who are given about as many lines as Rylance has facial expressions.<br/><br/>Keeping in character with Bridge of Spies, I am now going to do a flip and stitch in a new perspective - in spite of all the above, go see it. Tom Hanks is just so good at playing these kinds of roles that you shouldn't miss it. Not the showy stuff of Forrest Gump or Philadelphia, but the kind of roles that Henry Fonda gave us in 12 Angry Men and a host of other films. Another quietly fantastic Hanks' performance is worth the price of admission."

","It is not that common a movie absorbs you with its story, but when it does, you could feel living inside it and experience it as it goes. Tom Hanks' acting is as good as ever and Mark Rylance's performance is absolutely incredible for which he won the academy Awards for best actor in a supporting role.
It's a movie about legal confidentiality in the years of the cold war, before Berlin's wall was broken. East Germany is highly under the Soviet union's influence, and a lawyer is responsible for trading lives between US, USSR and East Germany.
It's easy to watch as the rhythm of the movie never slows down more than a few seconds. Music is adequately good for the movie, Oscar Nominated.
I've never been a fan of Coen Brothers, and I've seen many of their originals. I liked their screenplay for this movie better than the others. Steven Spielberg's patriotism once again is dominating in this movie.
So, if you are one of those people who'd enjoy watching a movie based on a true story, full of dialogues, monologues, great acting, good music, and a lot of nervousness, this is your type of movie. I deducted a few points for I'd never watch this movie again, didn't love the directing, and I think there were unnecessary exaggeration in some scenes.
However, I loved that you'll know about the situation and what is going on in many scenes just as the protagonist knows and understands: if he's waiting, you're waiting, if he's scared, you're scared, and if he's nervous about what is going to happen, you'd feel the same. The amount of empathy you'd feel for this movie's characters is very much in many scenes. Other scenes, on the contrary, somehow hard to feel any empathy.<br/><br/>All in all, watch this movie, there's a reason it's been nominated for many awards, and as much as Spielberg's involvement, the quality of production is never below a certain point which makes it, still, a good movie to enjoy and a good story to listen to."

","24 October 2015. Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance star in this amazing, intense, and compelling movie about the behind the scenes negotiations between James Donovan, a United States lawyer, and the U.S.S.R. and East Germany for the exchange of Rudolph Abel, a convicted Russian spy and Gary Powers, whose American U-2 spy plane was shot down over Russia in 1961. This mainstream movie directed by Steven Spielberg brings great cinematography, setting, and performances to build the tension, suspense through acting and script especially without action and fireworks. This is truly a big screen, big tent-pole event movie based on historic events as well as the poignant fear and importance of the human spirit in the face of a frightening, uncertain foreign world.<br/><br/>There is a pungent feeling of both dread and hope in this dark mysterious world of espionage. Bridge of Spies carries its weight of deeper psychological warfare reminiscent of John LeCarre's classic Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy (1979) or Breach (1997) and with setting a similar tone and flavor of The American (2010) or Sum of All Fears (2002) as well as a same period spy movie The Spy Who Came In From the Cold (1965) or The Russia House (1990) presenting a smaller scale, or the more broader sweep found in The Good Shepard (2006), all possessing a powerful espionage theme. This movie is riveting, capturing the visceral emotive uncertainty and fear, sometimes powerlessness, and sometimes faithful confidence that arises from an understanding the serious game being played. In addition there are some nicely timed and edited subtle humor to balance the drama occurring on screen. Overall, this is one of the best movies of the year."

","Based on a true story: In 1957, James Donovan (played by Tom Hanks) is a partner in a Brooklyn law firm who deals mostly in insurance claims. After he is assigned to defend a convicted Soviet spy, his life and mission are changed entirely.<br/><br/>Director Steven Spielberg succeeds in evoking earlier periods: Brooklyn in 1957 and Berlin in 1962. The physical atmosphere has a mood of its own in each city. These evocations are well aided by the cinematography of Janusz Kaminski.<br/><br/>The beginning is rather good but is occasionally predictable even to those of us not aware of the historical events. Donovan also seems too earnest and we don't fully get why he would be this way considering the danger his convictions place upon him and his family.<br/><br/>The middle of the film successfully portrays the bleakness of Berlin as the infamous wall is being built; but it tends to sag and seem overlong.<br/><br/>The final scene, which takes place in the titular location, lifts everything to make the film worthwhile. The bleak winter night is made even harsher as the tension and suspense reach their heights. Here, Spielberg shows once again what makes him great.<br/><br/>There may be an overall message: that countries with good laws must maintain those good laws to stay great, even when such countries are being threatened.

","I always find Spielberg a hit-and-miss director; for every winning thriller like MUNICH there's a piece of tat like INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL to come along and reduce the director's stature in my eyes. Thankfully, BRIDGE OF SPIES is one of his mature films, which translates into talkiness which is never boring thanks to a very strong script that recalls great Cold War thrillers like THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. Tom Hanks is once again a likeable, quick-thinking everyman who this time around is tasked with defending a Russian spy in the courts. I remember despising Mark Rylance's WOLF HALL when I attempted watching it, but Rylance is at the top of his game here and extremely likeable as the self-effacing spy. The film's true story origins means it has the ring of authenticity throughout and Spielberg admirably avoids sentimentality, instead presenting complex characters working their way through complicated situations. The end result is a film which delights from beginning to end."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>This movie's story is very linear and straightforward. The story objectives are clear as lawyer Hanks is tasked with negotiating an international exchange of a downed American pilot for a Russian spy while in Germany in the 1950's. Hanks must manage a few negotiation twists and read between the lines to keep and get leverage. The movie highlight must go to the sets and production crew. It looked and felt greatmuch like Munich. Hanks was quality as usual and the editing kept the pacing moving along at a nice clip. The best character was the Russian spy; tremendous performance. The movie could have somehow added more tension or emotion or to help me care for the character's outcomes. Overall, a very solid movie without causing much cognitive effort."

","I thought Bridge of Spies was a well made period drama. I really enjoy that Spielburg takes efforts to make you feel like you are in the fifties in this one. The cars, the style, and even the authentic train Hanks rode to work made it excellent. I enjoy period pieces, they are more engrossing when the environment around the actors seems to match the era they are supposed to be in. The little touches were great.<br/><br/>I found, like another reviewer, this movie to be more humorous than I expected as well. I really liked Abel's repeated ""Would it help?"" to comedic effect. This was a well written drama by the Coen brothers as well. The combination of the Coen's writing with Spielburg's vision was great. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks is fantastic in this movie as he usually is. I am a big fan of Tom Hanks, he has always been very versatile. Here he plays a lawyer tapped to defend a suspected Russian spy in court, and negotiate the return of captured Americans in exchange for the spy. Hanks does well with these types of roles. <br/><br/>There isn't a lot of action in this movie, but there is still an excellent Spielburgian action sequence. The movie moves along fairly quickly for such a long movie, and that is no small feat, as some of the material is pretty dry. This movie could have been much more boring than it was, the story was told well. I am a huge Spielburg fan, like many movie fans, and he does a great job again. The cinematography from Spielburg's regular team was excellent.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this movie, and I am not generally a fan of spy movies. I find spy movies boring sometimes, even ones with great action sequences. This movie is a well made period drama, that should satisfy fans of the Coen brothers, Tom Hanks, and Steven Speilburg. Check it out if you like biographical period dramas. 8/10"
"rscafanever","7","0","0","21 October 2016"," Enjoyable cold war drama
","(Spoiler in the last paragraph) Inspired by true events, the film turns the events in a nice story. An insurance lawyer first defends a caught Soviet spy, and then helps to arrange an exchange with an US spy in the middle of the cold war.<br/><br/>The main achievement of the movie is that it turned the events into a credible, substantial and enjoyable story. It's easy to feel involved into the different players. The subplots all have a decent ending. Screenplay is good, light and sound convincing. Tension is always playing in the background, until the very end.<br/><br/>Another strong point is the depiction of the beginning of the cold war. For example, the scenes at the wall dividing Berlin show well a part of history that is easily forgotten. Also, how society was organised in the early 1960s. In certain scenes, you wonder: was it really like that? The research team made a really good effort there.<br/><br/>The actors act at different levels: Mark Rylance plays the soviet spy, with an outstanding performance rewarded with an Oscar. Tom Hanks has his strong moments, but the CIA agent was a little disappointing, just like some other supporting actors.<br/><br/>The good, easy-to-understand story sometimes reveals its weaknesses: a lack of depth, a focus on story instead of history, and occasional corniness.<br/><br/>However, it's still a good movie to watch and to be entertained with. <br/><br/>Spoiler alert: One questions still remains. At the end, when they're waiting for the signal that the economics student is released, the CIA agent on the phone might have faked that the student was released. So the lawyer would agree to swap only the Soviet spy for the American, since the student wasn't important for the CIA."

Other than that is a great movie and very entertaining for a two hour feature with people talking all the time, it may seem like a boring political movie, but in fact has a nice pace (slow at times) with some light jokes to ease the mood, and Mr Hanks never disappointing what he has to show his acting skills, just don't expect many spies in this movie."

","Bridge of Spies is a good picture in general. It issues the most severe era of cold war. Even if you're not interested in political history, (I study history of politics that's why i especially liked it) I believe it'll take your interest as well. It also adapts the era's historical events into the script in a good way. In my opinion, all those historical events are so significant that all we have to be at least familiar with. I want to specially mention about Mark Rylance as well. He shows a brilliant acting even tough he doesn't show up throughout all the movie. He definitely proves that why he deserves the Oscar.<br/><br/>Beside all these good aspects of the movie, of course there are some bad sides too. Spielberg is using some 'unnecessary' tricks to demonstrate the events in another way unlike the real events. Unfortunately, these things overshadow the movie and he is making an obvious propaganda again. I also suggest you to read the history after watching it. <br/><br/>In overall, it is a nice movie that you will not regret."

","I'm not sure what caused me to pick up ""Bridge of Spies"" when I found a Blu-ray copy of it at my library, since its length and the fact that it had Tom Hanks (an actor who usually gives me annoyance) seemed to be obstacles. But I'm glad I did. While the movie is long (140 minutes), credit director Steven Spielberg for making the package chug along fairly briskly, while at the same time showing that the world of espionage in real life is often a lot of work and not flashy business. The acting is also pretty good; even I had to admit that Tom Hanks does a pretty good job here, giving his character a kind of everyman feel that gives him sympathy.<br/><br/>The only real flaw that the movie has is that it doesn't go into depth enough with some key details - namely the backstory of both Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and American pilot Francis Gary Powers. Now, I actually knew a lot about their real life stories before watching the movie, so I was able to fill in the blanks. But I suspect most viewers will know little to nothing about both men before watching the movie, so they may be scratching their heads every so often. However, I will admit devoting more time to these real life individuals may have made the movie overlong. So you may want to research both individuals before watching this movie."

Donovan. There is an arrest of a suspected Russian spy and the government asks Donovan to be his defense lawyer, allegedly to show the world that even a suspected spy would get proper due process. But it was clear (at least the way this script is written) that all that was wanted was a quick conviction.<br/><br/>A critical move was to talk the judge into giving the spy a life sentence instead of death, he reasoned that maybe the spy would eventually talk, but even if he didn't maybe there would be a future opportunity to use him in an exchange.<br/><br/>That opportunity came in the early 1960s when Powers was flying a high- altitude U2 photo mission over Russia but was shot down. After that the government asks Donovan to try to negotiate a prisoner swap, to get Powers back. This required him to travel to East Germany as the Berlin wall was being constructed. <br/><br/>There is a lot of tension and close calls but the mission is accomplished, also with the release of a young 25-yr-old student who did nothing wrong but was studying Economics in Germany.<br/><br/>Surely there are some things fabricated but overall it is a nicely entertaining movie based on real people and real events."

","Bridge of Spies is an excellent movie. It is based on a true story and showcases the tumultuous political intricacies that are involved in espionage. Although it is based in the past and espionage has no doubt undergone massive change the political aspects of espionage always remain extremely delicate. There is no doubt that situations can be resolved or escalate depending on the actions of a few men. Tom Hanks is truly excellent as the 'standing man'. He is a straight down the middle man who believes in his country's constitution and believes in justice. He is prepared to stand up for it at any cost. He is the movie's hero and is wisely understated as so rather than over celebrated. His performance should have stole the show however Mark Rylance (who I had never encountered before) gives a truly memorable performance as Rudolf Abel. He is indifferent in the face of danger and resigned to playing his part as a pawn in a bigger game. Every moment he is on screen is true acting brilliance, and mesmerizing to watch. As in many espionage thrillers there are a few twists and turns right up until the end. This movie makes you think about the real life people who have put everything on the line for something bigger. People who know how it could end but carry on regardless in service of their country. People who carry out the dirty work of bigger powers and may never have been remembered for it. If a movie can make you think like that then it has done it's job and then some."

They made the most of their material, and I was surprised to discover that the events in the movie were closer to the truth than I had suspected to be the case.<br/><br/>Filmmakers are notorious for making up events to spice up a true story (as in The Imitation Game), but in The Bridge of Spies they didn't need to – there was enough to work on.<br/><br/>It is unclear to this reviewer whether Gary Powers deliberately opted not to take the poison pill.The CIA instructed him to take it if he was in danger of being captured. Was it an accident or a circumstance of misfortune? <br/><br/>Now I come to the controversial part of my review.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies is an entertaining film and I was very happy to watch it in my own home. It certainly doesn't need a big cinema screen and I would put it on a par with any number of excellent 'made for TV movies' that have been released in recent years. If it had been made for TV, I am quite sure it would have picked up a truckload of Emmys.<br/><br/>But an Oscar nomination for 'best picture'? Sorry, but I just don't see it. It is no better than the likes of ""The spy who came in from the cold"" or ""The Ipcress file"" or many other fine films set in the cold war, spy genre. (and none of these won any Oscars)<br/><br/>The difference is that this one was directed by Spielberg and starred Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>It would seem that The Oscar academy works in weird and wonderful ways, especially when black actors are concerned. I'm not sure about this year's black acting candidates, but last year it was a travesty that Selma was all but ignored by the academy.<br/><br/>( Selma – now there was a great film that could have proudly gone down in history as Best Picture instead of the execrable Birdman, which nobody went to see except ""insider luvvies"".)"

This was my benchmark when I decided to spend almost 2.5 hours in front of screen; I had some vacillations as the Americans tend to approach European events and characters in a different manner we are used to. Luckily, it was not the case here - European venues seemed authentic, German characters spoke/were German, there was no black-and-white approach regarding ""us vs. them"", etc. And as the plot is based on true characters and events, then realism prevails, and artistic exaggerations just ensure more spirited and dynamic course of events, diminishing aridity usually so characteristic to Cold War spy movies. Thus, the main ideas of justice vs. fairness and legality vs. humanity were skilfully moved to the surface. <br/><br/>As for performances, they are good as well, particularly Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan and Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel; unlike many other movies with Hanks' starring, he does not dominate here, he is not evidently ""better"" (= so more famous) than his co-stars. And just today, Mark Rylance obtained his first Academy Award. Congratulations!<br/><br/>PS Only last fall, my country experienced a similar event: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksei_Dressen"
"martijn-56","8","0","0","30 January 2016"," 'It is a bloody good story' (quoted by Spielberg), but alas not told from the much more urgent present times
","I gave this movie an 8 for how it showed simply a good cold war thriller. It had the cold war tension between the US and USSR, played out in the divided Berlin, both East and West. Beautifully filmed as a British costume drama, I also liked how Tom Hanks's character provided some inner tension in how his look on justice for all, even for spies, had consequences for both himself as his family. What is surprising though is that Spielberg confirmed in a BBC interview he had no political message in this one. That is curious to say the least, with all the abundant contemporary parallels like Snowden for Abel in the story, or drones for the U2 back then. His reply was 'it is just a bloody good story'. Sure, but a story that makes America look good, in 2015, a time when he could have made a political thriller that could have given us a much more balanced view of reality we see today, with the US spying on everyone. The result would then have been much more powerful and less preachy. His choice is all the more peculiar, since he did not shy away showing us uncompromising battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan, but perhaps it was also helping us realize that was indeed a deserved accolade for what America has done for the world. Spielberg is, as IMDb says, indeed one of the most influential figures of cinema, and he deserves this for his many film making qualities as also this movie shows us again. I just wish with aging he would also have the guts to be like Shakespeare, to allow the arguable greatness of the US to shine through all the flaws it surely has like any country. But, to stick with Spielberg, if you just go for the story alone, and you don't mind the propaganda of the US being the ultimate example of the Good of the Free World, then this beautifully adapted film is entertaining enough."

","Brilliant and amazing film! Forget films based on John Le Carré's novels. It is a different approach about stories related to spies. Totally different, indeed! In the height of the Cold War, the inspiring and true story of the man who kept his commitment with the Law and the Democracy - precisely the political regime based on the Law - , even with risks for his career, his own life and the lives of his whole family, in his own country. The sequel of the Hanks' character during his speech to the Supreme Court is simply memorable! It reminds me Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck's performance) and the Lt Colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino's performance). In my opinion, this film deserves at least the Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Screenplay (Charman add Coen Bros.), Best Film, Best Director (Spielberg), Best Actor (Hanks) and Best Supporting Actor (Rylance). A high level entertainment! A fair tribute to the seventh art and to the politics we wish see prevail."

","I had the privilege of going to view the new Stephen Spielberg drama ""Bridge of Spies"" on it's opening night in Australia on 22nd October 2015. I sat in my armchair premium seating at the theater and went on an intriguing ride. This is historical drama at it's best, directed by the master of the craft Stephen Spielberg starring Tom Hanks as the lead character ""James Donovan"", who does a splendid job in a role suited to him, just an ordinary everyday honest man that has to do the extraordinary. This is not an action film but a true historical drama told with suspenseful story telling and wit. Many of scenes were shot in the actual places in Germany were the true events took place which added to realism. You can feel the American paranoia and intrigue at a time when the world stood closer to blowing itself up in a nuclear holocaust than it ever has been, it has clever plot turns and twists and maintains an easy to follow story that at times has you on the edge of your seat. This is a movie for intelligent people who want realistic entertainment that does not require ""suspension of disbelief"", its just plain old fashioned good story telling and comes highly recommended, it is Academy Award winning material."
"ryanmark-57919","10","3","8","22 October 2015"," This Film is Flawless
","Is there really any danger of this film being bad when you have talent like Steven Spielberg directing and the Coen brothers writing? When you combine these three with the absolutely phenomenal cast and an interesting story then I could probably just tell you guys to go out and give it a watch and be done with it. The rest of this post is basically going to be me talking about how incredibly good this movie is so I definitely recommend everyone give it a shot.<br/><br/>The story focuses on an insurance lawyer named James Donovan (Tom Hanks) in 1950s America. The Cold War is just getting into full swing and the whole country is on edge because of a possible war with the Soviet Union. The US and the USSR are constantly spying on one another and looking to find the spies in their midst. Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), a Soviet spy in America, has just been caught and the government wants Donovan to defend him, or at least put on a show of defending him. Little do they know that Donovan takes his job and morals very seriously and will bend over backwards to try to help everyone depending on him. Things soon get even more complicated when the Soviets shoot down an American spy plane and capture the pilot. Donovan has his work cut out for him.<br/><br/>I mentioned before that the cast is excellent and some of these names will probably speak for themselves. Tom Hanks practically embodies his characters and I can't think of a single moment when he's given us a poor performance. This movie is no exception. Donovan is a quick talking lawyer but has an extremely strong sense of morality and truly goes out of his way to help everyone around him. Rylance's Abel also has very strong convictions but he's an enemy spy so the majority of the American people really don't want anything good to happen to him. Rylance portrays this character quite well and very calmly. Abel doesn't get bent out of shape for anything and he shows more fear over what might happen to Donovan than he does for himself. Everyone does a fantastic job but the film really centers around these two and they carry the movie beautifully.<br/><br/>Spielberg films are always gorgeous to look at and this movie is no exception. The transition between the US and East Germany is great and really goes to show just what the country was going through at this time. East Germany is full of crumbling architecture and is obviously pretty deep in poverty. The scenes in the US look like paradise compared to what the East Germans are going through. I also like the differences in the depiction of the prisons in the US, USSR, and East Germany. I don't want to spoil too much but let's just say that prison in the US is a cakewalk compared to the others.<br/><br/>One of the best things this film does is to portray the characters in shades of gray rather than force an actual bad guy onto us. There is no antagonist here. Donovan is negotiating with people that are technically enemies of the United States government but they're not his personal enemies and they certainly don't want to start a war. That's the important thing to remember here and helps to explain how Donovan was able to negotiate as well as he did. No one wants to start a war, at least not anyone that's sane. The Soviets in the film are portrayed as an obstacle that Donovan must overcome and convince but it's obvious that they don't want a war anymore than anyone else. It's great that both sides have characters that we can root for and against.<br/><br/>I'm going to keep this short since I can't think of a single complaint to say about this film. It's beautifully directed, very well acted, and the story is interesting. The dialogue is also intelligent and even witty at times. Maybe I'll think of something later but as it stands now this movie, at least in my opinion, is flawless. That being said, historical films aren't for everyone, but for those of you that get into this kind of movie, do yourself a favor and give this one a watch. It's really an excellent film."

Spielberg proves many if not most American law enforcement and military officers, prosecutors, judges, and lawmakers perjure themselves when they take their oaths of office to live at U.S. taxpayer expense. Crooked FBI and CIA agents, prosecutors, judges, and cops abound in Spielberg's BRIDGE OF SPIES. All of them apparently had their fingers crossed behind their backs when they were sworn into their offices, thinking that they will ""uphold the Constitiution"" only when it's convenient and profitable to themselves to do so, treating it like toilet paper whenever it conflicts with their personal agendas, profit motives, idiosyncratic belief structures, or if they feel a sudden urge to enjoy an ""opposite day"" at the Constitution's expense (not unlike most of the officials depicted in the current release, BLACK MASS). I say, cut the hypocrisy now! Things have gotten much worse in America since 1957, when the BRIDGE OF SPIES story begins.

"paul-allaer","7","3","8","17 October 2015"," Spielberg playing it safe and ""Bridge of Spies"" feels strangely subdued
","""Bridge of Spies"" (2015 release; 141 min.) brings the story of how insurance lawyer Jim Donovan became involved in negotiating a prisoner exchange in Berlin between the US and the USSR. As the movie opens, we are told that it is ""1957, the height of the cold war"". We then follow someone in Brooklyn, who after a long chase sequence gets arrested for spying for the Russians. In order to make it look like the spy is getting due process and a ""fair shake"", the US government appoints a lawyer to represent him. Turns out to be NY insurance lawyer (and ex-Nurnberg assistant prosecutor) Jim Donovan. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest in series of historical ""inspired by true events"" movies from director Steven Spielberg, this time directing from a script by Matt Charman, Ethan Coen and Joel Coen (yes, THE Coen brothers). I had seen the trailer a number of times, and was expecting a riveting movie in line with earlier historical movies from Spielberg such as Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, and Munich. Alas, it was not to be. The movie lacks any tension whatsoever, and has the feeling of having been done strictly ""by the numbers"". The best scenes are when we get to Berlin, in the frantic days as the wall was being completed and people were desperate to get out of East Berlin. And the of course the climax of the movie, filmed on the real bridge of spies (the Glienicke Bridge in Berlin, near Potsdam--I had the good fortune of visiting this site a few years ago, it gave me the chills walking on it). There are several noteworthy acting performances: Tom Hanks (in his 4th cooperation with Spielberg) as Jim Donovan, and Mark Rylance as the spy Rudolf Abel (great line: Donovan: ""you're not worried?"", to which Abel responds: ""would it help?"", ha!). As always with Spielberg, the production is terrific and authentic in to the smallest of details. Last but certainly not least: the orchestral score is, shockingly, NOT by John Williams, which I believe marks the first time in 40 years in a Steven Spielberg (the score is from Thomas Newman, who does a fine job). Bottom lime: I found ""Bridge of Spies"" strangely subdued and to me it feels like Spielberg played it safe in this one.<br/><br/>""Bridge of Spies"" opened nationwide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay, but frankly I had expected a lot more people, given this is the movie's opening weekend. I have seen most of Spielberg's movies and as a long-time fan, must admit this to me feels like one of the weaker movies he's done in a long time. Is it bad? Of course not, but neither is it great. Nevertheless, this is of course a personal and subjective view, and I would encourage you to check out ""Bridge of Spies"", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions."
"jmoneyjohal","9","3","8","16 October 2015"," A true story about an American lawyer trying to uphold, true American values during the cold war. Another masterpiece by Spielberg, and one of the years best films!!!
","Every life matters, we see Tom Hanks character, James Donovan repeat this dialogue again, and again, and not till the tear dropping climax do we realize why he says this. Bridge of Spies is probably my personal favorite film of the year, The combo of Director Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have made another masterpiece, this being there fourth collaboration. Both create an absolutely moving,inspiring, and tear jerking film. Spielberg is just pure genius, he is like a gift from the film gods, and Hanks gives another Oscar worthy act. Spielberg with the Bridge of Spies, promotes American nationalism, and pride in a very worthy way, he doesn't spread propaganda that we see in films like American sniper. He shows, that all American lives matter, that a man who upholds the American constitution for ever person whether they be a spy or not is the real American hero. One who follows orders like a robot is not always correct aka CIA agents. Spielberg also shows how American children where feed false fear mongering information/propaganda to instill fear for a enemy who wasn't there, they just wanted to make American Nationalists. But more on that later. In short Mr Spielberg and Mr Hanks get ready for the Oscars.<br/><br/>Story wise the film is about an Insurance lawyer based in Brooklyn New York named James Donavan, who is given a criminal case after years to defend a soviet spy during the cold war between the US and the USSR. The case is a open and shut one, the American government is ready to hang the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, but James is not going to let that happen, he wants to defend his client properly by upholding the American constitution.Even though he is found guilty in all counts of the charges against him, James somehow negotiates with the Judge to give him life in jail, and not the death sentence. While the CIA follows James for info on Abel, he goes to Supreme Court to get a retrial, he fails but a opportunity comes out nowhere. The soviets have captured a American pilot, Gary Powers who was spying in Soviet skies for the CIA and they want exchange him for Abel. The CIA send James to negotiate the deal in Germany (no mans land), where a civil war in ensuing. What happens next is what forms the rest of the plot.<br/><br/>Acting wise Tom Hanks is at it again with another masterful act, he makes the character his own, and leaves you in awe. The climax scene when he is watching Abel getting shoved in the back seat of a Soviet car, is pure genius and evokes tears. Mark Rylance is brilliant as the Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel. The rest of the cast are good in there respected roles.<br/><br/>Bridge of the Spies is based on a true story, and Spielberg makes sure he tells the story as true as possible. He shows the good, bad and ugly side of America during the cold war, the film has no biases at all. He shows a man upholding the American constitution for an Soviet Spy, and he also shows how American children were feed false info to be made American Nationalistic robots. He showed how the CIA had there own agenda, and didn't necessarily care about American lives. The American stance against Germany during the Berlin Wall (East and West Germany)is also shown .In short Spielberg has got his facts almost 100% correct. And in a film like this that is of utmost importance. He doesn't take his audience for granted. He instead shows a powerful, moving drama, about one man trying to save American lives during the cold war. At many instance Bridge of Spies will leave you laughing,stunned, and in the climax you will be moved in tears. The films is an emotional journey of a true American hero James B. Donavan, who went from the most hated man in the USA, to an American hero. He is an American hero, and even I salute you good sir. This is the one of the most accurate, and positive films made on American history. The film is technically sound, its shot beautifully through America, and Germany in the 60s era, and the BGM is excellent. Kudos to the Cohen brothers for writing a brilliant screenplay and script. For me the film has no blemishes, but viewers may be for warned Bridge Of Spies is no flashy, no brainier entertainer, its a film made for a mature audience, who relish good cinema.<br/><br/>Overall Bridge of Spies is nothing short of a masterpiece, Spielberg does it again and his resume and Oscars speak for themselves, but he proves his worth again, with this moving tale. In short if you want to see one of the years best films, don't wait,run to the theaters.<br/><br/>4.5/5* or 9.3/10"
"TheFirstExecutioner","9","2","5","28 February 2016"," Spielberg's Latest Outing in Style
","Bridge of Spies is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks, which is the best director-actor duo in history in my opinion. Once again, Tom Hanks is so good as a lawyer who has to defend a Soviet spy during the Cold War. But probably the best performance was Mark Rylance, the man who played the Soviet spy, and he certainly deserves an Oscar nomination. The cinematography is so beautiful and Spielberg perfectly captures the world in 1957.<br/><br/>Most of this movie is conversations between Hanks and others during negotiations or court room scenes. A lot of people can be turned off by this, claiming it's ""too boring."" But if you like drama with a lot of intrigue about history, you will be engrossed in Bridge of Spies. It is a slow and long movie, so you have to be patient while watching. However, there is a fantastic scene with an airplane that brings energy into the movie.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies is certainly not one of Spielberg's masterpieces, but it is still a great movie on its own. Bridge of Spies gets an A."
"nmholland","9","2","5","27 February 2016"," Adding To Spielberg's Amazing Collection Is....
","Bridge of Spies is directed Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks as James Donovan, an American lawyer that, in Cold War era 1957, is chosen to defend a captured Soviet spy named Rudolf Adel (Mark Rylance) in a court of law. He later is selected to negotiate a swap of sorts to trade Mr. Adel to the Soviets in exchange for an imprisoned American pilot, Francis Powers (Austin Stowell). This film is based off of a true story, and is truly one of the best films of 2015. I'm glad it's nominated for best picture.<br/><br/>The best thing this movie offers is the directing. Very few films are directed perfectly, and this is absolutely one of them. The camera angles Spielberg utilizes are fantastic, and his ability to capture a whole conversation in just one shot is magnificent. The cinematography is also great. The cinematographer (Janusz Kamiński) did amazing at capturing the Cold War era, and the flips in between Germany and the United States are very distinguishable and impressive.<br/><br/>On the contrary, the movie is long, and has about 2% rewatchability. Much like Spielberg's 1993 film, Schindler's List, the movie is a one or two time watch, and may be a two hour-thirty minute snooze-fest for action lovers. Anybody who comes to this movie expecting James Bond espionage will surely have a good nap. However, a film lover and admirer of the art of cinema will be on the edge of his seat.<br/><br/>The acting is also great. Tom Hanks gives an amazing performance, as always, yet not very memorable, unlike Forrest Gump or Captain Miller (Saving Private Ryan). His character won't be remembered in twenty years or so, no matter the status that the film ascertains. However, Mark Rylance gives the performance of his career. Besides Stallone, Rylance is most qualified to acquire the Oscar. The only performance I really had a problem with was that of Amy Ryan in the role of Mary Donovan (James' wife). She didn't exactly do bad, but her ability to portray her disagreement with her husband in dealing with his defense of a Soviet spy.<br/><br/>The main problem I had with this movie is everything having to do with the American spy, throughout the first 45 minutes or so of the film. It takes away from the intensity going on with Hanks' and Rylance's characters. Every time something suspenseful was happening, the film would switch over to Power's side of the story, which wasn't too interesting. His scenes were directed well, and acted well, so the blame goes to the jumpy script, although the Coen brothers (yeah, they wrote a serious movie) ultimately did well once the second act rolled around, and lifted the film up pretty high.<br/><br/>The last thing I'll mention is the score. This is the first Spielberg movie in many years that is not composed by John Williams, and it shows. However, that's not a bad thing. This film has a really good score, and keeps the suspense up, in a style Williams doesn't often use. Not to criticize Williams; he's the best film composer working today, but the score is captured beautifully by Thomas Newman, this film adding to his collection of many other great films he's scored, such as The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and American Beauty (1999).<br/><br/>Overall, Bridge of Spies is a great movie with a few nitpicky problems here and there. The acting is good, the script is good, and the directing is flawless. I'm going to give Bridge of Spies an A-, or a 9 out of 10."

I'm glad I rented this film and watched it at home and did not waste my money by seeing it in a theater.

There was nothing wrong with this movie as everybody acted well and Spielberg as usual directed a well deserved Oscar winning Thriller film. However the plot was too slow and I was feeling sleepy while watching. The story involves only on one thing, exchange between countries which I felt too dumb.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","5","18 December 2015"," Solid political thriller
","""Bridge of Spies"" is the newest Steven Spielberg movie as of 2015 and once again Tom Hanks plays the main character in here. I was particularly curious about this film because I knew they were shooting here about a year ago and there is a lot of German background as the final crucial scene takes place here in Berlin. It is a pretty solid film by the books. Hanks is rock-solid as always and carries this film nicely, even if I would not go so far and say he is among the best performances this year. But he is not getting too much awards attention really, so it's fine I guess. The one getting tons of awards recognition is Mark Rylance, who is even considered a possible Academy Award winner in the supporting category. I thought he was decent, but I am not so sure if he was really that outstanding.<br/><br/>Back to the film and away from the performances, this film is a decent watch for everybody with an interest in films about politics. It is set during the Cold War when a Russian spy gets caught and there is an exchange with an American soldier who was held captive in Russia. Most of the film is actually the preparation for this exchange and even the trial of Abel (the Russian spy played by Rylance), in which he faces the death penalty. In my opinion, the film was a bit sterile at times. I never felt any real emotions watching this. So it's not a bad film at all, but I felt the topic could have been dealt with maybe with a more personal approach. Spielberg's direction left me unattached mostly. It was interesting, yes, but I never felt really involved at any point and that is quite a shame as the topic certainly offers material of great emotion as well. Then again, this is a problem that is the case with many Spielberg films in my opinion, but that is just personal perception. I vaguely knew about the exchange, but I'm sure most Americans and non-Germans probably don't, especially the younger generation, which makes it even more informative.<br/><br/>Finally, I recommend this movie. I am not too sure how accurate everything we see is and I am sure there are lots of additions for dramatic purpose, but that's not a problem at all. All films have such. And in the end, there is a reference about the main character's negotiations with Fidel Castro, which alone could be material enough for a complete film. I recommend watching ""Bridge of Spies"", even if it's nowhere near my personal favorites from 2015."
"davidgee","8","2","5","9 December 2015"," Tom Hanks, a 'warhorse' like Jimmy Stewart
","The role of James Donovan would have gone to Jimmy Stewart in years gone by and Hanks brings that same 'warhorse' integrity to the role: a man of modest intellect bringing more to his duties than was demanded or expected of him. Mark Rylance has a more challenging role, since Rudolph Abel is given very little back story, but as Donovan slowly warms to this cold enigmatic man, so do we, the audience. The trial scenes are inevitably slow and static, like their equivalents in LINCOLN and AMISTAD, but when events move to Germany this becomes as enthralling as anything else maestro Spielberg has brought us. Berlin in 1961 - a seamless mixture of set and CGI, presumably - is almost the real star of the movie, grim and oppressive: we see the Wall being built and some heart-wrenchingly desperate escapes. <br/><br/>BRIDGE OF SPIES is history, with only a little jazzing-up (and some condensing of the time-line), so we know how it's going to end, but Spielberg and Hanks manage to generate terrific tension in the final scenes. This whole picture is a chilling reminder of the darkest period in East-West relations, hopefully never to be repeated."

In return for downed U2 pilot Gary Powers, (and an unfortunate American student detained in East Berlin), the Americans agreed to hand over convicted Soviet KGB spy Rudolf Abel, the physical exchange of the actual spies taking place on Glienicke Bridge (hence the title of the movie echoing that other bridge in Venice).<br/><br/>This is a great role for Hanks who plays the kind of decent American that is rare in the movies these days, an amicable lawyer who is willing to offer Abel a legal defence and gives a CIA operative a mini-lecture on the need to honour ""the rule book"" that is the US Constitution. <br/><br/>In effect, Donovan is the bridge between Abel and Powers and the film cleverly tells the spies'stories in parallel - two dedicated state servants who become lonely prisoners whose only physical connection is a few seconds passing one another on a snowy bridge without a word exchanged between them. Abel is played by the outstanding British actor Mark Rylance who, as he did in his portrayal of Thomas Cromwell on BBC television, ushers a laconic, wry and understated persona (although his accent rather wanders).<br/><br/>It is a tribute to the sharp (and sometimes amusing) script - co-authored by British dramatist Matt Charmian - that, although we know how the mission will end, it is still a gripping tale. Thanks to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, the film looks good with a lot of attention to period detail, but there are a couple of contemporary political messages here. <br/><br/>The first is clear: in the face of a war (whether the cold war or the war on terror), we should not abandon our ""rulebook"" (that is, our protection of liberty). The other message might be unintentional: just as the East Germans build a wall and fortifications to prevent their citizens from seeking freedom and prosperity in the West, so Europe today - but notably not Germany itself - is erecting fences to present Syrian and other refugees from their efforts to flee another form of totalitarian rule."

","The height of the Cold War, the late 1950s, was a time of anti-Communist hysteria fueled by Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communist crusade and only four years after Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted and executed for providing atomic secrets to the Russians. While it may seem anachronistic to make a film about the Cold War, the points made in Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies are just as relevant today. Like Spielberg's Lincoln, it is a film about values, about standing up for what you know to be right instead of succumbing to your fears, not an examination of the rights and wrongs of international intrigue or the merits or demerits of the Cold War. <br/><br/>Co-written by the Coen Brothers and Matt Charman, insurance lawyer James Donovan, (Tom Hanks), is called upon by his boss (Alan Alda) to defend Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), a defense that would thwart a public opinion calling for his summary execution. In attempting to mount a defense, Donovan discovers that the government only wants him to go through the motions of due process, not to actually mount a strong case for his acquittal. Not even Donovan's family wants him to defend Abel, especially after they receive death threats and rocks are thrown through the windows. <br/><br/>In the film's opening sequence, Abel is seen painting a self-portrait in a room filled with receivers and transmitters when he is interrupted by a phone call. Leaving his building, he is pursued by federal agents in a frantic chase through streets and subways tracked by cinematographer Janusz Kaminsky. When captured in his home by the feds, the taciturn Abel in a breakout performance by Shakespearean actor Rylance maintains his calm and denies that he is a spy. All he can say is to ask that the agent to please fetch his teeth from the bathroom. Un-Communist spy-like, Abel is also given to dry humor. <br/><br/>When asked why he is so calm in the face of possible execution, he replies, ""Would it help?"" a response that is humorous and appropriate but repeated once too often in the film to maintain its edge. Though aware of the strong evidence of his client's guilt, Donovan establishes a good relationship with Abel whom he calls a man of integrity who is only serving his country. The first part of the film depicts the court proceedings, the sentencing, and Donovan's appeal to the Supreme Court on constitutional grounds, an appeal that he lost on a 5-4 decision. <br/><br/>The bulk of the film, however, takes place in Berlin where it turns into an international spy thriller, and a good one at that. The film shows the CIA's secret U2 spy plane piloted by Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) flying at 70,000 feet en route to Russia to photograph military installations when it is shot down over Russian air space. When Powers disobeys instructions from his superiors to go down with the plane and is captured by the Russians where he is imprisoned and tortured, the event torpedoes the summit meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower, dashing the world's hopes for peace. Spielberg does not hold back from showing the techniques that Powers is forced to undergo, perhaps a reference to the CIA's use of water-boarding during the Iraq War. <br/><br/>Called upon to negotiate a prisoner exchange between the Soviets and the East Germans of Powers and captured American student Frederic L. Pryor (Will Rogers) for Abel, Donovan is mugged by East German punks and stripped of his overcoat in the freezing snow, suggesting the addition of ""The Spy Who Got a Cold"" to the film's title. Anyway, coat or no coat, Donovan must maintain the ruse that he is an independent party, not an official government representative and the back and forth intrigue and chess match of opposing wills ratchets up the tension until its dramatic conclusion. Bridge of Spies strives for and achieves a refreshing balance, not gratingly pro-American or excessively anti-Soviet but a film that demonstrates the sordid nature of espionage on both sides. <br/><br/>I could complain about the unnecessary role played by Amy Ryan as Donovan's devoted wife, the ending that goes on past the film's logical dramatic stopping point, or the overwrought score by Thomas Newman, but would it help? The film is best when it makes clear what American values are supposed to be about. Donovan's argument to the Supreme Court expresses this well. ""Abel is an alien charged with the capital offense of Soviet espionage,"" he said. ""It may seem anomalous that our Constitutional guarantees protect such a man.  Yet our principles are engraved in the history and the law of the land. If the free world is not faithful to its own moral code, there remains no society for which others may hunger."" Amen, brother!"

","There are two sides two Steven Spielberg. One- Making magnanimous movies with big budget and special effects, Two- Making history come to life with classic film-making. Bridge of spies belongs to the second type. Based on true events, Bridge of Spies tells the story of American Lawyer, Jim Donovan in two parts. The first part is where he tries to do his best as a defense lawyer for the alleged Russian spy Abel and the second part where he negotiates a prisoner exchange with Russians and Germans. The film has two different flows. But, one cannot argue over the shift in the storyline as it is based on real events and it is best that Steven Spielberg has kept it that way. Very well written dialogues, subtle humour and great acting makes this movie, a masterpiece. Not too emotional, not too funny, not too dramatic this movie balances everything well.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, well there is nothing to say about him we all know he gives the best. But Rylance, with very few lines is the one who steals the show in this film. His role adds a whole new dimension to a grey character. Apart from these two characters, other roles are hardly significant. <br/><br/>If you are looking for an out and out entertainment, this movies pace might disappoint you. But this movie is for the good cinema lovers. Who loves and admires a work of art whenever they see one."
"writers_reign","8","2","5","28 November 2015"," Donovan's Riff
","This could almost be subtitled To Kill A Nightingale for what we have is no less than Tom Hanks as Atticus Finch, the ultra respectable lawyer and seemingly the only one who can be approached to defend a no-hoper in the shape of Mark Rylance, honorary Black man and, as a Russian spy in the in the heart of the Cold War as persona non grata in New York as Tom Robinson in 1930s Alabama. In a further touch of irony Gregory Peck, the personification of Atticus Finch, would have arguably been first choice to play Donovan had he still been available but Tom Hanks who, to some extent, plays Gregory Peck good-guy roles for a living, makes a creditable pinch- hitter. Whereas Atticus Finch was a fictional recreation of Harper Lee's lawyer father Donovan was a real person as was Francis Gary Powers, the pilot shot down in Russian air space who declined to kill himself rather than be captured. As comedian Mort Sahl said at the time, there have been two traitors in US history, the first was Nathan Hale who said 'I regret I have but one life to give for my country', the second was Francis Gary Powers, who said, 'this shatters all my plans'. Donovan is, of course, unable to secure a not guilty verdict for his client but he does prevail upon the court to spare him execution on the grounds that he may prove useful as a pawn in some future negotiation and when Powers is captured he is able to broker an exchange. Both Hanks and Mark Rylance turn in fine performances and for a cerebral rather than action-filled thriller the film is a success."

","Bridge of Spies marks the fourth collaboration between director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks, a relationship that has gone extremely well thus far. Both of these Hollywood icons seem to bring the best out of each other and all things were pointing towards Bridge of Spies being another winner.<br/><br/>Telling the story of James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), an insurance lawyer who, during the Cold War, is told he will be the defending Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) in court, a man believed to be a Soviet spy.<br/><br/>When the American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), is shot down and imprisoned by the Soviet Union, Donovan is then tasked with negotiating an exchange with the Soviets; Powers for Abel at a time when tensions were very high between the two nations.<br/><br/>Spielberg is my favourite director and he will go down as one of the greatest storytellers in the history of cinema. Whether he's dealing with a summer blockbuster or a lower budget drama, Spielberg finds a way for the film to connect with its audience, and Bridge of Spies is no different.<br/><br/>The sentimentality that can so often be found in a Spielberg film is usually the key component in that connection and it is ever present in Bridge of Spies, a film that depicts an event in history made possible by one honest man when some thought war was the only option.<br/><br/>There were some rewrites carried out on the script, written by Matt Charman however, when you can call upon the likes of Joel and Ethan Coen to spruce it up a bit, you know you are going to get real quality. Every word feels like it counts and there were some genuine moments where I was thinking to myself, ""Yeah, these are the words of the Coen Brothers"", with dashing of light humour sprinkled throughout.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, there were two that, unsurprisingly, stood out for me. Of course, Tom Hanks is one of them, playing the spirited Donovan with a performance full of such wit and charm that he becomes instantly likable and a character the audience will be rooting for.<br/><br/>The other is the performance from the lesser known Mark Rylance, an actor known more for his stage roles than his work in front of a camera. As accused spy Abel, Rylance shares a chemistry with Hanks that sees Donovan and Abel seem more like old friends than strangers who have just met. Spielberg was so impressed with Rylance that he offered him the lead part in his upcoming adaptation of The BFG, due next year.<br/><br/>Weirdly, for a Spielberg film, the score was not composed by John Williams, who had to drop off the project due to bad health. Thomas Newman stepped up to the plate and, while he does a fine job, his score doesn't do enough to evoke the emotions the way a score from John Williams would.<br/><br/>This isn't Spielberg showing off with a big special effects laden film, nor is it a film about spies that you may expect. Bridge of Spies is however, a riveting drama with two Hollywood icons in top form. You'd be crazy not to check it out."

","It is 1957, and commercial lawyer James Donovan is required to defend spy Rudolf Abel, which he does (unsuccessfully). When US spy pilot Gary Powers is shot down by the Russians, Donovan is called upon to negotiate an exchange, into which he factors US student Frederic Pryor in a 2-for-1 exchange. But Powers is held by the Russians and Pror is held by the East Germans, and they don't have the same agendas.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg picks up the hidden parts of a story which had disappeared under the headline value of Gary Powers Shot Down, and it turns out to be quite a small story, but displayed on a big canvas (the painting metaphor is apt, as Abel's painting forms part of the film's narrative). The film conjures up its era very well – the comfort of 1950s USA vs the grim drabness of Berlin, the USA paranoia over the red menace, the communist paranoia over everything. And, among the efficient and effective telling of the story (aided by a script touch-up from the Coen brothers), there are the usual Spielbergian directorial flourishes, primarily some wonderful moving camera shots. This is not an attractive film – post-war Berlin was not an attractive city – but it is never less than rewarding to watch.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks does a sterling job as the deceptively mild but steely Donovan, and Mark Rylance's Abel is similar to his Thomas Cromwell: a watcher and a listener, with quiet depths.<br/><br/>This is not a film full of bluster and bombast, but it is an impressive and gripping movie."
"ellscashncarry","8","2","5","24 November 2015"," Solid in all areas and does exactly what it sets out to do!
","First off I had no idea going into this film that it wasn't a traditional Spielberg/John Williams collaboration. So it is testament to Thomas Newman's sheer brilliance and style that as the credits came, the first thing I turned and said to my partner was 'I could swear this score sounds like Thomas Newman, but obviously it's Spielberg so I'd imagine it's John Williams'. In fact on viewing the credits it turned out I was right and Spielberg has collaborated with another composer for the first time in 30 years! And what a brilliant soundtrack it is! Already far and away my favourite composer it's about time Thomas Newman won an Oscar. Given that he's done Spectre as well this year, fingers crossed it's his time!<br/><br/>As for the film itself, yes the soundtrack is the best thing about the movie but that doesn't mean to say the film isn't good. It's very good, and delivered exactly what it should - a fascinating story delivered well and with solid acting performances. Hanks is great as usual and his character is brilliant! The set design is excellent and very true to the era (across 3 different countries). All in all it does exactly what it's supposed to, not ground-breaking, unlikely to be award winning, but a solid film... Think Lincoln, but more thrilling, less 'dull historic scenes'. One thing's for sure, it's certainly a step up from War of the Worlds!"

","Amidst the megahits of Q4 (is winter the new summer?) comes this quiet sleeper from Steven Spielberg. It's a chamber piece defined by soft words and silent gestures. Even the true story upon which it's based is a relatively unseen bit of history. Although it's such an interesting story, you wonder why.<br/><br/>You've seen the big beats in the trailer. But this is a movie of details as tiny as the secret messages that unshakeable Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) receives on the sly. He's captured and fast-tracked through the American justice system. Insurance lawyer Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks) represents him, but he's powerless against a guilty-by-default verdict.<br/><br/>Then the Ruskies capture a US spy and an American student. As a US citizen ostensibly representing no one but his clients, Donovan is bunged off to a divided Berlin to negotiate a swap: one Russian for two Americans. The devil's in the detail – and, as Donovan discovers, there are so many damned details.<br/><br/>Spielberg is cinema's top craftsman. We know this. But he does little here to draw attention to that consummate skill – and I mean that as a compliment. The ""quiet camera"" of Lincoln continues. And as a story it's as much a humanitarian one as Lincoln, although the script here (sharpened up by the Coen brothers, who are presumably to thank for the plentiful ironic humour) is less labyrinthine, less grandiose. More on-the-nose.<br/><br/>So is Thomas Newman's music, sadly, which sounds like one imagines a Spielberg movie should be scored, all sugary clarinet softness. It jars with the austere Cold War mood and only really making sense in the final scenes, where a creeping schmaltz lurks. The Lives of Others this ain't.<br/><br/>That's not to belittle the human emotion the film possesses, which is mostly convincing. Abel's ""standing man"" speech is a keeper. But beyond that, Bridge of Spies is a film of Big Themes: what nationality means; what professional duty means; and the arbitrariness of national borders. Donovan is genuinely baffled by the hypocrisy of his superiors, regarding Abel as merely a human being doing a job – the same job many US spies are asked to do.<br/><br/>Rylance, subtle and dignified, is a shoe-in for a Supporting Actor gong. Hanks, meanwhile, makes it look effortless, somehow forging a relatable everyman out of an iron-nosed lawyer. These are actors at the top of their game.<br/><br/>Intense, involving, and intelligent: if you're looking for something patient and quietly moving at the multiplex, look no further. It might look like minor Spielberg, but it's a major dramatic success."

","The stand out performances of Hanks and Rylance earns this film an 8/10 and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.<br/><br/>However, I couldn't help coming away feeling like this strayed a little too far into a lesson in American patriotism and the idea that no matter what, the American Constitution will see you through. I have no issue with a good bit of patriotism to warm the cockles of your heart, but it came at the expense of any kind of tension!<br/><br/>I'll admit that it being a true story didn't help - though I didn't know any details, it was clear this was a celebration of an American hero so it could hardly have ended with anything particularly gruesome. However, even in the moments where my heart should have been beating out of my chest, all I could think was ""nah, Tom Hanks movies always end well!""<br/><br/>Perhaps I've become desensitized by too much violence and tension in movies but this felt watered down and naming it ""Bridge of Spies"" to reference what should have been the peak dramatic moment seemed a little contrived.<br/><br/>As a celebration of a hero of the Cold War, this film is genuinely excellent and I would absolutely recommend it. As a ""Cold War spy thriller"", it falls well short."

","During the Cold War, U.S. pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is captured by the Soviet Union after his U-2 spy plane gets shot down. Sentenced to 10 years in prison, Powers' only hope is New York lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) who is recruited by the CIA to negotiate his release. Donovan then boards a plane to Berlin to try to secure Powers' freedom through a prisoner exchange. If all went according to plan, the Soviets would get Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), the convicted spy who Donovan defended earlier in court.<br/><br/>I will say that the film is not as exciting as the trailer but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. There isn't too much action or suspense as the core of this film is based on conversations between characters. The suspense comes from whether or not the people on the other side will follow through with what they say and whether or not the situation in which the characters are in the middle of, The Cold War, will have an impact on the proceedings. But what had the potential to be quite dull was not thanks to the performances of Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, the direction by Steven Spielberg, the score, and the cinematography that really captured the paranoia in that corner of the world during the Cold War. Hanks is great here as he was the only reason I saw this film. In his best role since Captain Phillips (I still think he should have been nominated for an Oscar for that one instead of Christian Bale for American Hustle). I liked him in this one because I found his character to be very endearing and very human. I also found that this went well when juxtaposed against the world he was in. Rylance, who I have never heard of before this, stole scenes as the Soviet spy Abel. He was very witty with a calm demeanour and who never let the situation get to him. He and Hanks had great chemistry which made their scenes together very entertaining. I just wish they could have had more scenes together as their storyline was only for the first quarter when Donovan defended Abel in court and a little near the end of the film during the exchange. The reason I say this is because the middle of the film was not as exciting to me since it dealt with Hanks being in Berlin during the Cold War and having his character negotiating for the release of Powers and also another prisoner Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers). These scenes were still good because of the great script by the Coen brothers and the acting by Hanks and others. They just just didn't have the same weight for me since the film chose to focus on Hanks's character Donovan instead of the characters he was trying to rescue so they came off as one- dimensional. I guess they just wanted Powers for what he knew but they still could have fleshed him out more than just in the one scene. Also it is evident that this is taking place during the Cold War but I wished I had more of a sense of that. In other words, they could have gone further with that idea as we never got to see ""how bad"" the Soviets and the Germans, who captured Pryor, were as nothing really happened to them (onscreen at least). Overall, this is just a great movie and one of Spielberg's best.<br/><br/>Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com"

","Worried but smiling, Mary Donovan sees her husband off on his secret mission to East Berlin: ""Can't you give me something to go on? I don't even care if it's not true."" As the stay at home, perky wife, Mary doesn't have much role in the action — but that line strikes to the heart of Stephen Spielberg's Bridge of Spies. As insurance lawyer James Donovan learns when he's introduced to the web of lies woven by the Russian, American and East German governments, everyone indulges each other's fictions.<br/><br/>When Donovan negotiates the exchange of Russian spy Rudolf Abel for the U2 pilot Gary Powers and a hapless American economics student taken prisoner in East Berlin, he finds layer upon layer of fiction. All the agents lie and hide. Actors are presented as Abel's family. The lawyer Vogel proves a rare bird, elusive in flight and of ambiguous power and role when finally spotted. Nobody is who they seem to be. <br/><br/>The CIA enlists Donovan as negotiator because the swap is too touchy for governments to negotiate. Only Donovan refuses to lie. Mary doesn't believe his cover — the company sending him to Europe for clients — but even to assuage her fears all he says is ""I'm doing this for us."" They go through the marmalade game to confirm her confidence. <br/><br/>The metaphor extends even further. When Donovan defends the Russian spy, when he enforces the Americans' guarantee of justice, he offends all America. Vigilante citizens shoot up Donovan's home. A cop turns against him, preferring to persecute rather than to protect him. The lawyers and judge want to present just the appearance of a fair trial — precisely what we disdain in the Russian autocracy. Donovan is totally invested in the moral principles of US justice, which the other lawyers, the judge and the embittered frightened citizens are all too willing to scuttle. Only by appealing to the judge's self-interest does Donovan manage to avoid his client's death sentence. The Golden Rule fails Donovan: Shouldn't we treat their spies as we would want them to treat ours? He wins by foreseeing the possibility of using Abel for an exchange the next time Russia catches an American spy. Pragmatism trumps principle. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks's James Donovan is what the Russian spy Abel admires as ""the standing man,"" a character so strong of will and ideals that he stands by them whatever the cost and challenge. After the swap Donovan appears standing still solid — but dwarfed by the machinery of the bridge that looms black and impersonal over him. When he finally collapses on his bed at home, exhausted, he's still in that standing pose, though splayed out horizontal. <br/><br/>The political chill of the Cold War permeates the West, as we see in the school kids' oath of allegiance and Duck and Cover drill, and in the sniffly cold that starts with Abel, overwhelms Donovan when a German gang steals his Saks Fifth Avenue overcoat, and passes on to the CIA agent. The white hanky signifies the characters' surrender to the era's paranoia, cruelty and abandonment of American values.<br/><br/>That's what makes this film about now as much as then. The film addresses the current threat, America abandoning its values in their supposed defence against a monster enemy, whether their Communism or our current bogey, radical Islam. ""There's no book of rules,"" the CIA agent tells Donovan, attempting to violate the client-lawyer relationship. There is, Donovan reminds him — the constitution. <br/><br/>Of course, the Supreme Court is split down the middle on what the constitution was intended to advance. But the principles of freedom, justice, protection of the individual, should guard against the system's corrupt pragmatism. That's the gist of Donovan's terse but resonant address to the Supreme Court. His appeal fails on the familiar 5-4 count. Bridge of Spies reminds us all of what distinguished America and made her a beacon for humanity worldwide. It also warns us how easy it is to abandon those values in the name of defending them. <br/><br/>On the train home Donovan shows a flicker of disturbance when he sees American teenagers playfully leaping over backyard high wire fences. He's remembering the young people shot dead trying to leap the Berlin Wall? He's remembering his close call when he was threatened and robbed by the East Berliners? He sees the spectre of the fascist society in America? We're reminded that however great our social and political differences, we and our enemies are equally tempted to abandon our values for expediency. That's when we indulge our own fictions, which is even more dangerous than indulging each other's."

I agree with other reviewers, it's a very entertaining film that's hard not to like. sometimes I am struck by that fact that Spielberg films often resemble Frank Capra films in that they uphold a high standard in filmmaking and don't always rely on naked characters and buckets of blood. In ""Bridge of Spies"", Tom Hanks has the Everyman role Capra used to employ. This one, in fact, is rated PG-13, which doesn't happen often in Lowest-Common-Denominator Hollywood.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks never disappoints and an argument could be made that he is America's best actor. Here he is his old self, although a few pounds heavier than in previous pictures but an idealist in the James Stewart mold.

","The name Steven Spielberg is usually enough for many people, including myself, to get excited for a movie. Throw in Tom Hanks and a script written with the help of the Coen Brothers and you have an instant must see, right? Despite all the star power in the movie, I was still a little hesitant going into the movie because a couple of Spielberg's recent efforts in the 2000's haven't been up to par for him. That being said, I exited this movie with a new-found interest in Cold War politics and its effect on the people. <br/><br/>The story Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance), an assumed Soviet spy who is captured and given to James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), an insurance lawyer, in order to give Abel a fair trial in court before sending him to the electric chair. However, on the other side of the world in the Soviet Union, one of the United States' spies is captured by the Soviets. Both countries agree to exchange the spies for each other and James Donovan is brought in once again to negotiate the swap. <br/><br/>The film does a good job at neither portraying the Soviets or Americans as the good guys and finding an unbiased standpoint between the two. Each character is portrayed expertly by their actors, but I was most impressed by Mark Rylance. Going into this movie, you already know that you are going to get a committed performance from Tom Hanks. Surprisingly, I thought that Rylance did an equal or even better job portraying Rudolph Abel. Rylance so effortlessly makes his character sympathetic and the poignant expressions and subtly in his performance is one of the best parts of this movie. Another surprising aspect of the movie was the large amount of humor. I guess I should have expected that coming from a script written by the Coen Brothers. <br/><br/>My one complaint of the film would be that the American spy captured Soviets was not developed nearly as well as Rylance in the United States. I was unsure if I was supposed to feel sympathetic because he was an American or anger because he failed to carry out his job and allowed himself to be caught. <br/><br/>Overall, Bridge of Spies is a masterfully crafted Cold War thriller with Spielberg beautifully showing the audience what he does best when at the helm. This is most definitely not a film for everyone, but those who appreciate an old-fashioned Hollywood thriller will find much enjoyment in the film.<br/><br/>""You're not worried?""

"r_tripleus","9","2","5","22 October 2015"," It is a John LeCarré movie
","Had somebody told me if it was LeCarré and not Steven Spielberg, I would have believed it. Steven Spielberg is a great storyteller, but LeCarré, well for me, is the pinnacle for anything to do with spy & espionage. With that being said, this movie doesn't fall under spy or espionage category. The story is more towards realpolitik. It was the spy who reminded me about all those characters from LeCarré novels. <br/><br/>The partnership between Stephen Spielberg & Tom Hanks has always provided brilliant narratives. Tom Hanks, as always is brilliant. James Donovan is s New York lawyer, a family man. A very satisfying performance by Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>This was easily outdone by Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel. Watching him on screen, I wonder why haven't I watched his previous movies. Will he continue with mainstream cinema? His character, the way it was portrayed is similar to Alec Guinness in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. There it is, another reference to John LeCarré (Apologies, this would be my last. It would be unfair to compare).<br/><br/>When Rylance was on screen, he was the lead. Not even Tom Hanks is noticeable. Such a powerful performance by Rylance. Rudolf Abel understands he has fallen into the hands of his enemy who would stop at nothing but end his life. There is absolutely no hope, even the civilians want him done. Rylance brilliantly brings this out, his eyes and body do most of the acting.<br/><br/>There are three stars in this movie – Tom Hanks, the story. Both which have been easily outdone by Mark Rylance.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, you can not help but wonder with everything falling in place, it should be one of those spy kids movies made for mature audience with the basic underlying story. The process of sentencing Rudolf was so swift hardly anytime before he was sentenced. But again that can be understood. The entire nation wants him dead and the writers want to stick to the main story, appreciated.<br/><br/>The negotiations between Donavan, The Soviets & East Germans were too fast. Negotiations between 2 super powers over a very sensitive issue, which could have been disrupted or delayed considerably by the home nation – East Germany, gets resolved with ease. Just like that. Poof. It looked more like everything fell in place for Donavon. Even though that was not key to the movie, it does take out some charm off it.<br/><br/>Everything said, the makers have made brilliant effort to turn it right. It is a really enjoyable movie. Someday looking forward to renting it at home and watching it again the way I like. Rewind few scenes, pause at few scenes. Get completely absorbed."
"kckidjoseph-1","8","2","5","20 October 2015"," Spielberg's 'Bridge': A Believable, Entertaining Reach Across Recent History
","Steven Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies"" is great entertainment, especially for those who like their stories painted in deep dark colors, cooled by moody late-night drizzle and starring an enormously appealing and empathetic leading man (in this case, the redoubtable Tom Hanks). It's not bad as history, either. Overall, on a scale of 10, I'd give it an eight _ but advise you to read up on the facts before taking in the film.<br/><br/>To understand the story completely, it's important to know what the United States and the Soviets were up to in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and what they were thinking.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, it was the height of the Cold War and the so-called atomic age, a time when both nations worried about being blown out of existence, when the Soviets scored a public relations coup _ and more _ in launching the Sputnik, the first artificial Earth satellite, on Oct. 4, 1957. Now, the Americans figured, their sworn enemy could really do them damage, perhaps sending a bomb into outer space.<br/><br/>Indeed, with this in mind, the U.S. had been sending up its super sophisticated spy plane, the U-2, having it fly over adversaries real and imagined, including the Soviet Union. One of these flights over the Soviet Union commenced on May 1, 1960, with Francis Gary Powers at the controls, and was shot down.<br/><br/>It came at an awkward and embarrassing time for the U.S. <br/><br/>President Eisenhower had met with Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev the previous September in America, and they were so optimistic about their talks that they planned to meet again later in 1960, this time in Moscow.<br/><br/>Eisenhower, still worried over Soviet armaments, had nonetheless okayed the U-2 flights, even at risk of jeopardizing the upcoming talks. When the shoot down occurred, Ike at first denied the flights. But when plane debris _ and Powers himself, very much alive _ were produced, the jig was up, and Khrushchev angrily canceled the summit (perhaps something he had wanted all along anyway).<br/><br/>On August 17, 1960, Powers was convicted of espionage against the Soviet Union and sentenced to 10 years. On February 10, 1962, he was exchanged, along with American student Frederic Pryor, in a spy swap at the Glienicke Bridge in Berlin, for Soviet KGB Colonel Vilyam Fisher, known as ""Rudolf Abel,"" who had been caught by the FBI and tried and jailed for espionage.<br/><br/>OK, that's the story.<br/><br/>'Bridge of Spies' focuses on the spy exchange on that bridge and how the negotiations came about, with Hanks playing New York lawyer James Donovan, who is first pressed into defending Abel (played with exquisite understated menace _ and appeal _ by Mark Rylance of ""Wolf Hall"" fame), then in fashioning a deal to have him swapped for Powers (a rather bland and somewhat miscast Austin Stowell). Thrown into the mix is American exchange student Pryor (believably if briefly played by Will Rogers), held by the East Germans, who, according to the film, are eager to establish their own independence from the Soviets while at the same time defying the Americans.<br/><br/>The old-fashioned script (and I mean this in the best sense) _ rewritten, oddly enough, by the usually eccentric Ethan and Joel Coen, from Matt Charman's original script _ gives Spielberg the chance to do what he does best, especially when given actors like Hanks (who by the way is superb) and Rylance, which is to weave a story that engrosses and involves, which this film certainly does.<br/><br/>The movie's spy games seem to tear a page out of Carol Reed's ""Third Man"" playbook, but instead of shadowy black and white scenes shot at askew angles in post World War II Vienna we have rainy, color-drained nights in early-1960s, newly walled Berlin. It works.<br/><br/>If I have a problem with the film, it would probably be with the depiction of Donovan's home life, obviously intended as counterpoint to the shadowy dealings he apparently was involved in, sometimes at the exclusion of his wife and children (to make matters worse, Amy Ryan as the missus just doesn't seem like his kind of gal). I never quite buy into the family as being real, but rather as a rather heavy-handed attempt to present them as a kind of Ozzie and Harriet content with having the kids watch ""77 Sunset Strip"" as their father's clandestine life begins to enshroud them and their idyllic existence. <br/><br/>I'm also not sure if I quite believe how Hanks' Donovan and Rylance's Abel bond into frankly inexplicable Cold War buddyism, but the technique sets up an interesting dynamic that helps flesh out the period's blurry political and nationalistic borders that often saw friends and enemies switch places at an alarming rate (just as now _ and perhaps that's the point).<br/><br/>Powers' life, ironically, would be cut short a decade and a half later as the news helicopter he was flying over Los Angeles crashed and killed him instantly. But maybe that's yet another point, intended or not. In the kind of backstreet war _ and world _ this film depicts, the greatest threat to our existence sometimes begins at home."
"PrashunChakraborty","8","2","5","19 October 2015"," Solid but nothing spectacular
","I don't think I can criticize this movie, it's a Spielberg film after all, nearly flawlessly made, Tom Hanks is excellent as usual (but let's face it Tom Hanks has never acted poorly in ANY film EVER), mostly historically accurate as well. In fact if it would have been made by anyone else I may have liked it a lot more than I currently do, but alas Steven Spielberg has become a victim to his own success and ability. So all I can say is that while this movie is solid it's nothing spectacular, there are no great scenes but the story is well done and it's evenly represented, a couple of weeks ago I watched Edward Zwick's Pawn Sacrifice and found it to be very pro American and anti Russian, Spileberg of course is above all this pettiness and delivers a balanced film in which both sides are fairly represented. However, I was expecting the raw power that Spielberg delivered in Munich (last time he tackled the theme of espionage) but that's not what this movie is about, it feels a lot simpler and the stakes never feel high. Bridge of spies is a good movie and can go on the B-Side of Steven Spielberg's greatest hits along with The Terminal, Lincoln, War Horse etc. while the A side continues to have Schindler's List, Saving private Ryan, Raiders of the lost ark etc."
"StevePulaski","8","2","5","19 October 2015"," Standard moral and thematic inclusions can't disturb a film largely built on meditative quietness
","Steven Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies"" opens in a quiet, almost meditative manner, giving us a sense of the hustle in 1957 Brooklyn during the brutal Cold War. Spielberg focuses on movements of characters and slow, melodic buildup that results in a shockingly peaceful opening, giving what we can foresee will occur. We then cut to a man named Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance), who retrieves a secret message in public before he returns to his apartment to be apprehended by FBI agents believing he is a Soviet spy.<br/><br/>Subsequently, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), a lawyer who specializes in insurance settlements, is requested to take the case and serve as Abel's defense. The difficultly in the forthcoming legal battle is to ensure that Abel gets a fair trial, despite relations with Russian boiling like an unattended pot on a hot stove. Also during this time is the famous U-2 incident, where an American spy plane was shot down by Soviets and resulted in the death of Pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). As a result, Donovan must now go to the USSR in order to try and sanction an exchange for Abel's safe return to his homeland for Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), an economics professor who was arrested under suspicion of being a spy during the construction of the Berlin Wall.<br/><br/>The first half of ""Bridge of Spies"" is so quiet and low-key that it's almost a marvel of some sort. Spielberg further proves himself to be a delicate artist, with a gentle, liberal hand for long takes and intimate settings that build relationships with characters through tight, formal structures. Working with his longtime cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, Spielberg gives this film a classic-film look, almost echoing the dark and brooding sentiments of Hanks' overlooked ""Road to Perdition."" This film feels like a Cold War-era film about a forgotten piece of the era, thanks to its emphasis on classic set decoration and Spielberg's directorial artistry.<br/><br/>The second half of ""Bridge of Spies,"" however, opts for an approach more grounded in what you'd expect from this kind of a film: talky setups, moral conveniences, and a more linear A-to-B plot structure instead of the fascinating ambiguity and meditative qualities a Spielberg film like ""Lincoln"" or ""Munich"" maintained throughout their entire runtimes. During this latter half of the film - which admittedly doesn't cripple it - even with the film's scope extended to a more international level, we still zero in on the fine performance by Tom Hanks, who further proves that pairing him with Spielberg can almost do no wrong.<br/><br/>Hanks plays a character conflicted because of oppressive times to the point where some may find it difficult to see ""the big deal"" behind defending a Soviet spy on American soil. The moral ideas about following through with due process and a fair trial, while pretty standard and predictable for anyone who paid attention in law class, is still nonetheless a fascinating depiction of a film that is erected on difficult, weighty decisions by characters that always come with an accompanied ""but..."" whenever they are audibly proposed. Probably the most underrated component of the film, however, is the relationship Hanks' Donovan has with Rylance's Abel. The two occupy a sort of respectful, father/son relationship with one another that makes their banter that much more believable, in addition to softly humorous in some respect. The film would've benefited from more of these simple scenes between two men caught in very difficult positions where a rulebook of any kind eludes them.<br/><br/>The film was co-written by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, and in some ways, the more somber style of filmmaking makes this feel more like a Coen spectacle than a Spielberg film. However, it's the poetry communicated through Spielberg's directing that makes the film feel so fluid, in addition to the strong narrative that is given time to build over the course of nearly two and a half hours. All of these elements blended with some great, subtle period cinematography and a strong Hanks performance and you have a fascinating adult drama that, while not as layered as it could be, is an enriching experience."

"regula1","10","3","11","16 October 2015"," With subtle messaging and outstanding acting, Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies"" knocks it out of the park
","In my mind, there are only two kinds of movie: good and bad. What makes a good movie good depends on a variety of factors that boil down to one thing: does it satisfy the needs of the audience? If you go to an action movie, chances are you go into it expecting many things to blow up and not a bunch of romantic interludes. If you get a lot of booms, then you are satisfied, or if you get a lot of romance, you will probably be dissatisfied.<br/><br/>""Bridge of Spies"" is a very satisfying movie.<br/><br/>This is not an action film by any stretch of the imagination, mind you. Only three or four booms occur and only a handful of gunshots are seen. This is not a spy film, either. True, the main points of the film centers around two ""spies."" For those not well versed in history, here's the set-up:<br/><br/>In 1957, Rudolph Abel, played very simply yet effectively by Mark Rylance, is arrested in New York by the FBI on charges of espionage. Appointed to his defense is Tom Hanks playing James Donovan, an insurance lawyer with a good family struggling to raise his children in the midst of the Cold War atmosphere of paranoia.<br/><br/>In 1960, Francis Gary Powers is shot down flying a U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union and is captured alive. In 1961, the Berlin Wall is erected, completely separating East Berlin from West. Finally, in 1962, a prisoner exchange is arranged for Powers and Abel in Berlin, on the Glienicke Bridge, known as ""the bridge of spies.""<br/><br/>Donovan is given the unenviable task of defending a self-admitted spy, putting him in a position much like that of John Adams who took the case of the British soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre. Hated by his own people for defending values that everyone in America should value, Hanks' Donovan must wrestle with his morals in the face of people who have bought into their own propaganda and forgotten what is truly at stake.<br/><br/>Spielberg puts the values of America at the heart of this movie, but doesn't rub it in your face. On the contrary, through the simple but powerful character interactions and very simple background music, Spielberg lets the audience come to the conclusion for themselves the results of sticking to your values, even when you don't want to, with implications that easily apply today (think Guantanamo.)<br/><br/>For those interested in history, the set directors did a wonderful job showing Cold War-era America and Berlin, Berlin especially. It's amazing to think that even 17 years after the end of World War II, East Berlin still had large sections of the city in ruins.<br/><br/>Don't look for anything fancy, but don't look at anything at face value. Appreciate the simple yet smart repartee that Hanks shares with characters such as Abel, FBI agents, and Soviet and East German bureaucrats. Reflect on the messages that this film sends in parallel images seen throughout the film. Hopefully, you will come out of the theater feeling ... satisfied."

","Steven Spielberg's latest film ""Bridge of Spies"" is another great historical masterpiece in his entire film-making career but with this one being much different than the rest, with Schindler's List talking about a very successful businessman at the time who also happened to be a member of the Nazi party who ended up saving 1200 Jews from concentration camps, Saving Private Ryan talking about the D-Day invasion and the casualties on Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, Catch Me If You Can talking about the early criminal life of Frank Abagnale Jr., Munich talking about the five men assigned by the Israeli government to eliminate the terrorists responsible for the Black September bombings at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany, as well as Lincoln talking about the last few months of Abraham Lincoln's presidency, and now with ""Bridge of Spies"" not only does Spielberg tackle the Cold War but also takes on the subject of communism along with it. The movie stars Tom Hanks (in an Oscar worthy performance) as a Brooklyn insurance lawyer named James Donovan who is told by his boss Thomas Watters (played by Alan Alda) that he was the unanimous choice to defend a Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance) whom the majority of Americans want to be hanged but I'm not going to give anything away. After the trial is over the mission of the U-2 spy plane is in effect which it's job is to take pictures of what is going on in the Soviet Union from an altitude of 70,000 feet in the air and the person on that mission is an Air Force Lieutenant named Francis Gary Powers (played by Austin Stowell).After Powers gets arrested and jailed by the Soviets Donovan flies to Berlin to negotiate an exchange between Abel and Powers, soon after a college student majoring in economics gets arrested and immediately ends up being a part of the exchange. Spielberg directed this movie with suspense,passion, and a huge love of country, and not to mention those scenes with Donovan and his wife Mary (played by Amy Ryan) are just heartbreaking.

","This Cold War history describes (with Spielberg drama) a tense time in American history, when the US and Soviets were immersed in tensions that had the potential of engaging the world in a nuclear war.Tom Hanks portrays the insurance lawyer James Britt Donavan, who was recruited to become a patriotically motivated defense attorney for Soviet KGB Colonel Vilyam Fisher, known as ""Rudolf Abel"", who was caught by the FBI and eventually convicted for espionage. Subsequently, Donavan was asked to negotiate a prisoner swap between Abel and the downed U2 spy pilot, Francis Gary Powers, an event that occurred on February 10, 1962, on Glienicke Bridge in Berlin. There are several layers to this historic film challenging our concepts about justice. Hanks brilliantly carried Donavan's dignity with credibility throughout a somewhat complicated plot. There's something for every movie goer in this excellent movie- there's history, drama, espionage and emotional human dignity. Excellent cinematography during the scene when Powers and his U2 reconnaissance airplane are hit with a surface to air missile is particularly exciting. Additionally interesting are the scenes describing how Americans were immersed with Cold War paranoia and showing the ""duck and cover"" drills taught in public schools. Mark Rylance gives a brilliantly superb performance as the Russian spy Rudolf Abel. ""Bridge of Spies"" is a serious, albeit entertaining, history lesson about an incident that had the potential to change the world as we knew it, but proved how cooler negotiating heads somehow prevailed, in spite of international tensions.

"odaat-30737","10","2","6","19 October 2015"," Spielberg's spellbinding historical journey to another hit
","When it comes to the art of storytelling on the silver screen, I believe Steven Spielberg is amongst the greatest in history of cinema! While; just like any other movie director, he is guilty of mixing truth with fiction in films marketing their movie as 'based on a true story', Spielberg tends to restrain his amount of fiction to a lot smaller percentage than other film makers do. In his historical films such as his, (1993) 'Schindler's List', and (2012) 'Lincoln', they always have a significant wealth of authentic historical awareness and themes of morality. Spielberg's just released, 'Bridge of Spies' serves as another striking example of this. <br/><br/>The just released historical dramatic thriller takes on two big plot lines. It begins in 1957 Brooklyn where an aging mild mannered Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) from Russia is arrested in his apartment by FBI charged as being a Russian spy. Appointed to him is, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) a lawyer who specializes in insurance settlements. The fact that Donovan is being placed out of his league is no mere accident. The government acting only in the interest of presenting a visual that the spy is getting his legal right to a trial, has no interest in a fair trial. Their hopes are for Rudolf to get a form of a speedy kangaroo court trial to sentence him to the death penalty. In a similar likeness to Gregory Peck's role of Atticus Finch in (1962) 'To Kill a Mockingbird', James is caught in a personal battle between his loyalty to the constitution and a world of prejudism and hate whom would rather bypass the law in the alleged best interest of America. Ironically, James soon finds himself beseeched to fly to Russia to negotiate the release of an American military spy pilot, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) who was shot down by the Russians.<br/><br/>At the core, 'Bridge of Spies' resonates traces of themes similar to today's controversial matter of detainees at Guantanamo Bay detention camp where many incarcerated are there with no trial at all. Tom Hanks not only elegantly inhabits James's conflicted role of a man whom I suspect was highly ahead of his time in his thinking, but also must deal with what he sees as the political hypocritical world where people judge Russia for doing the exact same thing as American officials do. He places himself in a vulnerable position also where he and his family's safety may be jeopardized.<br/><br/>What I particularly loved most of all about Spielberg's direction was what I perceived as his simplicity in tell the story. Since I don't have anything close to a high ranking IQ in the subject of political science, beforehand I had some fear that this would be one of those films where I get so flooded with political information that I become lost. That fear was quickly extinguished <br/><br/>Similar to the author John Steinbeck's gift in simple writing in a fashion where everybody could understand his literature, Spielberg presented his symbolism and story in an easy to understand way. Just one example: a courtroom scene where James is desperately fighting what looks like a losing battle for him to pursue the court to follow the constitution is suddenly contrasted by a random elementary classroom scene where all the children are standing up and reciting the 'Pledge of Allegiance'. In the front stands the woman teacher glaring up at the flag with an insane smile; looking like to be a woman who has some god-like obsession with the flag.<br/><br/>I admit; even though Steven Spielberg is my favorite movie director, I don't always love a movie he's made. However; in my opinion, I rank this as one of his great films! Will it be nominated for Academy Awards next year like the speculation and buzz that has been going around in the media? I don't know. While I don't think 'Bridge of Spies' ranks to the greatness of Spielberg's (1993) ' Schindler's List' and (1997) 'Saving Private Ryan', it nevertheless without a doubt in my opinion is highly worthy of consideration for nominations."

","""Bridge of Spies"" is a big-budget, beautifully produced movie that is unabashedly geared toward thinking adults. There are no nods to fanboys who need to see ""part four"" after a title or a comic book superhero in tights to commit to a film. If you go to movies for fast- paced fight scenes, explosions or strippers, stay home. <br/><br/>""Bridge of Spies"" is an historical drama about the Cold War. It's based on real events. Insurance lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is pressured by colleagues to defend Russian spy Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance), who has been caught in 1957 Brooklyn. It's his patriotic duty, they tell him, to provide the accused with counsel, even though the accused is a Russian spy at the height of the Cold War. Donovan does such a good job defending an unappealing client that he is later selected to help negotiate the release of downed U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers. No, this isn't the most scintillating of plots. Most scenes consist of men over fifty wearing suits conversing in cagey language and subdued voices about big, big issues. <br/><br/>Lavish spending by gifted costumers, set directors and cinematographers is all over the screen. The interior of a middle- class American home in the 1950s-1960s era is beautifully recreated, right down to the divided aluminum foil trays for TV dinners. It would be hard for a male to watch this film and not feel serious fedora envy. Women may yearn for the day when a woman could single-handedly prepare a five course meal for an intact family that eats together in a formal dining room, and yet appear at that dining table looking like a Vogue cover model with cinched waist, pointy assets, firm hair and bright lipstick. And then mom, dad, and the kids hold hands and say grace, and no one looks at their cell phone, or even the TV. They all pay attention to each other. <br/><br/>As soon as the camera moves from the United States to East Berlin, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski drains almost all color from his images, the way Dracula drained blood from his victims. The sky is dead white, without clouds or sun, and almost everything you see is the lifeless gray concrete of the Berlin Wall or the charred gray of remaining bombed out buildings. People dress in gray wool; their grim faces are the only vague smudge of color. East Berliners attempting to escape are shot by snipers in watchtowers. It's a totalitarian nightmare. <br/><br/>When Donovan enters East Berlin to negotiate Powers' release, he enters an absurd maze of petty manipulations and espionage that would be laughable were it not so deadly. These scenes are reminiscent of the depiction of the state apparatus of petty terror in real Eastern European films like Andrzej Wajda's ""Man of Marble."" Russian actor Mikhail Gorevoy as Ivan Schischkin, a Russian negotiator, is simply a weird and scary looking and sounding man. He wonderfully channels Peter Lorre. <br/><br/>We all know, love and trust Hanks so much that there is not as much tension in the film as there ought to be. We know he's going to do the right thing, in spite of every obstacle, temptation, threat or sneer from a stranger on a train who recognizes him from a newspaper photograph. Somehow ""A Man for All Seasons,"" as many times as I've seen it, gives me the sense that maybe, just maybe, this time Paul Scofield's Thomas More will figure out a way to compromise with Henry VIII's demands and not be decapitated. That tension that maybe Donovan will weaken or sell out or be even slightly less than utterly heroic is missing from ""Bridge of Spies."" Spielberg wanted an uncomplicated hero, and he has created one. <br/><br/>Mark Rylance gives an amazing performance as Russian spy Rudolph Abel. Rylance is apparently a highly celebrated British stage actor but I'd never heard of him. Rylance does virtually nothing noticeable except tuck his chin into his neck and elevate his eyebrows, yet he is riveting, moving, and memorable. Now that's acting! <br/><br/>Abel was just one of the spy's many aliases. His real name was Vilyam ""Willie"" Genrikhovich Fisher. He was of German-Jewish ancestry. Did that play any role in his dedication to Communism? He had lived during the Holocaust. Did Communism offer the only brighter tomorrow in which he could believe? It would have made his life so much better if he had defected to the West, rather than go to prison. Why did he not? The film offers no clue. <br/><br/>""Bridge of Spies"" recreates for the viewer the undercurrent of daily fear during the Cold War. Schoolchildren cry during a school ""duck and cover"" presentation. A boy fills his bathtub with water so as to be prepared for nuclear attack. What was missing for me was what each side offered: an articulation of capitalism v communism. Perhaps the film could have included scenes where Donovan and Abel present their respective systems, their promises and flaws. There are reasons the Berlin Wall went up in 1961, and came down in 1989, reasons that seem to elude the supporters of US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. <br/><br/>As it is, there is a marvelous scene where Donovan tells Hoffman, a CIA agent who looks a bit like Bobby Fischer (another pawn in the Cold War) what makes an American an American – the Constitution."

","Watched a Tom Hanks movie after a long time. Brilliant movie. Probably in 15 minutes into the movie we all know how it will go and how it will end. Still every scene was interesting and made with perfection. Who am I to praise Steven Spielberg... btw, is Tom Hangs look that young?"

","While at first I was skeptical for this film's Best Picture nominee status, as I was under the impression it was just given to it because it was directed by Speilberg and written by the Coen brothers, it did eventually win me over by the end. Of course, first it had to get through a Cold War version of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" before that, but once Tom Hanks' character got to Europe, things got interesting. Clearly, the direction and writing on this film is what gave it the nomination it deserved."
"gavinp9","8","1","2","2 January 2018"," Really well made Cold War true story
","'Bridge of Spies' is an espionage thriller at its finest. It's set in the late 50s & early 60s and certainly looks the part - I always love seeing the old cars driving around New York, looking classy. Starts off like any classic spy film, but then Abel (Rylance) is caught. In comes Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer who is asked to defend Abel, so he can receive due legal practice. The first 45min or so is a good courtroom drama and moves along fast enough, with Hanks giving a few great speeches and making some solid points about what's right and what's best.<br/><br/>The movie really captures well the Cold War tension in America and what families would've gone through. It helps that this is the best film Spielberg has made in a few years and the best film Hanks has been in for a while. Once the movie turns into political chess, with an exchange of Abel for Powers (Stowell) in Berlin, the stakes are raised and there's plenty of great subterfuge.<br/><br/>Hanks basically owns the film, with everyone having some good moments (especially Rylance, with his ""would it help?""s), but he really plays a great everyman who stands up to both Germany, Russia & his own country (mostly portrayed by the CIA/Shepherd) for what is morally right and just, not just what is politically acceptable at the current time."
"DHWaldron","9","1","2","11 November 2017"," An amazingly engaging historical representation
","Bridge of Spies stars Tom Hanks as the real-life lawyer James B. Donovan, who must defend the captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Directed and produced by Steven Spielberg, who has directed and produced many war-time films (such as Saving Private Ryan, War Horse and Schindler's List) he sets this film during the bleak conditions of the Cold War, just as the Berlin War completes construction.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies employs fantastic acting from all cast members, especially Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, who emit a strong yet realistic sense of camaraderie and friendship due to their, at first, mutual relationship which develops into a bond so tight that the audience doesn't want it to be broken. The film also manages to contrast image and words, which work brilliantly, such as every scene where Tom Hanks is on a train, where no words are spoken, but one hundred ideas are broadcasted via the strong emotional face of Tom Hanks. These Grade-A performances as well as the completely differing settings of the two halves of the film, perfectly execute the mood integral for this serious, often heart-tugging moments. As mentioned, the scenery is gorgeous, with frequent switches of location; from America to Berlin and back, the location/cinematography greatly enhances the atmosphere of this film as do the uncoverings of background characters emotions and feelings towards Hanks' character such as a random policeman he meets, all questioning him: ""Why are you defending that traitor?"", revealing to the audience the side some must take for their country.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is magnificent with perfect performances, a contrasting climate (from sun to snow) and the nuanced characters makes Bridge of Spies a fantastic film with strong underlying morals and values which still apply to this day."
"zkonedog","8","1","2","27 February 2017"," Explaining The Cold War Era
","The combination of director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks is almost certain to produce a quality product at the cinema. That's exactly what happens (again) with ""Bridge of Spies"". It probably won't be your favorite effort from either of those two film luminaries, but it is instead a quite, brooding tale about life and espionage during the Cold War.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Bridge of Spies"" tells the adapted-from-true-events story of James B. Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer tapped to defend one of the most hated men in America, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), who is convicted of spying in our homeland for the Soviet Union. Donovan first fights for Abel's rights (when no one else will seem to, even in full breach of the law), then is sent to Russia in order to facilitate an espionage-laden exchange mission.<br/><br/>The area in which ""Bridge of Spies"" works best is when it can relate the themes of the Cold War to everyday life, showing that the events around the world may change over time, but people's reactions to them are usually more predictable. The overwhelmingly negative and hateful response to Abel's more presence in the country is startlingly familiar to the country's response to people of Islamic faith after 9/11. Seemingly all rule of law (and even some of decency) was thrown out the window in favor of ""patriotic justice"". Early in the film, there is also a poignant angle dealing with how children are reacting to Cold War tensions. At school, they are taught to ""duck and cover"" in case of an Atomic explosion (right after reciting the pledge of allegiance, of course), and at home Donovan's children are all very conflicted about how he could possibly defend the ""Commie traitor"".<br/><br/>Bolstering those themes is the expected brilliance from Hanks in the leading role. Here, he is very much akin to, say, Atticus Finch in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", or the typical Jimmy Stewart ""defend peace and law at all costs"" type role. In a world turned upside-down with misinformation about the Communists and hatred about something that isn't probably understood, Hanks's Donovan is able to keep a level head and pursue the tasks that really seem to make a difference, such as diplomacy and preserving the rule of law.<br/><br/>The only reason ""Bridge of Spies"" probably isn't even better is that the ""espionage stuff"" over in Russia, while still rather entertaining in general, isn't the highlight of this film. The themes in the first half or so of the movie, feating Donovan's interactions with his family and the Abel case, just work on a deeper level. It still turns out to be a pretty emotional and satisfying ending, but the time spent in Russia is where things tend to get a little formulaic or draggy. Again, nothing terrible, but enough for me to drop this to four stars instead of an all-out five.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the deep themes and powerful messages of ""Bridge of Spies"", as well as the notable acting performances given. It is a movie that can really be enjoyed by anyone teenaged years and up, as it touches on so many distinct avenues to get its message across. That Cold War era is one that often doesn't get its ""fair shake"" in history books or curriculums, so it is nice to see Spielberg bring it to the masses."
"tyingling7766","9","1","2","27 February 2017"," Why did I wait so long for this movie?
","Bridge of Spies. I hate that I waited so long to see this movie. It is so amazing. Stick around and see how so.<br/><br/>Synopsis: In the cold war, a lawyer, James B. Donovan is recruited by the CIA and involved in an intense negotiation mission to release and exchange a CIA U-2 spy-plane pilot, Francis G. Powers. The pilot was arrested alive after his plane was shot down by the Soviet Union during a mission and stays in the company of a KGB intelligence officer, Rudolf Abel, who was arrested for espionage in the US. Starring: Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance Director: Steven Spielberg<br/><br/>First thing is, there is hardly anything wrong with this movie. The only downfall is the fact that it ran two minutes longer than it should have. Just a mere two minutes was the matter of this movie being a 10 or a 9. Throughout Tom Hanks' character's whole time in Germany he was saying all he wanted to do was get home to his bed. When that happened at the end of the movie it should have just ended there. There was no need to show that people respected his character after he got back. Falling onto his bed and going to sleep was enough in my opinion.<br/><br/>Now that we got the one bad thing out of the way, let's talk about the best thing of the movie. Mark Rylance did deserve the best supporting actor for his role. He was so amazing in this movie. Was he a spy or not? Yes, the truth has come out and he was a spy, but nobody knew that at the time. The way Rylance played it off as if you couldn't tell was superb. If he see this movie for anything watch it for Rylance's performance.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks in this movie was as amazing as he always is. Well, after he stopped doing those romance movies. And outside the two I have mentioned, there was no one who stood out. That's okay. The whole situation was about how Donovan treated Abel respectfully and worked over the Russians and Germans to get what the U.S. needed.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of Spielberg's movies in the last twenty years this one did not have a pacing problem. Even though it was nearly two and a half hours long it didn't feel that way. You are so entranced in the story that you don't realize you were sitting there for two hours and then the movie is over.<br/><br/>How this movie didn't win more awards is beyond me. It was so good. This is one of those movies that will stand the test of time. I guarantee it. Watch it.<br/><br/>Rating: 9 out of 10"
"EthanBJones_03","9","1","2","8 January 2017"," Top notch film; highly recommended
","*I Will Do My Best to not include spoilers but if I feel the need I will notify you beforehand<br/><br/>Overall: This movie is a great cold war drama and is another badge that Spielberg and Hanks should wear with pride.<br/><br/>Good: Absolutely stunning cinematography. Every single actor did their job incredibly well and could not be flawed.The story itself is very interesting and I imagine it was a very tough task to transform it into a movie but it worked so well done writers. Anyone can turn a large scale event such as Dunkirk, or Stalingrad but to turn something much more minor and make it give an effect ranking with them events requires true skill. ​Beautiful music to show tension, heart warming moments and even the brutality such as the train sequence, speaking of which was jaw dropping. The ending was so very well done and came full circle to the movies prior events though I feel the actual final negotiations could have been done a little better. <br/><br/>​Bad: The first act is quite slow and dull but it makes up for it after that. Some scenes could be taken away or cut down. Some subplots and minor characters such as the journalist, while possibly historically accurate, felt out of place and could have meant more if explored more thoroughly. The final negotiations could have been done a tad bit better and accents weren't always accurate.<br/><br/>Best Part: The ending that comes full circle<br/><br/>MVP: Ton Hanks as James Donovan<br/><br/>9/10"
"RileyOnFilm","10","1","2","26 December 2016"," Cinematic Gold
","""Bridge of Spies"" is a film directed by Steven Spielberg. For some these days, that may not be persuasive enough to buy a ticket so let me say it is crafted to make a historical event come alive on screen. It stars Tom Hanks but doesn't rely on his huge appeal. Hanks lets the story play out on its own without grandstanding with his character. There's an excellent cast with him and they all work together to make this film amazing.<br/><br/>There is so much to enjoy here. It's first of all interesting because it is a true story. Second, it heralds the accused's right to a solid defense. There is much here about negotiations in and out of country. It's also a period piece replete with authentic props and there is a remarkable conclusion one may or may not expect.<br/><br/>""Bridge of Spies"" is top notch storytelling about an event that should be remembered from the cold war. A couple questions are addressed:<br/><br/>How can people thought of as evil make grand gestures of humanity? Why should we put effort into defending the rights of those such as a foreign spy?<br/><br/>There are parts of those questions that require a long telling so the length of the movie may put off some. I was bored at times but I kept regaining interest. If one can keep ones attention span alive between the slower scenes, ""Bridge of Spies"" has many engaging moments and a most intriguing payoff. This is yet another in the sequence of movies I've been reviewing lately that definitely could win movie of the year. It is a story told by Spielberg worth watching."
"jrarichards","9","1","2","17 October 2016"," Exquisitely acted and authentic-looking Cold War drama
","If the basis of a good film is a good story, then it shouldn't be too difficult to make a success out of the real-life (1962) exchange of (British-born) Soviet spy Rudolf Abel for American spy-plane pilot Francis Gary Powers and American student Frederic Pryor, all the more so given the background of the construction of the Berlin Wall, and the events leading to Abel's capture in a ""Reds Under the Bed""-obsessed 1957 America.<br/><br/>But ""Bridge of Spies"" does not make it very clear that its real-life events cover a 5-year period, and maybe that is as it should be. This is a film, when all is said and done, and it is as a film that it should or must be judged. Who knows if Rudolf Abel was as likable as Mark Rylance makes him out to be? Intuitively that would seem pretty unlikely. And indeed perhaps even Tom Hanks's lawyer for Abel's defence - James B. Donovan - was not quite the ideally noble character we see.<br/><br/>It matters not in the work of art that is this film.<br/><br/>The ever-so-slightly Nixon-like Hanks looks like he's been extracted physically from 1957, and indeed immaculate authenticity of US setting is a hallmark of the film. And - having been born in Poland in 1959 - Janusz Kaminski on camera needs no lessons in how to make the Eastern European scenes look as they should. Thomas Newman's score adds greatly to the effect, and there are enough 2015 nuances in plot-lines and script to hint to us (I think rightly) that the division of the then world into US angels and Soviet devils was almost but not quite that.<br/><br/>Indeed, a joy of the film (if not for the first time in cinema history) is the way it depicts (again one assumes realistically) the way in which East and West did have to find some ways at least of ""getting on"", even if only for pragmatic reasons, and - let's face it - to ensure that the bombs were not actually dropped, in spite of all the rhetoric. They were not, so somehow it worked...<br/><br/>While supporting cast members like Alan Alda, Scott Shepherd, Sebastian Koch, Peter McRobbie (in an excellent cameo as Allen Dulles) and especially Mikhail Gorevoy (as the KGB man) all do great things in parts that paint in that authentic background, this is ultimately the film of the Rylance-Hanks pairing, and this is inspiring and interesting, and offers the chance for a surprising amount of wit and wisdom, and indeed warmth.<br/><br/>Indeed, this film has a particular cosy feel about it, which scarcely seems warranted - given the circumstances - but is quite tangible and imparts huge watchability to the movie. Not for a moment do things drag.<br/><br/>Ultimately, that enigmatic ""cosiness"" presumably boils down to the fact that the Donovan we follow is left much to his own devices as he moves from East to West and back again, is regularly in danger (indeed even in his own home in America), is playing a potentially risky game of high stakes with very big fish indeed, but manages to do so successfully by simply doing his (lawyer's) job as best he can in a circumstance in which his ""best"" is pretty darned good. He somehow keeps himself out of danger, and although he is sharp and even at times wily, he is most of all just dogged; and he keeps (or chooses to keep) things clean, simple and straight when all those around him seek to make them dirty, devious and complicated. Given that the key concept in the whole film (put into words by Abel) is that here is a man who always stands up again no matter how many times, and no matter how hard, he is knocked down, that cohesively whole image is indeed conveyed by the film, and it comes over as remarkably refreshing, and surprisingly convincing.<br/><br/>Those interested in the truth behind the story are encouraged to read about it at length, but that should definitely be done after the film has been seen and judged (and enjoyed) on its own merits, which are as a very impressive and enjoyable piece of art."

James Donavan(hanks) plays the the perfect joker in the negotiations and his bluffs do pay off at the end. Mr. Hanks played the character amazingly well and the story being a real one will give chills about what it was to live back then in the East/west Germany.

","Bridge of spies is based on a true historical event. When Rudolph Abel is caught sending secrets to the Soviet Union and is found out to be a spy Abel needed a lawyer and when no one came forward to do it. One lawyer named James Donovan was appointed. Donovan formerly a criminal lawyer and had served at the Nazi war trials had settled down and became a Insurance lawyer. Donovan doesn't want it. But it becomes clear to him that the case has already been tried and Abel found guilty in a court of public opinion. Donovan decides to do his best to win by any means Legal. This makes him a target in many quarters and unpopular. In an age where anti communist feelings ran high. The case was done in a highly illegal manner and Abel found guilty. Donovan however found a way to save Abel's life by suggesting that he may be useful in the future if say a American Spy had been caught. In this Donovan was smart and foretelling the future because that is what happened. Francis Gary Powers and A young medical student are captured as spies Powers for his failed U2 flight in which he got caught shot down and Pryor for being on the wrong side of the Berlin wall. the U.S. Government wanting to secure the release of both men but not seem involved ask Donovan to work for them but Publicly Donovan works for himself his mission get Powers home. Donovan finds out about Pryor and is determined that Both men come home. Donovan is on his own. no gadgets no tools no back up a lot of handlers watching him and giving him orders which he ignores some he takes seriously but over all he refuses to give up on Powers of Pryor. both men he insists are innocent and are coming home. Alone in a strange country not speaking the language and scared Donovan does the impossible. And that is the movie in every bit of glory. This humble man that would never think of himself as a hero is one. And this man who does the impossible wants one thing to go home and get rid of his cold.<br/><br/>This just may be the best spy movie to come out of the last 35 years . and it also is tom Hanks best. Mark Rylance shines as Abel the unworried spy who becomes a pillar of strength to Donovan in the darkest points of the trial. You're not worried Donovan asks him and his reply is a classic No should I be ? would it help if I was ?<br/><br/>These are the things movie gold is made of."
"andre-168-995430","10","1","2","10 August 2016"," Steven Spielberg and Kaminski put out another gem
","Spielberg and the Cohen Brothers are a dream team for films like this. The photography by Kaminski, a favorite of Steven, is only matched by the costumes created by Polish born Kasia Walicka (who also did the work for the Cohens in Moonrise Kingdom). Steven has an affinity for capturing the ethos and complexity of Eastern Europe period films as demonstrated in Schindlers List and now in Bridge of Spies.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays his usual self, milking scenes with small gestures that lend a form of gravitas to otherwise normal events. His gradually worsening cold gives him a chance to play with his handkerchief that otherwise sits like a soldier in his coat pocket, rigid as the East German guards. If you look up the real person that he plays (Donovan), you will notice that Tom does a bang up job in capturing the character of the man.<br/><br/>The story is true, the scenes where Berlin becomes divided by a wall are graphically real and disturbing. Spielberg uses the camera as the eyes of citizens separated by the wall. Depending on which side you end up provides a polar opposite understanding of what's happening.<br/><br/>As for the Russian Spy played by Oscar winning English actor Mark Rylance, I was stunned by his minimalist interpretation and limited dialog that riveted my attention to everything he spoke and the little gestures that made his character so vivid.<br/><br/>A lot of people felt he did not deserve and Oscar. I say he deserved it by stripping out all unnecessary movements and character effects and still leaving a powerful presence. Unlike Stallone who milks every scene with the same body language, Mylance shows his gifts he learned from stage roles and his management of the Shakespeare Theater. Expect more from this man. Steven already is pulling him into the animated BFG story coming out now.<br/><br/>The only part I did not like is the one dimensional treatment of the U2 pilots, young bucks out of central casting. Gary Powers was a much more complex person than shown in this film. This would have added an extra dimension on what the value of each ""spy"" was to their respective countries.<br/><br/>An excellent film, done in cold, unemotional, frigid, bleak style."

Thomas Newman composes a fantastic score that fits the film although I wish it was John Williams's name on the film credits but ah well it's a shame but I expect we might have to see other composer's names on Steven Spielberg's films in the future in regards of John Williams's age! In conclusion Bridge of Spies is an outstanding return to film directing from Steven Spielberg, it's one of his very best in his recent film output up there with Lincoln most certainly and I am beyond excited to see him return to the fantasy genre with the BFG it's going to be quite something!"
"daniyarseisenov","10","1","2","23 June 2016"," Remarkably satisfying film. Coen brothers & Spielberg & T.Hanks, couldn't get better than that.
","Bridge Of Spies"" is the film inspired by true events portraying spies during 1960's Cold War, starring Tom Hanks (James Donovan), Mark Rylance (Rudolf Abel), written by Coen brothers and directed by Steven Spielberg. What a team huh?! Only by looking at those names, you are not doubting yourself whether it's worth of watching.<br/><br/>Speaking of watching, I've done it twice, at the theater strictly for entertainment purpose, one more time at home to analyze key elements of this particular film. The length of ""Bridge Of Spies"" is 2 hours 22 min, which might seem pretty long movie considering there is not much action to witness. However, the directer could develop story integrated with full of tension, lots of suspense which are from A to Z engage you to the given film, at least that's how it was for me, 2 hours had passed unnoticeable. At first, based on the trailer and description of the movie, the audience might get a picture of propaganda ""Anti Russian Communism"", where some key scenes display open violence towards USA by Russians. But it's appear to be very false impression, as the whole movie showcase equal rights and disclosures of two countries without discrimination one to another.<br/><br/>Generally speaking the story of ""Bridge of Spies"" unfolds in Cold War where James Donovan, Insurance attorney from Brooklyn (Tom Hanks), who is enlisted by US government to defend / represent a Russian Spy (Rudolf Abel) during the Cold War. The climax of the film comes when Donovan stands at the Glienicke Bridge (Berlin, Germany) to exchange Rudolf Abel with U-2 spy place pilot Gary Powers who was shot down over the Soviet Union and Frederic Pryor, US economy student who was being held captive in East Berlin for about 6 months.<br/><br/>The film based on true events could be very tricky to produce, as you have to make sure to capture all the key scenarios and momentum from the history as accurate as possible, and the same time not to squeeze any given facts. From that point of view the film came up pretty satisfying but not entirely error-free.<br/><br/>For instance, Frederic Pryor after this film has claimed, that almost all the scenes related to himself were false. Particularly, in the movie Mr.Pryor was sent to prison by German police because he try to help one of his female classmates to pass freshly constructed wall to the ""safe"" side of Berlin, but in reality, Frederic states he was in Denmark at the time of its construction and 'didn't know any beautiful blondes in Berlin'.<br/><br/>Another false fact, Donovan's son, Roger (Noah Schnapp) was preparing for the possibility of a nuclear bomb attack, but in reality, historians agree that educational films to prepare children for a nuclear bomb were propaganda.<br/><br/>You could argue nonstop about making historical films as accurate as possible without twisting any facts, but in my personal opinion, there is nothing wrong on changing ""subvents"" making them more exciting for the audience by adding extra drama/romance or whatever, but the main events has to display 99% real facts from the given history. No question on that.<br/><br/>Overall ""Bridge of Spies"" one of these rare movies, what makes you go back to the history and start researching the true facts according to the particular event, and figure it out for yourself how main character James Donovan from ordinary attorney from Brooklyn, became the person in charge for one of the most responsible negotiation in the history of USA. Fantastic story, phenomenal performance by Hanks and Rylance, another brilliant film by Spielberg. Bottom line, go watch if you haven't done so.<br/><br/>PS: My favorite film in 2015."
"classicsoncall","10","1","2","13 June 2016"," ""What's the next move when you don't know what the game is?""
","This is a compelling character study set amid the espionage and drama of the Cold War between America and the Soviets. What really got my attention was when part of James Donovan's (Tom Hanks) argument against the death penalty for Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) relied largely on foreseeing the day when an American might be arrested on similar charges, and a live prisoner might be the key to an exchange. Cold War paranoia is more than evident in the early part of the story, Donovan's own son asks him, ""You're not a Communist, so why are you defending one""? <br/><br/>It's not made clear how much Donovan's pressure impacted the judge in sentencing Abel, who early on insisted this was an open and shut case, with Donovan's court strategy merely window dressing. I was surprised how little time was offered for Francis Gary Powers' (Austin Stowell) role in the film, but that apparently was not the emphasis of the story. I was only six years old when these events unfolded but somehow (amazingly) can recall Powers' name in headlines of the day.<br/><br/>There's always a question about historical accuracy with films like this, but that shouldn't sway one's interest in seeing the picture. The story is gripping and does a good job in demonstrating Donovan's resolve to protect his client's rights while remaining faithful to the principles of the Constitution. His reaction to East Germans being shot at the Berlin Wall attempting to escape was an unsubtle reminder that even though the events depicted occurred over a half century ago, they still resonate strongly with viewers who were alive at the time."

","I finally watched this Steven Spielberg-directed drama starring Tom Hanks on Netflix disc with my mom just now. We were both enthralled by this based on a true story of Hanks' James Donovan-an insurance lawyer who previously was involved in the Nuremberg trials-and his attempt to first defend Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance who gave a performance worthy of his Oscar win) and then fostering an exchange with Russia and East Germany to trade Abel for pilot Francis Gary Powers and student Frederic Pryor, respectively. It was fascinating finding out later how much of the movie was historically accurate, turns out quite a bit. Some scenes would be considered shocking but this was mostly carried by compelling dialogue of which much of it was by Joel and Ethan Coen. So on that note, me and Mom highly recommend Bridge of Spies."

","I like films about spies, especially those are based on actual events. This film is one of the greatest. It tells the story very clear and fantastic. It draws me back to that special period of the cold war. The two campaigns hate each other, they send spies and hunt for them. I think the lawyer Donawin is magnificent and he really changes the world. The exchange is successful, and his fame improves. I hope that I can watch more espionage films like that, such films can take us inside the secretive, interesting, amazing world of spies. I admire the director Steven Spielburg, I have also seen his films including the Jurassic Park series and the Schindler's list. I really appreciate his film style."
"tom-43722","5","1","2","13 April 2016"," Not bad but a bit boring
","I'm not really a fan of Tom Hanks but in this film, he gave a good, albeit not brilliant, performance as Donovan, who suffered public scorn to do what he thought was right. I went into this film unaware that it was based on real live events but at the end, it showed some of Donovan's accomplishments after these events and I was impressed by the number of people he saved; 9703. However in the film, I wasn't hugely impressed by Tom Hanks, although he's by no means a bad actor. Supporting actor Mark Rylance was good, perhaps better than Hanks, and had some funny moments particularly with his main phrase ""Would it help?"" <br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure if this was meant to be a funny film but it got a laugh out of the audience a fair few times. There were scenes showing Abel's indifference to his situation and Donovan had some amusing lines here and there, but it seemed that the films tone was supposed to be a bit more serious and the humorous parts ruined that slightly. That said, the funny scenes weren't bad, but would probably have been better suited to a more humorous film.<br/><br/>There were some things I liked such as the friendship that developed between Abel and Donovan over the course of the film. Their relationship was the films strong point in my opinion. Another part that I liked was at the end, when Donovan was on the train and saw some people climbing over a fence. This links back to an earlier scene in Berlin, where some people were trying to scale a wall and got shot down, which is a good contrast between Berlin and New York.<br/><br/>I thought the judge was a jerk and it seemed to me that he was letting his prejudice against Abel influence his decision in the courtroom, so I was glad when Donovan managed to talk him out of giving Abel the death sentence. To me, the judges behavior showed that some people can't be trusted with power, but it was nice to see that he wasn't totally corrupt, so perhaps I misjudged him. <br/><br/>This film had a lot of talk about negotiation and politics and since I have little interest in either - largely because I don't trust politicians - it wasn't really my kind of movie. However, I wouldn't call it a bad film. Tom Hanks has some good speeches and there's a funny line here and there, so if you like movies about what goes on behind the scenes in a war, instead of focusing on shooting and explosions, you'll probably like this film. There is a bit of shooting and blowing things up - specifically a plane used to spy on the enemy - but it's kept to a minimum, focusing mainly on Donovan's struggle to help Abel."
"SumanShakya","8","1","2","31 March 2016"," A brilliant historical movie by Spielberg.....
","Steven Spielberg is among the few legendary film makers who have made their prominence for the versatility in the subjects they bring through their films. On one hand, Spielberg had made a touching children drama ""E.T THe Extra Terristrial"" and on the other side gave ""Schindler's List"" documenting history, making it appear larger than life. His versatility continues even today with a touching movie like ""War Horse"" based on the children's novel or a historical movie like ""Bridge of Spies."" May that be 'Empire of the Sun,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" or ""Jurassic Park,"" he always had the clarity in story telling and with ""Bridge of Spies"" it seems he is still unbeatable in terms of story telling.<br/><br/>""Bridge of Spies,"" as has been narrated, is said to be inspired by true events depicting the cold war of 60s between the United States and the Soviet, during which an American attorney opts to negotiate an exchange between a Soviet Spy and an American pilot and a student. In a way, the film retells a segment of history which we haven't read yet. Whatever the film shows come very strongly and just touches you. An attorney who receives hate from the Americans becomes a negotiator for the US president explains a lot of our central character. in the role, Tom Hanks as usual gives a tremendous performance, which sadly went not nominated this time at the Oscars. But a face that catches your attention the most is Mark Rylance as a Soviet Spy, who won an Oscar for his performance. Even with the minimal dialogues he was given, he makes a prominent presence in the film, for which he deserved the award.<br/><br/>Overall, just watch this film to know a part of history, or feel the extraordinary power of Spielberg's story telling, or simply if you're an admirer of Tom Hank's brilliant performance.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 stars out of 4"

As the end credits rolled I found myself in soft tears, something I almost never do. <br/><br/>Maybe it's the setting, I was expecting a spy movie packed with intense dialogue or maybe even chases here and there... I was so wrong and for the better of it.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor and he plays the role of a simple lawyer being dragged into an unfamiliar situation with a huge amount of confidence and bravery. He fights for what he believes is right and plays both sides ( the Germans and the Russians) perfectly. I love his line in the end ""It doesn't matter what people think, you know what you did."" Make no mistake, this is a human drama with all the best elements of a spy story.<br/><br/>The acting by both Hanks and Rylance is great, Mr. Mark is a pleasure to watch and I don't think that anyone could have played the role of the soviet spy better than he did. There is something in his eyes and the way he talks, it just pins you down and you just have to focus on him. Of course, the camera work in the movie is excellent and it really puts you right inside the action - especially in the second part of the movie."

","Bridge of Spies is the true story of an American lawyer named James B.

Now right off the bat, I can say this is a really well- made movie. Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance (who plays the Soviet spy) are excellent in this movie. They both give Oscar-worthy performances and make you actually care for the characters. Also, the writing is excellent. Most of the movie is people talking and negotiating so it could've been boring. Fortunately, the writing keeps the story really interesting and engaging. The direction and musical score were also fantastic. My only problems with the movie is that it is a little slow, mainly in the first half. Also, it doesn't have that re-watchability so I can't really see myself watching it again. But in the end, this is a great movie that does a great job at doing what it set out to do. I give this an 7 out of 10."

These scenes are extremely good. <br/><br/>Other than those brief action scenes, this is a talk-fest, but the conversations don't drag and are very concise among the Russians, the East Germans (this was the time the Berlin Wall went up), the CIA, some other U.S. government officials and James Donovan.<br/><br/>The most engaging scenes are between Rudolph Abel and Donovan and they are excellent as the dialogues were spot on. When Donovan asks Abel why he doesn't show that he is worried Abel replies, "" Would it help?"" It wouldn't surprise me if Mark Rylance as Abel is nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Award. He is really good. <br/><br/>This was history being made and this story is well told. There is nothing complicated and you always know what is going on. However, I was not aware that Donovan also wanted to get Pryor out of Russia as part of the deal. Tom Hanks as James Donovan in this role is perfect.

","I have to confess to knowing very little about Bridge of Spies before the opening credits rolled. Going from the title and Tom Hanks presence was expecting a thriller, but it's actually a docu drama. The film tells the tale of events from the cold war. Like most docu dramas it suffers from the need to spice up a few of the real life events, but judging from other comments on the web most of the main plot lines are true.<br/><br/>Hanks plays James B Donovan who is a lawyer hired to defend a Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). The film is always at it's best with the interplay between Donovan and Abel. A few of the scenes could probably have been dealt with a little more harshly in editing. As ever Hanks is always very watchable though, so it's certainly well worth a watch and gives a sense of what life was like during the cold war."

","The Donovan character (Tom Hanks) was portrayed as being perfect. A good husband, a good father, a good lawyer, a good humanitarian.

Pro-American means also anti-communist.<br/><br/>East Berlin. My parents were born in Berlin and my father took me there about 4-5 years after the film takes place. Both my parents lived in what was in the 1960s the Eastern (Russian) zone.<br/><br/>It was no problem to cross the border into East Berlin. I did not see as much war destruction as was shown in the film. In fact, other then some bullet and shell damage to buildings, I can only remember one that showed real damage, and it was only the top two floors of a building. The scene with the gang that steals Hanks coat is pure fiction. East Berlin had both local policemen and Russian soldiers armed with machine guns. There may well have been young men without jobs, but they would not have been permitted to hang around in a group and harass people walking by.<br/><br/>I never saw people being shot down for trying to escape from the east, but I doubt very much the soldiers were even armed with machine guns, much less used them.<br/><br/>The film makes East Berlin look like a hell compared to the US. That is a pretty big exaggeration. The people in East Berlin did not have access to the rich stores and latest goods in West Berlin, but that is not my idea of hell.<br/><br/>It's a simplistic way of looking at the world: we are good/perfect/rich and they are jealous of us.<br/><br/>I did not particularly enjoy the film even within its own context."

","1957. Rudolph Abel is being followed as he retrieves a ""dead drop"". Back on his place, FBI agents soon storm in and arrest him. Insurance lawyer James Donovan is a skilled negotiator. He gets tasked to defend Abel despite it's been long since he handled a crime case. He accepts anyways. His family questions him about defending an enemy spy, but he insists on his professional code, even advising Abel not to tell anything to the government. Meanwhile, an Air Force lieutenant Francis Gary Powers and a few colleagues get handpicked by the CIA. A CIA agent Hoffman approaches Jim about Abel but he divulges nothing. Jim argues about the legality of the search at Abel's place as there's no warrant; but he meets a dead end. Abel is found guilty of espionage, but the judge holds the sentence for another day. Visited in jail, Abel tells Jim that he looks like his father's friend who stood even after severe beatings. Jim visited the judge with his view of for Abel's sentence; that the judge shouldn't sentence Abel to die so he can be exchanged if suddenly a US spy gets captured in Russia. The judge decides to put Abel incarcerated, to public disagreement.<br/><br/>Gary gets explained about the poison should he get shot down, which he eventually does over Russia. Jim gets a letter from Leipzig supposedly from Abel's family, so he brings it to him. Abel says it's a Russian way to contact him. In Russia, Gary's trial concludes The CIA summons Jim saying he's entrusted to negotiate an exchange of Abel for Gary. He has to act on his own, with no official government support. As Jim arrives in Berlin, complications take place as a US student Frederic Pryor is captured in East Berlin. Hoffman, now Jim's handler, tells him the Russians may switch Powers with Pryor. Jim goes to the Russian embassy in East Berlin supposedly to meet Abel's family lawyer, Mr. Vogel. Instead he meets Ivan Schischkin. He tries everything at Jim; sweet-talking to smoothly threatening; to get Abel and delay Gary's release. But Jim doesn't flinch; he even asks for both Gary and Pryor for Abel, though Schischkin insisted that Pryor is under East German authority. Next Jim meets Vogel who brings the East Germans voice, which demands the US parlays with them about Pryor, acknowledging them as a sovereign state. Hoffman tells Jim to sideline Pryor. <br/><br/>Jim and Schischkin agree on the exchange place in Glienicke Bridge. Vogel backs down, saying Jim's selling the same thing to two parties. As Jim hitches a ride in his car, Vogel tricks him into spending a night in an East German jail. Hoffman accidentally tells Jim that the East German attorney general wants to meet him. But when they meet there's no agreement as Jim insists on his proposal; Abel for both Gary and Pryor. Hoffman gets angry with this, but as they wait eventually confirmation come from other side that Jim gets his way, although the East Germans want to exchange in Checkpoint Charlie. As they wait on the bridge, Jim keeps asking about Checkpoint Charlie. When the Russians arrive and both parties confirm identities, Jim asks to halt the exchange as he realizes the East Germans stall to see if the Americans go through while forgetting Pryor. At last the East Germans arrive and Pryor gets secured, so the Gary and Abel gets exchanged. Jim goes home and his family sees his name credited for Gary's release.<br/><br/>The story contains great potential. A lawyer fervently defends his client despite obvious bias weighing the case, turning into a story of how a civilian managed to negotiate two-for-one prisoner exchange; this movie has its two major acts brimming with things to focus more on. Unfortunately, for me this movie feels like it lacks something. As a story about spies, the movie's first act looks more like a courtroom flick. It tries making it up on the second act, showing great visuals of Berlin on the early Wall era. But still the movie lacks much in suspense, a feat any real spy movie should have.<br/><br/>The technicals in this movie work great wonders. The sets and props look very convincing. I very much enjoy the Berlin Wall train view as great never-been-done visuals. The scoring is also great as it supports in creating great mood for its scenes. The sequence when Pryor gets arrested is also great since as far as I know this movie is the first to show the Berlin Wall as it's being erected. The U2 shooting scene is also a great work as Gary's perspective view from his chute looks very beautiful.<br/><br/>The movie did great in building up its mood and depicting the common anxiety in the Cold War era, particularly with the side scenes. Still, the lack of suspense really undermines the good things in this movie, particularly since this is a Steven Spielberg movie, who did great job in building the suspense in movies like Saving Private Ryan and Munich. The movie could also give more screen time for the second act to emphasize more on the spy aspect of the story, instead of balancing the courtroom drama and the Berlin negotiations.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, the movie is a great work. As the main focus, Tom Hanks nicely measured his performance to be believable and yet still portraying Jim's persistence on his terms of the negotiation. Mark Rylance did well in balancing the performance as in one frame with Hanks. Austin Stowell and Scott Shepherd added nicely to the story angles. Sebastian Koch also did adequately to the story.<br/><br/>My view for Bridge of Spies (2015) is it deserves a 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation is a so-so say from me since although it's a piece of great film work, still the movie lacks the suspense that the audience looks for in a spy movie."
"liberationz","9","2","7","17 October 2015"," Spielberg vs Hanks Episode 4
","For the fourth time in they're respective careers, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have come together to make a movie. This time set during the Cold War, Tom Hanks ( James Donovan) is required to represent Mark Rylance (Rudolf Abel), a Soviet Spy. But when an American spy is captured by the Soviets, it's up to Donovan to negotiate an exchange between two opposing nations. Seeing the trailers and knowing who was involved in this film, it would make one excited (if you know anything about Steven Spielberg or Tom Hanks). Bridge of Spies is a great example of historical story telling done at it's finest. Spielberg is no stranger to this feat. However this is an example of old school Hollywood, and it is not for everyone. There are two types of Spielberg history movies, the Saving Private Ryan (action packed, thrilling) and the Lincoln (great performances, talking based). Both are incredible movies for different reasons, and Bridge of Spies falls into the Lincoln category, where there isn't action, it is a film with a lot of talking. But it's those talking scenes where the movie comes to life, and a lot of that is thanks to the masterful directing of Steven Spielberg. Another big part why this movie is great are the performances. You have Tom Hanks, two time Oscar winner (Philadelphia 1993 and Forrest Gump 1994) who does amazing. What else can you expect from one of the best actors of all time. Also you have Mark Rylance (Rudolf Abel) who does, maybe just as good or even better than Hanks. Whenever he appeared on screen, he was electrifying. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets a nomination for best supporting actor come the Oscars. This is definitely not Spielberg's best, and has some slight negatives. At times, felt slow and the second act was not as strong as the first or third, but still solid. Overall, Bridge of Spies is a beautifully directed film, with amazing performances, and a great history lesson. It is written by the Coen Brothers, and composed wonderfully by Thomas Newman. This movie is not for everyone, but if your the type that gets goosebumps from watching people talk in a perfectly crafted scene, then this movie is for you."
"Tweekums","9","1","3","17 March 2017"," A gripping cold war thriller
","Set at the height of the cold war Soviet spy Rudolf Abel is arrested in New York; nobody is keen to represent him in court but eventually James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer with previous experience at the Nuremberg trials, takes on the job. He is not expected to do much more than go through the motions but he is determined that Abel will represented to the best of his ability even if that makes him unpopular. Donovan is adamant that Abel must be given the best defence as demanded by the US Constitution not doing so would make America little better than countries that don't have fair trials. Somewhat inevitably Abel is found guilty but Donovan makes a very logical plea against the expected death sentence if for no other reason he should be kept alive so that the United States will have somebody to trade if one of their spies is caught by the Soviets. Not long afterwards just such an event happens when US pilot Gary Powers is shot down while flying a U2 spy plane high over the Soviet Union. Shortly afterwards another American is arrested on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain; this time a student in East Berlin. Donovan soon finds himself in Berlin, where he is to negotiate with the Soviets to exchange Abel for Powers however he wants both Powers and the student; it won't be easy though as the latter is held by the East Germans and the CIA aren't at all bothered about getting him back; they just want Powers before he cracks and starts to spill secrets about the U2 project.<br/><br/>This is very much a film of two halves; both of them gripping. The first half is a court room drama where Donovan represents Abel to the best of his abilities even though it makes him very unpopular with a population that seems to think that anybody who represents a suspected spy is little better themselves; during this we also get scenes showing Powers entering the U2 programme and explanations of his mission before his eventual shooting down. These scenes serve to introduce the main characters and their situations but are still gripping in their own right. Tension raises significantly once the action moves to Berlin as it is made clear that if anything goes wrong while Donovan is in East Berlin he doesn't have any formal protection. There is a sense of anti-communist paranoia in America but this is nothing compared to the tension in East Berlin were people are being shot trying to cross the newly erected Berlin Wall. Tom Hanks does a great job as Donovan; an apparently ordinary man who has found himself in an extraordinary situation. Mark Rylance also stands out as Abel; a likable character with a dry sense of humour. Director Steven Spielberg does a fine job keeping the story gripping and capturing the feel of the era. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film."

He does establish that the US should treat its prisoners well at least for the hope that our imprisoned soldiers or agents will receive reasonable behavior from jailers.<br/><br/>In 1960, the Russians shoot down the U2 reconnaissance plane flown by Francis Gary Powers over the USSR, and imprison him afterward. Powers has a great deal of classified intelligence that might be divulged. The Russians want Abel back; the Americans want Powers back.<br/><br/>Delineation of conflicts: James is 'requested' to negotiate the swap, but is not given diplomatic recognition, and must work as a private citizen.

The movie looks good, and the actors do a good job.<br/><br/>It seems like they tried to make a movie that is a bit more nuanced than good versus evil, where the characters aren't just black or white, but complex moral beings. But it doesn't really succeed. I like the way they explore the act all of the nations has to put up, and how all of them blunders, but do try to avoid war. But at the same time, the movie does not take the time to show the East Germans and the Russians as more than narrow minded. It was a terrible situation, and it should not be excused, but even a big movie like this should try to do justice to the (very real) people who lived back then, on all sides of the conflict.

","James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is a lawyer who practices in 'insurance' law, but when he's tasked with defending Soviet spy and traitor Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) it proves to be a case that is not only career-defining for Donovan, but one that is also life-changing as well.<br/><br/>Bridge Of Spies was a film that did hold my interest and have me gripped (up until the conclusion of Abel's trial). However, from this point on, at least as far as I was concerned, it gradually became less and less interesting....<br/><br/>The first problem lies with how the film has been structured - Bridge Of Spies is a film that runs for over 2 hours, but in those 2 + hours the film essentially only has two threads hanging it together (Abel's trial and the exchange of prisoners). What you get here is about 45 minutes of trial and about 90 minutes of Donovan's various conversations with government officials. As I've said the first third of it is OK, but the final two thirds of the picture are repetitive and rather dull and it quickly becomes evident that the prisoner exchange aspect of the story does not necessitate 90 minutes worth of screen time.<br/><br/>The next issue lies with how imbalanced the whole film feels; as I've said great portions of the film are spent on both Abel's trial and on Donovan's wonderful negotiating skills in effecting the prisoner exchanges, but Spielberg and his team of scriptwriters (2 of whom are the Coen brothers) seem to overlook other aspects of the film such as what happened to Abel whilst he was in the US? What happened to Powers when he was captured in Russia? What happened to the American student whilst he was held in Germany? Spielberg sets all these plot points up on an assembly line, but doesn't delve deeper into any of these plot points which at times means that the film lacks depth and insight. I was particularly disappointed that Powers didn't factor as prominently in the story considering that he was quite an important character.<br/><br/>Rylance won an Oscar for his performance here which I personally found a bit puzzling (yes he's OK, but I didn't really see anything brilliant about his performance). Hanks again is OK but he generally gives a fairly stock 'everyman' performance which isn't that big a stretch for him.<br/><br/>When all is said and done I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed by Bridge Of Spies; to me it put too much focus in some areas and not enough focus in other areas which resulted in an imbalanced and poorly structured film. I think the best way to summarise it would be 'interesting subject matter that was poorly delivered.'"

The spying was primitive with those spying planes that had no chance what-so-ever to get through: the first one was the last one. On both sides they ended up with spies in their prisons kept nicely warm to be used in some political negotiations as leverage. <br/><br/>Consider the case of a Soviet spy in New York and that of an American pilot of a spying plane shot down over the USSR, plus the fact that East Germany turned tricky and led to the construction of the wall, and to top it all like the cherry of the cake one naïve American student preparing his PhD on communist economic policy in eastern Europe was at the wrong place at the wrong moment and got arrested and prosecuted as a spy by the East Germans. But the East Germans hated the Russians who had for sure liberated them from Hitler, but who had also destroyed Berlin in the most ruthless way possible, though the Palace of the Hohenzollern was pulled down by the East Germans. <br/><br/>Tricky situation indeed to negotiate the release of two Americans, one of whom is a real security risk in exchange of one Soviet spy. And it took some time and a lot of patience, including against the CIA who only wanted to recuperate the security hazard out of Soviet hands before he cracked. It took a lawyer from Brooklyn, a pure Irish descendant to manage to bridge the two or three divides to get what he wanted. All those among you who have actually lived this period will remember the stress, the danger, the fear amplified by what the film does not tell: the Bay of Pigs debacle in 1961 and the Soviet missile crisis in Cuba in 1962. We went through a few years of absolute scare about the possibility of a nuclear war.<br/><br/>We can measure the immense change we have been through: reunited Germany; united Europe (nearly finished though Russia will always be on the side); free and emerging Vietnam; China the second economic power in the world; apartheid gone with the wind; Cuba accepted anew by the USA; the banana republics of South America also gone. And yet the dangerous places have just moved to other areas and mostly because of the dumb policy of one US president who decided to solve the problem he had with his own father by proving to the world the USA could create havoc in the Middle East, and they did. And North Korea is the answer of the shepherdess to the shepherd: a perverted and fouled love song that prolongs the Korean War that was a total failure in the objective of the time to get Mao Zedong and the Communists in China down. <br/><br/>Is the world really a better place today than it was in 1957-1962? You have to be naïve to believe that. The main difference is that spying is no longer that crucial and it has been replaced by the protection of intellectual property against pirating. Pirates and Hackers are the two plagues or our modern world. More than ever the danger is no longer from the outside but from the inside. Let's move our minds and backsides a little bit and let's clean up the mess Bush Jr. did and all European countries, especially the super-duper secular ones who pretend that everyone has the right to be a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian, or whatever, provided it is kept absolutely invisible in the public sphere, are today confronted to the bill.<br/><br/>Dematerialization and castration of at least two generations of immigrants in Europe from previously colonized countries, which means at least three, four or more centuries of colonial alienation, exploitation and extermination when necessary leading to uprooting them from their countries and transporting them into countries that refused to recognize and respect the fact that they are different. As the fundamentalist secularists would say: ""They can believe in what they want provided I do not see it."" And the hazardous population is not outside but inside our borders. We have walled them up in our backyard without any rights whatsoever as for opinions and religions.<br/><br/>The old Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome we all in Europe inherited from centuries of wars and the two world wars was turned into a Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome called the Cold War and we are still in that mood. We see the danger outside when it is inside, and not inside our territory only but inside our minds. The new situation is that the PTSS of the Cold War is confronted today to the Post Traumatic Colonial Stress Syndrome of the uprooted millions of previously colonized people who we have brought in our countries for salaried slavery. And we think that by mocking the religion of these human beings who are suffering in their inner essence we will free them of their PTSS. Only Charlie can be that dumb. I am sure that kind of anti-empathetic attitude would have turned the 1957-1962 situation into a holocaust. And that's the real danger today. The Islamic State will be defeated but what do we do afterwards? Cartoons of the Prophet dicing onions? And I am trying hard to remain polite. I guess some secular fundamentalists do think so. Papaoutai? Really this time. https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=oiKj0Z_Xnjc. <br/><br/>Stromae help us out of this diabolical fix!<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","The movie Bridge of Spies (2015) is one that is based on true events and it is also one of those movies that should make everyone look around them at all times. Bridge of Spies (2015) has an amazing lineup cast with a story that will keep you entertained and captivated as you think of the real story behind the film. It's a film that shows how things go in the world as long as it all looks good in the public or on paper; it points out humanism even in those days to be no different and that we hadn't evolved much; other than being a larger consumer. Though aside from the obvious reasons of my interest and love for such a great film; everything about Bridge of Spies (2015) was on point. It is entertaining, the story-line and acting is spot on; and the time setting for the film along with the sets and film locations were perfect."
"gradyharp","10","1","3","14 February 2016"," 'It doesn't matter what others think. You know what you did.'
","The setting for this based on a true story film is the 10950s – that tense period when in America children were put through classroom drills in case of an expected (or rather, feared) nuclear attack form Russia. Most people had bomb shelters stocked with supplies for the propaganda response that the Cold War ruled everyone's thinking. Remember those days? If not then this film will most assuredly force you to stare at the anxiety that ruled the politics and the military and the populace during that awful time.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg directs a script created by the Coen Brothers and Matt Charman and has engaged a splendid cast that offers many insights into the thinking of that period. The story (for those who are shaky on facts and dates) is as follows: 'In the cold war, an insurance lawyer, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), who hasn't practiced criminal law since he was a prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials after World War II, is recruited by the CIA and involved in an intense negotiation mission to release and exchange a CIA U-2 spy-plane pilot, Francis G. Powers (Austin Stowell) who was arrested alive after his plane was shot down by the Soviet Union during a mission- with a KGB intelligence officer, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) who was arrested for espionage in the US. The strong anti- Communist mood at the time makes him a target from those (the general populace) who think Abel should just be executed. Abel is convicted but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence him to prison, rather than execute him, as they may at some point in the future want to swap him for an American spy the Soviets might have in custody. And of course Donovan's theory works, emphasizing the humanity that can resist fear of the unknown in the time of Cold War. <br/><br/>The cast is uniformly excellent with special kudos to Alan Alda, Sebastian Koch, Amy Ryan and of course Hanks and Rylance. Superb script, well re-enactment of an ugly part of our history, and some fine nuances about faith in the democratic system make this one of the finest films of the year."
"jtindahouse","7","1","3","11 February 2016"," Dry but Spielberg puts his stamp on it
","It's so nice to watch a director who's completely in charge of whatever it is he's making. Even if the end product isn't perfect or to your liking, you can still appreciate that you are watching a master of his craft at work. Steven Spielberg will always be one of those directors. It helps he always works with an incredible team and has amazing actors at his disposal to direct, but the fact remains his name alone is always a stamp of quality. 'Bridge of Spies' isn't perfect, I have very little interest in the Cold War, the story itself within the war did very little for me, and yet it was an absolute pleasure to watch. A sure sign of class. <br/><br/>The film has been nominated for Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. I think the nomination surprised some as it wasn't Spielberg's finest work, and it was missing some of the ""neccessaties"" when it comes to getting a nod, like a compelling love story (you could say there was one but you'd be stretched to do so). Films that are considered lucky to get a nomination are never any shot of actually winning the award, as they are just supposed to consider themselves lucky to be there in the first place. So sadly you won't be seeing 'Bridge of Spies' take home the award. A well deserved nomination nonetheless.<br/><br/>Also nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role is Mark Rylance. Rylance blew me away. He has an amazing ability to appear as though he's not trying in the least bit, and yet at the same time completely steal a scene - even from the likes of Tom Hanks. The Coen Brothers, along with Matt Charman, wrote some terrific and Oscar worthy dialogue for him to deliver admittedly, but it was no doubt him that brought those words to life. Everyone is going to have a tough time knocking Sylvester Stallone off his perch for the award this year but if anyone can do it I believe it's Rylance.<br/><br/>The only thing really holding it back from being great is that it's a touch dry. I never felt any emotion towards any character throughout the entire film. That, along with the fact that there is very little humour anywhere in the mix, can make it a tough watch at times. The quality though makes it worth the price of admission. Nothing is done half-heartedly, the sets are astonishing, even set on the actual bridge the events happened on. Hanks is his usual charismatic self and Rylance is in masterful form in every scene he's in. It's probably not one Spielberg will be most remembered for when we look back in 50 years, but I'm certain he'll still be proud to have it on his résumé."

","Especially with his adult entries, Steven Spielberg has made a claim for being perhaps America's most elegant filmmaker, with shrewd choices in material coupled with effective storytelling skills highlighted by precise framing and expert use of tracking cameras (in collaboration with his superb cinematographer Janusz Kaminski). ""Bridge Of Spies"", while not quite reaching the Hitchcockian suspense and psychological depth of ""Munich"", nonetheless is a very fine example of Spielberg working with commitment and intensity to provide the mature film-goer a satisfying, thoughtful experience. Here, the Cold-War plot (based on true events) is fairly cut-and-dried: a Russian spy (Mark Rylance), unsuccessfully defended by attorney Tom Hanks, is used as a negotiating tool to retrieve downed spy pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) and, against the wishes of the CIA spook (Scott Shepherd) fronting the mission in Berlin, a student trapped on the other side of the Wall (Will Rogers). Working from a beautifully written script by Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers (supressing their smarm for a change), Spielberg underplays the action, working off body and facial nuance and well-timed, eloquent dialogue. The performers act with grace, particularly Hanks, continuing his transformation into the elder statesman of Hollywood film, and Rylance, whose placidity in the face of abandonment and death is appealing and entertaining. The only thing marring the film is Thomas Newton's score: while understated, it appears at inappropriate moments, distracting from the action on screen. But this is a minor quibble. The overall result is plausible and accessible--a very admirable addition to the impressive yet under-appreciated Spielberg canon."

"lasttimeisaw","7","1","3","23 January 2016"," the government propaganda of individual patriotism mars the film
","Steven Spielberg's 27th feature film is a superiorly constructed retro-pigmented Cold War drama, inspired by the real-life happening of a prison exchange among USA, USSR and GDR in 1957, a fourth collaboration with Hanks, who plays our hero James B. Donovan, a New York lawyer, who is firstly appointed to defend a KGB spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance), and later, he is entrusted by CIA in negotiating the release of the American pilot Francis Gary Powers (Stowell), who is captured by Soviet Union during his spy mission, in exchange of Abel, which will be held in East Germany. Meanwhile an American graduate student Frederic Pryor (Rogers) has been arrested as a spy by GDR government, but in fact, he is innocent, out of his righteousness, James wants to change the 1-for-1 swapping to 2-1, insist both Powers and Pryor should be released, where CIA's only interest is Powers, so will everything turns out as James hopes?<br/><br/>Spielberg sensibly enacts a more true-to-life depiction of the espionage activity in the movie's slick opening, from the Hollow Nickel Case, Abel is introduced as a phlegmatic and practised old- hand, who can steadily erase the evidence while FBI is rummaging his room, and Mark Rylance, a UK thespian, whose theatre achievement is overwhelmingly distinguished, proves that he can upstage Hanks without steeping into theatrics, his portrayal of Abel as a docile, reasonable and undaunted figure leaps out to be the takeaway of the entire movie, with his offhand epigram towards James' impromptu questions like ""are you afraid?"" or ""are you worried?"". ""Does it help?"" shows his much prepared devotion to his dangerous cause, which is also the reason why he is able to win over James' admiration.<br/><br/>Hanks acts in his very comfort zone, being an overall good guy, like his previous effort in Paul Greengrass' CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013), his goody-goody persona, aka, a standing man, has become quite weary, this is where dwells my major beef about the film, the script (with Coen brothers on board) conveniently establishes James as a textbook example of safeguarding the basic human rights without mining into his own inner struggle, as if from the very first moment, he is set about to be the unyielding fighter, against all odds of being the public enemy No. 2 to defend a so-called traitor, even after his own house being attacked, there is no single doubt ever flicking over his complexion about whether he should proceed this taxing case. More excruciatingly, he is also the one who miraculously persuades the jingoistic judge Byers (Matthews) from making a death penalty verdict to Abel by foretelling a possible prisoner-exchange would benefit from keeping Abel alive, and single-handedly accomplishes the tough deal without any assistance (he cannot even stay in the Hilton hotel) in Berlin. Everything tastes like an in-your-face American government propaganda of individual patriotism and the tropes are rather banal and a bit disappointing from Spielberg and co., e.g. the intentional juxtapositions of two disparate treatments of captives between USA and USSR, and an overlong shot of the hand of the GDR lawyer Vogel (Koch) after being denied for a handshake after delivering Pryor.<br/><br/>But then, fairly speaking, the film is a stunning accomplishment from the production team and a captivating political drama which reflects the highest quality of Hollywood filmmaking presently, nominated for 6 Oscars this year, apart from BEST PICTURE and BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY, the other four are well-grounded (BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR for Rylance, BEST ORIGINAL SCORE, SOUND MIX and PRODUCTION DESIGN), but one might highly suspect it will go home empty- handedly."

","If you're a fan of historical dramas--films based on true stories and the like--then you definitely should check out ""Bridge of Spies"". I found this movie to be absolutely great, and it's very easy to see how and why it's been nominated for Best Picture.<br/><br/>Perhaps the strongest part of this film is its overall production. I didn't know a thing about the movie going into it (I watched it as part of my attempt at seeing all of the 2016 Best Picture nominees), and so I had no clue that it's a Steven Spielberg film. That said, when you see this movie you'll be reminded of what true craftsmanship looks like in a film production. The scenes, the camera work, pretty much everything in this film just comes together to make it an outstanding effort in filmmaking.<br/><br/>I also can say that I enjoyed Tom Hanks in this performance. I do sometimes have trouble getting into Tom Hanks movies these days, as he's sort of become too big of a star--I always see him as himself rather than as whoever he's playing on screen. That was true for ""Bridge of Spies"" as well, but the role of a random New York attorney in the middle of the 20th Century makes that whole aspect less bothersome than if he were playing a more well known historical figure.<br/><br/>All that said, I seriously considered giving this movie a perfect 10, and I can see how many people might do just that. I've held back from the perfect rating for one lone aspect, and that's that this movie probably doesn't have the ""epic"" feel to it that I tend to want to reserve a perfect score for. ""Bridge of Spies"" is a fantastic movie that will entertain you for a couple of hours--but fifteen years from now it's probably not going to be a movie that you remember too much about. The story provides great escapism for the moment, but it just isn't so mind blowing or suspenseful that it warrants being thought of in the same category as, for me, an ""Unforgiven"" or a ""Chinatown"". Thus my 9/10 star rating."

","There was a recent case when a lawyer nominated to represent a terrorist in India faced a lot of flak in the media. People were just aghast at a killer getting legal representation and a comfortable cell, all at the cost of a society he had sworn to wipe off the face of the earth.<br/><br/>James B. Donovan brings to life the very same dilemma and drives home the need for a civilised society to accord basic human rights to even the most depraved criminals. And to make such a delicate case, you need a Spielberg and a Tom Hanks. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks brings a certain sincerity to the role that makes every word, every thought of Donovan believable. He perfectly depicts the angst of a man denied the chance to do what he believes, nay, knows is right. He keeps quiet when the judge does so, but let's the CIA agent have a mouthful. A quiet, short, but very strong lecture on being American. <br/><br/>This is the Spielberg touch, subtly slipping in strong messages. The rescued pilot's desperation to prove he wasn't broken, Agent Abel's grim future after returning to the USSR, these are all conveyed so very subtly, but firmly. James Donovan being sidelined in his firm.after the appeal is as subtly conveyed to him as to the audience, but neither is in any doubt.<br/><br/>Same is the case with young Pryor. He could have been left as a name, generating no empathy with us. Or he could have led a lesser storyteller to digress from the plot. But Spielberg gives him just the right amount of screen time. It enables us to empathise with Donovan's desperation to exceed his brief.<br/><br/>Mark Rylance was an absolute delight. He depicts the Soviet spy exactly as was required. A stereotypical depiction would have made the audience too hate Donovan for supporting a monster. Mark Rylance portrays the calm acceptance of a man who knows the exact nature of his job and is pragmatic about the outcomes. <br/><br/>And it is his description of Donovan that could have been an alternate title for the movie - Standing Man."

","Steven Spielberg is one of Hollywood's most prolific Directors. He does not have the best track record and yet he creates far more great films than poor ones. It will come as little of a shock then that Bridge of Spies is a great film, with Spielberg on fine form, showcasing tremendous showmanship, craft and talent. Bridge of Spies bears the distinction of being his best film since Saving Private Ryan, so applause in this case is necessary.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Bridge of Spies is set in the fifties in America, during the time of the Cold War. James B Donovan works as a lawyer, but soon the CIA involves him with a suspected Soviet Spy by the name of Rudolf Abel. They ask Donovan to help Abel out in court. What they really mean is to make the proceedings look civilised and yet they all know that Abel does not have a hope in hell. That is until Donovan is willing to truly help him.<br/><br/>What Bridge of Spies has really got going for it is an element of intrigue as well as a dash of surprise and suspense. How often is it that we get a film set in the fifties with the amount of drama, wit and excitement that Director Steven Spielberg and writers Joel and Ethan Coen can stir up in us? It's rare for a match between material, writers and director that is quite literally made in heaven. With Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance at the helm, Bridge of Spies is exceedingly well acted and I am not a loyal devotee of Hanks, but here oh my goodness how he shines like never before! His character has heart, warmth and humour. The most important aspects in making us love a character. He is not once misjudged. Thank the marvellous writing from the Coen Brothers for that one!<br/><br/>Still considering the talent involved when you have the Coens on board, in all honesty I wanted Bridge of Spies to be a greater film than it actually amounts to. But don't get me wrong this is terrific film making. Yet there's something lacking. What is it? A sense of flowing momentum and precision. Which is all to do with the script. At first glance there's no problem to be had here. Yet upon further scrutiny it does not hold up. My main issue? We are shown scenes that do not need to be seen. They detract from the thrust of the story. We almost forget about Donovan and that's a crime itself. Luckily it's only for ten minutes at a time, but I must admit that these departures from the essence and heart of the story do hurt the film. It's also too long for its own good and I strongly suspect that Spielberg inflated the runtime so that the Academy would pay more attention to the film during awards season. The gamble does not pay off.<br/><br/>But let's not get negative here. Bridge of Spies is no question or doubt in my mind an excellent film. Not perfect alas. But brilliant all the same. If anything its further proof that Steven Spielberg is the best at what he does in the business. Particularly if the subject matter is a) A Biopic b) centred around a well-drawn individual and c) about courage in the hardest to find places. Spielberg don't ever stop making movies while I'm around.<br/><br/>B+"
"CinemaClown","Null","1","3","24 December 2015"," A Riveting Espionage Thriller That's Consistently Thrilling Despite Its Lack Of Action
","Marking the fourth collaboration between Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks, Bridge of Spies is an elegantly crafted, cleverly narrated & sincerely performed spy-thriller from the esteemed filmmaker who, even in what can be termed as his semi-retirement phase, continues to thrill & surprise us with stories that may not be as magical as his best works but still make up for an enriching experience.<br/><br/>Inspired by true events, the story of Bridge of Spies is set in the 1960s during the Cold War and follows an insurance lawyer who is recruited to defend a Soviet spy, to give the illusion of a fair trial which in actuality turns out to be completely one-sided. But when an American spy plane pilot is caught by the Soviets, he's asked by the CIA to facilitate the exchange of spies between the two hostile nations.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg, Bridge of Spies continues his recent fascination with setting a drama around historical events and is another masterful work from the notable filmmaker that's thoroughly captivating from start to finish. While the story is dialogue-driven, the film has the structure of a cat-and-mouse game that keeps the interest alive and is wonderfully anchored by sensible performances from its cast.<br/><br/>Production design team does a splendid job in recreating the timeline its story is set in with all the necessary details in place. Cinematography follows the mantra that other dramas by Spielberg carry and brilliantly reflects the grim period with its slightly darkened images. The pacing is steady and top-notch editing ensures that only relevant moments stay in the final print. Also, it's is one of those rare Spielberg flicks that's not scored by John Williams but Thomas Newman does well to fill up the void.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Bridge of Spies features a much mature & dependable cast in Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan, Alan Alda & others, amongst which Hanks & Rylance impress the most. Hanks is at his usual best in the role of James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer assigned to defend the arrested Soviet spy in the court and later helps in negotiating a prisoner exchange deal between US & USSR. Rylance plays the Soviet spy with effortless ease and owns almost every scene he appears in.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Bridge of Spies is a refreshing entry in the genre of espionage thrillers that's deftly scripted and confidently brought to life under Spielberg's assured direction & Hanks' reliable performance. The plot brims with political tension, has its own set of twists n turns, and is consistently gripping despite its lack of action. The year of 2015 has already seen its fair share of spy-thrillers but Bridge of Spies is definitely amongst the best ones to surface and marks another successful collaboration between Spielberg & Hanks. Definitely recommended."
"dromasca","6","1","3","23 December 2015"," Spielberg takes on the Cold War
","So after sharks, dynos, extra-terrestrials, WWII, Holocaust, Olympics terrorism, future, Lincoln and handful of other themes, it's the turn of the Cold War to be processed, re-created and brought to screen in the vision of Steven Spielberg. 'Bridge of Spies' inspired by the historical character of James B. Donovan, defender of the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and then main negotiator in the spies exchange that set him free for the US pilot Gary Powers downed while in a mission over the USSR, is also the first movie in the political thriller genre directed by Spielberg.<br/><br/>Had the script of this film been written by Ken Follett or the late Robert Ludlum, I would probably have accepted much easier the outcome. However, when brothers Coen are two of the three authors of the script I would have expected more than a smooth narrative structure and well written dialogs (in many moments). There is almost nothing of the sparks or daring insolence of many of the scripts in the films directed by the two. The story is roughly divided into two parts, and the tentative to synchronize the two threads (Abel's story and Powers' story) fail not only because they were separated in time by five years but also because it is only the first that has interesting material and consistency. The lawyer who does the right thing defending the rights of a criminal who presumably caused harm to his own country in time of what some perceived as war is too gross an analogy to the contemporary fight against terror viewed from a liberal point of view. The second part is more like the classical East Berlin spy stories, but here again the schematic description of East Berlin and of the Eastern German policemen and even officials lacks authenticity and complexity.<br/><br/>We are left with enjoying two formidable performances by Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan and especially by Mark Rylance and Rudolf Abel. I am looking forward to the nominations for the Academy Awards and I hope that Rylance will get at least an Actor in a Supporting Role nomination. His act here is my favorite from all 2015 movies I have seen until now. On the other hand the political messages that this film tries to convey are much too obvious. Yes, they are important, but important messages are not well served when the style gets that close to propaganda. Actually the genre this film is closer than other is the Western. One lonely hero fights for justice against the whole world and wins against all odds. It's just that the century is the 20th and the hero is not using his gun, but is a lawyer. Problem is that the analogy does not work very well in this recent film of Spielberg."

","Bridge of Spies<br/><br/>What a delightfully wonderful movie! Tom Hanks, you are the best. For the past two days, I watched a lot of movies; they included some big names such as Sicario, The Martian, The Revenant, Creed, and The Hateful 8. No disrespect to any of those titles- they were all good- but surprisingly Bridge of Spies stood out. In fact I was least thrilled to watch it. <br/><br/>So what is it that makes a movie stand out? Why was Bridge of Spies so good? The sheer delight and joy, during and after watching, of a beautiful cinema; the moment you say ""Wow! that was good"" after the movie ends; and the picture of Tom Hanks lingering in your head long after the movie is over. You know that the movie was good.Keeping all these in mind, I decided to check its ratings. Guess what? In high sevens, that is low, and it is further going to go down- maybe stabilize around mid way. But I thought that it really deserved an eight.<br/><br/>Obviously, there are some questions which I had? Why did not Tom Hanks research his client? Defending a guilty and getting him acquitted is a greater crime. We knew Abel was a spy, but Donovan did not. So did Abel confide to Donovan about him being a spy? If so, shouldn't he not defend Abel or help the government- FBIs,CIAs? Or was he just fighting on humanitarian grounds? Did he feel the treatment given to Abel was not apt, but then who was he to decide? Further, did Abel play with Donovan with his story? Was it brilliant on part of Abel to take a shot in dark making him the real puppeteer? Further, was Donovan so a strict follower of rules- attorney client privileges, even if Abel told Donovan the truth-that he was ready to betray his country? In short was Donovan a traitor? I find all these aspects of the movie fascinating, and looking forward to further deliberation.<br/><br/>The dialogs were crisp and beautifully written. One of my favorite scene is the first conversation between Donovan and Russian spy posing as a secretary in Soviet embassy in East Germany. Another was the contrast between composure of an agent and that of Donovan during exchange.<br/><br/>I recommend-A Must Watch."

","It definitely isn't in the league with Spielberg's best ones, but it delivers the story quite well. <br/><br/>In short, this is a cold war politic drama, not by any means an action one. For a history buff like me this indeed is an interesting piece but for someone who couldn't care less, this might not be the best pick. The movie has a great balance of seriousness and spicy comedy, kicking the audience every once in a while. <br/><br/>The movie has a Hitchcockish opening. Camera moves smoothly and conveys the story most of the time perfectly. The comedy kicks in almost instantly and keeps you interested in otherwise grayish second act while going through the necessary clues to prepare us for the third act. At the second act you kind of feel like the story wasn't enough interesting to be a two and a half hour long. Although Coen brothers wrote the script I was pretty disappointed that, from time to time, Spielberg decided to use flat dialogue rather than letting the picture talk.<br/><br/>It's a well told story, so if you find the subject interesting, you will enjoy it."
"troyputland","9","1","3","14 December 2015"," Bridge of Spies is a thrilling drama with a witty script.
","Steven Spielberg. Tom Hanks. Mark Rylance. Joel Coen. Ethan Coen. Five reasons to love this film. Spielberg's directing is top notch, Hanks and Rylance's acting's cutting edge and the Coen's writing adds comedy to a serious film. There are two parts to Bridge of Spies. First part sees Hanks' lawyer defending Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance) during the Cold War. In the second part Hanks' James B. Donovan negotiates a prisoner exchange; Abel for a captured American pilot. The coming together of the cast and crew make Bridge of Spies a riveting watch. Tensions are constantly high, even though there's minimal action. The few jokes spread throughout make it no less thrilling. Mark Rylance and Hanks are superb. It's hard to say whether one outdoes the other when they share the screen time."
"lucasversantvoort","8","1","3","14 December 2015"," Definitely not a bridge too far
","Spielberg's been more and more interested in 'true stories' lately, what with him directing War Horse, Lincoln and so on. The same goes for Bridge of Spies, the story of how one insurance lawyer managed to negotiate the exchange between a Soviet spy and an American army pilot in East Berlin during the Cold War. Spielberg, armed with a script co-written by--of all people--the Coen brothers (oh ya betcha, yaaa!), manages to bring this piece of history to life, as a film about history should.<br/><br/>1957. A Russian spy, Abel (Mark Rylance), is arrested in New York. James Donovan (Tom Hanks), an insurance lawyer is brought on to defend him. But, he is told, it's basically a farce, since everyone and their mother wants to see this guy hang. The trial is merely to show the world he was treated fairly. Donovan takes his duties seriously, however, and defends Abel to the best of his abilities, to the dismay of pretty much the entire populace. During this time, his relationship with Abel seems to develop into a strange friendship, a sort of mutual understanding despite their differences. The judge presiding over the case wants to see Abel found guilty as much as anyone, but Donovan manages to persuade him to sentence him to jail rather than the chair. At this point, the film's second half begins. An American pilot on a top-secret mission is shot down and captured by the Russians and the CIA asks for Donovan's help in arranging the exchange: Abel for the pilot. Donovan travels to East Berlin, around the time the Berlin Wall was being built, to meet with the Russians, to have the conversations their governments can't.<br/><br/>What I found most appealing is something that is ironically also probably the source of that Spielberg-ian sense of Americana: James Donovan's sense of honor. James and Abel find each other in a way. They value each other's sense of honor and duty. Donovan argues in court that America should behave according to its own well-established rules, even during wartime, otherwise you're also dismissing the Constitution and how could you possibly represent American and all it stands for if you do that? Spielberg must have felt Donovan's message was relevant today. Then again, whenever we see Abel being fairly treated in prison (the way Donovan would've wanted), it's immediately contrasted with how the American pilot is harshly interrogated in Russia, so there's also a righteous America vs brutal Russia undertone, perhaps referring to how the Russia of today is fairing under Putin. Maybe both meanings apply simultaneously, with Spielberg urging humane behavior from both world powers.<br/><br/>If there's one thing the film doesn't sell well, it's the family scenes. Amy Ryan gets the unfortunate role of the nagging wife. That's selling her a bit short, but every time we see her, she's worried about Donovan, the family, the way society perceives them. That's her primary emotion: worry. And what about the son? There was not a single scene where I believed I was watching a father-son relationship. I get that he symbolizes the poisonous influence of those prepare-yourself-against-the-Russians video's from the fifties, but how am I supposed to take him seriously when their house is fired upon and they first thing this kid does is eagerly say he followed the correct procedure in case the Russians attacked them? If they wanted to increase the emotional stakes with the family scenes, well, they failed miserably.<br/><br/>Another (minor) complaint is the build-up to Francis Gary Powers' plane crash. It's just technical stuff we learn here. We're not becoming emotionally attached to Francis at all. Therefore, the only tense part of his inevitable capture is the CGI-ridden crash itself. You introduced the student only minutes before his capture, so why does the pilot deserve all this endless build-up? Either do a build-up like this right, or let it end up on the cutting room floor. The film's long enough as it is.<br/><br/>Overall though, the film's quite good. The drama is never overbearing, the film manages to infuse the proceedings with a sense of humor that essentially ridicules this strange part of history (perhaps à la Strangelove) and, even with what I consider some superfluous scenes, it's wonderfully paced. Definitely not a bridge too far."
"khang_tran","8","1","3","12 December 2015"," Spielberg and Hanks reunion delivers once more in a solid spy movie
","After a small hiatus, Steven Spielberg returns with the untold story of James B. Donovan. An insurance lawyer who is initially chosen to defend a captured Russian spy during the peak of the Cold War. This plays out as a real lose-lose situation for Donovan, as the US justice system isn't intending to actually give the Russian spy a fair trial. Furthermore, Donovan and his family's image will be blemished as he is defending an enemy of the state. Eventually, he is even tasked to negotiate a trade between this Russian spy and a captured American spy plane pilot and a third party captive from the DDR. With all these political standpoints to consider, it is extremely difficult to juggle with these numerous perspectives in a film and not lose its direction. Luckily, Spielberg is a master at it. Long gone are the days of Spielberg blockbusters and battle epics. He now carefully chooses his projects, telling the stories he wants to in the way he sees fit. With a resume as glorious as his, it is a privilege he has more than earned. Spielberg knows the tone he wants for this movie and keeps it consistent throughout the film. <br/><br/>The pace of the movie is rather slow, but consistent nonetheless. There is an exhilarating airplane sequence in the middle of the film, but that is where the high-stake action ends. The movie mostly keeps it tension with timely placed images and scenes that show the possible risk of nuclear war at the time. <br/><br/>What really carries the movie is the presence of Tom Hanks. In his fourth collaboration with Spielberg, Hanks is perfectly cast as Jim Donovan who is the heart and moral compass throughout the movie. His performance brings warmth and charisma to the character, depicting him as a devoted father and lawyer. An excellently written character. Unfortunately, it's the only character to receive such treatment. The screenplay, which is written by the legendary Coen brothers, is cleverly composed as it carefully meanders its way around possible pitfalls in misunderstanding political and judicial regulations. Character depth however, seems to be lacking. Many characters Hanks interacts with are fairly shallow, serving mostly as sources of exposition to further the story. None are really memorable even though a stellar cast was available (Alan Alda, Amy Ryan etc.) This all makes Mark Rylance's performance all the more impressive, as he plays the Russian spy Rudolf Abel. He is depicted as a stoic man, a talented artist who enjoys classical music and is of loyal service to his country. At first he seems a bit odd and awkward, with no real social ties to anyone. But keep in mind that these people usually make the best spies. Mark Rylance has few dialogue to work with, but expresses himself in brilliant subtlety through facial expressions. He and Tom Hanks have nice chemistry together, as they learn to appreciate each other as honorable men who stick to their principles after being put in these unfortunate circumstances. It's a shame that he is pretty underused in this movie. <br/><br/>Finally, a real strong point of this movie is how visually stunning it looks. Spielberg's longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, takes the Cold War era and films in it a cold somber tone. He uses an autumn-like color pallet and alongside excellent lighting and near-perfect scene composition, makes every frame look like an oil painting. In addition, Bridge of Spies also contains a delightful score from Thomas Newman, which only starts 30 minutes into the movie, and has gorgeous set pieces which really transport you back to the 1950s. <br/><br/>In summary, Bridge of Spies is a skillfully made film and a great example of how Steven Spielberg has not lost his touch in brilliantly directing movies. Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance give brilliant performances, but the rather slow pace, lack of character depth in supporting actors and use of political jargon and exposition can feel a bit dull at times. Not one of Spielberg's best, but that still means it's probably going to be nominated for an Oscar."

Tom Hanks stars as the brilliantly smart, wise, and very likable character while trying to do the best that he can for his country and relations with the Soviet Union, he becomes caught in a moving tale of an eye for eye, and doing the morally right thing, no matter what is safe.<br/><br/>Honestly though, the film took a while to get going for me, as the film mainly consist of men in suits talking and drinking, along with some brilliant dramatic music. However, when we come to the main plot of this exchange in Berlin, the film pulls you in, and now you never want to fall asleep. Even if the event is known to you, you are feeling the suspense.<br/><br/>You also get a real life feel of what it was like during the cold war and the tension between the USA and Soviet Union, which makes it a powerful film.

Idealistic lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) agrees to represent him, at a great personal cost to himself and his family. But as the situation escalates, and casualties start being taken on the Russian side, it builds to a dramatic settlement outside the courtroom that will test both sides.<br/><br/>Hanks and Spielberg are almost like their own company, obviously an effective partnership that has produced a number of high quality, epic productions over the years. The first thought bound to run through your mind when you see the latest offering from them is: what can go wrong? And so, the third film in a row I've reviewed that's been about spies unravels before me. Artistically, it's everything you'd expect on the tin, two seasoned professionals doing their thing and delivering the goods. In the end, though, it's just a bit too under-whelming to be great.<br/><br/>In a day and age of relentless, flashy, fast paced CGI spectacles, it is refreshing to see such an intelligent and intricate story up on the big screen, taking its time to unfold and present all the facts. The drama itself does need to be pretty compelling, though, and sadly Bridge of Spies doesn't always maintain the most exciting pace. Hanks himself is serviceable, but hardly gives the most stirring performance of his career. But then, the trailer promised a dramatization of a man who risks losing everything, whose endurance and sanity are pushed to the very limit, but the script just never really delivers this, just a slow, plodding trot to the end, so he hardly finds himself stretched.<br/><br/>It's an undeniably well made, intelligent and generally involving affair, if you're willing to pay attention, it just could have done with a little more meat on the bones underneath. ***"

"moviescriticnet","8","1","3","8 December 2015"," Worth watching film
","What is the common element of all Steven Spielberg's films? Whether it's ET calling home or a lawyer negotiating with Russians during the cold war, the story is presented in an absolutely epic way, like depeche mode use increased decibels to power up their music.The first part of the movie is a courtroom drama featuring the story of a professional lawyer with some strong personal ethics defending the ""evil"" Russian spy and it reminded me of ""Philadephia"" (also starring Tom Hanks). Τhe second (and longest) part of the film is the espionage/film-noir one, featuring the negotiations of the lawyer with East Germany and Russia to the exchange of the Russian spy with Americans. The story is largely based on true events but of course there is always room for some subtle American propaganda and epic dramaturgy, Spielberg's specialty. Tom Hanks plays his role with great maturity and efficiency and the story is compact, despite the long duration of the film (141 mins). I guess the point of the film is that ethics and common sense are rare qualities that can really change the world. Still, the fact that the film is after all a strongly presented biography doesn't allow it to be a really classic film-noir film. Nevertheless it's worth watching."
"paulmcuomo","8","1","3","8 December 2015"," Standing Man is the subtle bad ass in this great Spielberg movie
","Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have worked together on previous occasion - the most successful collaboration being 1999's Saving Private Ryan. Whilst that was an all-out, realistic, intense war film, this is a quiet, contemplative war film.<br/><br/>The film hangs its chances of success on the performances of Hanks and experienced Shakespearian actor Mark Rylance; both of them are great in different ways. Hanks is an everyman character, which he's become accustomed to, but allows for moments of humour present in many of his quips, and in a scene where he slowly deconstructs a CIA agent for prying into his relationship with Abel (the spy). He doesn't give as emotional or urgent a performance as he did in Captain Phillips, Cast Away, Forrest Gump or Philadelphia, but this certainly is a great standalone piece of work. As Rudolph Abel, Mark Rylance is so subdued that it's understandable why the real life Abel was so successful a spy; the way he quietly goes about his duties, commands the people holding him captive, and how he stays unbelievably calm in spite of the seriousness of the situation is almost boss like. At times his understating was slightly awkward, but the overall effect was very effective.<br/><br/>The production values are really high in this movie, and each place feels different; America is warm and bright in colour, East Germany is colder - and has a cooler palate. The distinction emphasises the Everyman being a hero and strengthens the film. Some might say it could be conceived as pro-American, I view it as good directing and strengthening the story.<br/><br/>The script is great, overall. It has a lot of information to unload about all the main players in the story - James Donovan, Abel, and also Gary Powers and Frederick Prior - and it does handle it effectively. It does play a little bit to Biopic traits in the structure and pacing, but the focus on Abel and Donovan keeps us invested and interested. In the catalogue of films by Hanks and Spielberg, this movie stands at the higher end of those scales. It's a great, quiet war film, with a great, quiet, resilient character at the centre."

","The first thing that struck me about Bridge of Spies was just how beautiful it was. The film is gorgeously shot, every frame seems like a painting. But the film's visuals are not the only good thing you can say about it. It is a solid, well acted drama with an engaging story that won't leave fans of the genre disappointed.<br/><br/>Overall I have nothing but good things to say about it and I would highly recommend it. There are however some minor nitpicks. The film strikes one as very good but it never rises to excellent when you get the feeling that it could have. The film is done by professionals who know their craft and thus the film is well polished but lacks that special spark, a deeper substance in the story that would make you love it instead of merely liking it, however much.<br/><br/>Of course all of that could be merely a question of preference and for some this movie would be satisfying enough. Again, I have nothing bad to say against Bridge of Spies. I thoroughly enjoyed and have already included it in my list of top movies of 2015."
"rubenm","8","1","3","7 December 2015"," Spielberg dish, seasoned with Coen spices
","Who would ever have thought that the Coen Brothers would co-write a film directed by Steven Spielberg? At first sight, it seems a very improbable combination. On the one hand the traditional Hollywood giant of blockbuster fame, and on the other hand the unruly creators of weird characters and unorthodox stories.<br/><br/>This could have been a disaster: a terrible clash of two styles of film making. But in fact, it is a wonderful cooperation. The film is mostly made according to the standard Spielberg recipe of big drama, but seasoned with some very tasteful spices of Coen-like creativity and dry humour.<br/><br/>I think I recognized some very clear Coen-moments in the film. At one point the hero of the story, American lawyer James Donovan, walks into the Russian embassy in Berlin hoping to meet an official called Mr Vogel, but instead is greeted by a bunch of rumpled peasants. This is, I think, typical for the Coen Brothers. One other very recognizable Coen-moment is Donovan's visit to the East German prosecutor, who picks up the wrong phone. This whole scene is filmed in the slightly surrealistic way that characterizes many Coen-films <br/><br/>'Bridge of Spies' is a cold war drama. It tells the true story of a righteous American lawyer who defends a Russian spy, learns to appreciate his professionalism and subsequently is asked to negotiate an exchange of prisoners in Berlin. The screenplay is very clever, with three spy stories woven into one narrative: the Russian spy in the US, an American pilot who is captured by the Russians after his plane is shot down, and an American student who happens to be in the wrong part of Berlin when the Wall is built.<br/><br/>Sometimes Spielberg accentuates the dramatic effects a bit too much, for example when the student tries to leave the Eastern section of Berlin and sees how the last peace of concrete closes the Wall between him and the West. But on the whole this film is cinematographic craftsmanship at its very best. The screenplay keeps on introducing new, exciting story elements, the sober but effective acting by Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance is spot on, and the period sets recreate the Cold War era perfectly. It is hard not to like this film."

","One more credit to Spielberg. It's a very good entertainment movie. Sound and writing is on it's place, as expected. Mark Rylance makes an excellent interpretation on Rudolf Abel, in my opinion. Abel is a very charismatic and enigmatic person who never brakes up with his duty. In the other hand, Tom Hanks as Donovan, keeps the movie going on it's espionage suspance, although against most of the American people. Donovan keeps doing he's lawyer work as he knows best, believing that behind the Russian spy is a good person who was just following orders years ago. The movie gets intense in the end when the main reason of the movie takes place. Personally, i was expecting a different ending, however the producer didn't want to make a ""show off"" scene, which i can understand since the movie is based on real facts."
"PipAndSqueak","8","1","3","5 December 2015"," Would it help?
","This is a very creditable attempt at telling the real story of 'Rudolf Abel' and the Cold War shenanigans that happened after the Second World War. Rylance manages to give a slight Scot's accent to Abel who was in fact born near Newcastle Upon Tyne (i.e. he would have spoken with a Geordie dialect). Never mind, Rylance conveys with perfect restraint the imperturbable front any spy worth his salt ought to aspire. This compares starkly with the slightly inept attempt at 'keeping secrets' shown by his American swappee, Powers, when subjected to interrogation. Spielberg manages to apply rose tinted spectacles at strategic points but thankfully, not too detrimentally. Compelling to watch for both Hanks' and Rylance's performances, you may be tempted to find out more about the characters they portray. Nice intro to the history!"

They are all here, plus Spielberg's renowned direction and a sterling performance by Tom Hanks in the lead role. The movie is doing well at the box office for which it can thank its bankable names and gripping main sequences - it's hard to go wrong with a high profile trial followed by a prisoner exchange, with some Cold War hysteria thrown in for good measure. All provide lots of tension without standing in the way of some very interesting character development. The relationship between Hanks and Rylance is really well managed. What great actors they both are: in their scenes together there is so much superb interaction in speech and body language. The New York and Berlin locations are exceptionally well recreated, a positive joy to watch. A lot of research, thought and professionalism have gone into this film. Some issues: not much material for the female lead to work with (blame that on the time setting), a bit of a sag in the transition between NYC and East Berlin, some clumsy humour (the so-called family and the delivery bikes in the corridor) and that trademark Spielberg sentimentality in the closing scenes.

","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>When a Soviet spy (Mark Rylance) in the height of the Cold War is arrested, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is recruited to defend him in an American trial. Meanwhile an American pilot is captured by the Soviets, thrusting Donovan into the responsibility of negotiating between two world powers on the brink of war. Bridge of Spies, balances the gravity of politics on a world stage with the relations and fears of the people behind it all. This film is yet another great example of what Spielberg and Hanks can achieve when they team up together. Will this be a classic from years to come? I expect not, but the quality of acting and directing is undeniable.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>Considering Spielberg being one of the best directors and Hanks being one of the best actors in the Hollywood business, it is hard not to get excited for this movie. I'm not completely familiar with the real-world story, so I can't say much on the accuracy but on the movie of course I have my opinion to share.<br/><br/>In terms of the performances, everybody was flawless but the clear stand-outs for me was Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance. The character Donovan is unwavering when it comes to his duty as a lawyer, even when he has to defend an enemy of his country. He believes in the importance of unbiased justice, so strongly that at first it may come off as naÃ¯ve. However, there are understated moments where we can see clearly his resolve being tested to the limits. Mark Rylance as the Soviet spy, is a man of few words but with that limitation he is able to convey so much about the character. He is defeated and fearful for his life, but when Donovan shows that there is still hope he will crack a joke. The key here is subtlety, that brings the power into the more dramatic moments without it feeling forced. I didn't feel like I was watching actors, I felt like I was watching real people.<br/><br/>Another aspect that really grabbed my attention is the Cold War setting. It is of course the perfect time period for any political thriller story (a real one at that). Despite it being decades ago, it is hard not to see the parallels between the Cold War era and present day. We get to see the xenophobia in USA surrounding communists and Soviet spies, people quick to draw conclusions from their emotion. Could we really say things are any different now? Unfortunately not. So it is interesting how the movie feels relevant in modern day politics. The second half of the movie shows the delicate nature of negotiations. There are moments of manipulations, lies, and deceit. Yet through all that a trust has to be built to have any movement in the talks. How the characters try to build that relation for mutual benefit is what intrigued me the most.<br/><br/>I only have one complain, that is it feels like two movies in one. The first half feels like legal drama, and the second half is a political thriller. So I would've liked more consistency between the two plot lines. Bridge of Spies, in the end achieves the authenticity in its characters and the setting. That's why I highly recommend seeing this movie. Personally, movies (not documentaries) that are based on real stories should prioritise authenticity and not accuracy. That I think are two very different things that deserves a whole entire post to explain."
"sol-","Null","1","3","23 November 2015"," A flawed but interesting insight into Cold War tension
","Based on the true story of an American insurance lawyer who wound up negotiating spy exchanges during the Cold War, 'Bridge of Spies' does a sterling job depicting tensions and insecurities during one of the most volatile periods in US history. While the focus of the film is always the American lawyer, played by Tom Hanks, the film successfully weaves in several subplots that hint at what it was like to live during the Cold War. Most potently, the lawyer's son becomes obsessed with preparing for nuclear disaster after watching one too many propaganda films at school. Not so successfully woven in are two subplots involving the men who Hanks has to negotiate getting back in exchange for a captured Russian spy. The time-line of events in the film is also a little incredulous; no sooner has Hanks pleaded for the Russian's spy life to be spared in case of prisoner exchange is a prisoner exchange suddenly put on the table. Never to mind, Mark Rylance is superb as the Russian spy who hilariously keeps asking ""would it help?"" whenever Hanks asks him if he is worried. In fact, there is quite a bit of oddball humour in the film (Burghart Klaussner answering the wrong phone, etc), which can probably be chalked up to the Coen Brothers script. Furthermore, one of the film's strongest assets is how it balances light humour and very grim drama. As icing on the cake, the film looks superb with accurate period sets/costumes and lots of fluid, mobile camera-work from Janusz Kaminski. Thomas Newman provides an effective score too in lieu of John Williams."

"Hellmant","9","1","3","13 November 2015"," I teared up, on multiple occasions!
","'BRIDGE OF SPIES': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's new Cold War drama film; about an American lawyer trying to arrange a prisoner swap, with the Soviet Union. The story is based on the 1960 U-2 incident; it was written by Matt Charman, and the Coen Brothers (marking the second film in a row, that was co-written but not directed by the brothers; following last year's 'UNBROKEN'). The movie stars Tom Hanks (in his 4th collaboration with Spielberg), and it costars Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan, Austin Stowell, Scott Shepherd, Jesse Plemons and Alan Alda. The film has received rave reviews from critics and moviegoers alike, and it's considered a likely Oscar contender, at next year's Academy Awards. I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The film begins in 1957 Brooklyn, New York; where Rudolf Abel (Rylance) is arrested by FBI agents, and charged with conspiracy. An insurance lawyer, named James B. Donovan (Hanks), is hired as his defense. Donovan takes the job very seriously, despite a corrupt court system, and hatred from a biased public. Abel is convicted of all charges, but Donovan is able to convince the judge (Dakin Matthews) to spare his life; on the chance that Abel might prove valuable, as a bargaining tool with the USSR in the future. His predictions come true, when an American U-2 spy plane pilot (Stowell) is captured by the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>The movie is extremely predictable, even if you're not familiar with the history behind it, but it's still very well made. Hanks gives another outstanding performance; and Rylance is very impressive as well, in his supporting role. The film is beautifully shot, edited and scored; it's classic Steven Spielberg (doing what he does best). I was especially moved by the movie, and teared up on multiple occasions. It's a must see!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/f4ptmnmXTWE"

","James Donovan: ""Aren't you worried?""<br/><br/>Rudolf Abel: ""Would it help?""<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies takes place during the Cold War, an American lawyer is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers.<br/><br/>So I finally just watch Bridge of Spies and it was pretty damn good. Steven Spielberg once again made a great movie, and just like I said about Ridley Scott about how great it is that we still can go to the cinema today and see a new movie directed by an icon.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is the type of director you never know what you're going to get and I'm talking about the type of film making he uses. Spielberg will always make a well directed movie even when some of his movies are not great or something you'll never watch again, it will still be well directed. Steven Spielberg's directing in Bridge of Spies was absolutely superb, because every scene is so perfectly crafted and Spielberg knows when to cut to a emotional reaction with the characters. These a couple of scenes in this movie that I didn't notice was all in one long wide take with no breaks, and that's because I was so locked in on what was going on with the characters and the scene itself. Spielberg brilliance is still present today as he's masterful style of film making is still alive today. If you love that kind of film making that's so masterful, perfect and old school, then Bridge of Spies might be the movie for you. This is one of the best directed films I've seen this year.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is one of the most lovable and respected actors of are times, as in every role he dose, he never disappoints. This is he's fourth collaboration with Spielberg after: Catch Me If You Can, Saving Private Ryan and The Terminal, and in Bridge of Spies Hanks once again deliverers a magnificent and believable performance. This is an Oscar worthy performance as he made his character so relatable, funny and very likable. Without spoiling anything, there's a scene in this movie where Tom Hanks character (James Donovan) gets followed by this unknown figure and at one point Donovan goes to sit at this restaurant to confront this man and the scene itself is just amazing, because Donovan knocks this guy to the ground with no action, just dialogue. Tom Hanks was amazing in this movie.<br/><br/>Another performance that blow me away was Mark Rylance as the soviet spy. I have seen this actor before in the hit TV show ""Wolf Hall"", and he was great in that show, but he impressed the hell out of me in this movie, because Mark Rylance was absolutely fantastic. This guy deserves an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor and I hope he dose, because it would be a huge sub if he doesn't get nominated. Mark Rylance was fan-freaking-tastic in this movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography was excellent, the score was great, the dialogue is outstanding and the story was really good.<br/><br/>Now for the problems: These a couple of scenes around the second act that wasn't that interesting to me.<br/><br/>If you don't like talky movies then you may not enjoy Bridge of Spies, because this whole movie is nothing but talking and I know some people may not find that enjoyable. I'm the kind of person who likes dialogue driven movies and that's why I enjoyed this movie, because of the movies excellent dialogue and I how locked in I was while watching it, but I know it's not going to be for everyone and if you think this movie is boring because it's a talky movie then that's fine.<br/><br/>Overall Bridge of Spies isn't Spielberg's greatest movie compared to his other ones, but it is a well crafted movie with excellent performances, fantastic directing and great writing. Bridge of Spies is the best Cold War thriller I've ever seen."

","Steven Spielberg, the Oscar winning producer and director of such masterpieces as Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List has been a household name for decades, and with good reason. One expects a Spielberg film to be a huge box office success while receiving numerous award nominations, but not everything he touches turns to solid gold (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull anyone?) With Bridge of Spies, the new Cold War thriller starring Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, Spielberg has given us another fine film worthy of attention and accolades although he is just shy of being at the top of his game. Handed a screenplay co-written by Matt Charmin and Oscar winners Joel and Ethan Coen, Spielberg has assembled a top notch cast and a stunning and much heralded design team. Each contributes work worthy of merit to the film, but the pieces don't always fit together quite right in the final product.<br/><br/>Set in 1957 during the Cold War, Bridge of Spies is inspired by the true story of Insurance Attorney James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks/Philadelphia, Forrest Gump). Donovan was assigned to defend captured Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance/The Gunman, Days and Nights) in court in order to prove that the US is fair, affording a POW all of the same rights as any American subject to due process.

"phd_travel","7","1","3","30 October 2015"," Timely but missing some crucial scenes
","This meticulously made and filmed movie is fascinating and topical considering the state of relations with Russia today.<br/><br/>Some crucial things that should have been shown are left out. This movie had too much focus on Tom Hank's character Jim Donovan and his negotiations. It's interesting including the details of his catching a cold and the state of Berlin after the War but it sacrificed the broader picture. I think they could have shown the impact of the incidents on the relationship between Heads of State Eisenhower and Kruschev. Next, the shooting down of Power's plane was exciting but the movie should have shown him getting caught on the ground and paraded around Russia on TV. Thirdly, I wasn't sure how Abel was spying apart from the coin paper and how he was caught. Not very clear. Also I don't know if the silly student really got held up because he was so whipped about a fraulein but I found it so irritating that the whole negotiations could have been ruined by a silly infatuation. Leave him in East Germany - he deserved it considering what was at stake.<br/><br/>The movie really plays the unsung hero card making him scorned by the public and his ungrateful boss (as always Alan Alda plays a schmuck to perfection). Mark Rylance is effective as Abel. Austin Stowell makes a suitably stunned looking Powers.<br/><br/>Bottom line worth watching as a timely warning not to get into another cold war but the movie could have been better."
"MovieMystro","Null","1","3","29 October 2015"," negotiations, posturing and dialogue done very well
","It's more than clear that Spielberg still has something left in the tank. This movie is masterfully crafted and given the subject matter, a master's touch was very much needed. The middle of the film does feel long and bloated but the set up and especially the third act negate that drag. Every scene that takes places in West Berlin and East Berlin and what follows was enthralling and a delight to watch. The entire film is basically negotiations, posturing and dialogue. So, showing both sides of the Cold War to a degree was an excellent decision. Tom Hanks was good as you would expect and the entire cast was serviceable. It's all about story in this case.<br/><br/>Overall, an enjoyable ""turn your brain on"" and enjoy type film."
"onumbersix","7","1","3","28 October 2015"," Great visuals as expected in a Spielberg film
","Spielberg's film is always a treat for the eye. He manages to recreate America and Europe of the ""cold war"" era with great aplomb. I defy anyone to find anachronistic errors in the visuals of the film. This film reunites the director with Tom Hanks. Hanks, who plays regularly this type of American who has integrity and honesty, and is driven by a strong sense of justice. He follows in the cinematic tradition of Gary Cooper and James Stewart, but does not add much to the genre, if only modernity.<br/><br/>With a director so focused on the visuals, the depth of the characters remains deficient. Even a script signed by the Cohen brothers, amazingly did not help much. So I remained with the question: how does this fairly ordinary lawyer become so heroic in environments of hostile international intrigues."
"gsygsy","7","1","3","27 October 2015"," Solid
","A solid piece of work by Spielberg and his collaborators. Tom Hanks, the James Stewart of our day, incarnates honourable American values but manages, in a way Stewart never would or probably could, to convey his awareness of their fragility. The business of holding fast to one's values in a challenging world is the spine of the film's message, dramatised in the relationship between spy Rudolph Abel and Hanks' character, lawyer James Donovan, in this tale of Cold War brinkmanship.<br/><br/>Abel is played by someone who I have no hesitation in naming as one of our era's greatest actors: Mark Rylance. Very familiar to theatre audiences in the UK, he has appeared infrequently on screen. I have a feeling this situation is going to change as a result of his typically superb performance here. Watching him and Hanks play their scenes together was for me the film's main pleasure.<br/><br/>Hanks is well partnered too in his scenes with Mikhail Gorevoy as a Russian diplomat and Sebastian Koch as an East German lawyer. Austin Stowell is excellently cast as Gary Powers, the American pilot whose capture reconfigures Abel's fate, and there are a number of other first rate cameos, including Peter McRobbie's turn as John Foster Dulles.<br/><br/>The women have a rotten time. Amy Ryan has little to do but smile or worry as Hanks' wife. Nadja Bobyleva manages to make a mark with an emotional scene as the Berlin Wall is being built, one of the film's most chilling sequences.<br/><br/>The film's stand-out sequence on the technical front is a terrifying plane crash, one of those jaw-dropping set-pieces that are hallmarks of a Spielberg movie. In this story there's not much room for another of those hallmarks - sentimentality - but where Spielberg can find it - mainly in the scenes around Hanks' family - he puts it in. <br/><br/>Still and all, it's definitely worth going to see BRIDGE OF SPIES, not least for Rylance's masterclass in screen acting."
"phatdan","7","1","3","26 October 2015"," Subtle Propaganda swings both ways.
","Propaganda plays out in this latest Spielberg effort. At the start we see a Russian spy arrested by the FBI. He is a most pleasant fellow played by Mark Rylance. Evidently typecast for the part, he is as soft- spoken and sincere as he was in 'Angels and Insects'. With a pleasant, Scottish brogue, he exhibits a spy with profound integrity. The depiction of the American response to his escaping the death penalty is embarrassingly sophomoric (Actually, as I can remember as a teenager, there was little or no public outcry at the sentence). The incompetence of American military intelligence is also depicted (70,000 ft wasn't high enough for the U-2 spy plane to avert being shot down). But military incompetence has always been an easy target, especially to a liberally biased Hollywood. Nonetheless, it is well-crafted and enjoyable. And, propaganda evens out as we see the Berlin Wall erected, and the consequent brutality of Soviet tyranny."
"brendandevere","7","1","3","25 October 2015"," A Safe bet in the Cold War.
","When a story needs to be told against the backdrop of a volatile world in the middle of the Cold War, who better to employ than a couple of silver screen legends in Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. Add the storytelling brilliance of the Coen brothers and Hollywood has a sure fire winner when it comes to 'Bridge of Spies'. With recent tensions resurfacing between the United States and Russia it is appropriate timing that the big players in movie land have handed such a sensitive issue safely in the steady palms of four powerhouse individuals to deliver a movie inspired by real life events.<br/><br/>But was it too safe? 'Bridge of Spies' was billed as a political thriller with dramatic historical undertones but I can't help feeling that this film has missed its mark in its desire to leave an impact on the audience. Spielberg has delivered a film that comfortably plays within its boundaries without giving the viewer the 'wow factor' that allows the audience to walk out of the theatre with a sense of content satisfaction. This is not to say that 'Bridge of Spies' is a bad film, I just believe with the talent available, it could have been better. The Coen brothers have written a story that was always going to be strong, intelligent and interesting but the narrative seemed stale and tired. 'Bridge of Spies' could have been written by any number of decent script writers. It would have been very difficult for Joel and Ethan to insert their edgy trademark into a story with a set path leaving me perplexed as to why they would have agreed to write the script that relied on rigid conformity.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is his reliable solid self as Insurance Lawyer, James B. Donovan who has the unenviable task of defending accused Russian spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). In 1957 at the height of the Cold War, America's distrust of anything communist is evident with Donovan's staunch morals and belief in his countries constitution is tested and his families safety is not guaranteed. With Abel's outcome a foregone conclusion it comes as surprise to many at the result in his trial. Sometime later, Donovan is given the opportunity to broker a deal in East Berlin to exchange Abel with an American pilot that had been shot down while taking photographs over Russian airspace. Hanks plays out his role without a hiccup, never really challenged by his character who could be a little too close to Hanks own personality but it is his solid unspectacular performance that allows Mark Rylance to shine. Rylance's calm, intelligent interpretation of a British national that has ties with the USSR bounces wonderfully off Hanks's presence and it becomes apparent that the two characters have a mutual respect for each other. Amy Ryan has a bit part as Donovan's wife, Mary, but doesn't get the chance to make a significant impact and Alan Alda has a cameo as James B. Donovan's boss, Thomas Watters Jr.<br/><br/>Spielberg does give the audience an outstanding look into the recent past with a reconstruction of East Berlin. The wall has just been built and the infamous Checkpoint Charlie is brought back to life with disturbing images of desperate wall jumpers being mercilessly gunned down. An authentic contrast of conditions on either side of the wall adds some much needed tension to Donovan's negotiation's in an atmosphere where uneasy paranoia is just below the surface.<br/><br/>At a little under two and a half hours, 'Bridge of Spies' strains the patience that the viewer puts into it believing that they are going to be given more than what they actually get. It's solid and it is safe but it is not brilliant."
"theRetiree","8","1","3","20 October 2015"," Naturally the Air Force Loves It--Bad History
","One reviewer saw this movie with Air Force brass, who naturally loved it, but almost everything related to the 1950s U-2 program is flat wrong without any obvious reason for the errors. President Eisenhower specifically directed the CIA to develop and manage the program with ""civilian"" pilots to avoid committing acts of war by sending military aircraft over foreign countries. Pilots were required to resign from the Air Force, certainly didn't wear uniforms, and were trained at Area 51 (now officially acknowledged) and certainly not in Peshawar Pakistan. Only accurate bits were the grease pencil number on Powers' helmet (they were obviously custom fitted) and the fact that he couldn't destroy the cameras because he got sucked out of the cockpit. All that being said: a great story, great character study, great acting, great if momentary homage to the immortal Billy Wilder and his much more accurate depiction of 1961 Berlin: ""Eins, Zwei, Drei"" aka ""One Two Three."" Wilder too presents German dialogue without subtitles, but with him it's much funnier and no less pointed.<br/><br/>Well worth watching, especially for Hanks and Rylance, but keep in mind that its no more ""history"" than Oliver Stone's ""JFK."" (JFK got shot, Powers got shot down and swapped for Abel.) BTW: Powers got screwed by both the CIA and Air Force, with Kelly Johnson of Lockheed's Skunk Works the only person to stand by him. That's why he wound up flying a traffic copter and running out of gas in 1977. I was there in 2000 when Brigadier General Kevin Chilton, commanding the USAF 9th Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base in northern California, gave his son Gary Jr those medals as a way of assuaging the government's guilty conscience."

","People in the 21st century might not be that familiar with the U-2 incident (a US spy plane got shot down over the Soviet Union and the pilot got arrested). If Steven Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies"" is a good introduction. Indeed, one of the most important scenes is when Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks) explains that he is defending Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) because the Constitution says that even the people charged with the most heinous crimes deserve equal protection under the law; this scene is just as relevant during the so called War on Terrorism, which is now likely to go supernova under a Trump presidency.<br/><br/>But there was another side to the U-2 incident. Eisenhower was planning a summit with the leaders of the UK, France and the USSR, in the hope of easing Cold War tensions. The U-2 spy plane got shot down right before the summit was to take place, and the summit got canceled. It looks as though the plane got sent over the USSR to deliberately sabotage the summit, as the US hardliners didn't want an easing of Cold War tensions. This makes clear why Ike warned about the military industrial complex.<br/><br/>A previous reviewer complained that the movie didn't emphasize things that were representative of the era, like cars or music. I interpreted the absence of these things to mean that this story is a timeless one, especially the matter of civil liberties in wartime.<br/><br/>I'd say that Rylance deserved his Oscar win."

","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4.8/5 stars<br/><br/>With ""Bridge of Spies"", Steven Spielberg infuses new life in Hollywood's all-but-forgotten Cold War espionage thrillers from the 70s and 80s. He goes about creating an arresting, sometimes haunting milieu in the midst of a mission of wits and high-intensity at the height of the Cold War, where American attorney James B. Donovan is recruited by the CIA to negotiate the release of a US spy-plane pilot - shot down and captured in Soviet territory - in exchange of a KGB spy, Rudolf Abel, who was arrested for espionage in the US.<br/><br/>Spielberg enters full-blown Stanley Kramer mode, and triumphantly delivers (like he has on numerous times in his distinguished career) a socially conscious tale of back-and-forth diplomacy and behind- closed-doors politics at home, at the office, and on the global stage. At the same time, he doesn't let up the tension for a moment in this richly-detailed narrative where the interactions between smart and unpredictable characters is the main focus of the Director and his writers (the maverick Coen Brothers; avant-garde filmmakers in their own right). And, eventually, it's these interactions that are the core foundation of ""Bridge of Spies"", with its real strength lying in the bond developed between its two main characters - unwitting negotiator Donovan (Tom Hanks in fine form) and incarcerated Soviet spy Abel (Mark Rylance deservedly an Oscar nominee). The warm portrait of a highly unlikely friendship is perhaps the movie's greatest achievement, even more than its sublime Direction, crisp writing, lasting cinematography, and exemplary performances.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg and the Coen Brothers take on the Cold War and spy world with a visually stunning, tension-filled, and surprisingly feel-good thriller that slithers along with gripping intensity and tantalizing uncertainty."
"tochukwu-83206","5","1","4","8 February 2016"," It's not entertaining enough.
","No doubt, Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of our time, but his latest entry serves as a text on a film that throws around images, ideals, patriotism without fleshing out the weight it has on its characters.<br/><br/>The film takes in 1957, at the height of the cold war. Seriously, what this film lacks is the entertainment factor: no feeling of satisfaction or afterwards excitement I could sit down from afar and list out many reasons why it should win an Oscar-for best picture in fact. But I could also tell you one reason why it shouldn't-have stated that above. This is the second time we have Hanks and Spielberg working together. They collaborated in 1997 for the World War II film: Saving Private Ryan. It is glaring that Bridge of Spies was made for the Oscars in the same vein as their former collaboration. At least they were successful delving more into worldwide changing events that happened as a result of that warfare. <br/><br/>There are several themes here, which are consequences of the cold war setting of the film. One of them is nationalism, which are indirect consequences of the espionage milieu of the film. And this is juxtaposed against personal ideals and shrugging off how the world looks at you. Then Spielberg allows us to see things from the justice-angle. Technically, there are many facets to this film- politics and negotiation included. Steve gradually posits each parts influence on the film. If nothing else I should give him credit for that. The cinematography is benumb-sometimes looking like Spielberg's previous film (War Horse). But at the same time, it is beautiful especially in those West Germany/East Germany scenes. Sincerely, those scenes were the best part of the film. We could see how it served as a barrier, not just between two nations, but two ideas. Sincerely, I would have been glad if Steven was making a film about those communist/capitalist tensions in Europe rather than the propaganda filled first ¼ of this film.<br/><br/>However, the propagandist aspects of the film made for an interesting watch. I was fascinated when the main character who is an insurance lawyer James B Donovan was called in to take the case of the soviet spy, not because it is obligatory. But because of the image America was trying to project here. And it follows that James goes on take the case to the Supreme Court to appeal against the rancor of the general public. So, at that point where the spy pilot's jet crashes, you can sort of predict everything from here. But according to the beginning credits, which say ""Inspired by a True Story""-which it is-the predictability argument loses face value.<br/><br/>In spite of its thick plot and beautiful on-screen hues, Bridge of Spies is ho-hum. Not because Spielberg decides to spare us some scenes like in that air crash scene or because he jumps some. But because it lacks weight, emotional intensity and tension, the film is made in such a way that makes you feel the negotiation for exchange of the spies was a walk in the park. No force majeure, no chance for failure-all success. Remember, the more the likelihood to fail for the protagonist, the more appreciative and savored is the victory. But no, it doesn't progress like that. And as such, the end result is a bit monotonous."
"thejoes444","7","1","4","8 February 2016"," Good film but lacks tension
","Bridge of Spies takes the audience back to a time when the entire world was on the brink of a thermonuclear war, however, it didn't make me feel that way. A plethora of small internal and external conflicts are presented in the film but it never really built up enough tension to put me on the edge of my seat. The film contradicted itself by presenting each problem as very serious with the use of incisive dialogue and melodramatic lighting without ever really letting the viewer know what was at stake. Although aesthetically pleasing, almost every scene's outcome seemed inconsequential throughout the movie. Tom Hanks did a great job with what he was given; it's the fault of the soft-hitting plot that he isn't up for an Academy Award. I have no idea what the the writers were trying to do with the Russian Spy character. If you watch the movie you'll understand. Even with all of these critiques, the film was very easy to watch and it made you want to know what was going to happen next. Despite being a good movie, it will undoubtedly be swallowed up by time for not being great. I would fully recommend this movie to any person interested in history or wants to pass two hours leisurely.<br/><br/>Positive(s): I was pleasantly surprised with how well the movie flowed and I was never bored.

Directed by Steven Spielberg, who knows how to direct a movie, and written by Matt Charman and the Coen brothers. You have a creative team behind this movie who knows what they're doing, and the skill they possess is present in the movie.

Including Amy Ryan and Mark Rylance.<br/><br/>With all of this, and nominations for Best Original Screenplay, Sound Mixing, Production Design, Original Score, Actor in a Supporting Role (Mark Rylance), and Best Picture, it wouldn't be a stretch to have high hopes for this movie. At least on paper.<br/><br/>What's really unfortunate is that the movie is just bland. For clarity, I want you to understand, it's not BORING, or BAD, it's just unremarkable. The people who worked on this movie are capable, and have proved being capable, of very interesting and amazing film making. This is not an example of anyone's best work, especially when you look at the company that Bridge keeps in the Best Picture category.<br/><br/>I had similar issues with the movie The Imitation Game. The presentation is fantastic, the movie is well made on a technical level, and hell, it's even a good movie. It's just not a groundbreaking piece of film, which is allegedly the purpose of the Academy Awards. The stories are interesting, though departures from the real story to be sure, but the movie as a whole doesn't offer a whole lot.<br/><br/>We aren't dealing with a bad movie, hell it's even a good movie. That said, when you put a movie into the category of BEST of the year, a different level of criticism should be used.<br/><br/>It's worth noting, as an aside, that the total number of speaking characters in this movie who are not cisgendered, white, straight men, who offer any kind of significant plot progression sits at zero for this movie. Something to think about."

","Steven Spielberg's latest exercise in good ol' fashioned American wholesomeness, integrity and diplomacy transports us back to 1957, where undercover KGB agent Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is about to be busted by the FBI under suspicion of passing secrets onto the Soviets. The idealistic man at the centre of the story is James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer working in Brooklyn who joins the likes of John Quincy Adams, Oskar Schindler and Abraham Lincoln on the list of great, conflicted men caught up in a difficult period of upheaval and portrayed by Spielberg in an admiring light. And who better to play a man of such a clear sense of morality than Hollywood's favourite nice-guy Tom Hanks?<br/><br/>Working with frequent collaborator Janusz Kaminski, Bridge of Spies is about a good-looking as a film gets. Infused with the same eye for detail and greyed-down solemnity of Lincoln (2012), the backdrops on show provide the perfect location for serious men talking serious business. The main crux of the film rests in the blossoming friendship between Donovan and Abel, who are captured on an equal par in a bleak interrogation room as the sun blazes through the blinds. These are two men from opposing sides, but share the share the same determination, stubbornness, and loyalty to the ideals of their country. Abel accepts his increasingly-likely execution as one of the requirements of his job, but Donovan wants to exercise his rights as a PoW, making himself public enemy number one in the process as his face splashes across the newspapers.<br/><br/>Donovan also hopes to keep him as a tool should the need for a prisoner exchange rear its head in the future, which was incredible foresight for anyone who knows the true-life story. As Donovan fights for Abel in the courtroom, the United States are prepping their own mission - to send a spy plane over the Soviet Union to take photographs. Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is shot down and, after failing to swallow the cyanide given to him by his commanding officer in case he finds himself in such a perilous position, is taken prisoner by the Soviets and routinely tortured for information. The U.S. government again turn to Donovan in the hope of setting up an exchange just as American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) is also arrested.<br/><br/>For a story so littered with intrigue and espionage, Bridge of Spies is oddly lacking in thrills and tension. When Donovan arrives for the exchange in Berlin as the Wall is being put in place, the city is hostile and seemingly lawless in areas, but instead the film focuses on the various bizarre characters, including a Petter Lorre- alike KGB man, who flock around Donovan, a man they simply do not know. Perhaps the unevenness in tone is down to a script-polishing by Joel and Ethan Coen, who never shy away from taking a genre and stamping their own particular brand of humour on it. Spielberg also cannot resist resorting to sentiment at the film's climax on the eponymous 'bridge of spies' (Glienicke Bridge). Still, this is Spielberg at his most professional, harking back to classic Hollywood while maintaining the relevance of the films themes."
"justinwfirestone","7","1","4","1 February 2016"," Not the thriller it wants to be
","Why would Stephen Spielberg want to make Bridge of Spies, a Cold War spy thriller, when there's already plenty of better movies out there, like The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, the original Manchurian Candidate, The Lives of Others, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, or even The Third Man? The answer seems that Spielberg is using Bridge of Spies to draw thinly-veiled allusions to the modern War on Terror and enemy combatants, with warnings about xenophobia, government propaganda, and global hyper-nationalism.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies is engrossing and Mark Rylance is especially good as a dispassionate pawn, seemingly apathetic to every part of life and every person, except he has a deep respect for people who get knocked down and stand up again. However, the movie is simply good, not the great movie it wants to be. It lacks the necessary noir and suspense, two aspects hard to achieve in color.<br/><br/>We get a legal procedural followed by some low-intensity negotiation and some minor history lessons. Our hero, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), also plays a manipulated pawn, but he has a few tricks up his sleeve because he's compassionate and thoughtful and impervious to propaganda. Information is key, and thus also secrets, so we must keep secrets about lies and lies about secrets (insert modern discussion of cryptography here). Eventually, no one knows who is zooming whom.<br/><br/>We have the Rule of Law, which so often breaks down to the Rule of Man, because people write laws and choose whether and how to enforce them. America wants to show off it is better than evil police states, but the lesson here is maybe that's all we do. We simply show off we are better without the actual moral higher ground.<br/><br/>Maybe Mario Puzo wrote it best in The Godfather: ""The lawyer with the briefcase can steal more money than the man with the gun."""
"akcenat","6","1","4","28 January 2016"," Another Steven Spielberg history lesson (and based on Wikipedia not very much true)
","This film was one of the most anticipated movies of 2015. It's directed by Steven Spielberg, has Tom Hanks in the lead role and has a script written by Joel and Ethan Cohen, but...it's more conversational and seems to be more dialogue intensive rather than any movement or action. Also, the movie is too long for the story and unnecessary baggage of scenes are added. Absence of adequate background score makes many scenes sound boring. Generally, there's not as much tension as one might hope, especially once Hanks is in Berlin, when film becomes slow as we wait for the deal to be brokered.<br/><br/>It is OK movie, but that's about it. The film runs for over two hours and is almost nothing but talk, which makes it a bit of dull historical movie. In some ways, it feels like a film for school children. The flick's headlining novelty is Mark Rylance, who plays Abel with mesmerizing performance. Compering to him, Austin Stowell as Powers comes off as the equivalent of actor negative space. Overall, it just didn't make a huge impression on me. <br/><br/>Rating: 6-<br/><br/>Favorite quote: 
James Donovan: Aren't you worried?
Rudolf Abel: Would it help?"

"steven_torrey","10","1","4","6 December 2015"," A great spy drama.
","I'm 70 and I seem recall as a kid at least once getting under my desk to protect us from nuclear bombs. But I think only once. Too young to know of Russian Spy Rudolf Abel; but I clearly remember Gary Powers U-2 incident and the subsequent exchange of Abel and Powers.<br/><br/>I thought the drama taut, well crafted, suspenseful. Interesting characterization of Abel (Mark Rylance) and Donovan (Tom Hanks). (I refuse to say 'great acting'--that is why they get paid millions.) The film conveyed the greyness of those years--the greyness not only in America but in East Berlin. The sense of being slightly depressed about something--though in East Berlin there was lots to be depressed about.<br/><br/>Donovan challenges Abel, he challenges the court case, he challenges the CIA, the US Military, the East German thugs, the East German politburo. And in the end--he gets the release of not only Gary Powers but an American economics student--Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers)-- who got himself captured when he crossed into East Berlin. And crossing into East Berlin should not be seen as some easy cross the border jaunt; it was fraught with peril of being arrested as a spy on trumped up charges and incarcerated and interrogated mercilessly for any length of time. So Donovan crossing into East Berlin took huge guts and risks.<br/><br/>I was never certain of who or what Wolfgang Vogel (Sebastian Koch) was--was he an embassy functionary or an East German Communist Party Apparatchik? In the end, he clearly was not to be trusted.<br/><br/>Rudolf Abel was a Russian Spy and in the movie he aids Donovan or tolerates Donovan in being certain that Pryor is released as well as Powers--something the Russians agreed to by releasing Pryor at Checkpoint Charlie while Powers and Abel are exchanged at the Glienicke Bridge.<br/><br/>While in the movie, Donovan is portrayed as an insurance attorney recruited for Abel's criminal defense, and later recruited by the CIA Allen Dulles for the prisoner exchange, the film neglects to mention that he was also employed during the war in the OSS (precursor to the CIA). So his experience in the world of espionage was recognized and justifies choice for him in these sensitive assignments. So when he goes to Judge Mortimer W. Byers ((Dakin Matthews) to request Abel be sentenced to time in prison because the US may need him for tactical negotiation for a future potential prisoner exchange, he is working from some insight into the world of espionage. The film fails to make Donovan's relationship to this world of espionage clear.<br/><br/>There was a sort of Walter Mitty moment in the movie, when at the end, his family learns from the television news that Donovan was in reality a special Envoy to President Kennedy in a top secret mission. How cool is that: every child wants their father to be a secret agent in reality. It was just one light touch among several that gave the spy thriller an added dimension.<br/><br/>For escapist drama but well grounded in reality, it was really a great movie--well worth the time. And apparently the film hews pretty closely to actual events--given the inevitable need for film drama."
"abouhelier-r","10","1","4","5 December 2015"," Bridge of Spies
","Bridge of Spies premiered at the latest New-York Film Festival, is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks. I loved this film but I have to admit that going to the movie I did not really know what to expect. You never know with Steven Spielberg; though it's more than likely it will always be a well directed film. However as far as Spielberg is concerned there's two types of well directed historical movie: Saving Private Ryan and Lincoln (that last one is perfectly crafted but if you've seen it once, you'll probably never watch it again). Here, the entire cast is engaging down the line. Tom Hanks is one of my favourite actor. He's genuinely one of the most likable actor in cinema history. This film is his fourth collaboration with Spielberg and once again he nails it.<br/><br/>His performance is ultimately Oscar worthy with dry humour and reserve of intelligence that makes his character a man with very particular American ""greatest generation"" characteristics such as modesty, fundamental adherence to core principles he's been raised to value and live by. Hanks plays the movie's voice of conscience, he also can go dark but wasn't built to remain there for too long. Plus, Mark Rylance portrays a Soviet spy: Rudolf Abel with all his contemporary stages actor skills. He's very good bringing fascination and very, very subtle comic touches to a man who has made every effort to appear as bland, even invisible, as possible. Rylance really does a fantastic job, best supporting actor nomination at least.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, most Steven Spielberg's films are consummate entertainments that swipe you up with pure cinema. Bridge of Spies wonderfully comprehensive detailing of 1950's American life in the opening stretches, slides the viewers into the period. This is genuinely one of the best, if not the best, directed movie of the year so far. It's easy to say that because of Spielberg but I can easily see myself rewatching that film. Obviously Tom Hanks' character isn't sent to the Soviet to kill spies, but to negotiate a deal: so there's a lot of talking involved. You may be bored. But if like me you get butterflies in your body when you watch a perfectly crafted scene. When you notice that you've just seen a long wild single take of two people talking with no break, all because of Steven Spielberg brilliance: simulating a close up and mid shot. If this is your jam, you are going to enjoy this film as much as I did. Moreover, you get invested in this non-physical war. A war through words. Spielberg directed it as it was an action movie. He heats up the drama with some action, throws in crowds, chaos and transforms ordinary spaces like a home, an office or a street into battlefields. This film elevates to a new level of intrigue, tension and complexity in its last act and shapes up expertly into a John Le Carré style. Finally, this film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does nowadays. <br/><br/>Overall, Bridge of Spies is one of the best Cold-War thriller I've ever seen, a true life espionage tale smoothly handled by old pros who know what they're doing. Masterful old Hollywood style filmmaking."
"imaadnabil","7","1","4","28 November 2015"," Modern American Propaganda
","'Bridge of Spies' looks at the peak of the Cold War tensions between two global superpowers as part of a political three-way negotiation drama. The movie is a good one and is well directed by Steven Spielberg and of course brilliantly acted by Tom Hanks, but it has one fundamental flaw: We are blatantly given the impression that America is loving and caring while the Soviet Union is cold and unsentimental. This becomes especially clear in the end parts of the movie. The characters involved in the swap are well-played and well develop through the film. The Soviet 'spy' (and very talented artist) is on one side of the deal while the Economics student studying Communism in Fascist/Capitalist Germany (whoever does that...) is on the other side of the table alongside Francis Gary Powers. The film in more than one way is therefore unbalanced and does not excitingly exceed expectations, as previous Hanks/Spielberg productions have such as 'Band of Brothers' and 'Saving Private Ryan'. A decent - good film overall nevertheless which manages to keep a good level of suspense throughout. 7.0/10"

This film was pure Spielberg. Extremely well shot using interesting angles to provide menace and intimidation, combined with writing provided by Matt Charman and the amazing Joel and Ethan Cohen, this film had me glued to my seat. It wasn't all action, it was gritty, moving, and in places even amusing. It was also very sobering as we were treated to scenes of the wall being built between East and West Germany and the desperation of people trying to cross before it was completed. The plane spotter part of me was happy to see the U2 being depicted (whether it was real or a model I don't know but it looked pretty good). I could easily watch this again. Superb performance from Tom Hanks and I really liked Mark Rylance, who played the 'Russian Spy' Rudolf Abel, spy or not his performance evoked empathy for the character. It was good to move away from superheroes and disasters for a while and get my teeth into a gritty drama."

Otherwise we would be no different than the Kangaroo courts that the Soviets would set up if they capture one of our agents.

"rannynm","10","1","4","14 October 2015"," Oscar Shout Out! Nothing short of Legendary and an Immediate Classic
","This film is nothing other than legendary and an immediate classic. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg are back together again, to make another incredible dramatic and genius film. With historical facts, a heartfelt and dramatic story, this film is not only bound to be an Oscar contender, but I think this film may swoop any other film this year, and win the film of the year award.<br/><br/>This is a drama. Although it cracks jokes here and there, it really is primarily mainly a dramatic re-enactment of an historical event. The story itself is a large adventure with action and intense scenes filled with various human emotions and unpredictable actions that keep the viewer on the edge of their seat.<br/><br/>The story starts in the middle of the Cold War, in Brooklyn. A man believed to be a Soviet Spy is arrested and, because of American law, he is supposed to get a fair trial. The man responsible for defending him in court starts noticing things and instead of just making it look like a fair trial, he actually tries to help this 'spy' get the right sort of action.<br/><br/>I don't know how Steven Spielberg (director) does it but, he makes these stories come to life and helps you connect with the characters so that you cry, laugh and almost fall of your seat because it's so intense! The camera shots explore the scene from a variety of angles and go way beyond just showing one element. With each camera shot, you are prone to say, ""nice shot."" For example, in one scene, they are on a bridge and, instead of showing a sky high view as you might expect, he shows it from the prospective of the people. It is snowing; you can't see the other side or the people very well. You can just see a few lights and it is just so perfect. If you are a fan of Spielberg's work as I am, you will be happy to see some of his famous wide shots which help scenes seem to float into each other.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Tom Hanks has done many roles and this is truly one of his best. He plays a character that does so many dangerous things and does them for a few people that he doesn't even know. He shows extraordinary skill portraying this character, bringing out emotions we can relate to. Full and heartfelt, with each scene his character gets better and better to the point that you are just sitting there with your eyes wide and forgetting to breathe thinking, ""What is he going to do next?"". When he is upset, you're upset. When he is terrified, you're terrified. He is perfect for this role and this is easily one of his best work.<br/><br/>For this film, I cannot choose a favorite scene. Each scene is so important in its own way. Each scene is so spectacularly done. Each scene is so entertaining whether it's funny, intense or dramatic One of the scenes that was most impressive is when we see an American spy flying a plane, 70,000 feet over Russian territory. He is gathering intelligence and hoping to get some information about nuclear defenses. His plane is being attacked and the problem is, he was supposed to go down with the plane. The cockpit shatters and he goes into free fall. I love the scene because it looks like he is falling from 70,000 feet at an alarming rate. The execution of this is outstanding. It is clear and intense, which is why I love it so much.<br/><br/>The subject of this film is rather mature like the scenes near East Berlin during the time the Berlin Wall was being constructed. A part of Berlin is cut off from food and everything else. There are many other scenes featuring the impact of the Cold War. Because of these, I recommend this for ages 11 to 18. I enthusiastically give it 5 out of 5 stars because this film is legendary. It is mind blowing in so many parts and, I believe it is one of the best films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."

","I did not come to Bridge of Spies with particularly high expectations. Based on the commercials, it looked like an attempt to put a patriotic spin on what was an extremely embarrassing international incident for the United States. However, even though Steven Spielberg brings his usual optimistic outlook to the proceedings, he still crafts a well done film, boosted by an excellent cast and a script by the Coen brothers.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies focuses on the early 1960s prisoner exchange of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel for captured American pilot Francis Gary Powers and graduate student Frederick Pryor. Tom Hanks gives a strong performance as James Donovan, the American lawyer pressured into representing Abel and ultimately negotiating the exchange deal with the Soviets. He is backed by a strong supporting cast, especially Mark Rylance as Abel. Rylance deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the very least.<br/><br/>The proceedings are prevented from descending into historical pageantry through a strong, witty script by the Coen Brothers. The serious national security proceedings are permeated with humor, particularly from the deadpan Abel. The script also manages to maintain a certain level of suspense, not a small feat given that we know how the events turned out. At the same time, the film offers important messages about the true nature of patriotism, lessons that are all too needed nowadays since patriotism has been reduced to militaristic fervor.<br/><br/>The film does have some notable flaws. At times the pacing is rather slow, and the proceedings may lose the interest those with weaker attention spans. Furthermore, it downplays just how embarrassing the U-2 shoot down was for the United States, particularly after President Eisenhower was caught lying about the U-2 program at a US-Soviet summit. Nevertheless, the film is well worth your time."
"bartlettjon","10","1","5","25 October 2015"," Bridge of Spies (2015)
","BRIDGE OF SPIES (2015) On May 1, 1960, at the height of the USA-USSR post WWII tensions, aka the ""Cold War,"" a CIA spy plane piloted by American Francis Gary Powers, was shot down over the Soviet Union causing Soviet Premier Khrushchev to cancel proposed negotiations with President Eisenhower. The pilot was captured and held as a bargaining chip. Previously, Attorney James Donovan, played by Tom Hanks, had represented a captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) in his trial and conviction. This historical sequence of events provides the story line for this fine film.<br/><br/>Through political connections Donovan is pressed into duty by the CIA to negotiate as a private citizen, the release of Powers, who the CIA desperately wanted back, in exchange for the convicted spy, Rudolf Abel, who the Soviets desperately wanted back. Mr. Hanks completely nails the part and sells the character as a methodical and brilliant negotiator. Donovan thus begins the process that takes him across the Berlin Wall and into East Berlin and infinite danger. Along the way he successfully negotiates with no less than five different parties by deftly playing one against the other to achieve his goal: a two-for-one prisoner exchange, while infuriating the US side by including a hapless US graduate student who got caught on the wrong side of the Wall.<br/><br/>Donovan knew his ace-in-the-hole was his status as a ""private citizen,"" and not as a US government representative. What could have been a disadvantage, he turned into his advantage while making the plot quite thrilling for a movie that seemed to be dark and cold in every scene.<br/><br/>Hats off to Steven Spielberg for tackling this great story from the Cold War without changing the material facts of the incident. The viewer is taken on a road trip behind the ""Iron Curtain"" and into the dark and paranoid times of the Cold War. <br/><br/>One film can only touch briefly on such a broad topic, but Spielberg manages to present East German – Soviet friction, the shameless manipulation of US public opinion by the CIA and US press which was even directed at our children, the honest-to-God fear within the US of nuclear annihilation as well as the general confusion on both sides. Donovan's dilemma is universal and so very relevant today. If our American experiment of democratic representative government is based on laws, the choice gets down to either follow the laws, change the laws in a civil, objective and reasonable environment (Government) or disregard the laws and revert back to the caves. In representing a Soviet spy, Donovan shows the legal system to be based on such basic factors as human dignity, honor and respect for self and others. Donovan and Abel eventually form a personal relationship beyond attorney-client where each character exposes the lunacy of their respective sides. Abel was completely unflappable, even if facing imminent death. Donovan finally asked Abel, ""Does anything ever get you angry?"" Abel's reply came back, ""Would it make a difference?""<br/><br/>Donovan's defiance of all parties involved and his dogged determination to complete this transaction made the difference. Keeping the spirit of our democratic values and the Constitution is the message here. This is a powerful and inspirational film, produced and written with meticulous attention to detail. Highly recommended."

","I feel sandbagged after watching this movie I went and looked up the main character since it was based upon a true story. We first meet Jim Dononvan working an insurance case, but I would have to ask why in the world is this man arguing an insurance case? Certainly I would also question why this man was chosen for the main action of the plot. There is where an opening up of his background would explain it all simply but we don't get it except a single throw away line.<br/><br/>Donovan worked on the Nuremberg trials as a prosecutor, he also was general counsel to the OSS, the predecessor to the CIA. He had extensive experience with handling secrets and dealing with spies and likely knew more than a smattering of German. Not the plain Jane insurance lawyer the movie offers for him. Choosing him for the action in this plot now seems perfectly natural.<br/><br/>However not knowing all of that information means we see the action in quite a different light. So which individual do we cheer for? The plain Jane insurance lawyer or the high powered spy master and Nuremberg prosecutor? Should I blame myself for not knowing ahead of time? Anyone who reads this prior to watching the movie will not see the same movie I saw since I didn't have this information ahead of time.

","The message is that the ""other"" is always a gift, and that Americans who resent those who seek to destroy their country are evil. No one in fact ever attacked Donovan's home, but it's a made up scene for the movie to reinforce how awful average Americans are, typical Coen brothers' nonsense. The push is always free of the fact that the Soviet system was and is vastly less concerned with civil liberties or rights than America. However, the movie frequently picks apart American values and slips these themes into the movie like roofies to lull the audience drinking in this bull. When Donovan tries to appeal and is warned off for the potential damage to his career, they forget this never happened, but the same film makers would never highlight how many mainstream Americans get de-platformed everyday from Facebook, Twitter and others in the greatest assault on the First Amendment in American history. Great acting, sets, cars and clothing, etc. Too bad there's a political anti-American theme dressed up as ""history""."

","Director Steven Spielberg is the conscience of American film-makers, delving into the dark places of our history - the morally shaky ground of policymaking in a country that prides itself on its belief in upholding the principles of the U.S.Constitution. In his latest film, BRIDGE OF SPIES, he pokes a stick into the headlines of Cold War events - the 1960 U-2 Spy plane incident, in order to shed air and light into the dark reaches of official myth-making. Aware that this can be done most powerfully through precise direction, detailed sets, soaring soundtracks, and cinematography that echoes the dreary mood of the times - bright sunshine recedes behind the shadows of deception. The audience is always entertained, despite the subject matter's depiction of the murkiness of ethics and morality. Like the great illustrator Norman Rockwell - we are seduced by an ""apple pie"" ethos, except there are worms wriggling around in the crust.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is perfectly cast - an actor who I cannot remember ever playing a ""bad"" guy - as James Donovan, an insurance lawyer conscripted by the CIA in 1957 during the height of the Cold War hysteria to defend the arrested Soviet mole, Rudolf Abel, (an academy award winning performance by Mark Rylance,) and participate in a US government programmed ""kangaroo-court"" trial. Except James Donovan believes in the right of an individual to the best defense as the bedrock of our democracy, not willing to compromise his deeply held integrity.<br/><br/>BRIDGE OF SPIES begins with a panning of a dreary Brooklyn street with the Manhattan Bridge in the background looming over the landscape, the camera eventually lands upstairs in a tenement building where Mark Rylance/Rudolf Abel is looking at himself in a mirror painting a quite good traditional self-portrait. This double view is our introduction to the personality of a seemingly Walter Mitty-like individual, his physiognomy imprinted with a haunting and magnetic expressiveness, conveying adversity and conviction. Rylance's sympathetic portrayal of Abel is seductive and thrilling; this spy is a mystery and remains so.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks/James Donovan - a reincarnation of Jimmy Stewart (thicker in physique) lives a 1950's dream life in suburbia; three children and a clueless stay-at-home wife and mother (played by Amy Ryan in a thankless part.) Women are just accessories in this movie - indicative of how they were considered at the time. Thank goodness for the Feminist Movement 20 years later! Getting involved with cloak and dagger politics does not change Donovan - he is incorruptible and strongly rooted to the ideals of American values as put forth in the Constitution and Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>At the same time as the Abel trial - America is preparing to send a U-2 spy plane equipped with surveillance equipment over Soviet territory and the Central Intelligence Agency recruits a young pilot Francis Gary Powers (a bland, handsome Austin Stowell) to complete the reconnaissance mission. In 1960, the operation is implemented and shortly thereafter the U-2 spy plane is shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air missile and Powers parachutes unto Russian soil still alive and is captured and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment and hard labor. A politically heated issue and an embarrassment for the Eisenhower administration - the incident was vigorously denied by the USA and a cover-up was attempted, but the covert military maneuver was ultimately exposed.<br/><br/>Attempts are made to return Gary Francis Power to the USA in order to interrogate him about how much classified information he revealed to the Soviets. The authorities turn again to Attorney James Donovan to negotiate the exchange of spies on Glienicker Bridge in East Germany - Rudolf Abel for Gary Francis Powers; the tension and drama of BRIDGE OF SPIES begins against the backdrop of the Wall being erected in East Berlin - a bleak city in contrast to its counterpart in the Western sector.<br/><br/>Pragmatic political behavior by officials in the KGB, CIA and FBI are all stick figures in the chess game of diplomacy and Tom Hanks deftly navigates his way through the labyrinth of innuendo and deceit. Espionage, duplicity, betrayal are at the heart of this film. What makes it palatable is the humanity of both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance's characters who bond with mutual respect, despite their opposing ideological viewpoints. Director Spielberg can be sentimental, but is able to tunnel through the sappiness with humor and affection. He really likes his two leading men and so do we."

Tom Hanks is brilliant as the attorney who becomes progressively enmeshed in nail biting, high level spy trading negotiations. Mark Rylance as the Russian spy gave a memorable performance for which he deserved an Oscar. One felt such pathos surrounding this spy who in the end, whether he was convicted in America or sent back to his homeland in a spy trade, was in a no win situation. For the attorney played by Tom Hanks, he apparently became quite an asset in negotiating international deals for the Kennedy administration."

","Bridge Of Spies is a historical drama film starring Tom Hanks. Even though its subject matter of the Cold War is something I barley know about, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am now more interested than ever to learn more about it.<br/><br/>In 1957, tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War are at their peak. Spies from both the American CIA and Soviet KGB are a major threat to the security of both world powers and each side often resorts to hasty measures to stop any classified information from being leaked. In Brooklyn, New York, Rudolf Abel is arrested under the suspicion of being a spy. James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is assigned as Abel's defence lawyer. However the idea of defending a potential Soviet spy proves to be an unpopular and difficult task for Donovan. Meanwhile, over in the Soviet Union, an American spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers is shot down and captured by the KGB. As a means to ease tension between the two warring countries, Donovan proposes a swap between the two prisoners of war, Abel for Powers.<br/><br/>Despite containing barely any action scenes and being almost entirely made up of talking, the film never feels boring or slow paced. This is most likely due to the Coen brothers' clever screenplay and Steven Spielberg's creative direction. There were many suspenseful moments where it felt like the prisoner negotiations would go horribly wrong and that kept me on the edge of my seat. Tom Hanks also gives another memorable performance, proving once again how great actor he is."

What I appreciated was the gripping and suspenseful storytelling, and when I realized after the fact that Spielberg was the director, I wasn't surprised. I'm not a Tom Hanks fan at all, but I can say he knocks it out of the park with this one. Everything felt genuine and period correct. The film is thoughtful and makes you think about some higher themes, while making you want to concentrate on what is happening so that you don't miss anything. It covers a lot of ground, and it probably helped that I didn't really know much about the events in question. The dialogue is witty and on point (see, Hollywood, you can still do it when you want to), and some scenes are quite moving. This movie is proof that you don't need sado-masochistic torture scenes and embarrassing soft porn to have a gripping spy movie.

"SimonJack","9","0","1","11 July 2017"," Good film of Cold War true events
","""Bridge of Spies"" is a first rate film about three true events that occurred at the height of the Cold War (1946-1991). They were headline news stories of their day. The first two incidents were unrelated but were tied together by the third event. Director Steven Spielberg and the writing team had a tough job condensing three stories over five years into a film of less than 2½ hours. They had to skip much detail, and the film seems crammed in places. Some things may not be apparent to one who doesn't know the history. <br/><br/>The first event was the 1957 New York arrest, trial and conviction of Rudolf Abel, a Soviet spy. The second event was the 1960 crash of an American spy plane over Russia and the arrest, trial and conviction of the pilot, Francis Gary Powers. The third event was the 1962 prisoner exchange of the two men, along with a second American. The first and last of these three events involve a third principal character, James Donovan, a New York attorney. The film revolves around Donovan and his role in the lives of the captive men. <br/><br/>All of the cast are superb in their roles. The film naturally had Hollywood treatment, so some parts are fiction. Folks interested in the Cold War, or in espionage, or Soviet spying in particular, might enjoy more details. So, I offer some here from my study of these subjects. <br/><br/>Rudolf Abel was one of many aliases of Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher (1903-1971). Fisher was an English-born Russian. He moved to Russia in the 1920s, served in the military and became a Soviet intelligence officer. After World War II, he joined the KGB and was trained to spy in the U.S. He left Russia in 1948. Using different IDs and passports, he made his way across Europe to Canada and then the U.S. on Nov. 17. He operated in a spy ring under the code name, Mark. When things heated up, he was about to leave the U.S. with a new ID. But, he was arrested before he could leave. That was June 21, 1957.<br/><br/>The film gives a sense of intrigue with Abel's capture. It didn't happen the way the movie portrays it. He answered the door in his hotel room and was arrested by FBI agents. But the scenes with a hollow nickel were one way to bring into the story a real aspect that led to Abel's capture. In 1953, a Brooklyn newspaper boy received a hollow nickel for payment when he was collecting for his paper route. He dropped the coin and it popped open, revealing a piece of microfilm. It wound up in the hands of the FBI. In time, through trailing other known Soviet spies, and the defection of one in May of 1957, the feds were able to corral Abel. <br/><br/>The federal court in New York convicted him of spying and sentenced him to 30 years in prison. He had served just over four years in an Atlanta prison, when he was exchanged in 1962 for Gary Powers. Back home in Russia, Fisher lectured on his experiences until he died at age 68 in 1971.<br/><br/>Francis Gary Powers (1929-1977) was a U.S. Air Force jet pilot during 1952-56. He was discharged from the Air Force as a captain in 1956, and went to work for the CIA to fly U-2 missions over the Soviet Union. Those began on Sept. 27, 1956 and continued into 1960. On May 1 of that year, Powers was shot down by a new Soviet ground to air missile, and parachuted to safety. On Aug. 19, the Soviet Union convicted him of espionage and sentenced him to three years in prison and seven years of hard labor. He served just over 21 months in prison before the February 10, 1962 exchange. The movie doesn't show it, but the Powers family and two American attorneys were at his trial.<br/><br/>In later years, Powers received honors for his service. Soviet records released after the fall of the Iron Curtain verified the details Power had given of his U-2 flight. Powers died on Aug. 1, 1977 when his TV traffic helicopter crashed in Los Angeles. While making an emergency landing, he swerved to avoid hitting children playing in a park. <br/><br/>James Donovan (1916-1970) took the Abel case after several others had turned it down. He had been in a private law firm just seven years after serving as a commander in the Navy. During World War II, he was associate counsel in a research and development office. After the war, he was assistant to Justice Robert H. Jackson, the chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg war trials in Germany. Donovan was the main negotiator in the prisoner exchange of Abel and Powers, which also included an American student, Frederic Pryor. <br/><br/>While the movie doesn't cover it, Donovan's efforts that same year and the next for Cuban exiles were as harrowing as his negotiations with the Soviets. In June, exiled Cubans asked him to negotiate the release of the Cuban Americans captured by Fidel Castro after the failed April 17, 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. The negotiations concluded on July 3, 1963, and led to the release of about 1,100 people. Donovan was just 53 years old when he died of a heart attack in January 1970. <br/><br/>A 1976 TV movie was made about Gary Powers. Lee Majors starred in ""Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident."" A 1948 movie, ""The Iron Curtain,"" stars Dana Andrews as Igor Gouzenko. He was a Soviet crypto clerk who defected and exposed a massive spy network in Canada and the U.S. The Soviets were way ahead of the U.S. in their espionage work after WW II and during the early years of the Cold War."

He is so laid back as to be almost horizontal. It is, by its subject, a very talky movie but it is well written and none of the talk is wasted time. It is absorbing and interesting about a time when I had little interest in world politics. It all makes sense to me now."

What seemed like an open and shut case of espionage Abel was given insurance lawyer James B. Donovan, Tom Hanks, to represent him to show the world as well as the hated Soviet Union that he was to get a fair trial before he's to be executed or at least sent away for life for his crimes. Donovan really takes his job as well as the US Constatution seriously and defends Abel to the best of his ability only to have his client convicted and given a 30 year sentence which to many Americans seems like a slap on the wrist: That's after the Rosenbergs were executed for the very same crimes that Abel was convicted of some five years earlier.<br/><br/>With Abel locked away in federal prison in Georgia and Donoven appealing his conviction US Air Force pilot Francis Gary Powers,Austin Stowell, is shot down with his U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union on of all days May 1-May or Workers Day in the USSR-1960 giving Abel a lifeline for an early out by the US Government who's ready to exchange him for Powers. It was Powers who against orders didn't end up killing himself with a cyanide tipped needle before he was captured by the Russians alive that exposed him as a US spy not a weather man as the US Government claimed he was.<br/><br/>With Donovan still Abel's lawyer he's told by his government to negotiate Abel's release in exchange for Powers who's been given a three year sentence, a lot less the Abel was given by the US courts ,behind bars as well as seven years house arrest-In the Moscow Hilton- by the Soviet peoples court. It's with all this going on a love sick American collage student Fred Pryor played by Will Rogers?, not the one you think it is but someone else, is busted by the Communist East German police in trying to get his German girlfriend out of the city of divided Berlin before it's walled up by the East German police as well as military. With the US more then willing to let the totally innocent Pryor hang-by his you know what's- but only wanting to get Powers, who in fact was spying on the USSR, freed Donovan makes it a point to get both Pryor as well as Donovan freed or else he just won't cooperate with his string pullers in both the State Department and Pentagon.<br/><br/>***MILD SPOILERS SINCE HISTORY ALREADY SHOWED US WHAT HAPPENED***Donovan prevailed in the end getting both Powers as well as Pryor freed for the return of Rudolf Able in a nail biting exchange on the Berlin Gilenicke Bridge with out as much as a shot, in anger or celebration, being fired. Donvovan who was hated and called a dirty Commie by almost everyone who knew him is now a hero not only by getting Powers and Pryor back but later getting over 9,000 Cuban freedom fighters and their families back to freedom after being captured and arrested by Castro's troops in the disastrous ""Bay of Pigs"" invasion of Communist Cuba in 1961. As for Francis Gary Powers the main man in this movie he never was given the respect that he deserved in him not killing himself before the Commies or Russans captured him thus exposing the entire U-2 spy operations to the world at large. And putting the US, who up until then said it was national policy not to spy on anyone, the self proclaimed ""Good Guys of the Free World"" in a bad light."

","Bridge of Spies tells the story of lawyer James B Donovan's defense of a Russian spy and subsequent role as a negotiator in the trade of that spy for U.S. pilot Gary Powers.<br/><br/>It didn't strike me as that intriguing a story, honestly, but I like director Stephen Spielberg so I thought I'd take a look.<br/><br/>The result is surprisingly engaging. The story is simple but interesting, the movie deftly sketches out cold war tensions, and there are solid doses of humor and drama. <br/><br/>While I often find Tom Hanks a little too noble, he nicely underplays Donovan, who comes across not, like a lot of Hanks' roles, as a man so noble that he is on the verge of tears at his own nobility, but rather a smart lawyer with a great deal of integrity. There are no speeches, no tearful moments, but you wind up really admiring the guy.<br/><br/>Even better is Mark Rylance as the Russian spy, an odd, phlegmatic little guy with his own kind of integrity.<br/><br/>While the movie is entertaining and absorbing, it is a movie that, like Spielberg's Lincoln, feels a little too careful and educational to really bring history to life the way a movie like Spotlight does. Spielberg seems to have lost interest in taking chances (I really think he should break out of his mold and make a Dogme 95-style film), and that can make his films seem a touch stodgy, but he still has that remarkable directorial expertise, and certainly knows how to make a movie."

","Bridge of Spies is a pedestrian cold war drama that combines the talents of Steven Spielberg and the Coen brothers. It really is a literal title as the climax takes place on a bridge and it has spies.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays an insurance lawyer. We are meant to root for him even though as he tries to stiff a personal injury lawyer. Remember folks, his insured driver injured five people but he wants to limit it as one claim.<br/><br/>Hanks really has the hang of these types of characters now, sturdy, steady, steadfast with just a hint of overacting. He plays James Donovan who is called in to defend Rudolf Abel a captured KGB spy operating in the USA. He places his life at risk to save him from the death penalty, being astute enough to realise that Abel may become useful in later years. So it does when the Russians capture a U-2 spy plane pilot. Donovan then has to put his personal safety at risk by going to East Germany to negotiate a spy swap.<br/><br/>The film features a critically acclaimed performance from Mark Rylance who plays Abel and won a best supporting actor Oscar. Rylance is an example of a subtle, understated performance.<br/><br/>Spielberg is a master craftsman but the film is just too cumbersome and stuffy.

","We enjoyed this movie on a purely entertainment level. If you don't have to have historical accuracy and logic, this will do for that.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with mucho movie clichés, for example, a dark stormy, rainy night to set the anxious scene for the shady CIA agent following Tom Hanks, cold blizzardy snow to set the East Germany post war gloom and danger, mean/cold/evil CIA agents, a judge that doesn't care about following proper legal proceedings, WW II era German soldiers, cold and calculating Soviets, 1950's innocence in America, Commie hating Americans, unquestioning allegiance to the Military, and of course everything has to be based on a time deadline and come down to a happy ending at the last moment.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie made me uncomfortable because of its historical inaccuracy and exaggerations. Once I stopped looking for accuracy and reality as necessities, I settled down to just being entertained. <br/><br/>Gary Powers clinging to his spinning out of control U-2 was both exciting and silly. A person attached to an out of control airplane that was falling at +400 mph would be torn apart. I believe the historically accurate story was less exciting. Gary Powers ejected after his plane was hit, failed to destroy the aircraft and take his suicide pill, and was captured, to the embarrassment of the U.S.<br/><br/>The movie takes a long time to move through the story that we know has to have a happy ending. It's filled with almost there, then failure, then almost there again. That's the main pattern of the telling.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is always Tom Hanks, no matter who he plays these days. He's no longer the intense actor we saw in ""Big"", ""Forrest Gump"", ""Cast Away"", or his other blockbuster masterpieces. <br/><br/>The overall theme of the story was a good one. Spying was considered a necessary part of the Cold War, and both sides denying that they were spying was part of the game.<br/><br/>History loses something in the telling."

Mr Hank's wife is just a bit too difficult to believe - especially her reaction after their home and family get shot up!- then again, with that whole segment being a fabricated beat-up (this looks like Cohen Bros stuff) I guess it also fits in with the way Hollywood saw 50's women. <br/><br/>It's mostly good based on fact dramatic entertainment with an element of fanciful trimmings - what more could be expected of a Spielberg/Cohen partnership?.

"soupy2002","Null","0","1","2 June 2016"," A bridge too far.
","Spielberg's latest film, Bridge of Spies ends up being about exactly that. A bridge in Berlin where captured spies are swapped from east to west. And the hero of the piece, played by Tom Hanks, is the one good American who will win the day and save the participants. And that is where my least favourite trope of a Spielberg film comes out.<br/><br/>There's no denying that Spielberg is a good filmmaker and a master storyteller. I just wish that he wouldn't allow his sentimentality to subvert the real subjects of his movies. What Bridge of Spies should be about, and briefly is, are the two contrasting spies in this mostly true story.<br/><br/>The film opens with Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) being captured. It's made clear that there is no question of his guilt. The government doesn't want anything to do with the defence, so attorney James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is randomly assigned to the case. Its then that you get to see the performance of Rylance dominate in his sessions with Donovan. Seemingly non-plussed, Abel doesn't seem to care about his fate and Rylance brings a real sense of eccentricity and intelligence to his character. The trial is stacked against him, with zero chance of an acquittal and that's when the film started to lose my interest. Minutes are devoted to the actual trial and the viewer is left to wonder about the nature of the evidence and the drama of the case. I hoped to learn more about the psychology of spydom, and Rylance has the nuance to reveal it. Ultimately, the character remains an unknowable cipher. But it's deemed unimportant because Spielberg has bigger fish to fry. Namely, after the conviction, the suggestion by Donovan that in lieu of sentencing, Abel may be used as a trade for an American spy being held by the Soviets.<br/><br/>This turns out to be U.S. air pilot Francis Gary Powers, shot down over Soviet air space while on a reconnaissance mission. His guilt isn't in question either, but unlike Abel, we don't get to know too much about Powers other than the fact that he is young and handsome. His instructions were to blow up his plane and commit suicide if he is captured, neither of which he does. It's difficult to care about his fate, particularly with his actions remaining unquestioned. He seems more pawn than spy. So the trade seems unbalanced. The second half of the movie shifts the focus almost completely to Donovan and his mission to make the spy swap in Berlin. We get an hour or so of stereotypical, and in some cases ridiculous agents and diplomats of the East German and Soviet variety. And this is where Spielberg really shows his hand. He uses Hanks for his Jimmy Stewart quality as an aw shucks, righteous man who not only manages the swap, but gets an extra prisoner, an American student held in East Berlin. We've been prepared for this since the start with scenes that show what a good husband and father he is, a sympathetic and kind lawyer, and, it seems, the only character with a pure agenda. So by the end, the film becomes a flag waving tribute to the decency of a simple, honest man. Forrest Gump does détente."

"TheLittleSongbird","8","0","1","28 April 2016"," Excellent and often very absorbing film, without being one of Spielberg's finest
","'Bridge of Spies' had much going for it, mainly that it's based on a very interesting story, Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance are talented actors with some very noteworthy performances and when in his prime Steven Spielberg directed some of the most relentlessly entertaining and entertaining films in cinema.<br/><br/>While 'Bridge of Spies' is not one of Spielberg's finest films, in the way 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'ET', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Empire of the Sun', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'Jurassic Park' are, for me despite its flaws along with 'Lincoln' and 'War Horse' (remember liking 'Munich' a lot too, though it needs a re-watch) it's one of his better ones since 'AI'.<br/><br/>There is not an awful lot wrong with 'Bridge of Spies', though due to the subject matter it's not going to appeal to all tastebuds. To me, it's biggest problem was pacing. By all means not a continuous problem, because there was enough in the film that was really engaging, but parts do drag and not every scene felt like it was needed. The beginning is notably draggy and the film could easily have ended after the climactic scene on the bridge, because the ending did feel unnecessarily stretched and was particularly guilty of the sappiness and over-sentimentality that Spielberg is often criticised for. Similarly Donovan's family scenes could have been excised with no problem, they add very little and their cloying nature did feel too much and misplaced within the rest of the film. The only other problem was Thomas Newman's score, it's nicely composed and it fits at least (to have it used sparingly was also a good move in order to not distract from the atmosphere and dialogue) but there is nothing hugely memorable or anything to go wow over or that evokes any strong emotions. Not bad as such, just bland.<br/><br/>However, 'Bridge of Spies', as always with Spielberg is incredibly well-made, as well as directed with a lot of class. It is sumptuously shot and the period detail is elegant, atmospheric and positively eye catching, especially the scenes in Berlin where you actually feel the cold, austerity and tension. While there is a lot of talk in 'Bridge of Spies', the script is thought-provoking and tightly structured, not making the mistake of being rambling, using complicated jargon or being too wordy. There is even some nice knowing witty humour that gives the film some freshness and is well-incorporated when it appears, while the political and patriotic elements avoid being preachy. While the pace is not completely secure and not every scene felt necessary, the story is very absorbing and is told with intelligence, tension and emotion. While there is perhaps not enough on the trial, that part is very intriguingly done, while the Berlin scenes that dominate the film have a lot of tension and suspense. The shift from America to Berlin is handled well and not too crudely, a very easy thing to do when visually and atmospherically their scenes are so different.<br/><br/>The characters are engagingly written on the most part, with the exception of Donovan's family (his wife in particular is the typical nurturing but frustrated cliché with little variation on it). Donovan is one of those characters that holds the narrative together as strong as a rock and is easily rootable, while Abel comes close to being the most sympathetic character while at the same time evoking some chills. The chemistry between the two characters is very strongly done. All the acting is very good (though Amy Ryan barely registers in the role that gives her very little to work with), with Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance being outstanding. Hanks is effortlessly commanding and has such a great cool charisma, essential for a lead role that is on screen for almost the whole duration. Despite his screen time being much less, Rylance portrays Abel with quiet understated dignity, with his expressions and eyes speaking every bit as much as when he's delivering his lines, that comes over both chillingly and heart-wrenchingly.<br/><br/>All in all, excellent and often very absorbing. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"naenaekramm","8","0","1","27 April 2016"," Bridge of Spies displays a lot of patriotism, character, and love for your enemies.
","Bridge of Spies had an amazing display of sincere and authentic care for your enemies. The display of love for your enemies in this movie is a great example of who we are supposed to be in Christ when we struggle to do the right thing against our sin nature. For when we love our enemies, our friends may hate us for it, but we can be assured in who we are in Christ by not backing down in our character and convictions even if the crowd demands our head. In the Bible in Matthew 5:43-45 it says, ""You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven."" Character is also greatly displayed in Donovan's character throughout the movie. For example when the American government asks Donovan to violate attorney client privilege defending an accused Russian spy on American soil, Donovan refuses quoting the constitution and stays true to his client and character. Bridge of Spies is a great movie filled with true patriotism."

Was it to build up tension? I'd guess so, though I didn't feel it and I was always waiting for more to happen (to no avail, until the finale).

"robert-temple-1","8","0","1","15 April 2016"," An exciting film which however varies wildly from the real truth
","This film is an example of myth-making, whether intentional or not I do not know. There is very little chance that the U-2 spy aircraft supposedly 'shot down' in 1960 by the Soviets in the notorious 'U-2 Incident' was really shot down at all. The various existing stories significantly contradict each other. The Russians say they fired one S-75 Dvina missile, but two different internet sites say that seven or thirteen missiles were fired, one shooting a MIG-19 out of the sky by mistake. I do not believe that any of these stories is true. We now know that Lee Harvey Oswald insisted the plane was never really shot down, and papers released in 2012 by the CIA show that they never believed either that their own man, the young pilot Francis Gary Powers, was really shot down. So why should the film suggest that he was and perpetuate a now discredited myth? It was apparently impossible for the Soviets' S-75 missile to hit a target flying at above 70,000 feet as the U-2 was. Nor did they have the guidance and control capacity to hit the plane even if a rocket existed which could get that high with any semblance of accuracy. The film shows the plane crashing nose-downward, which contradicts the official report that it crashed nose-upwards. But it appears that the truth is it never crashed, and merely landed normally, as part of a complex and mysterious political plot. It has been suggested that this was to derail détente, but that may not be the whole story. There are other ambiguities regarding Powers himself. There seems to be no certainty as to his birthplace. In the 1960s he was said to be from Pound, Virginia, but on Wikipedia it says Jenkins, Kentucky, or perhaps Burdine, Kentucky. All three places are near one another on the Kentucky-Virginia border, and I used to know the area well. In the old days, apart from Highway 23, there was nothing but dirt tracks. The region is one of the wildest and most remote in the entire Appalachians. I have spent many, many weeks there in the distant past. The area was populated almost entirely by genuine hillbillies, who lived in log cabins and still hunted with flintlock rifles. I know this because I met them as a child, entered their log cabins, and held their flintlocks. I was not allowed to fire one because the gunpowder was precious and they cast their own lead ball shot from an iron mould. But the boy who let me hold and aim his own precious flintlock, which had an immensely long barrel and had 'belonged to my great-great-great-grand-pappy', was from about 1800 or even earlier. Using it, the family got most of their wild meat. The boy told me, in words I shall never forget: 'I can shoot the head off a squirrel at a hundred yards with my flintlock.' It was from this wild area that Powers was supposed to have originated, as well as another well known and notorious CIA-linked figure. (The coincidence of two major spy figures coming from the same dot on the map is impossible.) I also knew as a child a genuine local man who told me the CIA and FBI both had a special connection with Pound, Virginia, and that he had been hired himself by the FBI to do messenger work across the South and to report regularly to Pound. When Powers died mysteriously in 1977, many people thought he had been murdered. So all of these matters are extremely murky, and we shall probably never know the real truth about any of it. As for the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, I do not know what the film's agenda is for showing him as a quiet gentle, thoughtful, and artistic man, who is repeatedly described as 'honourable'. Why also is the entire American population shown in the film as foaming-at-the-mouth McCarthyites who want to lynch Abel and Donovan? Are Soviet spies being set up as the new heroes? What is going on with this film? The idea that the supposedly naive insurance lawyer Donovan would be taken to see Allen Dulles, who would tell him he could carry out his own private negotiations with the Soviets at the height of the Cold War involving a spy and a captured pilot, is totally and outrageously ludicrous. Donovan had been part of the legal team at Nuremberg and must have had intelligence affiliations already in the 1940s. Rudolf Abel (aka Willie Fisher) appears to have been a failure as a Soviet spy in America, and it defies belief that the Soviets would exchange a high-value captured American airman for him. The suspicion is that the American and Soviet security services cooperated secretly, with or without the knowledge of their own governments, to stage these phoney events. The film does not make clear that Abel had been in jail for four years before the swap for Powers, and was hence 'old news'. The film maintains that the East Germans resented and defied the Soviets, which is absurd, since East Germany was the most supine and devoted Soviet satellite state in the entire Warsaw Pact. If the Germans had behaved as shown in the film, they would have been summarily executed. Why are we expected to swallow all this nonsense? The direction of the film by Stephen Spielberg is superb, and the performances by Tom Hanks as the lawyer Donovan and Mark Rylance as Abel are outstanding in every way. (Powers features only as a minor figure in the two parallel stories shown here, which only come together with the spy swap on the bridge in Berlin.) But how much better and more interesting the film would have been if it had been accurate, and had explored the many mysterious byways and unanswered enigmas and contradictions. Instead, it adds to the existing, enormous disinformation overload."
"DavidLindahl","6","0","1","8 April 2016"," A somewhat exciting but rather bland story of Americans helping each other
","Bridge of Spies is about a simple American lawyer, played by Tom Hanks, who during the 60's Cold War defends a Soviet spy, played by Mark Rylance. Hanks eventually end up in the middle of East Berlin to negotiate a trade, the Soviet spy for an American pilot. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg which means that the two heavyweights are reunited once again, the last time being in 2004 when they collaborated on The Terminal. Bridge of Spies was nominated for an Oscar, among others in the category for best picture. Mark Rylance won surprisingly for best supporting role.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies is a very skillfully crafted film but with such a competent director as Steven Spielberg, I wasn't expecting anything else. What really stands out with Bridge of Spies is how great they've recreated East Berlin in the 60's. The production design, the costumes and the music is indeed top class. I was curious about the story itself, but at the same time I sort of suspected it to be a pretty one-sided tale of American heroism. I was right.<br/><br/>The fact that Bridge of Spies is told from an American perspective is not a problem, there are tons of great films told that way. The thing that bothers me is the liberties they take with the truth, just for dramatic effect. Everything can of course not be true in a film based on real events, but this film steps over the line a couple of times. An example of this is the portrayal of how the Soviet treats their prisoners just to make them look worse. The other thing that bothers me is the pacing of the film and the fact that it never really takes off. It's sort of like watching a motion picture combined with a documentary where they twist and turn the truth. Hanks spends a lot of time in East Berlin without ever really finding out anything new and vital. With its 2 hours and 20 minutes, Bridge of Spies is simply too long and could have been made on or below 2 hours. The story is however interesting and the film looks good, 6 out of 10.<br/><br/>David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"

","I love how Spielberg is able to tell such a complex historical event in such a humane way. Having the Cohen brothers as accomplices I'm sure solidified the success of this movie which easily could have faded into the piles of forgotten spy/Cold War predecessors.<br/><br/>Barring the language at times, this would be such a great film for older students to watch, study, and hopefully inspire. There are so many great lessons to be learned about character, standing for what is right regardless of the disdain of others, and most of all courage of players in the world who each in their own country or manner believe in what they are doing is right.<br/><br/>Appreciated also is the that Donavan did not discard one single human life at stake in the exchange, regardless of the government's disdain for his choice! I mean, WOW!<br/><br/>Ass Donavan (Hanks) summarizes, each person is acting as a soldier in their respective vocations. While we often and rightly react negatively and succinctly towards spies against our country, we also are doing the same in other countries of the world."

","This is worth watching for the acting. Hanks and especially Rylance were masterful. Their characters carried the film. I kept wanting more, to hear how these honorable men, in opposite enemy camps planning to blow up the World, each doing their duty for beliefs and country, learn to know and like each other. Alas, this film hinted at the depth of their relationship but could have showed so much more.<br/><br/>Rather, like a parasitic over-the-top twin, the movie within a movie interrupted the story. The U-2 pilot was more Millennium Falcon than Air Force, the U-2 special effects more ""Gravity"" than realistic high altitude ejection, and the U-2 training--OJT rather than classroom, made me laugh when humor was not intended.<br/><br/>Some of the plot points felt gimmicky so I read up on the history after watching, and the film did take some literary license with several of the historical details. Although some were clearly worth the payoff to maintain tension, some struck me as more distracting than dramatic. The sense of place and feeling of the Cold War comes through, but don't watch this film to prep for a history test.<br/><br/>Overall, the storytelling, pacing, and acting -- especially the two lead characters, make this well worth watching."

","Bridge of Spies is based on the true story of an insurance lawyer during the Cold War who is chosen to defend a Russian spy in court simply to give the man a fair trial, and he decides to take it too far. For the most part it's well presented, but it doesn't stand out as anything special. <br/><br/>The plot is one that I think we've all seen before. There's someone who wants to help beyond his call of duty, so he does. It's not a bad plot line, but it's not a particularly good one. It's like a superhero movie without the capes. Although Bridge of Spies is much better than most superhero movies. It's not very well-paced all the time though, and it does drag a little pretty much throughout the entire movie. I always felt myself checking the remaining run time and wondering how the movie would find enough content to compensate for its 142 minute run time. It does, though, and I think that for the most part it did it well. <br/><br/>The character development is just fine. Jim Donovan is just like any other main character in these kinds of movies: He wants to help people, and he overdoes it more than expected despite people not wanting him to. Other than him, there's hardly any focus on any other character, so in short, they're just fine. Nothing special, but not bad either. <br/><br/>The acting is just fine too. Mark Rylance, who somehow won an Oscar for his performance, is such a minor character that he barely had enough time to showcase his skills as an actor. Sure, he's important to the story, but he has barely enough screen time to really be considered all that important. This is more of a personal issue that doesn't really affect my opinion of the movie, however, and is more directed at the Oscars themselves. <br/><br/>Overall Bridge of Spies is a good movie. It's not fantastic, it's not great, it's just good. It's one of those movies that I just watched and will probably never watch again or think about really afterwards. It's pretty forgettable, actually. Nothing about it stood out in particular, it was just good. In the end I'd recommend this movie. Maybe you'll love it, maybe you'll hate it, and maybe you'll just like it. I can see why anyone would feel any of those ways."

I just have to note that I had a real problem with the comment wielded at Tom Hanks' character at the beginning of the movie by the CIA agent over a drink: ""...don't go all Boy Scout on me..."" No one would have said that in 1957 and there were a few other similar inconsistencies...annoying. This story is an important one to be told--the ""cold war"" was very real as children and downright frightening on a daily basis. It's important to get this message out to the younger audience."

","""I am Irish, you are German. But what makes us Americans? Just one thing, The rulebook. We call it the Constitution and agree to the rules, and that's what makes us American.""<br/><br/>Spielberg returns to the history of war long after ""War Horse"", a story of a stallion with a Lassie attitude during WWI, but not with heroic images of the battlefield as in ""Saving Private Ryan"". ""Bridge of Spies"" takes place during the Cold War. A period during which espionage was commonplace and super powers completely distrusted each other. As a result a whole arsenal of nuclear missiles were aiming at the main cities in both continents. Spies infiltrated into society and gave the authorities and agencies all sorts of secret information. And those spies just look like we imagined them. Dignified dressed men with a long coat and a stylish trilby, shyly and cautiously moving through the crowd and revealing a rolled up piece of paper somewhere out of a wall. After that they deciphered this message by means of an ingenious mechanism and a complicated decoding key in their sober furnished apartment. And that message contained the new coordinates where the next message was hidden. Well, in my childhood I imagined it would be like that. <br/><br/>The most successful part of this film are the overall eye-catching images and decorations. The setting looks absolutely beautiful with lots of details. The city of New York in the 60s with its boulevards full of beautiful cars, the costumes, the atmosphere and family values in that period. Thus we are introduced to the the family of James Donovan (Tom Hanks). A typical American model family, residing in a house decorated in atom style, elegantly dressed in the fashion of those days and with a disciplined lifestyle. In contrast, a bit later we are witnessing the construction of the Berlin wall that splits this city into two parts. A grim, postwar, snow covered Berlin where heartbreaking scenes take place.<br/><br/>Key figure in this espionage drama is James Donovan, an ordinary lawyer who's specialized in legal cases with insurance companies. From one moment to the other he needs to defend the recently arrested Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). In those days anyone or anything that has to do with communism is automatically suspicious and should be condemned immediately. This means that this cold-blooded spy can't count on a fair trial. But they forgot about Donovan, because this principled lawyer convulsively believes in the constitutional rule that everyone, no matter what their crime or origin, is entitled to a defense and isn't guilty until proved otherwise. The result is that the hostile public opinion isn't only focused on Abel but also on Donovan, someone of Irish descent but American at heart.<br/><br/>Did ""Bridge of spies"" make a huge impression on me? No not really. Not that the perfectionistic images are disappointing. Or that the acting is abominably bad. But because I wasn't waiting for the umpteenth historical war-documentary. The used clichéd contradictions between the two superpowers was a bit to obvious. For instance, the circumstances of Abel's imprisonment seemed more comfortable than those of the American prisoners in Eastern Europe. And the cunning way Spielberg bypasses the historical character and gives it a more adventurous and heroic touch, shows that he must make concessions to Hollywood's management. On the other hand it was a relief to see that the image of a spy is shown in a realistic way. So don't expect James Bond or Ethan Hunt situations, filled with impetuous action and death-defying stunts while making use of high tech gadgets. The spies in ""Bridge of spies"" are ordinary characters who perform their ""spy-work"" in a simple and less spectacular way.<br/><br/>And finally, the importance of a star actor such as Tom Hanks is of course crucial for this film.Hanks is and will always remain one of my favorite actors. A charismatic and versatile actor who turns each role into a masterpiece. He dominates in every movie. Without Hanks this would only be a typical historical drama that has taken shape in the mind of the master himself, Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

"jboothmillard","8","0","1","21 January 2016"," Bridge of Spies
","I saw this film reviewed on Film 2015 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh, then award nominations were announced and this film got a good amount of them, I wasn't sure originally whether I'd want to see it or not, but I cannot ignore the films that get this buzz, from BAFTA nominated director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan). Based on a true story, set in 1957 during the Cold War, lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), who specialises in insurance settlements, is recruited by his firm to defend accused Soviet Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Mark Rylance, star of Wolf Hall). Donovan has never practised criminal law, after World War II he was formerly a prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials, so the prosecuting attorneys, the judge, his firm and his family do not expect him to mount a strong case for Abel, Donovan becomes a hate target by many who just want Abel executed. Abel is found guilty of all charges and convicted, but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence him to 30 years imprisonment rather than execution, as he could be valuable to the USSR as a bargaining chip for an American spy the Soviets might have in custody, Donovan also appeals against the U.S. Supreme Court, presenting evidence that a search warrant was not issued during the arrest of Abel. This scenario does come into play, American pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) flies a U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union, he is shot down, captured, convicted and interrogated, then American economics graduate student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) visits his German girlfriend in East Berlin, during the building of the Berlin Wall, trying to bring her back into West Berlin, but border control stops and arrests him as a spy. The USSR send a message to Donovan, under a false identity, proposing a prisoner exchange: Abel for Powers, Donovan travels to Berlin to begin negotiations, he finds out about the capture of Pryor and is instead insisting on a 2-for-1 exchange. The CIA are only interested in the return of Powers, but Donovan negotiates for Pryor as well, on condition that there is no jeopardising of the Abel-for- Powers deal, however the East German government holding Pryor suddenly pull out, they are insulted Donovan did not inform them of the involvement of the USSR during the negotiation, the CIA want to leave Pryor behind, but Donovan threatens East Germany that the entire deal will be scrapped, Abel could talk, and East Germany would be blamed by the USSR for any damage. In the end, after long hours and patience, Donovan's efforts are rewarded, the exchange is agreed and takes place on the Glienicke Bridge and at Checkpoint Charlie simultaneously, Abel, Powers and Pryor are freed and handed over peacefully to the opposite sides, Donovan gains credit for his achievement. Also starring Amy Ryan as Mary Donovan, Scott Shepherd as Hoffman, The Lives of Others' Sebastian Koch as Wolfgang Vogel, Alan Alda as Thomas Watters Jr., Mikhail Gorevoy as Ivan Schischkin, Eve Hewson as Carol Donovan and Child's Play 3's Dakin Matthews as Judge Byers. Hanks in his fourth Spielberg collaboration as always gives a great everyman performance with stamina, Wolf Hall star Rylance is a great choice as the always calm mole-like dignified man,I was wondering if this film would be complicated or too political, and I'm thankful it wasn't, the real- life story about prisoner exchange and a paranoid climate is very interesting, with the backgrounds and costumes it feels authentic, it is an enjoyably patriotic wartime historical drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen, Best Music for Thomas Newman, Best Sound Mixing and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Original Music, Best Sound and Best Film.

","Great movie. It left me wanting to learn how to say ""Standing Man"" in Russian. I hope that ""James Donovan"" the main character is accurately represented by Tom Hanks. An amazing man who stood for what is right even against his own government. However did you spot the mistake with the pilots uniforms. In the movie the pilots are wearing tan uniforms as used to be worn by the Army Air Force. By the end of 1952 all US air force personnel were required to wear blue uniforms so that the period of 1957-60 would not have seen the uniforms that props issued to the actors playing the pilots. In-spite of that i like the way that the paranoia of the time about the soviets and the bomb were represented. It really reminded me of our modern equivalent of being paranoid about anyone who comes from a Muslim country."

","Master auteur Steven Spielberg's latest movie ""Bridge of Spies"" is not falling down, not falling down, not falling down. OK, I think my Bridge of Puns is nearly extinguishing you from further reading. But please continue to read for puns' sake. This 1950's true story film adaptation stars the splendiferous Tom Hanks as insurance lawyer James Donovan who inexplicably is delegated to defend arraigned Russian spy Rudolf Abel, exceptionally & subtlety played by Mark Rylance. Donovan is conflicted on defending a Russian spy and all the negative publicity it will receive; and not to mention how it will affect his family. Spielberg once again puts on the genius directorial cap with his intelligent direction of a Steven flick; and there are no bridge of lies with that statement. Another truth you have to handle is that Tom Hanks keeps on putting up strong work; he captivates with his starring performance as Donovan. But it is Rylance here who is the master thespian of the movie, and you can rely on that. Would you want me to add more on the movie? Would it help? But a few tidbits I will add: loved Thomas Newman's score of the picture and the solid screenplay from Joel & Ethan Coen and Matt Charman. That's all I have to say about this movie.

"gnix1979","8","0","2","14 January 2016"," Interesting movie but no longer relevant
","As a historian, I thought this movie was excellent and covered a time of extreme secrecy and mistrust. Its good that movies of this nature and subject still get made.<br/><br/>However this movie presents a problem, its about a subject that is no longer relevant in the modern age, sure there will always be mutual mistrust of both East (Russia, China, N Korea) and West (NATO Countries) but the art of human espionage is over. This is not a critical analysis of the movie, but considering an article I read about 18 months ago when Spielberg was criticising Hollywood and the movie industry as a whole for releasing too many sequels and CGI blockbusters, does he really think there is a market for movies like this? There was an interesting post about a 20+ year old who took his girlfriend to see this movie and they enjoyed it, he commented everyone else in the audience was older. This is great to hear and read because it proves that there IS still an audience for this kind of subject.<br/><br/>That being said, as much as this story was interesting and the acting good by the always dependable Tom Hanks as well as it being nice to see the excellent Sebastian Koch, I felt the movie dragged so much that I kept looking at my watch wondering when it was over. I have noticed that I have done this for the last few of Spielberg's movies. There is no doubt that he was once a great filmmaker but his editing has become appalling. I would have liked to have seen more of the conditions faced by the citizens of East Germany and less about the US pilot and the training he went through as that didn't really add to the movie.<br/><br/>I think if in future Spielberg is going to make further movies like this he need to make sure he edits carefully, make the story entertaining and not long and boring. Unfortunately in my opinion with the exception of the Martian, this is where we now find Ridley Scott, making long and boring movies when really they are exceptional movies just poorly edited."

","That was a pleasant movie to watch. I didn't get bored for one second despise the length of the movie. It's interesting to watch the way things happened during the cold war. The American propaganda, the brainwashed American people, the evil communists, we're good and they are bad and so on... It could still apply now when I think about it. Americans are still brainwashed by the media on daily basis. It's so normal for them after all those years that they have absolutely no clue whatsoever that they are being controlled by their government. Same things happen here in Europe as well though, but on smaller basis. I wonder when people will stop thinking everything that appears on television must be true? Never I guess because humans are just sheep and easily distracted from real problems. But back to the movie. Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance were to me the two best actors in Bridge of Spies. Great acting in a story that keeps you interested for more then two hours. If you like some drama with a touch of biography then you will like this movie.

"vinodemails","8","0","2","8 January 2016"," Simple masterpiece
","Hollywood regularly comes up with movies that are essentially American in their subject, but try to push forth a universal appeal. Many of them fail because of just that, trying. And then there are those movies which do not pretend to be anything bigger than just their story and let the audience chose what they'd be appeased with. 'Bridge of Spies' falls easily into the latter category. <br/><br/>The story based on true events, is portrayed almost as a documentary, but in the style of Spielberg, which was visible in his other famous creation 'Schindler's list'. I'll list down a few points which appealed to my nature:<br/><br/>Real-life Heroes are people who face situations which they don't fancy, but put their heads down and work on them. In this case, Mr. Donovan, played by Mr. Hanks is a well to do insurance lawyer who is handed a case of a Russian spy arrested in the states. Initially indecisive and reluctant, he gives the case all attention.<br/><br/>The perks of freedom which most of us enjoy, but rarely acknowledge or realize suddenly dawn on us when they are violated by force. The movie beautifully depicts this, by picturing the building of the Berlin wall and a scene where Mr.Donovan coat is politely stolen, without caused him any offence.<br/><br/>The suaveness and impassiveness with which Mr. Abel (the Russian spy) carries himself, very unlike 007, is refreshing in itself and so is his attitude. When asked for multiple times by his counsel whether he's worried, his quirky response is 'Would it help?'. It helps us reflect on our petty worries and it's futility.<br/><br/>There are multiple situations in the movie which puts forward the message summarized bluntly by Mr. Donovan as ' Let people think what they want, you know what you did'. However, the director also emphasizes on how difficult it is, through the protagonist's facial expressions in response to the reactions of his fellow passengers in the metro.<br/><br/>Last, and this may help many in their professional career, are the negotiation skills of the lawyer, polite where it works and t where need be, speculating as much as required and putting all at stake for the bargain.<br/><br/>I'd recommend Bridge of Spies for all the lovers of the drama life offers and for those interested in the approach of those exceptional people who just do their job well.."

This is not one of those, it a great story , well acted, well directed, and well worth watching. Reminds me that when the US makes a good film, nobody can come close to them. Mark Rylance has a face and an air about him that makes you believe that he's the real soviet spy, with an interesting Scottish accent and an occasional slip into his soviet past. Tom Hanks puts in another seasoned great performance as James Donovan, and one of the best lines is when Donovan/Hanks asks Abel/Rylance , Aren't you worried ? to which he replies Would it help ?

Which really makes me tip my hat to the guy Hanks plays for having such guts to press the limit. To avoid it being a spoiler, that's all I'll say about that.<br/><br/>This is just a very well-done movie. My only criticism would be the hokeyness (SPOILER ALERT PROBABLY FOLLOWS) the U2 pilot being tied to his disintegrating aircraft by his O2 hose. PLEASE! <br/><br/>Other than that, this one's a keeper and a candidate for a DVD buy."

","East and West Berliners were geographically neighbors, yet forty years of geo-political disparity transmuted these people, often time lovers, into strangers. There were, contrary to popular propaganda, a few shots fired here and there. This political thriller illustrated some examples where a Soviet surface to air missile hit a state of the art US spy plane and it's pilot down in Soviet controlled East Germany. Tom Hanks conveyed the duties of prisoner exchange negotiator steadfastly. The script had copious dialogue for each facet of the multi-faceted and convergent story lines. The climatic conclusion conveyed the limits of extenuated cooperation amongst the puerile East Germans, the imperious Soviets, and the desperate US."

","I am not a Spielberg fan. I don't dislike his films but they are not essential viewing. However Bridge of Spies is different. I am sure others will comment that he has made similar films. I may not have seen them.<br/><br/>Here's a few thoughts. Interesting to note that Spielberg's father had been involved in US - Soviet negotiations at the the same time as the film is set.<br/><br/>Although the character points out that the US government is a sham and a fraud in their trial of Abel, no search warrant etc Tom Hanks does not appear too outraged. <br/><br/>Did the financial backers of this movie also insist that an American out negotiates the Soviet and East German governments? Or did that actually happen?<br/><br/>Are there any parallels int his film with the moral vacuum we see in the US's attitude to the Middle East and Islam? Was that an intention? I feel certain that the Cohen Brothers and Spielberg definitely do not believe that everything is shiny under the bonnet of the US. <br/><br/>To the film itself. As I left the cinema I heard several people say ""best film I've seen all year. I wanted to find out why they thought that. Because aside from a few scenes of graphic threat and danger I was struggling to work out how you'd sell this film as one of the best films all year.<br/><br/>Personally I loved it. Occasionally the story telling was a little trite but it was a grown up film for grown ups...telling us a story of man v governments in a cynical way. It's just a shame that so many Americans still think the US is honourable. Let's hope Bernie Sanders leads them from late next year for 4- 8 years. Thankfully in this film, man seems to win but it a closer thing. Of course the East Germans are trying to outdo the Soviets. Of course the soviets don't believe anything they are told. Of course the American CIA are small minded and ridiculous and cannot see that their imperialism is as authoritarian as the Soviets....but the audience get to side with a human being not an ideology.<br/><br/>Great film."

","This is a great spy and legal drama on the exchange of spies during the cold war.<br/><br/>I went to see it with the kids and they all liked it. The historical reconstruction (East Berlin in particular) is very realistic and the movie mixes very well ""every day"" life scenes with intense scenes.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks played very well the unwilling soft spoken hero (Atticus Finch style). The stress that himself and his family had to bear is a tense part of the first half of the movie. The (almost) final scene when the family discovers his role in the exchange is a great masterpiece for me.<br/><br/>Mark Rylance in the Soviet spy role is also a great supporting actor, so much like a stubborn, quiet grandfather working at the post office, and so much different from the ""traditional Russian spy"" (either half-naked lady or half-brained bully) to be entirely believable (and likable too).<br/><br/>One of my kids knew the story from a spy history book and vouches for the accuracy of the details (minor issue is that the American spying plane pilot Powers seems a novice whilst he had several flights under his belly, but you can't have everything)."

He created horror, adventure, mystery, fantasy, comedy genre movies. But his strongest movies are the ones about history. Bridge of spies is about a lawyer who gets in a dangerous politics game of spies between USA and USSR. I gotta say this movie is not adventure movie so if you are waiting for lots of action and shooting and running, forget it. But if you want to see a good realistic spy movie that shows what spies looks like in a real world this movie is a must. Again Tom Hanks performed perfectly. Directing, screenplay and cameraman job is done with highest standards. The only weak spot i would think of is it gets too sentimental at times.

","The term espionage drama often injects doubt in one's mind these days. Primarily because one imagines a repetitive enactment of a browbeaten story line spiced up with a wiser than thou twist that leaves the unimaginative audience spellbound, but the seasoned viewer dismayed. Bridge of Spies is perhaps one of the better spy thrillers to have been produced in the last 2-3 years. <br/><br/>What differentiates the movie is the sincerity of the plot. Despite a cold-war era plot and seemingly predictable themes, Spielberg manages to enthuse the audience with unpretentious storytelling. <br/><br/>There is an air of suspense that lingers on till the end, but never commands or steers the plot. In fact the best part of the movie is that it excavates human emotions and psychology through the various sequences , thereby catapulting the drama to an equal status of that of the thriller. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks does a great job with the character dealt to him. Also noteworthy is the performance of the main CIA lead . The movie may be accused of being a little too sentimental and tad melodramatic , but then in this age of serving uncooked and practical relationships, I would love to go have a extra helping of emotions , once in a while."
"siderite","8","0","1","30 December 2015"," Philadelphia meets Schindler's List
","Personally I thought the movie was a bit too heavy-handed and that the ending was way more melodramatic than it should have been. But the movie was good. More than that, it is a story that must be shown today. I felt the ending kind of ruined the effect a little bit, though.<br/><br/>The story is that of a lawyer who believes in the law - imagine that - and because of his extraordinary efforts to defend a Russian spy in the heavily patriotic legal system from 1957 he is tagged to intermediate a prisoner exchange. You get this idea directly from the trailer and the plot, as it were, is not deviating from that. Instead, it is Hanks' acting and Spielberg's directing that you need to appreciate, as they masterfully make the case for the spirit of America, not for its power.<br/><br/>The film is based on a real person, and his own autobiographical book, and it is well rendered, albeit a bit paint-by-numbers. The title of my review is more accurate than I would have wanted. Even so, I felt that the first part of the movie was great and that it should have been a film on its own. You get a man that is doing his job and upholding the moral values Americans are so proud of by defending a man that everyone thinks is despicably guilty and as reward gets scoffed at, gets the evil eye and even has shots fired at his house - 2nd amendment style - from a driving by car, only to be blamed for it by the police officers called to investigate. He returns to his job only to find that cases he was assigned to were reassigned and his partners are reluctant to speak to him.<br/><br/>That message is far more relevant today than the general result driven heroics that movies - including this one - usually portray. The point is that good means different things for different people and therefore it never actually wins. The fact that Donovan had a successful career as a negotiator later on is good for Donovan, but I felt it hurt the movie."

","If you know what to expect from Spielberg & Hanks collaboration, I think, you will feel the same way I feel; satisfied. Most characters Tom Hanks have depicted during the years are similar to the ones we see in real life. This makes it easier to watch and enjoy his movies, although this isn't the sole reason to praise Bridge of Spies.<br/><br/>Cold War era, Russian and American spies trying to get information about each others' actions, people feel like they are on the brink of a nuclear war, irrational fear of everything related to communism, thriving West Germany while East in poverty, Berlin Wall and so on. Among all this cliché, an alleged Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), is arrested for espionage in NYC, and the constitution demands somebody to defend him. In order to look just, the government appoints a successful attorney, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), as Rudolf Abel's attorney. Our journey starts when these two meet. Tom Hanks does a great job portraying Mr. Donovan. He is so convincing and the time he appears on the screen, it is like your old uncle Tom came to see you after a long time. And there is Mark Rylance's character Rudolf Abel the coolest spy I have ever seen on the screen. He is unbelievable, don't expect him jumping long distances, flying and punching somebody and killing ten guys with one punch, he is just cool, even with his pyjamas. These outstanding performances offer unique and enjoyable dialogues.<br/><br/>The only problem is the story is based on true events but it's told from only one sides perspective. I think this is not a big deal, and had the Soviets told their version of the story I'd be glad to see it. <br/><br/>The scene with Ivan Schisckin, head of eastern KGB, is so disturbing because to reach there Mr. Donovan walks a long distance in freezing cold weather with his coat robbed of him, and shivering continuously in front of the former, but he doesn't care and even offer him a glass of drink. Nobody doesn't expect a great deal of hospitality from him, but, common, even he is your enemy, be polite. That was inhumane. And finally there is unlikable Agent Hoffman, well portrayed by Scott Shepherd, I don't know how to describe him, people like him, I guess, are there just to make everything difficult and annoy you.<br/><br/>Overall, Bridge of Spies is an entertaining picture, I recommend it."
"EzioMonty117","9","0","1","29 December 2015"," Spielberg went back to his route's with this beautiful and intense drama
","Bridge of Spies was a Movie i knew about from Empire Magazine where i saw the poster for it and it looked quite good since it's directed by the legendary Spielberg himself and then i saw With my friend and my former teacher and i love almost as much as Catch me if you can but not Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan. Here's why this film is a near masterpiece.<br/><br/>The story follows a lawyer called James who gets recruited by the CIA to go on a negotiation mission to Exchange the CIA U-2 plane until Francis Powers fails a mission and gets shot Down by the Soviet Union and the plane crashes and now Francis is sentenced for many years in prison due to the crash of the plane and capturing everyone on camera, while a another subplot follows James's Client Rudolf Abel who is considered a spy despite not being a Spy and being a normal East German painter With a wife, and James wants to Exchange his partner With Powers because Rudolf deserves his freedom and James goes on a quest in East Berlin to Exchange partners while having unexpected surprises With Frederick, who is not up to par.<br/><br/>First off, the direction is almost as good as Schindler, the accuracy of the real events are pretty Close and the 1957 Brooklyn and East Berlin is well put out to look like the 1950s. The characters are designed uniquely and they have one of the best character driven stories in any Spielberg film. Rudolf is the painter With no Identity, Powers is the pilot accused for one mistake and Frederick is the American who just needs information to get out from prison and last James is the lawyer With kindness and respect to People, they all are Perfect and well choreographed.<br/><br/>The performances especially Tom Hanks is the strongest aspect of this Movie, Tom Hanks brings his signature trademark which is his emotions and respect to People which makes him a likable character and you really feel sorry for all he is going through. Mark Rylance is pretty good as he also brings the emotions and struggles the pain of being considered a spy while not being one at all.<br/><br/>The film has some problems but they're not too big, the ending is too long, like you think the film is done after the Exchange of partners and Frederick release from prison but no, there's 10 minutes more of James getting back home and hiding his adventures until his wife finds it out and he takes a nap without the wife noticing his innocence, i just thought the ending just dragged on, but it isn't terrible The dialogue can be nifty at times, especially from Frederick and one of the CIA agents, they just don't deliver them as much as the others, and the film's score by John Williams is kinda forgettable at best, but it's still there.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies is a near Perfect Movie With great performances, direction, drama, setting, characters, Development, story and accuracy but the dialogue, score and the ending is weak but this film is Worth it nonetheless <br/><br/>9/10"

","Whilst it won't be making any top Spielberg lists nor it will register as one of the year's best for me, ""Bridge of Spies"" was a very welcome time at the cinema, that proves Spielberg is still going strong.<br/><br/>And at times you feel like he's going as strong as ever. I refer that to many little scenes that the film has, especially at the beginning with Mark Rylance. The majority of them are small chase scenes, yet Spielberg manages to stage all of them so intimately that even in the opening where you don't know who is who yet, you still feel genuine tension coming out. That is especially thanks to how to camera is placed and moved which really makes itself noticeable, but happily so because it is a pleasure to see unfold on screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Spielberg misses the mark with the overall story and emotional core for me. That is something that I see many people disagreeing on, Stuckmann for example talked about how truly what the movie is about, is two nations with different views getting along. Regretfully so I really didn't see many layers to the film, I was always engaged by the plot moving forward, but I never felt emotional about much stuff and it showed in the climax and finale that should have been the usual overwhelming of emotions from Spielberg (that for example I got from Lincoln, even though I dislike the film), but it just never arrived for me. I didn't get involved in anything other than the story and had a really hard time grasping the movie's arch, message and overall emotional punch. That is also probably due to the way many morality issues are dealt with. I get it's subjective, that there is no need to have a conclusion on the issue, but the film constantly sidelined the discussion that was going on about the moral issues involved, so much so that I found it to be murky on the subject. They are brought up throughout, but as soon as they come in they are left aside for the story to move on, so your left watching the story unfold, but I was thinking: ""can't we go back to the part where they discuss that?"".<br/><br/>Anyways, that's enough for the lacks I found with the film. Overall I must say that as much as I didn't grasp the underlying thematic layers, I dug that story a lot. In a 140 minute movie I was never, ever bored for a second, I always wanted to see what happened next and Tom Hanks is probably on of the main reasons for it. He made every scene go out with a punch and negotiations discussions fascinating. What can I say? It was a really well written screenplay which brilliantly managed to tell a story without you ever getting confused, especially looking at how many characters there are.<br/><br/>If you're going in expecting some Spielberg magic you will certainly be disappointed, but that's a really tall order. I think that what you get is a very good and surprisingly fun time at the cinema."
"stephendaxter","8","0","1","28 December 2015"," Spielberg delivers another incredible dialogue driven film
","'Bridge of Spies'.. A Drama/Spy Thriller Biopic.. Directed by Steven Spielberg.. Written by the Coen Brothers.. Starring Tom Hanks.. Seriously, this film deserves WAY more love and attention than it got. This film told the story of James Donovan, a lawyer who defended a captured Soviet spy and was then thrown into the middle of the Cold War where he was responsible for organising an exchange: a captured US pilot for a Soviet spy. This was an incredible movie all across the board, Spielberg as usual has done a fantastic job at directing this film and Tom Hanks puts in one of the performances of his career (It seems as though everything he does is 'one of the performances of his career') as they tell this story in the most captivating way possible. One thing you must know about this film and the thing i loved the most about it is that this is, from start to finish, is a dialogue driven film with fantastic visuals to make you feel like you are in East Berlin. You don't get any high stakes action scenes, and no fast paced violent depictions of the Cold War, this is a very focused story about one man and his mission to organise a trade between two opposing governments. <br/><br/>And at first it may seem rather boring, you may ask; How are they going to fill 2 hours and 20 minutes with conversations and discussions about a trade for two men in a 'Spy Thriller'? Well by utilising amazing and incredible dialogue, they manage to capture your attention at every moment and you are fully engaged the whole time so that the film goes by really quickly. I cannot express enough, how amazing the dialogue is to be able to carry the film all the way through without needing any big exciting events. The dialogue is so smart that you start picking up on the little hints that tie in to things said an hour prior and start noticing moments of foreshadowing and it only goes to show the amount of attention and thought from the Coen Brothers that went into crafting the dialogue in the film. There are a few scenes in the film where Spielberg creates the feeling of tension extremely well without using any dialogue or little music, just visuals. These relatively quiet moments were so powerful and managed to get the message across without any exposition, that it is another testament to Spielberg's incredibly diverse directing abilities. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks was just absolutely amazing in this film as James Donovan. This film showed why he remains as one of my favourite actors of all time. Especially in these dramatic roles, the way he embodies the character and their traits and personality, you never feel like he is just playing the same character over and over. The dialogue alone isn't enough to captivate an audience, you need a top tier actor to put in a stellar performance and make it all seem believable, imagine Adam Sandler delivering the same lines, it simply would not work, and would just turn into a shitty comedy. Tom Hanks it seems can be anyone, need a Captain Phillips? Walt Disney? James Donovan? Hanks is your go-to guy. If i was to pick out anything i think could have been done better i would be nit-picking because it is a variation of minor stuff. But there is a brief moment around a third of the way into the film where there is a shift in the overall focus of the film and i thought it happened a little too quick and would liked to have seen it drawn out a little, but seriously, just a fairly minor thing. <br/><br/>So in the end, this is a film you should definitely check out, a Dramatic, Suspenseful Spy Thriller that takes out the big action set-pieces and replaces them with interesting and captivating dialogue delivered by Tom Hanks to perfection.<br/><br/>8.2/10"

","A Cold War thriller starring a Tom Hanks seeming inexplicable. Steven Spielberg's technique is to pack intrigue and movement into every shot, to fill his characters and story with fidelity to the era's realpolitik. It's a movie without much glamor and it's enjoyable though there's no impetus or pace. Spielberg can't animate a Coen brothers script combining espionage and court room. 141 minutes is an excessive runtime but the story successfully bets the house on the interplay between an all-American archetype and a reserved but fragile traitor looking like a bank clerk. All these characters are perfect and that's enough in a film built on legal conversation."

","""Bridge of Spies"" is a true story that occurred during the Cold War and shows the story of a lawyer that is tasked to organize the exchange of prisoners between the US and the Soviets in Berlin.<br/><br/>I have to start with Mark Rylance performance. His nomination for the Golden Globes as Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture is totally deserved. Every time he appears is like a breath of fresh air and the character he performs made me think a lot about one of my main decision/realization of lately. His repeated line: ""Would it help?"" comes into what you could call as, accepting what is (something I first read about in Eckhart Tolle books). Eveytime he is asked if he is worried, if he is afraid, Abel answers with this simple question that has a deep meaning. Is it worth it to spend energy or time worrying about something that is beyond your control? The only think you can do in that moment is to accept. If you really can do something, do it or simply let it be. His performance is jut brilliant! When a movie is based on true events, it always brings with it a more palpable way I can relate to the story. Even though I also think about what was made shinier just for the movie sake. Tom Hanks, as Donovan, also performs beautifully, but in my opinion not as brilliantly, a man that when asked to do something outside his usual job, still wants to do deliver the best he can in order to get the facts straight. Even if it goes ""against"" his own country view of what is the truth.<br/><br/>The 8 goes for the brilliant interpretation of Mark Rylance and everything he made me think about (also Donovan's work ethic), for the work in making us truly believed that the movie has recorded in that years and locations, for the amazing story being shared and what was one of the most enjoyable trips to the cinemas I had in the last months."

It's a very subtle one, but he commands your gaze and attention any time he is on screen. I don't think many actors could have given the role so much effect, especially such a quiet one, but he managed to do that and more. The problem is that he's stuck in a film that is completely and thoroughly just fine. The good thing is that, except for the sentimental ending, Steven Spielberg doesn't interfere too much with the story around him. He is mostly restrained. Overall, this isn't something I will be aching to rewatch any time soon, and not something I will remember. Although it's quicker in pacing, definitely not nearly the film that Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is, but it's not bad at all."

It is intense movie (although ending can be predicted) with a very good cast and directing.<br/><br/>Reason I didn't rate this movie with a higher rate than 7 is that I consider it as typical ""Americanized"" war movie. I do not like subjectivity in American movies especially war movies.<br/><br/>It is reflected for example in the fact that American treat Russian spy correctly and much better than the Russians treat American spy - no reason for that. Also in the attitude of the main character, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) who represents everything good in America. He represents honest, decent American citizen upstanding in his work, with his family... He behaves like a hero when he refuse to obey orders and decides to risk all and of course he manage to save both American prisoners.<br/><br/>Pathetic can be seen in ending when James B. Donovan comes home tired and his family is just watching TV news about him as a hero. Also in scene in subway where random people (woman in subway) recognized him and feeling proud.<br/><br/>Because of mentioned reasons I put it among average war movies. Tom Hanks performance was very good as always, reminds me of his role in the film Captain Phillips, similar role, true story both, ""Americanized"" and he ends up as a hero.<br/><br/>This ""Americanization"" can be seen in all of Spielberg's war movies except for Schindler's List, in which is represented in a much lesser extent, therefore, I consider Schindler's list his best war movie."

In Vin Arthey's book about Abel ""The Kremlin's Geordie Spy: The Man They Swapped for Gary Powers"" (also called ""Like Father Like Son: A Dynasty of Spies"") he states that Abel, real name William Fisher, sometimes spoke 'educated' English and sometimes local or dialect speech, that is with a Geordie accent.

","Bridge of Spies, the new Steven Spielberg directed film about an American lawyer who is asked to defend a man accused of being a Soviet spy during the Cold War, reminds me of the type of films that James Stewart would have starred in back in the 40's and 50's. It especially brings to mind some of his collaborations with director Frank Capra. All these films took place at a similar time and deep down Bridge of Spies both has the nostalgic qualities of those early movies as well as it proudly an American picture and represents it's country with dignity and respect, but also ingrained into the film is a message about loyalty, honour and humanism. Tom Hanks, plays the James Stewart type character in this film and he is a loving family man and cares deeply not only about his family, but his country and doing the right thing as well. When he is asked to defend Rudolf Abel, the man convicted of being a Soviet spy, Hanks' character James B. Donovan, doesn't really have to think about it for too long. He knows that defending such a man as Rudolf, especially during the Cold War, is a risky move and one that is bound to raise many an eyebrow of his friends and neighbors, but also could bring some repercussions upon him and even his family. Donovan accepts the job though because he is under the impression and belief that everyone is entitled to a fair trial and that Rudolf also deserves his share of justice and having been defended whether he really is guilty, or not. A character who puts others first instead of himself is one of the attributes that reminds me of a lot of the loyal and truly honorable American characters that James Stewart used to play. Take, It's A Wonderful Life for example. Stewart's character George Bailey does so much for the town in which he lives as well as everyone living in it that he has always put his own dreams and desires on the backburner to see to it that there was a fair lending system in his city and people were not controlled by the evil, Mr. Potter, who more, or less tries to take over the town and the town people's money. James B. Donovan, is another one of those characters who absolutely is proud and loves his country and while what he is doing may be called ""un American"" by some of those around him, he strongly believes that giving Abel, a fair trial and representing him is everything that America stands for. Including true democracy and freedom of speech and the right to be defended in a court of law. Another honorable film character it brings to mind is Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird. We have seen these type of heroes and films before and yet there is something that keeps bringing us back to them. I would be a liar if I said there has been a single Christmas is the last ten to fifteen years when I haven't watched It's A Wonderful Life and have been completely wowed and deeply moved by it on every single occasion I watch it (which does turn out to be every year). These are the type of films that were shown after the Great Depression, or during, or after the Second World War because these types of films were definitely morale boosters and in a sense (especially back then), that is why they were made in the first place. I have read some complaints about Bridge of Spies and this certain World War 2 era nostalgia and type of acting. I have read complaints calling the acting in the film hokey and more melodramatic, which is something I can understand a lot of people who would watch a modern day film would have a problem with. I admit myself that in my journey through all sorts of different films from different years and decades, that I used to have a problem with American films made in the 40's, or 50's because of the melodramatic acting style. And yet, I could have easily watched a European film from that same time period and have had no qualms, or issues with the acting whatsoever. While, I admit that melodramatic acting is still not one of my favorites (whether it was done back then, or currently), I have learned to accept it and look at it more as a sign of the times back then more than anything else. I think that is also how you have to look at Bridge of Spies because it is very faithful and accurate in recreating those times, so that acting style has to stay. It wasn't a problem for me though and look at Mark Rylance's performance as Rudolf Abel. Not melodramatic in the least, but a very fascinating and interesting character to watch that does eventually become endearing to us the viewers. This is a film that I found to be quite inspiring and moving and that is one of the strong reasons I am recommending it. The performances (keeping in mind the time period) are all very good as well and this is one of those films that is a feel good film that captures your interest and keeps you in a good mood after you have left the theatre. A real accomplishment in this day and age and one to be honored."

","Mr Hanks and Mr Spielberg turned out a very watchable Cold War thriller. Is it great? Nope...but it is very good. I do remember the U2 and, Tom Hanks is correct, Lt Powers was probably the most hated man in America. As much as I liked this movie, I did find one thing offensive...the way the country's paranoia was portrayed, reeks of typical Hollyweirdo hypocrisy and hubris. Reacting to real fear is neither simplistic nor sophomoric. To scoff at yesteryear's apprehensions resonates eerily with those denying atrocities that occurred two decades before or those ignorantly forgetting the war (? I know...it was not a declared war) with North Korea. For most other directors, callous arrogance is to be expected...but not from thee Movie-master, Mr. Spielberg. Probably an oversight, but I think the situational reactions should have been just edited out. Anyways...good movie. I like everything that is actually done by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks always seems like one of the guys you want have a beer with...really easy to get along with, and level headed"
"jakob13","9","0","1","8 November 2015"," Solid conventional film
","Spielberg's 'Bridge of Spires' is a solid, conventional, following a style that he has wrought over his career as film maker. As film's opening alerts us, it's a mostly true story, some facts having been modified or slightly changed to accommodate the narrative. Missing is the key that brought about the capture of Rudolph I. Abel: the nickel given to the 'Brooklyn Eagle' newsboy that had the microfiche of data for Moscow. 'Bridge of Spies' happens during the early Cold War years that 'Trumbo' takes place. Here the good and the bad is clearly delineated, in the person of Donahue (Tom Hanks) who defends the spy Abel (Mark Ryland). Hanks is faithful to the Constitution and to the law that says Abel is innocent until proved guilty. Even though the judge, the spooks in the CIA and the whole legal system want a speedy show trial of sorts, to show the superiority of the God fearing capitalism of the US versus atheistic communism of the Soviet Union. A parallel story is on another track the U-2 pilot Gary Francis Power who gets shot down while on a hush hush CIA spy mission in Soviet territory. He doesn't kill himself which was part of his mission if captured, and even though he didn't break under interrogation he remained suspect and tainted with cowardice and perhaps suspicion of treason. Donahue is called on, as a private citizen to arrange for the exchange of spies on a bridge in divided Berlin. The capture by the East Germans of a Yale Ph.D. student Pryor gums up the works, the more especially since Donahue won't carry out the exchange without Powers and Pryor. In the course of defending Abel, Donahue and he are seen of men of principle and consistency of motive and mission. American diplomacy, spy networks and the law come off with unclean hands. We needn't worry about the Commies since we know how evil they are. Ryland plays Abel with great discernment and circumspection. Hanks has the modesty and intellectual honesty of the hero of the film he is and perhaps he was in real life. A man of commonsense who wanted to see the cash on the barrel head, as partner of a prestigious law firm dealing in insurance. 'Bridge' has a PG-13 rating which does suffer the way 'Trumbo' does with an 'R' rating. The former politics are acceptable and in the main stream whilst the latter is louche and out of sync with the main stream, though the two play by the same rule book, the US Constitution. But 'Bridge' remains within orthodoxy and 'Trumbo' smells of heresy."

","What's Spielberg without war? He continues pushing out film after film involving some war story and somehow we can never get tired of it. We never feel like he's beating a dead horse. It's because the man encapsulates the classic ideals of cinema, and one of the last of his kind to do so.<br/><br/>Spielberg's way of directing is the kind that invites you to come aboard, but never forces you to. He doesn't beg for your attention--you just can't help but give it to him--sometimes without even realizing.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies is a story about espionage, human rights, societal opinion, understanding your enemy, and American pride all wrapped up into one. It's at its very best when themes conflict and contradict with one another--which happens all throughout.<br/><br/>Taking place in New York in the 1950s during the Cold War, it stars Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer chosen to represent captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Obviously, Donovan becomes one of America's most hated men, meanwhile developing a friendship with Abel and truly understanding his life and choices. Then tables are turned as now the Soviets have captured one of our own spies and Donovan must use Abel as leverage to trade back what is ours.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies constantly reminds us that at our worst we are still better than the Soviet Union. It acts as a good reminder of our humanity, even during the times that are most bereft of it. Perhaps it even satirizes our willingness to change our minds. While our viewpoints may be skewed at times by the media or even the government, it reminds us that we never quite know the whole story--although we're wholly convinced that we do at times.<br/><br/>The first third takes place in America--presumably on purpose. It's a little darker than many other period pieces may depict it as--say even this year's The Man from U.N.C.L.E.--obviously a very specific perspective of the era. Then the last chunk of the film features the most depraved East Berlin. But the thing is, here we don't see it as any exaggeration. It's exactly how we've always envisioned it during that time. That's how it was--glum and depressing--another reminder.<br/><br/>Spielberg uses juxtaposition to its finest potential, transitioning between scenes of Americans and Soviets--an American spy going to sleep in his cell after being tortured by Soviet soldiers cuts to Abel, the most hated man in America, being woken up respectfully by American prison guards.<br/><br/>I will say, however, that there is something missing with the absence of a John Williams score in the film, but Thomas Newman's style fits nicely with the project adding the right amounts of emotion.<br/><br/>The film adequately captures the misinformed fears of the early Cold War and uses them to get its points across. It's last reminder, and perhaps its strongest, is that you never know the whole story. When you stop thinking independently you begin allowing others to control you--much like the Soviets tried doing. It's crazy. Our fear was inadvertently becoming what it so desperately tried to avoid.<br/><br/>How can you not love Spielberg? He brings magic back into the movies when we feel, at times, it may be gone forever. Bridge of Spies is superb--one of the year's best. This is why I go to the movies.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 100"
"svorva","7","0","1","5 November 2015"," Living Up to Hype
","Movie buffs pegged Bridge of Spies as one of the premier films of 2015 simply by looking at the credits. Spielberg at the helm along with his main man, the Cohen Brothers script might not have been necessary to generate the early Oscar buzz. Were expectations met? Well I don't think I would stir up to much controversy by saying that Bridge was not one of Spielberg's best. Hanks is still playing Hanks. And I bet that third writer nobody ever heard of actually wrote the script. Still, Bridge of Spies should leave moviegoers satisfied if not inspired. Bridge of Spies covers lawyer James B. Donovan involvement in the events before and after the 1960 U2 spy plane incident. Donovan is played by America's leading man Tom Hanks. Thus he possesses all those fundamental Hanksian values we have learned to love. Donovan has been serendipitously thrust into international covert hostage exchange. Still, this is no cloak and dagger spy thriller. Donovan primarily perseveres by being courageous and amiable. The Cohen Brothers are best sensed in eloquent spats of dialogue between the straight foreword Donovan and his more clandestine adversaries. These sequences highlight the madness of the Cold War and how men like Donovan even in perilous situations are infinitely more valuable than an army of 007s. Sure, the account is largely fictitious, but I appreciate the clear thesis in historical dramas. Spielberg is still a master. Take the opening. A bit of camera movement turns a bystander into a suspicious character. Three men walking in one direction suggest a conspiracy. Finally, the tension breaks, a flustered pair reunite with their equally miffed compatriots, and we have a blown operation. The film might slow a tad too much after the first act, but the craftsmanship evaporates any notion of boring. Bridge of Spies might not be the product of the dream team we were hoping for, but I doubt more than a dozen films well hit theaters this year that could possibly be better."
"luke-a-mcgowan","8","0","1","4 November 2015"," Reliably good work from all, but lacks passion beyond a star turn from Rylance
","Bridge of Spies tells the true story of James Donovan, an insurance lawyer who is given the thankless task of defending a Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel in the name of ""due process"". Where the stumbling blocks rise is that Donovan's view of ""due process"" differs from everyone else's. The country, the judge, the prosecution - everyone wants Abel convicted and hanged, and sooner rather than later. Donovan wants to do his best by his client. Hanks himself is solid - failing to rise up to his excellent work in Cast Away or The Green Mile, or to evoke a flaming desire for justice like Gregory Peck could in To Kill a Mockingbird - but solid. This part of the story is slow but solid, as it serves as a showcase for a wonderful Mark Rylance. Rylance is immensely understated yet far from bland - his mild-mannered conversations are the most interesting part of the film. <br/><br/>When an American pilot is shot down, Donovan is sent to negotiate his return for Abel, who Donovan managed to save from the death penalty in anticipation of this occurrence (its very obvious in places that this dialogue was written with the benefit of hindsight, as opposed to being natural dialogue of the characters). East Berlin is lovingly crafted thanks to outstanding work from Adam Stockhausen (last year's Oscar winner for Production Design, and a sure nominee again this year). Just like in Lincoln and Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg doesn't just take you to a world, he creates in on screen and gives it the right atmosphere - in this case, a chilling and claustrophobic one. <br/><br/>The screenplay is a strong asset considering that it keeps an almost 150 minute film interesting. The negotiations (which are far more complicated than the trailer implies) are fascinating, the dialogue crackles and there are quite a few connections and themes I really enjoyed. For example, when Donovan converses with the sentencing judge and later with his German adversary there are throwbacks to his insurance lawyer language that go to show just how right he was for the job. A debriefing word of comfort he gives to the captured American pilot also shows a similarity between them that I had never seen before. <br/><br/>There are a few scenes that weren't particularly necessary - a few forced and obligatory Cold War scenes and a ten-second romance between Donovan's daughter and young law associate - and a few points that are touched on briefly and pounded into us instead of subtly touched on throughout (i.e. community anger towards Donovan). The film's editors could have chopped a bit more out of the film, but I really enjoyed a few smash cuts between the different story lines - especially one about Powers' and Abel's respective equipment. While there are a number of small problems with the film - mostly in the cinematography department - I don't have any problems with the film so much as missed opportunities. Amy Ryan is wasted in a bit part, and is unrecognisable under what looks like an inch and a half of makeup. <br/><br/>Casting is probably the biggest missed opportunity - with the exception of Hanks and a cameo from Alan Alda (who is great, but doesn't stop it being a cameo), there's almost no one recognisable in this movie. Its as if Spielberg was trying to launch as many careers as he can, but Rylance is the only one who rises to the occasion. It was definitely a wasted opportunity not to have big name actors going toe to toe with Hanks in the negotiations. Imagine if Mandy Patinkin was the Russian, while Fiennes and Neeson (former Oscar nominees for playing Germans in Spielberg films) played the Germans? Just like Catch Me If You Can was thrilling because it was Hanks v Dicaprio, now the negotiations would be gripping for watching Hollywood heavyweights duke it out.<br/><br/>Bridge of Spies is not stirring enough to invite passion that many of his older films have enjoyed, but its a head and shoulders above Lincoln and is reliably excellent on all fronts. It can rely on a number of Oscar nominations come January, but I highly doubt it has the potential to claim the top prize."

The movie is a brilliant portrayal of the story and it really kept me interested the whole time. The movie was amazing. Hanks's performance was excellent, and Steven Spielberg did a wonderful job with the film as well. Rylance is also good as Abel.

"thefilmlawyers","8","0","4","23 October 2015"," Bridge of Spies: ""A solid, yet unspectacular, effort as Spielberg and Hanks reunite.""
","Greetings everybody, Chulbul-Pandey has returned to deliver another review of an Oscar hopeful! This week, the film being covered is the one that reunites Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks in the midst of the Cold War. This film, ladies, and gentlemen is Bridge of Spies. <br/><br/>When going into a film headlined by Steven Spielberg in the role of director and Tom Hanks in the lead role, hopes immediately are raised that the film will be as memorable and classic as their most celebrated team up, Saving Private Ryan. Add in the fact that the film was written by Joel and Ethan Coen (oh, you know, the duo behind classics such as Fargo, No Country for Old Men & True Grit) and expectations rightfully reach stratospheric levels of hype. Despite all of that quality, what the film delivers does not reach that level of expected quality; it comes agonizingly close to being a great film but the certain setup decisions hold it back. Keep in mind, the film was still a solid effort that ticked all of the right boxes so failing to reach the lofty goals I described in no way detracts from what was still a solid flick. From the great acting to incredible visuals to the focus on the story that does away with the expected love story shoo-in typical of many films, it certainly does a lot of things right. The part that immediately draws the viewer in is how Hanks' character, an American insurance lawyer, is selected to defend a Russian spy (played by Mark Rylance) in a case where the odds are heavily stacked against said Russian. The opening 45 minutes has the viewer thinking this will be a Cold War era film that goes against the norm, focusing more in-depth on the xenophobia prevalent during that era and less on establishing the Soviets as the indisputable villains. That the film fails to further such an idea and opts to focus on battlefield negotiations can be seen as a disappointment, as a film dedicated to exploring hostilities by the highest levels of the United States authorities against sympathetic non-American villains would have been a fairly novel and innovative idea. The film's decision to move away from this idea drags its grade down a notch, bringing it from something special to just solid. <br/><br/>The final hour is a distinctly notable tonal change, as the film transitions from a courtroom drama to a hostage negotiation/amateur spycraft scenario in the second half. The film used its 2+hour run time very well (when has a Spielberg film ever not been consistently excellent in terms of time management) but that glaring feeling persists throughout that it could have been more impactful and ""epic"" had it followed the path the first 45 minute established.<br/><br/>The little details that are packed into the film's scenes and individual performances are marvelously executed, from the lack of subtitles in foreign language scenes highlighting the ""show, not tell"" attitude adopted by Spielberg and co, to the enthralling and marvelous opening segment that sets the stakes for what is to follow. The dialogue was generally superb throughout, and it says something for the quality of a film when nearly 3/4s of it can be filled with conversations across a desk and yet the film's quality is elevated further due to such a setup. The Coen brothers' fingerprints were all over the script and it showed, as their films are famous for their engaging dialogue. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks, as is the norm for him, marvels in a very restrained role this time around (he'll get his usual Oscar nomination, but his performance is not quite at Saving Private Ryan level excellent). For any fans of legendary actor Jimmy Stewart, this feels as if it is the most Jimmy Steward-type role of Hanks career, which is always a good thing. Mark Rylance, in his role as an alleged Soviet spy, actually ends up stealing the show, putting forth a performance that will rightfully generate awards buzz in the coming months. His performance, despite being delivered in a supporting and thus limited role, keeps viewers invested in his Soviet character in the film, which is not something Hollywood usually excels at. His timing and delivery of lines also serves to lighten the mood for the crowd as well, as he defies the traditional expectations of a boring and stoic Soviet character. The easiest way to sum up the film would be this: Bridge of Spies is mostly about covering and delivering material that many Cold War spy and espionage films had attempted to previously but Spies succeeds in putting it all together in a much more entertaining package. <br/><br/>Janusz Kaminski provides some wonderful images with his cinematography. One notable scene involving a teenager biking alongside the Berlin Wall as it is being built is both tense and remarkable for its beauty. A downside of that is that while that scene – and a few others- was exceptionally shot, no single shot felt quite ""epic"" in its scope, a disappointment when considering the vast amount of iconic and ""epic"" shots Spielberg's prior films have been host to. Additionally, Spielberg moved away from his recent tendency to use overpowering soundtracks, instead utilizing either very serene ambient music or no music at all, preferring to let the scene and natural sound tell the story. That decision lends itself well to Spies, as the use of a stronger sound in the climactic scene helped to elevate the quality of the scene and bring along with it a greater appreciation for the conclusion. <br/><br/>As has become customary for almost any film with Spielberg at the helm or with Hanks starring, Spies will undoubtedly earn some Oscar consideration. When compared to the vast filmography of all involved,<br/><br/>however, one cannot help but feel that the film just lacks that extra oomph to push it over the top. <br/><br/>Bridge of Spies gets a B+."
"michaelradny","7","0","3","22 October 2015"," Bridge Of Pies
","Bridge Of Spies acts as if you are ordering food at a restaurant (much like that one scene with all the food in East Berlin). However, you've ordered a rare steak and what comes out is a medium steak. It's the same food, and you'll eat it, but it's not what you ordered. Bridge Of Spies just feels too cautious in it's approach. The trailers were extremely misleading (tho I don't judge the film on that) and nothing really happens. Instead of the suspense and highly intense story I was believing I was going to get, I got a courtroom drama with a cliché side story instead.<br/><br/>Bridge Of Spies is underwhelming, tho if you deal with it, the middle portion of the film is quite fast paced and well filmed. However, if you look at the two sides of the middle, you'll find a slow paced, uneventful, cliché riddled, classic Spielberg film and a classic Tom Hanks performance. Nothing all that new nor great, but at times enjoyable."
"burlesonjesse5","7","0","2","22 October 2015"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Bridge of Spies
","Spielberg and Hanks. Hanks and Spielberg. Their collaborations have become legend. You've got 1998's Saving Private Ryan which I never went gaga over. Then there's The Terminal, not an awful film just meh. Finally, we have Catch Me If You Can, the duo's entertaining masterpiece (this is just my opinion). Bridge of Spies (my latest review) is the current synergy between these two celebrated, Hollywood giants. It's cinematic hot chocolate recommendable because of historical significance. ""Bridge"" with its darkly-lit scenes and bloated two hour- plus running time, falls into Steven's two categories of movies being hyperactive, action adventures and historical sagas. It hightails into the latter meaning it's talky, draggy, and mostly devoid of anything compelling. I felt as if I was watching Lincoln again minus the circa range of 1865. Translation: No second viewing for this camper.<br/><br/>Taking place during the Cold War via 1957, featuring a cast of virtual unknowns (a Spielberg emblem), and written by none other than the Cohen brothers (Ethan and Joel Cohen of course), Bridge of Spies chronicles real-life insurance lawyer, James B. Donovan (Hanks). He's a family man, a dude bent on doing the right thing. When he gets saddled with defending a Russian spy (Rudolf Abel played uniquely by Mark Rylance), Donovan helps said spy avoid the death penalty while attempting to trade him for two American refugees (a fighter pilot and a graduate student who are both detained by way of espionage). The flick then involves globetrotting within the territories of Germany, Russia, and you guessed it, Brooklyn, New York. Scenes build to a slow creep combining negotiation dialogue that spews mannerisms at verbatim (Tom's James B. has the flu, we get it). I sensed that I'd been in the theater for ten hours and sat through three drawn-out endings (the final sequence is reminiscent of 1985's White Nights. It looks like a soundstage which is uncharacteristic of the mighty Steven Spielberg).<br/><br/>In retrospect, the acting (as expected) is solid with Tom Hanks being well, Tom Hanks. We all know he's the quintessential everyman. Will he get a nomination from the Academy? Maybe but this is October so there's sixty days left in the fiscal year. Bottom line: The World's most socko director provides us with admirable storytelling, technical skill, and period detail of the highest order. Does he entertain the moviegoer in the process? Not entirely. Be sure to bring heightened intelligence and an attention span (the size of Texas) to actually feel immersed. This is a ""bridge"" too far if you ask me. Rating: 3 stars."
